"The UK is falling behind on its target to cut greenhouse gas emissions and risks a surge in carbon emissions as lockdown eases, the government’s climate advisers warn. Ministers must act fast if the UK is to avoid a massive rebound in carbon emissions after the coronavirus crisis eases, Lord Deben, chair of the committee on climate change (CCC), which published its progress report to parliament on Thursday, said. By setting up new schemes to insulate homes, raise carbon taxes, switch to electric vehicles and improve broadband, the government could spur a green recovery to create jobs and cut emissions permanently. The CCC found that the lack of clear leadership and direction from the prime minister was at the heart of the problem, just as the world was looking to the UK as host of the next UN climate summit. Boris Johnson has chaired only one meeting of the cabinet committee on climate change since taking personal charge of the issue last October, with the government’s statutory advisers urging him to convene the group more often, as a matter of urgency, if the UK is to meet its 2050 net zero carbon target, which is off track. Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC said: “Without central and integrated leadership we will fail in our task, and this really does need the prime minister’s attention to make a success of it. It is a poor excuse that [the cabinet committee] has not met more often.” Deben added: “We have to do this as rapidly as possible – this window of opportunity is closing clearly. What we do not want is a lot of good-hearted statements about beginning policies – what we need to do is seize the opportunity.” Delay in the government’s regulations for housebuilding had already resulted in 1 million new homes that were “not fit for purpose” because they had been built to old inefficient standards, he said. They would all have to be retrofitted for energy efficiency at extra cost. “That’s what happens if you don’t take these measures,” he said. The “central role” of the cabinet committee on climate change, which Johnson said last October would spearhead a cross-government push to bring down emissions, is mentioned 10 times in the CCC’s 196-page progress report to parliament, published on Thursday. The cabinet committee’s one meeting, chaired by Johnson, was in March, the Guardian has established, and a second meeting is planned in the near future. Details are scant as the government has said it does not intend to report publicly on the committee meetings. “[It] will need to meet more regularly and demonstrate it is driving sustained progress,” the CCC report said. Insiders told the Guardian that despite the government’s public commitment to net zero carbon emissions, the lack of leadership was severely hampering the UK’s ability to meet its carbon targets and its credibility as host of next year’s UN Cop26 climate summit. “We are not being given a good lead by the prime minister and this is really undermining our ability to move things on,” said Tom Burke, co-founder of the environment thinktank E3G and a veteran government adviser. “What binds any institution, but especially the government, is leadership, and if you don’t get leadership, then people go off in different directions.” He called for Johnson to take personal control. “The point of setting up a cabinet committee is to signal the importance of the issue for the government. If you don’t follow up that signal by using the device you created, you tell people you are more interested in the headline than in the outcome.” Other recommendations in the CCC report include: A national plan to renovate buildings and construct new housing to the highest standards of energy and water efficiency. Bringing forward the phasing out of petrol and diesel vehicles from 2035 to 2032. Raising carbon taxes, including fuel duty, while oil prices are low, to bring in £15bn a year for spending on green measures. The UK’s greenhouse gas emissions fell by about 3.2% last year, but emissions must fall faster over the next 30 years to meet the target of net zero emissions by 2050. The report sets out 29 milestones for the government to reach by 2030, as well as more than 130 detailed policy recommendations covering each government department. Ministers must respond to the report by 15 October. A government spokesperson said: “We agree with the CCC that tackling climate change should be at the heart of our economic recovery. We were the first major economy to commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and want to ensure the UK has the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth.” Green campaigners called on ministers to act urgently, as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepared a statement on the post-coronavirus economic rescue package for early next month. Rosie Rogers, head of green recovery at Greenpeace UK, said: “The likes of energy, efficiency, cycling and saving peatlands are essential, not nice-to-have measures. The CCC have shown the government where they need to put their money, and all eyes are now on the chancellor to make it happen.”"
"**Storm-ravaged Puerto Rico has promised a full audit of a $300m (Â£227m) deal won by a small electrical firm with Trump administration connections.**
A US House of Representatives committee is also scrutinising the contract.
The chief executive of Whitefish Energy Holdings in Montana knows US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, while one of its investors has donated to Donald Trump.
More than 80% of Puerto Ricans remain without power more than a month after Hurricane Maria struck.
Governor Ricardo Rossello's announcement came late on Tuesday as questions mounted about the deal with Whitefish Energy Holdings, a two-year-old company that has seemingly little experience with work on this scale.
The contract, inked by Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (Prepa) in the immediate aftermath of the storm, will be paid for by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), Puerto Rican authorities have said.
A Fema spokeswoman said their organisation ""had no involvement"" in the deal-making process between Whitefish and Prepa.
""Fema has received the project from Prepa and it is under review to ensure it is in compliance with established procurement guidelines,"" she said.
Congressman Darren Soto, a Florida Democrat of Puerto Rican descent, told the BBC he will be requesting an investigation from the Department of the Interior's Inspector General.
""It is concerning that the task of rebuilding Puerto Rico's energy grid - the biggest infrastructural rebuilt in the United States since Hurricane Katrina - is being contracted solely with Whitefish Energy,"" he said in an email.
The House Natural Resources Committee is scrutinising the agreement.
""The size and unknown details of this contract raises numerous questions,"" committee spokesman Parish Braden told the BBC on Tuesday.
""This is one of many things the committee is taking a close look at as it continues to work with the resident commissioner, governor's office, and oversight board to ensure Puerto Rico's recovery is robust, effective and sustained.""
Puerto Rico, a US territory whose 3.4 million residents are US citizens, was struck by two hurricanes in September - Irma and, later, the more-destructive Maria. The second storm all but wiped out the island's power grid.
In a Facebook post dated 29 September, Whitefish Energy Holdings announced that it had ""received a contract from Puerto Rico Power Authority (Prepa), to rebuild the hurricane ravaged power line infrastructure"".
On 19 October, the company announced that Prepa had formally approved and ratified its agreement.
Whitefish Energy Holdings said it had been working for Prepa since 26 September, six days after the storm made landfall, ""to repair and reconstruct electrical transmission infrastructure on the island"".
Little is known about the utility company.
On its website, the company says it was created in 2015 is and funded by two Texas investment firms and a Brazilian transformer manufacturer.
It states that it is headquartered in Whitefish, Montana, which also happens to be the hometown of Mr Zinke, the US interior secretary.
In an email to BBC News, the US Department of the Interior said: ""Neither the Secretary nor anyone in his office have taken any meetings or action on behalf of this company and played no role in anything to do with any contracts.""
However, Mr Zinke does know Whitefish chief executive Andy Techmanski because ""they both live in a small town (population 6,000) where everyone knows everyone"", said the statement.
While it has provided regular updates on its work in Puerto Rico since its announcement on 29 September, there appears to be no posts on its Facebook page before the date of the contract announcement.
An industry trade group says it ""understands that Whitefish has previously worked on the island and is familiar with Prepa's facilities"".
A search on GovTribe, a site that collects information on government contracts, shows that Whitefish was awarded a $1.3m contract in July for work in Arizona.
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) placed the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in charge of ""the immediate power restoration effort"".
When asked by BBC News about the contract, USACE spokeswoman Catalina Carrasco said on Monday ""the US Army Corps of Engineers does not have any involvement with the contract between the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and Whitefish"". She referred further questions to Prepa.
Multiple emails sent by the BBC to Prepa on Monday and Tuesday were not returned.
In his statement announcing an audit of the deal, Governor Rossello explained how the island's authorities came to work with Whitefish after the passing of the first, less-destructive hurricane. He did not explain how the relationship with Whitefish changed in the run up to nor immediate aftermath of the second, stronger storm.
His office tweeted on Tuesday that ""the [power authority's] investment to repair the electrical system will be refundable by @fema"".
Whether Fema reviewed the deal struck between the two companies before it was signed remains unclear.
Meanwhile, questions have been raised about whether political donations made to President Donald Trump's campaign and allied groups could have influenced the decision.
A review of federal election data showed that a founding partner in HBC Investments, one of the two Texas firms that backs Whitefish Energy Holdings - had donated $2,700 to Mr Trump's presidential campaign, as well as $20,000 to a group that supported the White House bid.
According to election data, the investor also gave $30,700 to the Republican National Committee in 2016 - after Mr Trump became the party's presumptive nominee.
A message sent to the investment firm was not immediately returned.
Members of the US business community frequently donate to political parties, and many tend to favour Republicans.
Also of interest to those scrutinising the deal was the decision by Puerto Rico not to request a programme known as ""mutual aid"".
Co-ordinated by the American Public Power Association (Appa), this scheme arranges for other utilities to offer assistance.
""When (and even before) a major disaster hits a utility's territory and the utility knows that its own crews and equipment won't be enough to restore power quickly, it calls for mutual aid,"" the Appa states in a document on its website.
By way of comparison, the US Virgin Islands - also damaged by the hurricane and geographically close to Puerto Rico - have requested such aid, according to the Appa.
Brandon Smulyan, a representative for Whitefish, told BBC News in an email that the firm had been talking to Prepa before Hurricane Maria struck the island.
""They knew the company's experience in mountainous regions because they discussed the work previously,"" the spokesman said, adding that Whitefish specialised in ""working in rugged, remote and rural terrain"".
Mr Smulyan said that Mr Techmanski and Secretary Zinke had ""no business relationship"", and that Whitefish had not advised Puerto Rican authorities to avoid seeking mutual aid from other utility companies.
About 18% of customers have electricity as of Tuesday, according to the Pentagon.
The Puerto Rican governor's goal is to have 30% restored by 30 October, 50% by 15 November and 95% a month later."

Share this...FacebookTwitterForbes summarizes Germany’s Energiewende:
It’s tragicomic.
To summarize: Energiewende is the worst possible example of how to implement an energy transition. The overzealous push for the wrong generation technology has hurt citizens, businesses, and the environment all at the same time.
I want to make it clear that I’m not saying we should abandon solar. It should definitely be part of our generation mix. Due a mix of bad climate and bad policy, Germany ran into problems at a very low solar penetration, and other countries will be able to reach higher penetrations. But even if we ignore cost, there is still a maximum practical limit to solar power based on the realities of grid management.

You can’t build more PV solar than the rest of the grid can ramp up/down to accept. The necessary grid storage for large-scale solar power is a “maybe someday” technology, not something viable today. Calls for 50% of power to come from solar in our lifetimes are a fantasy, and we need to be realistic about that.
You can’t force utilities to buy unneeded power just because it’s renewable. The energy and materials to build the excess capacity just goes to waste. That is the opposite of green.

We have to learn those lessons. We can’t sweep this failure under the rug.
Every time a renewables advocate holds Germany up as a shining beacon, they set back the credibility of the environmental movement.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe primary drive behind the Green Movement is the attempt to seize the power to control human behavior and to enforce it with a system of severe punishment and reward.
Human behavior can be modified to some extent, as long as the change is gradual, involves some reward and does not entail unreasonable sacrifice. But once you expect too much from the public, there’s a high chance of violent revolt and the movement backfiring.
Nikolaus Blome at Spiegel reports this is precisely what has happened to the German Greens recently in their attempt to reduce meat consumption by forcing the public to swallow a nationwide weekly “Veggie Day”, where every Thursday German public cafeterias would serve up only vegetarian dishes.
Spiegel last year wrote:
Veggie Day’ should link to the tradition of a meatless Friday and promote health, animal and climate protection, Green Party leading candidate Katrin Göring-Eckardt has pushed.”
The public reacted almost instantly and handed the Germans Greens a series of costly election day defeats. Criticism was harsh from all sides. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats blasted the food nannies, calling the agenda “paternalism” and a move towards a federal “republic of bans”. Even the German Communist Links Party warned of a “green upbringing dictatorship”

What was meant to be a noble planet-rescue mission by the Greens, who thought they had tapped into a new trend sweeping across the country, turned into a political flop. Apparently Germans are not ready to part from their beloved national food icons: schnitzel and bratwurst. The German Green Party has since been forced to withdraw their “Veggie Day” from its political agenda.
Spiegel writes the Greens will be formally adopting a new position on nutrition. Spiegel writes:
In the new party program the following sentence will be included in early November: ‘What I eat and what I don’t eat shall be decided by my own taste.'”
In its online poll, over 56% of the more than 15,000 Spiegel readers who voted checked off:“Everyone should be allowed to eat as much meat as he she wishes”, while 21% checked: “Excessive meat consumption is responsible for climate change and the suffering of millions of animals.”
Goes to show: politicians may think they can shove whatever they want down the throats of the public, but in the end, more often than not, it just gets coughed right back up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs New Year’s Day approaches here’s something off-topic, but could make a real difference to your health. It has to mine.
Probably the most common New Year’s resolution one hears is “I’m going to get back in shape“. Unfortunately it is also the one that fails the most often. A year ago, at the age of 54, I was about 20 pounds overweight, on blood pressure medicine, and likely starting on that path to years of medication, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, all later eventually leading to bypasses, stents, and eventually a miserable death – if cancer didn’t get me first. However thanks to a major adjustment in my diet, all that has changed dramatically. Now I’m trim and feel better than ever.
What did I do? I ignored the scientific and medical consensus on “healthy nutrition” and changed over to a high-fat, low-carb diet. The results have been beyond anything I expected. Today I’m off the blood pressure medication and my blood values are all okay. Everyone is happy – that is except the pharmaceutical industry and the greedy doctors.
Here are the four steps you need to take:
1) Get off the killer high carb, low-fat diet
It’s a deadly, junk-science myth that has needlessly killed millions of people. Yes, for decades we’ve been bamboozled and deceived by the food, medical and pharmaceutical industry. As David Diamond shows, when your diet changes over to a high fat, low carb one, your health improves dramatically. Carbohydrates, especially processed sugars, are the real killers. So drastically reduce your intake of sugars, bread, starches, potatoes, processed snacks and eat more fresh meats, animal fats, cheese, butter, vegetables, chicken, fish, nuts, bacon, eggs, and so on.
If you start with anything, it should be first getting yourself off the processed carbs and sugar, which also have profound impacts on people’s behavior. This cannot be overstressed. And by all means, absolutely stay away from the artificial sweeteners.
2) Stop eating so-called “healthy whole-wheat grains”
Contrary to what most people believe, so-called “healthy whole-wheat grains” are toxic and pose a serious hazard to your health. There are three reasons why:
a) The gluten protein damages (for some people very severely) the small intestine and thus leads to mal-absorption of nutrients.
b) Wheat is a powerful carbohydrate with a high glycemic index and wreaks havoc with your blood sugar, which we all know has terrible consequences.
c) Wheat is an opiate and is in fact addictive. It causes people to experience cravings. Studies show that people who are off wheat consume 400 calories per day less than people who consume the grain. That means 146,000 extra calories annually – or two months equivalent! No wonder so many people struggle with their weight. Wheat causes cravings and the food industry has long known and shamelessly exploited this.
3) Vegetable oils cause cancer and cardiovascular disease
If you are consuming salad dressings, margarine, sunflower oil, Crisco, or cooking with these oils, stop doing so now. These are loaded with omega 6 fatty acids which are inflammatory and associated with cancer-causing free radicals. Consume instead foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids, which are non-inflammatory. Before industrialization, the ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids consumed was about 1 to 1. Today in the US the ratio is over a stunning 20 to 1. Elevated omega 6 intake is associated with cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cancer and a host of other diseases.

Proctor & Gamble and the Edible Oil Industry used fraudulent science to demonize animal fats and to promote vegetable oils as a “healthy alternative”, see 19 min. mark.
4) Supplement with vitamins and minerals
Eating “balanced meals” does not ensure that you are getting the 60 essential minerals, 16 vitamins, 12 amino acids and 3 fatty acids. Much of the agricultural soils are depleted of minerals and today’s industrially processed foods are woefully deficient. Therefore supplementing can lead to dramatic health improvements. If you are into extreme sports, then you are highly vulnerable to serious illnesses or injury from chronic mineral deficiencies. I do moderate sport and take Centrum once a day.
Summary
I’ve pretty much stuck to the above rules and have seen a profound difference in every respect over the last 7 months. The pounds and associated health problems literally shed away by themselves. Of course some moderate regular exercise is essential. The toughest part is finding alternatives to the carbs we have become so accustomed to.
I hope you’ll take the time to watch the videos I’ve linked to…it could lead to adding many precious years to your life. If this post changes the health and life of a single reader, then it will have been worth it.
Andrew Revkin’s “stroke of luck”
Remember that a high-carb, low-fat diet was and is still the “consensus science” – all heartily endorsed by the backwards AMA, NAS, AHA, ADA, etc. Today we are finding out they all have been dead wrong, and even perhaps deceptive. Westerners are more obese and seriously ill than ever. And the situation will explode into a major crisis in the years ahead. When are these institutes ever going to wake up?
On May 13, 2013 in a piece titled My Stroke of Luck, science writer Andrew Revkin recounts his experience of having suffered a stroke caused by a diseased carotid artery in near his brain. The root cause of the potentially lethal ailment may be hotly debated, of course, but these things are rarely “genetic” and more often are the result of years of exposure to an improper diet. Such a condition does not develop out of the blue in generally healthy people. I suspect Mr Revkin probably became an unfortunate victim of the farcical high-carb, low-fat diet that the “medical consensus” had promoted for decades. If 99 doctors tell you high-carb/low fat is good and 1 doesn’t, who do you think Mr. Revkin will listen to? We know his answer on this in climate science.
Mr. Revkin will likely deem my speculation concerning the cause of his stroke nonsense. I may be wrong. But then again, if he isn’t on the low-carb/high fat diet by now, he may want to take a real close and honest look at the lipid hypothesis and the phony data underpinning it, and to do so far more seriously than he does with climate data. Here his life depends on it.
It just goes to show that the idea of science by consensus is indeed a very dangerous one, especially when the data are tainted to begin with.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis week’s print edition of the Swiss news weekly Weltwoche has a commentary by economist Silvio Borner titled “Cardiac Arrest with Flickering Power“. His commentary focusses on the completely misleading and false claims often made by tax-payer funded proponents of renewable energies, mainly solar and wind power.

Hat-tip: “Kurt in Switzerland”
According to Borner, the Swiss canton of Basel City has been levying a tax on every kilowatt of power consumed since 1999. The resulting revenue, according to Borner, flows into a “power-savings fund”.
Energy “Grubering”
Borner discovered that some of the generated revenue gets used for spreading green energy propaganda, for example the Fall 2014 publication dubbed: Neue Energie für die Schweiz (New Energy for Switzerland). Borner has found a number of dubious, misleading and even false claims in the publication, which one could easily describe as a classic example of energy policy “Grubering”.
Wind and solar constrained by “physical and economic laws”
First the Swiss publication confuses rated capacity and actual output. Neue Energie claims that 33,000 blocked small-scale green energy power systems could replace “without a problem” 3 nuclear power plants. Borner calls that claim false because even if a means for storing the intermittent wind and solar energy did exist, many times more the number of systems would be needed because they operate only at a small fraction of their rated capacity. Moreover they would produce much more CO2 than the zero-emission nuclear power plants, which run continuously near to full capacity.
This is a well known fact that still even today has yet to sink through the dense skulls of the naive green energy believers.
And because wind and solar energy are so intermittent when it comes to their supply, Borner dubs them “Flatterstrom“, which in English can be translated to: “flickering-power“. Thus they will never be able to serve as the stable base supply a power grid requires. Borner writes:

A complete replacement of the nuclear power plants by wind and solar cannot be achieved “without a problem’ due to physical and economic laws.”

Green energies “destroy x-times more jobs than they create”
The Neue Energie propaganda publication also claims green energies are a jobs engine for Switzerland. But Borner writes that this not by any means the truth.
The higher costs for power thus destroy x-times more jobs subject to international competition than they artificially create, and do so only temporarily.”
Green energies increase dependency on foreign power
Borner also calls the assertion of energy independence thanks to wind and solar, and their “low prices”, a myth:
The more flickering power we feed into the grid (independent of demand and thus value), the more unstable the domestic supply becomes and thus the greater the dependency on foreign countries becomes.”
At the end, using an excellent analogy, Borner demolishes the claim made by the Swiss green energy propaganda publication where “20 to 30 square meters of rooftop supplies the energy demand of an average household, without CO2 emissions“. Borner writes:
Fact: The crux of the argument is the misleading magnitude ‘annual consumption’. What does our household do over the long and dark winter months? What use does the average number of annual heartbeats have if your heart stops for a few hours every night? The electric power circuit is like blood circulation. Both need a permananet flow. Anyne who puts faith in the annual value for supplying his own power, should please get off the grid and not expect others to bear the extra costs.”
Indeed. What good would be the average heart, which beats on average some 38 million times per year, if it stopped every year for even just an hour?

"This month marks the re-opening of the controversial trophy hunt for at-risk grizzly bears in the province of British Columbia, Canada.  Scrutiny of this hunt was ramped up last year with new evidence that its economic benefits are small when compared with ecotourism. Add to this further research that suggests hunting management strategies impose considerable risks to bear populations and it’s not surprising that concerns are being raised. There is strong opposition from many indigenous groups, which have renewed calls for the government to respect tribal laws that ban the hunt on their traditional territories. They are not alone – recent poll data suggests that 80-90% of citizens in the province, including hunters who target other species, oppose the trophy hunt.   Nevertheless, despite this opposition the hunt was not only re-opened but expanded on April 1st – what might have passed for an April Fools’ joke was instead presented as “science-based” management. But our recent study casts doubt on this “science-based” management. We found that between 2001-2011, human kills of grizzly bears (of which four out of every five were from trophy hunting) exceeded government limits in half of all hunted populations. We also found that hunt targets were not conservative because they did not properly take into account uncertainty in bear numbers, population growth rates, or poaching rates. This uncertainty is not surprising: counting bears accurately in their remote wilderness habitats is difficult, let alone studying how quickly they reproduce and replace lost individuals. To address this we described a management approach that explicitly takes uncertainty into account. To keep the probability of over-kill below 5%, targets would need to be reduced by 80%, and one third of hunted bear populations would need to be closed to hunting. Surprisingly, shortly after this study was released, the government instead announced plans to increase the number of bears to be hunted, and to re-open the hunt in two populations that had previously been closed because of over-kills. Managers stated that “because we recognise inherent uncertainty in our population and harvest rate estimates, conservative mortality targets are used”. While the government used language reminiscent of the recent study, they decided to expand the hunt,  contrary to its conclusions. The minister in British Columbia responsible for managing the hunt came under fire repeatedly in the provincial legislature for this, and also for claiming in a press release that sustainability of the hunt was confirmed by another study, which was not the case. This raises the question – are “science-based” management decisions actually guided by science?    Scientific research and enquiry is held up for external scrutiny through the peer review process. This ensures key scientific values: transparency, rationality, and reliance on rigorous evidence.  Scientists have no choice about this; if they want to publish their work in a credible journal, it needs to be peer-reviewed. Work that does not stand up to scrutiny gets rejected.  But there is no such requirement for most wildlife management decisions, even those claiming to be “science-based”. Although scientists might spend years gathering and analysing data, packaging it into a manuscript, and revising their work in light of reviews by independent experts, politicians can make “science-based” claims without any such checks. Not surprisingly this can and does lead to decisions guided more by politics than by science. The infamous collapse of the cod fishery in eastern Canada in the 1980s comes to mind.  And more recently, the science behind efforts to remove gray wolves from the US Endangered Species Act, and in the decision to cull badgers in the UK, has also been questioned.  A recent letter in the journal Science has pointed this shortcoming in “science-based” wildlife management, and following the letters’ release, more stories of questionable science emerged. It seems examples of scientific shortcomings might be the rule, not the exception.  Fortunately, the well-established scientific publishing process can provide ways to improve management decisions: subjecting management decisions to the same outside scrutiny expected of scientists would be an important first step. As well as making science management more rigorous and transparent, external peer review would have the added bonus of helping to bridge the long bemoaned science-policy gap."

 **Burn, Hollywood, Burn**  
A regular review by John Black



A little thought experiment if you will. Imagine a movie based on the following premise:



A group of single dads, working as bartenders at a high class New York bar frequented by wealthy women, decide that their generous tips aren’t quite keeping them in Rolexes and Tom Ford suits. They start putting roofies into the drinks of their rich lonely clientele and when the ladies are out of it, abscond with their credit cards and charge up a storm, relying on social embarrassment to keep the women quiet. 



**Do you think these lads would be hailed by critics as heroes or condemned as villains?**



I’m sure it took you the duration of a humming bird’s fart to decide on the latter. Then why is the opposite scenario in the movie _Hustlers_ , with strippers scamming men, being called ‘Pulse racing empowerment’ or (by our own Flicks.co.nz) a ‘Perfect movie’? 



I disrespectfully dissent from this critical consensus: _Hustlers_ is nothing but immoral garbage being pimped by woke wankerdom for a nefarious political agenda.



Constance Wu is young ‘exotic dancer’ Destiny who follows ‘the green-brick road’ to New York, where she learns the ropes from seasoned Ramona (Lopez) on how to exploit men for cash. Everything is Champagne and Louis Vuitton until the 2008 financial crisis hits and the expense account boys rein it in. Ramona and her ‘sisters’ come up with a scheme to up their take home by seeking out solo men in bars, slipping them a mickey and hauling them back to the club for fleecing. The ladies bond over their criminal enterprise, shitty boyfriends, motherhood, and a love of mammoth shopping sprees on other people’s coin. When they inevitably get sprung (in a _Goodfellas_ inspired montage of arrests set to Kiwi Lorde’s ‘Royals’) there is betrayal, of the save-your-ass-by-talking-to-the-feds variety before it all ends in hugs and kisses and five years’ probation. 



Lopez is already getting Oscar ‘buzz’. She’s a decent enough actress (any doubts, watch her in _Out of Sight_ ), but praising an ex-dancer (she was a ‘fly girl’ on _In Living Colour_ ) from the Bronx for playing a stripper from the Bronx is a little like praising Tom Cruise for pulling off a role as a vain Scientologist. 



The plot follows the beats of the heist flick and there is some entertainment to be had from the ladies’ chutzpah in separating men from their hard-earned (or as the film has it, from their ‘stolen money’ although I’m not as sure as the movie is that every Wall Street guy is Bernie Madoff). 



_Hustlers_ is really a platonic love story between two women, Destiny and Ramona. As such it succeeds. But what chafes the ball sack of this male reviewer is why a sweet tale of sisterly support has to be told at the expense of men. _Every single_ male character in this film is either a complete A-hole or pathetic or both. Not one decent father, husband or boyfriend – even the children of both Destiny and Ramona are girls, perhaps to avoid scenes of them being affectionate to a male. Destiny calls one victim of their scam ‘a nice guy’ but only after robbing him so badly he cries like a little girl who’s lost her dolly. I’m sure saints are thin on the ground in strip clubs but as someone who has darkened the door of a few such establishments, we ain’t all irredeemable sinners either. 



Worse, **ripping off men is shown as a positive good.** This is where the ‘empowerment’ bit comes in. These women you see, are victims. The patriarchy is responsible for their bad choices, lack of education and inability to get a job at McDonalds. Ergo, the bastards must pay and any bastard will do. This isn’t just insulting to men; it’s a slur against all those single mums in strained circumstances who struggle on without using men as walking ATMs.



If there is any doubt as to the message of this movie it comes at the Christmas party when Destiny’s grandmother, who one would think would hold more conservative views, is asked if she’d have left her husband on her wedding night if the singer Frankie Valli had turned up at her door. Her reply? ‘What car is he driving?’ That’s right folks, a man’s worth is entirely economic. 



Nice.



The almost uniform praise from critics of both sexes that _Hustlers_ has received seems to me further evidence that gender politics is driving the world insane.



I guess it’s no huge revelation that young women (who now on average earn _more than men_ ) in the current political climate are not only to be automatically ‘believed’ but are beyond moral critique altogether.



A much bigger (ahem) revelation is that the only ‘mature’ dancer here, 50 year old J.Lo, still has an arse you could crack an egg on. 



Take that, you woke wankers.

"Adélie penguin populations could boom in coming years, according to research revealing the small birds find it easier to forage when sea ice is sparse around continental Antarctica. While, overall, sea ice extent has increased in the Antarctic over recent decades, in the past few years it has fallen dramatically – a matter of deep concern in the scientific community.  However, Adélie penguins – the birds whose sexual antics so shocked early explorers – have more breeding success on the continent when levels of sea ice are low. Now scientists say they have worked out why: the birds can forage more efficiently. The upshot is a higher growth rate for their chicks, and more fledglings per nest. Dr Yuuki Watanabe, first author of the study from the National Institute of Polar Research in Tokyo, said the study showed not all animals would necessarily suffer from the climate crisis which, he said, models suggest could reduce sea ice in the Antarctic. “Our study shows that the completely opposite results can happen, and highlights the complexity of climate change effects on wildlife,” he said. The study, published in the journal Science Advances, reveals how Watanabe and colleagues electronically tagged 175 Adélie penguins in Lützow-Holm Bay, in continental east Antarctica, and followed them for four breeding seasons from 2010. While three seasons featured extensive sea ice in the foraging area, in late December 2016 to early February 2017 a large section of sea ice broke up, leaving an extensive area of open water. Using GPS and accelerometer data from a subset of the penguins, the team discovered that when the foraging area was covered in ice the penguins had crossed the frozen expanse on their feet or their bellies, looking for a gap to dive through to find food – facing stiff competition in the process. When the area was ice-free, however, the penguins could enter the water on the doorstep of their nests. With the birds moving four times faster when swimming than walking, the result was foraging trips that took 3.2 to 7.9 hours less time on average but covered up to 4.8km further, used less energy and likely involved less competition, while dives were also shorter. “In ice-free seasons, [the penguins] travelled fast by swimming and dived anywhere they wanted. They came back to the nest quickly, which means that chicks waiting at the nest had food more often,” said Watanabe, noting the improved foraging conditions improved breeding success. Moreover, the ice-free conditions led to blooms of phytoplankton, increasing the density of certain small crustaceans on which the penguins prey. However, the overall number of nests and chicks were smaller during the ice-free season, suggesting winter conditions also matter, while not all Adélies enjoy a loss of sea ice. Adélies living on the Antarctic peninsula and islands in the Antarctic, where sea ice is already sparse, are known to fare worse in such conditions, something Watanabe said was likely down to factors including a loss of resting places while foraging and less protection from predators. Watanabe warned the study did not mean the impact of the climate crisis in the Antarctic was less of a concern. “Responses to climate warming will differ depending on species and regions,” he said, for example predatory seabirds called skua found it harder to catch big and healthy penguin chicks.  Dr Tom Hart, a penguin expert from the University of Oxford, said the scale of the tagging was impressive, but stressed the study only looked at one site where sea ice was not frequently scarce. But he said the research helped explain why Adéile penguins seemed to be increasing in areas with high sea ice yet declining where sea ice was already low. “It seems to be the Goldilocks hypothesis,” he said. “It fits the idea that intermediate sea ice is the sweet spot for these penguins as there is both lots of food and easy access to it.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA number of media outlets are reporting on how a Russian Tupolev jet “froze” at Igarka Airport in Siberia, some 3000 kilometers east of Moscow, 160 kilometers above the Arctic circle.

The Russian RT News Agency here reports that the plane “froze to the ground“. Yet another report says that it was actually the plane’s brake system that froze in the horrible -60°F Siberian cold, and not the tires to the surface.
German Bild daily writes:
“At the village of Igarka, about 3000 kilometers east of Moscow, 74 passengers were waiting for the departure of their Tupolew Tu-134 to Krasnojarsk. But the plane did not take off – down to minus 52°C nothing worked: The brake system was frozen!”
But RT writes that “the ice-covered ground was the reason the plane couldn’t be moved”
Technically and physically, I find it implausible that a plane would freeze to the ground, meaning it would have to have been first wet under the tires. Highly unlikely at such dreadful temperatures, even with the increased pressure from the weight of the plane. And wouldn’t such a problem occur routinely if that were the case?

The other question is what could happen to brake fluid or brake equipment at temperatures under -50°C? One could imagine things tending to gum up a bit.
Bild daily adds more details:
“Vladimir Artemenko, Technical Director of the airline, however denies that the jet’s braking system was frozen. “The aircraft was technically without faults’ he said. The local presecutor is now investigating for possible violations of maintenance regulations.”
Whatever caused the frozen jet, global warming doesn’t seem to have come to Igarka at all. What follows is a chart depicting mean November temperatures. As we see, the normal low for this date is around -26°C:


The daily average low (blue) and high (red) temperature with percentile bands (inner band from 25th to 75th percentile, outer band from 10th to 90th percentile). Source: weatherspark.com/averages/33842/11/Igarka-Krasnoyarsk-Krai-Russian-Federation
That makes a temperature of -52°C a heck of a lot colder than normal, not the sort of thing you’d expect from warming. In fact, looking at the chart, the chances of the temperature reaching -52°C up there in November are pretty slim.

Don’t get us wrong: If low‐​polluting renewable energy sources could displace fossil fuels without massive taxpayer subsidies that would harm the economy, you’d find us at the front of the parade. But President Obama’s undying devotion to clean energy — memorably invoked in his inaugural address — should trouble anyone who does not believe in showering public money on industries with no hope of a back‐​end payoff for the taxpayer or consumer.



On the steps of the Capitol, Obama again spoke of clean energy as the energy of the future, intoning: “We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries.” He also repeated the argument that clean energy is a necessary prerequisite for saving the world from catastrophic global warming. Let’s look at both points.



If clean energy is the energy of future, then it’s news to the analysts within the Obama administration. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) — the analytic arm of the U.S. Department of Energy — predicts that renewable energy (excluding liquid biofuels like ethanol which are, at present, as carbon‐​intensive as crude oil) will rise from 8 percent of total U.S. energy consumption today to a grand total of 11 percent in 2040. Moreover, that modest gain in market share is not expected to come from improvements in clean energy’s ability to compete with fossil fuels. No, the EIA believes that this anemic growth stems “mainly from the implementation of … state renewable portfolio standard (RPS) programs for electricity generation” (that is, state programs that simply dictate that a certain amount of renewables are produced regardless of cost).



If this is the main pillar of the president’s plan to create jobs, then we’re in big trouble. First of all, there’s no evidence to suggest that “clean” energy is more labor intensive than “brown” energy. After all, once the wind farms or solar facilities are built, it doesn’t take a lot of employees to fuel them or run them unless they happen to break down. If plant construction is the main source of job creation, then we could accomplish the same end by building museums, highways, oil refineries, or a few dozen Egyptian‐​style pyramids for that matter.



To be fair, forecasting future energy market shares is a problematic and — if past is prologue — nearly pointless exercise. Much hinges on technological innovations and breakthroughs that have yet to occur (and may never occur). Even on the eve of a revolution in hydraulic fracturing, few forecasters saw anything but sky‐​high natural gas prices as far as the eye could see. Still, the EIA’s forecasts represent our most educated guesses about where the future will take us — and alas, even those who draw paychecks from the Obama administration believe that clean energy will remain a bit player in energy markets despite the myriad tax credits, loan guarantees, and government production mandates to change that reality.



It’s difficult to believe that this modest gain in market share is going to do much to reduce the impact of climate change. Happily, hydraulic fracturing is doing that environmental job for us. As Mitt Romney and his cohorts on the right were fond of telling us during the recent presidential campaign, 135 coal‐​fired power plants have already closed during the Obama administration and another 175 are scheduled to close by 2016. But what Romney & co. didn’t tell us is that low‐​cost natural gas — courtesy of hydraulic fracturing — was the main reason for those plant closures. Jesse Ausubel, director of the Program for the Human Environment at Rockefeller University, argues persuasively that this will continue as carbon‐​rich fuels continue to give way — as they have historically — to hydrogen‐​rich fuels. Yesterday, it was coal displacing biomass, then oil displacing coal. Today, it’s natural gas displacing oil and coal. Tomorrow, it will likely be hydrogen displacing natural gas.



Would a more aggressive set of government policies succeed on the clean energy front? One never knows, but it’s worth noting that the two instances in which the federal government has made Herculean efforts to turn ugly energy ducks into beautiful economic swans — nuclear energy and corn ethanol — have failed spectacularly despite decades of concentrated political effort and tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer assistance. Nuclear energy and corn ethanol continue to be so uncompetitive that, absent continuing government subsidy, those industries would largely disappear. There’s no reason to think that throwing the same effort into clean energy will turn out any differently.



Environmentalists remain wedded to clean energy subsidies because they fear that, even if we are correct, no better policy avenue exists to address climate change. This approach is likely to yield next to nothing, although it does provide the illusion that climate risks are being addressed. But they aren’t. Far better, we think, for environmental voters to have no such illusions about what the president is delivering.

"Change at the British coastline is a reality we have always lived with. A thousand years ago, King Canute showed his courtiers how absurd it was to seek to command the waves. Later, others built sea walls and estuary defences.  Stretches of sandstone cliffs provided natural protection, as did shingle heaped by the sea. Revetments were added, sea walls raised, lately boulders and rocks too, yet still churches, houses and some whole settlements have fallen into the sea. Now the National Trust reminds us, the twin pressures of rising sea levels and extreme weather mean we need urgently to adapt to the impact this will have on our coastlines and its people and wildlife. Britain’s coastline is an important part of the country’s character and needs to be managed well. My experience of spending a year walking 400 miles and boating another 100 along the coasts of Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk highlighted to me how strongly the coastline defines the character and identity of this whole region.  From the landscape of beach, sea wall and marshland, to the ecology, economy and cultures of fishing, farming, sailing and bird watching. Coastlines are host to created communities, deserted resorts, eroding cliffs, villages under water, caravan parks and new, entirely invented places. On the marshes, curlews call and peregrines swoop. But to these coasts that have always ebbed and flowed comes a new risk: our voracious consumption of resources is boosting the power of nature. Some see it coming, many are in denial. As the National Trust are warning, it is time to adapt to this growing reality. Warm water takes up more volume than cold, and climate change will raise sea levels this century. In the pre-industrial era, CO2 concentrations were 280ppm in the atmosphere; now they have just passed 400ppm. At the current annual rate of 2ppm per year, three decades from now will see global atmospheric concentration exceed 450ppm, causing seas to rise by 0.5 to 1.7 metres.  This may only be the start. To restrict concentrations to 450ppm, a 50-85% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is required by 2050. Emissions did fall in 2009, but that was because of the credit crunch and following recession. If hopes for returns to year-on-year economic growth are met, then emissions will rise again.  There is thus little current prospect of atmospheric concentrations stabilising, and some now talk of a warming of as much as four degrees Celsius as possible this century. Major changes in our behaviour and rapid increases in our use of non-polluting technologies are going to be needed. Rising temperatures will raise sea levels, affecting millions worldwide, particularly low lying areas with long coastlines. Domestically, climate change has brought alternating drought and floods, and the policy focus has turned inland. The drenching rains of this winter poured off hills, saturated fields, burst banks, filled reservoirs, covered fields and flooded villages. Protection from flooding is clearly needed, as is better land management of whole catchments.  But we should not forget the coasts. Money is short and has been diverted to rivers. Let the coast go, say some; leave the sea walls unrepaired. For an island nation, this would be a mistake. Since the 1953 floods that still scar the memories of many, the sea defences along the whole of the coast have been raised, strengthened with concrete, and raised again. What we now know is that both hard and soft defences are needed, and different choices need to be made for each habitat on the coast.  A managed retreat has begun in some locations. The first deliberate breach of defences was in Essex to create new salt-marshes, first at Tollesbury in 1995, then Abbots Hall Farm and now at Wallasea Island. This is sensible, as marshes can act as “soft defences”, absorbing the power of storm surges and preventing flooding inland. But managing a retreat before the sea does not work everywhere. Many homeowners in low-lying areas at risk of flooding feel that government and local agencies have not invested sufficiently in ensuring existing sea and estuary defences remain strong.  True, there are some areas – cliffs especially – whose susceptibility to the elements is hard to counter, as the many settlements that have been lost over the centuries shows us. Yet every house lost, every patch of land, is a place locked up with memory and identity. They matter to local people. We may have to let more land go. Perhaps a beach will lose its sands. There will be difficult choices, but to do nothing will be the worst outcome for all. In the face of climate change, rising sea levels and extremes of weather, we must manage this assault on our coastlines with a mixture of defence, adaptation and retreat."

Voters in the 2019 local elections have elected the largest number of new mayors in 30 years! Twenty-six of the new mayors are young and will be wearing the mayoral chains for the first time 



Putting young people in charge is a trend reflected also in the record numbers of women and younger candidates joining local bodies across the country.



“The number of new mayors really challenges the narrative that incumbents can pretty much walk back into office,” says LGNZ Principal Policy Advisor Dr Mike Reid.



A preliminary count reveals the number of elected members under 40 years of age has increased by at least a third.



In particular, **the cohort under 30 has doubled.** At **18 years of age, the youngest is School Strike 4 Climate Organiser and now K?piti Coast District Councillor, Sophie Handford,** while Rotorua Lakes and Nelson City voters have each elected a **19-year-old** representative on their councils – Fisher Wang and Rohan O’Neill-Stevens.



Early analysis has also revealed an increase in under 40s on rural and regional councils, reflecting increased youth concern around environmental issues and climate change.



“Young people are thinking globally and acting locally, and recognise that standing for and getting involved with council is one of the best ways to make positive change in their communities.”



We have our youth adjacent Prime Minister and now it looks like we will have some young and inexperienced but “passionate” people on councils making decisions about things like the so-called Climate Emergency. What could possibly go wrong?

"The poster advertising the evening of debate and organic canapés in Halle’s university district looked familiar to environmentally conscious Germans: a rugged pair of hands, cupping fertile brown soil, underneath the slogan “Farms instead of agricultural factories”, written in a font mimicking that of a popular biodynamic food brand. The only hint the event wasn’t organised by sandal-wearing good-lifers but a local group of far-right nationalists was in the subtitle: “Let’s chase the globalists off our acres!”  Farmers associations and environmental groups in Germany are increasingly warning of a new strategy pursued with increasing transparency by the country’s new right: to use the enduring popularity of organic lifestyles and a burgeoning green movement as a step into the mainstream. One harbinger of this is a new quarterly glossy magazine Die Kehre (The Turning), published this month, which describes itself as a “magazine for natural protection”. It draws its title from the writings of anti-modernist philosopher Martin Heidegger and tries to reclaim environmental concern as a reactionary cause. In its editorial, the magazine describes ecology as the “crown jewels” of the right “robbed” by the leftwing green movement in the 1970s, and argues for redefining the subject away from Klimaschutz (climate protection) towards Heimatschutz (homeland protection). Several articles warn of the danger to Germany’s “native” bird species and “fairytale forests” posed by windfarms. Another column cites a manifesto by far-right thinktank Recherche Dresden, “Seven theses for a conservative-ecological turn”, written in the wake of the German Green party’s triumph at the 2019 European elections: “The world’s population has to be stabilised at a lower level – otherwise we face irreversible ecological collapse.” If the magazine’s political messages are at times deliberately covert, the leanings of its supporters are less so: one of its most prominent champions on social media is Björn Höcke, the Thuringian leader of far-right party Alternative für Deutschland’s aggressively nationalist wing – a German court last year ruled he could legally be called a fascist. The magazine is edited by a member of the Identitarian movement, a group of nationalist activists that Germany’s domestic intelligence agency last year declared an extremist entity, and which also hosted the information evening about permaculture and sustainable farming in Halle at the start of last year. That event was not an isolated instance: a survey carried out among German natural protection NGOs found this month that 42% of respondents had in their work come across people with rightwing extremist views. “We discovered a significant number of environmental groups who had contact with far-right ideologues,” said Daniela Gottschlich, one of the political scientists who conducted the survey for the Diversu thinktank. “We discovered many felt unable to cope with the challenge and ask for support.” As such, attempts to use green issues to smuggle far-right ideas into respectable society are not new, said Yannick Passeick, a spokesperson for Farn, a government-sponsored body against radicalisation among environmentalist groups. Coming from older rightwing extremist parties like the neo-Nazi NPD, Passeick said, “It is a method we have known for decades.” What had changed since the AfD entered the German parliament in 2017, he added, “is the way these attempts are becoming more aggressive and openly visible”. Visibility was also the motive in the northern municipality of Oldenswort on 11 June, when farmers arranged 324 tractors on a field to form the outline of a red sword cutting a white plough – the symbol of the Landvolkbewegung, a farmers’ protest movement active in the state of Schleswig-Holstein from 1928 to 1933. Most famously portrayed in Hans Fallada’s novel A Small Circus, the “rural people’s movement” set out to draw attention to their financial difficulties and the ineffectiveness of their lobby groups, but ended up planting bombs at public buildings, including the Reichstag. Though Hitler later banned members of the Nazi party from joining in Landvolkbewegung’s protests, historians argue the movement’s nationalistic and anti-parliamentary agenda aided the rise of National Socialism. The revival of the movement’s symbol has been criticised by local politicians. Farmer Jann-Henning Dircks, who organised this month’s protest, told the Observer he learned about the historical group from the nephews of one of its founders. The sword in the symbol, he said, was “the knife used by the politicians and know-it-alls in our country to destroy our homeland”. Farmers were frustrated with the growing bureaucracy posed by new regulations on the use of fertilisers and the protection of insects, he said, adding that legal inconsistencies across the EU meant German farmers were struggling to compete against counterparts in eastern Europe. Asked why he had chosen to reclaim such an inflammatory symbol, he said: “You have to cause a scandal before you get a hearing. Obviously we distance ourselves from National Socialism, but we can’t deny our history”. Dircks said his movement would resist being patronised by any party, and claimed there had been no overt attempts to seek contact from far-right groups. “I don’t even know anyone in the AfD, but since not everyone wears their party membership on their sleeve, I can’t completely rule it out either.”"
"**President Donald Trump has been criticised for hailing the US response to the deadly Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year as ""tremendous"".**
The mayor of its capital tweeted: ""If he thinks the death of 3,000 people is a success God help us all.""
Puerto Rico only finished restoring full power last month, 11 months after the hurricane hit.
A recent report says 8% left the island after the hurricane and many died due to poor health care and other services.
The island's Governor Ricardo Rossello issued a statement on Tuesday night, describing Maria as ""the worst natural disaster in our modern history. Our basic infrastructure was devastated, thousands of our people lost their lives and many others still struggle"".
Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US, is home to some 3.3 million people.
He was asked at the White House what lessons could be learned from Hurricane Maria as Hurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas.
Maria, he said, was the ""hardest one we had by far because of the island nature"", adding: ""I actually think it was one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about.
""The job that Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] and law enforcement and everybody did working along with the governor in Puerto Rico, I think was tremendous. I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success.""
Mr Trump had said recently: ""We have put billions and billions of dollars into Puerto Rico and it was a very tough one. I think most of the people in Puerto Rico really appreciate what we've done.""
Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a statement: ""No relationship between a colony and the federal government can ever be called 'successful' because Puerto Ricans lack certain inalienable rights enjoyed by our fellow Americans in the states.""
The mayor of the Puerto Rican capital San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, a vocal critic of Mr Trump who earlier described his response to Maria as a ""stain on his presidency"", said his latest comment ""added ""insult to injury"".
Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted: ""Nearly 3,000 people died. That is not a 'success'. That is a tragedy and a disgrace.""
Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said: ""This is an offensive, hurtful and blatantly false comment from the president.""
New York Democratic primary winner Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said: ""Some of my [Puerto Rico] family just got power a few weeks ago. People are developing respiratory issues partly due to airborne fungal spores from lack of proper cleanup. The admin's response to Puerto Rico has been a disaster.""
Some Trump supporters on social media accepted there had been failures but said the president had done all he could and that it was Puerto Rican officials who were to blame.
Maria made landfall in mid-September last year having just been downgraded to a category four hurricane, with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and driving rain.
It caused catastrophic damage to the north-eastern Caribbean and was the most intense cyclone worldwide in 2017.
Infrastructure was severely damaged in Puerto Rico and the territory struggled to make repairs to the power grid, only completing the work 11 months later.
Maria was estimated to have caused $100bn (Â£77bn) in damage.
For long the government there listed the death toll at only 64, although it acknowledged it was probably much higher.
The island's authorities finally accepted a revised toll of 2,975 after a government-commissioned report by experts from George Washington University.
This counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis.
The report said that those from poorer backgrounds in Puerto Rico were 45% more likely to have been killed in the aftermath of the hurricane."

The tiny clique of upper-middle-class almond-fussers playing dress-ups might steam the knickers of a few taxpayer-funded journalists, but their idiot pantomime antics just annoy the crap out of people who actually work for a living.



What’s more, they’re putting lives at risk. When some emaciated beta “male feminist” or blue-haired landwhale with a gender studies degree superglues xirself to the road and gridlocks a city, emergency services are blocked as well. The Queensland government is just one that’s taking action against these annoying twats.



The Queensland government is planning to fast-track proposed laws to jail protesters in the wake of disruptive climate demonstrations this week.



Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has condemned the Extinction Rebellion protests, saying activists were putting themselves and others at risk while soaking up valuable police and emergency services resources.



Last night Ms Palaszczuk said she was determined to pass legislation that would see protesters jailed for up to two years if they use “dangerous devices” such as drums with concrete and locks…“I say to protesters […] ‘what if it was your mother or grandmother that was held up from getting to hospital because of your actions, blocking streets?’,” Ms Palaszczuk told The Courier-Mail.



Or worse, stopping **them** getting their Maccas fix?



Naturally, useless taxpayer-funded ambulance-chasers are screeching up a storm in their biodegradable teacups.



The Human Rights Law Centre says the government has a legitimate interest in ensuring peaceful protests but that this law goes too far […]”We are seeing a clear and worrying wave of laws from governments across Australia that restrict people’s ability to stand together and speak out on issues they care deeply about.”



No, we’re seeing a wave of self-righteous, uninformed parasites restricting ordinary people’s ability to go about their business, and wasting everyone’s time.



And all because of the imaginary sky dragon that’s got these shrieking ninnies running around like headless chooks.

"People would be prepared to continue many of the lifestyle changes enforced by the coronavirus lockdown to help tackle the climate emergency, and the government would have broad support for a green economic recovery from the crisis, according to a report. Working from home is a popular option, along with changes to how people travel, and the government should take the opportunity to rethink investment in infrastructure and support low-carbon industries, the report found. The findings come from Climate Assembly UK, a group of 108 members of the public chosen to be representative of the UK population and to help shape future climate policy by discussing options to reach net zero carbon emissions, in line with the government’s 2050 target. Nearly eight in ten of the members said the measures taken by the government to help the economic recovery from Covid-19 should be designed to help reach net zero, and an even bigger proportion – 93% – said that, as the lockdown eased, the government and employers should encourage lifestyle changes to cut emissions. “It was quite clear that many of the assembly members felt this period should be taken as an opportunity to encourage a green economic recovery with a focus on promoting cleaner, greener lifestyles, and an economy that prizes sustainability over short-term benefits that would harm the planet,” said Ibrahim, an assembly member who is a GP from Surrey. “It feels that climate change is as big a crisis as Covid,” said one respondent. “[We] don’t want the government to put climate change on the back burner because of Covid.” Another unnamed member said: “It would be too easy to just carry on as before and take advantage of cheap oil and other special offers, [such as] cheap travel, cheap clothes, factories turning out cheap goods, to get the economy going. We need incentives to reduce emissions … and penalties for people who do not consider the environment when building or rebuilding businesses.” The chairs of the six select committees of MPs who commissioned the Climate Assembly wrote to the prime minister on Monday to say the experience of the coronavirus crisis was likely to make people more receptive to green messages from government. “In recent months, the UK public has demonstrated its capacity to respond positively and responsibly when they understand the risks posed to them by an invisible threat that demands collective action. We believe that a similar approach, based on securing public support for ambitious policies through open dialogue around the science, is a sound basis for the net zero journey,” they told Boris Johnson in a letter. A citizens’ assembly is a group of people brought together to discuss an issue or issues, and reach a conclusion about what they think should happen, according to the definition put forward by the House of Commons library. Citizens’ assemblies give members of the public the time and opportunity to learn about and discuss a topic, before reaching conclusions. Assembly members are asked to make trade-offs and arrive at workable recommendations. Facilitated by experts and combining small-group discussions with large-scale debates and a series of votes, members meet over a series of weekends with the goal of removing the conflicts of interest and tribal loyalties that can hamper politicians in reaching a conclusion. The people who take part are chosen randomly so they reflect the wider population in terms of demographics – age, gender, ethnicity and social class. The number of members involved can vary. A recent citizens’ assembly, formed to examine social care provision in England, had 47 members who were English citizens and eligible to vote in UK general elections. Citizens’ assemblies, and other similar methods, have been used in the UK and other countries, including Australia, Canada and the US, to address a range of complex issues. One of the most prominent to take place in recent years was the assembly established by the Irish parliament to address abortion after a decision had been made to have a referendum on the issue. Jamie Grierson, Home affairs correspondent Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy at University College London, who spoke to the assembly as an expert, said he was struck by what a “very very strong result” the questions produced. “People are prepared to change,” he said. “[But] they don’t see lifestyle changes in isolation from policy change and what businesses are doing. There is very strong support for the government shaping and directing the economy [towards net zero emissions].” Their opinions carry no legal weight or official recognition, but the organisers said the assembly members’ views were significant because “there is no other group that is at once a representative sample of the UK population, and well-acquainted with the sorts of measures required to reach net zero”. The assembly met for three weekends in Birmingham early this year, before lockdown, and since then attended three online meetings in April and May. Citizens’ assemblies have been used in other countries to help guide government decisions on tricky or controversial policy issues, most notably on the 2018 referendum on abortion in Ireland.  Their full findings will be released in September, but an interim report on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis is being published on Tuesday because the government is engaged in working out its economic response to the pandemic. The interim findings will also figure in a report by the committee on climate change this Thursday, which does carry statutory weight, as the government must make a formal response. Campaigners called on ministers to take note, and plan for a green recovery that would be “mind-blowingly popular”. Muna Suleiman, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s time to push the reset button on our carbon-guzzling and dysfunctional economic system, and prioritise the health and wellbeing of our planet and its people.” “Now the government has been given an overwhelming mandate for action from the informed public,” said Rosie Rogers of Greenpeace. “[If ministers fail to act] it will be glaringly obvious who they’ve been listening to behind the scenes.”"
"Despite scientists’ intensive efforts over many decades, bovine tuberculosis continues to be a problem in many parts of the world, not least in England, where it leads to the slaughter of thousands of cattle every year – 38,000 in 2012. The tiny Mycobacterium bovis bacterium that causes bovine TB has a huge impact on the health of livestock, and farm profitability. It’s become clear over the past few years that some of the variation in bovine TB is underpinned by the genetic makeup of the cattle. A number of quantitative genetic studies have estimated that the heritability (the proportion of the variation accounted for by genetics) is significant in the major dairy breed, the Holstein-Friesian. These studies indicate that it would be possible to breed cattle that are naturally more resistant to bovine TB. Our research paper recently published in Heredity offers new results which indicate that it should be possible to use genetic markers (known as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, or SNPs) to breed cattle that are more TB-resistant. Holstein-Friesian cattle were carefully chosen from herds with high prevalence to ensure that cases and controls were exposed to infection to the same level. Computerised genetic scanners, known as SNP chips, were used to identify differences in the genomes of more than 1,000 cattle that, given equal exposure to infection, had either contracted bovine TB or had not. By identifying more than 600,000 points across the cows’ genomes and combining all the differences detected, it was found around 21% of this breed’s liability to become infected could be accounted for by genetics. This means it’s possible to tentatively identify the elements of the genome associated with TB resistance. It is important to emphasise that our study compared TB infected cows, as determined by the standard test used by farmers and with laboratory confirmation, with cows that were highly likely to have been exposed to disease, but reacted negatively to repeated skin tests. We carefully chose these animals from herds that had high incidences of bovine TB, and tracked the eventual outcome of the animal to confirm our definitions of them as infected or uninfected were correct. In other words the genetic trait we investigated relates to TB infection, and not just a differing response to the skin test. We consider that the resistance trait relates to an innate genetic ability to prevent or eliminate infection, not to adaptive immunity. At first, TB attacks the white blood cells that help fight infection, and it’s likely that any genetic resistance to TB from the innate immune system, the body’s first line of defence, attacks the pathogen at this stage. This is the most likely explanation for those animals exposed but not infected (controls). If the animal becomes infected, then the TB-specific adaptive immune response can try to fight the infection, but this is dependent on the innate response happening first. This response takes time to develop, and shows up in the skin test for TB. But genetic differences are not the only factors – the environment and perhaps even differences between strains of TB also play a role. And while we studied the Holstein-Friesian breed, we don’t know how the genetics of other breeds of cattle, such as those common in beef herds, affect their susceptibility to infection. But there is evidence from Ethiopia that zebu cattle that are kept there are more TB-resistant than the Holstein-Friesian breed kept in the UK. These studies were only possible due to the data on TB infection that is routinely collected in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Future breeding programmes based on an understanding of genetic resistance to TB should be introduced alongside other TB control strategies. A project from dairy farmers’ organisation DairyCo and SAC Commercial Ltd is the first step, and will carry out a national genetic evalulation of pedigree data for Holstein-Friesian cattle.  These sorts of genetic evaluations are carried out routinely to select beneficial traits such as high milk yield or long-lived cows. With the costs of bovine TB so high, it makes sense to do the same for TB-resistance. By starting with the genetic markers our study identified using the SNP chips, this process could be carried out much faster – the SNP data will be more accurate, and the potential improvement in TB-resistance would be seen much more quickly in the next generation of cows."
"Forecasters predict a wetter than normal start to March that will no doubt hamper efforts to bring an end to the misery of those whose homes are underwater. These extended floods and bad weather reveal the changes in how emergencies are handled. Extreme weather conditions such as rainfall, wind, heat, cold, and tidal surges are becoming more common, and their impact felt for longer. Risk management planning by emergency services needs to start accommodating medium and long-term changes to the pattern of threats, particularly from the environment. This is something that Public Management and Governance Research Group and the Emergency Services Research Unit are already working on with the emergency services and government. One of the key questions to arise from the current floods is why the government has seemed so out of touch with what is happening on the ground and why the preparations and responses to the emergency have been so uncoordinated. After all, we live in a world of round-the-clock media coverage and instant access to news on mobile phones and portable computers. Yet the government’s response to floods that began in December came weeks, even months late. Part of the answer lies in the closure in 2011 of the Government Offices, a regional network that functioned as the local points of presence of central government departments. This has led to cuts in the capacity and funding of the regional resilience and emergency planning teams that had operated in the nine English regions. The Civil Contingencies Act replaced the earlier and very much outdated Civil Defence and Emergency Powers legislation, most of which dated back to World War II. This came about as domestic and terrorist threats to services, along with widespread flooding in England and Wales between 1998 and 2000 and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001, became more numerous and their social and economic impacts more widespread. This Act established Regional Resilience Teams in each regional office, small groups of dedicated specialists that co-ordinated and developed local resilience networks which brought together emergency planners and emergency responders. These include police, fire, ambulance and coastguard services, but also experts from for example the Environment Agency, Network Rail, Highways Agency, NHS, and electricity, gas and water utilities. These specialists prepared and updated emergency plans and established a two-way dialogue between the centre office and local emergency responders through Local Resilience Forums. At times of emergencies they could call on their local knowledge, assistance and contacts in the area, or of the teams within the offices. These teams knew their local areas well. They were in regular contact with all the key people on the ground in local communities – people who would know where and what resources were available, who would need to be involved, and how to effectively co-ordinate their deployment. However, the regional Government Offices were caught up in the bonfire of the quangos and swept away in a tide of austerity rhetoric and an anti-regional agenda spearheaded by Eric Pickles at the Department of Communities and Local Government. Now, what’s left of the Regional Resilience Teams have become the responsibility of the Cabinet Office, somewhat defeating the point of their local links, and numbers have been slashed. Staff now operate in a semi-peripatetic way across one of the three regions England is now divided into, essentially the North, Midlands and South. Inevitably these staff have a much thinner network of contacts, and no real chance of knowing the huge geographical areas under their control in the detail needed. The local forums have been left in place but inevitably with less support and guidance. They are all experienced in dealing with emergencies, but at a time when the affects of emergencies such as these floods are becoming more widespread and prolonged, there is a greater rather than a lesser need for better co-operation between emergency services – services which have themselves been subject to significant funding cuts. Stripping away this layer of regional government has resulted in a demonstrable loss of organisational capacity, as well as historical knowledge and experience, all at a time of rising demand. The government is well aware of the need for co-ordinated response – it established the Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Programme between the three main emergency services which produced it’s first publication just weeks before the floods began. But for those on the ground, it’s a case of fine words butter no parsnips."
"The idea of the “green economy” goes in and out of fashion, not least because it is rarely defined and frequently misunderstood. Partly this is because different groups find ways to exaggerate the aspects of it that support their particular interests, each providing such different analyses and arguments that the term itself ceases to mean much. And partly it is because, like other issues, it is driven up and down the policy agenda by events. Right now it is extreme weather that is causing concern in many countries, floods in the UK, droughts and storms elsewhere. Given that these are the kinds of events climate scientists have said for years are the probable result of global warming, it’s quite likely they’re linked to climate change, albeit in complex ways. One of the key objectives of a green economy is reducing greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to mitigate the effects of climate change. Others are improving resource security by ensuring more efficient and productive use of resources, recycling and re-using products when they reach the end of their lives, and contributing to human well-being through clean air and water, urban green spaces, nature conservation and biodiversity. Climate stability, resource security, environmental quality: these are obvious goods to come from a green economy. One would imagine that people and societies, especially those that are stable and economically well developed, would be prepared to bear some costs in order to reap the benefits. But one remarkable aspect of a green economy is that substantial evidence points to these costs being very small, with savings from great efficiency in some instances being greater than the costs. These are among are the main conclusions of the UCL Green Economy Policy Commission’s report. It’s easiest to illustrate this with the example of reducing carbon emissions. Low carbon energy supply technologies are currently more expensive than high carbon fossil fuels, which might lead to the conclusion that cutting carbon emissions must be costly. But in fact low carbon technologies can save substantially more than they cost. Switching to low carbon tech will have a net short-term benefit if the gains from efficiency balance out the higher costs of supply. These costs can be further reduced if carbon pricing is used, such as through a carbon tax or emissions trading scheme, in order to stimulate investment in low carbon technologies. This would allow other taxes, for example on labour, investments or enterprise, which reduce incentives to work and save, to be cut – a process known as environmental tax reform. In the long term, the benefits of moving to low carbon technologies will be enhanced as the costs of low carbon tech come down further, and as these technologies find export markets abroad. The benefits would be greater still if fossil fuel prices continue to rise. Best of all would be if a green economic stimulus in the UK, and the wider European Union, encouraged other countries to move in the same direction. This points to other areas of policy required for a green economy. Government needs to stimulate innovation, from research and development through to deployment of new technology on the ground and in the sea. It needs to partner with the private sector in building new infrastructure that supports resource-efficient urban renewal and sustainable networks for energy, transport, and water. And it needs to generate much clearer information about the material demands of the economy, providing material accounts that match the national economic accounts in detail and sophistication, so that these materials can be more easily managed and recycled, preventing them from becoming waste. Government’s role in all these areas involves both committing its own resources and, more importantly, leveraging private sector investment in the new green infrastructure required. But it will only be successful in persuading the private sector to invest in greening the economy if its policies are credible and command confidence that the government intends to see this agenda through to the end. The confused messages from the government recently in energy policy – for example over the role of renewables or shale gas, or green subsidies on energy bills – have shown how difficult it is for politicians to maintain a clear sense of direction under the pressure of events.  Issuing bonds with interest rates linked to the government’s environmental performance (another recommendation from the report) might help convince investors of its long-term commitment to building a green economy. The mere rhetoric that is forthcoming from time to time will not."

The word for today is…



fecund (adj) – 1. (a) Capable of producing offspring or vegetation; fruitful.  
(b) Characterised by or suggestive of fertility.  
2\. Characterised by intellectual productivity.



Source : [The Free Dictionary](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/fecund)



Etymology : Fecund and its synonyms fruitful and fertile all mean producing or capable of producing offspring or fruit, literally or figuratively. Fecund applies to things that yield offspring, fruit, or results in abundance or with rapidity (“a fecund herd,” “a fecund imagination”). Fruitful emphasizes abundance, too, and often adds the implication that the results attained are desirable or useful (“fruitful plains,” “a fruitful discussion”). Fertile implies the power to reproduce (“a fertile egg”) or the power to assist in reproduction, growth, or development (“fertile soil,” “a fertile climate for artists”).

"House Democrats will unveil an aggressive climate crisis “action plan” on Tuesday to nearly eliminate US emissions by 2050, according to summary documents reviewed by the Guardian. The net-zero emissions goal is what United Nations leaders and the scientific community say the world must achieve to avoid the worst of rising temperatures, and it’s what the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, says he would pursue if he were to win the White House in November.  The Democrats’ proposal, referred to in a two-page summary as a “congressional action plan” and a “roadmap”, calls for interim targets to assess progress and make sure fossil fuel pollution is declining, particularly in communities of color that have suffered environmental injustices. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will announce the plan, compiled by the House select committee on the climate crisis that is chaired by the Florida congresswoman Kathy Castor, at an event in front of the US Capitol on Tuesday morning. The more than 538-page report will include hundreds of policy recommendations focused on 12 key pillars, according to a separate outline. Modeling on a subset of those recommendations by the firm energy innovation showed they would cut net US greenhouse gas emissions by 37% below 2010 levels in 2030, and 88% below 2010 levels in 2050, according to the report outline. The remaining 12% of emissions cuts would have to come from hard-to-decarbonize sectors, including heavy-duty truck transportation, industry and agriculture. The proposal outline recommends a clean energy standard for net-zero electricity by 2040 and net-zero new buildings by 2030. It calls for only zero-emitting new vehicles to be sold by 2035, and it advocates for doubling funding for public transit. The plan provides a “roadmap for Congress to build a prosperous, clean energy economy that values workers, advances environmental justice, and is prepared to meet the challenges of the climate crisis”, according to the documents. Leah Stokes, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies climate policy, called the plan “ambitious and comprehensive”. “It shows that the committee has been listening to stakeholders, and has watched the Democratic primary carefully. Clearly they have learned from climate champions like [Washington] Governor Jay Inslee,” she said. “I am very heartened to see the detail and ambition that the committee has put forward – it shows that the Democratic party is waking up to the scale and urgency of the climate crisis.” However, the plan has no chance of passing a Republican-controlled Senate, and would be a difficult sell even for some Democrats if their party took back that chamber and won the White House from Donald Trump. The president has vowed to exit the Paris climate agreement and has rescinded the country’s national climate efforts. Democrats will tout that the plan would provide almost $8tn in climate and health benefits through the middle of the century, but Republicans are sure to zero in on the proposal’s costs, arguing that they will stifle an already struggling economy. Investments would also be made to stem and respond to climate impacts, including water infrastructure to handle increased flooding and a next-generation 911 system to make sure wireless communications networks are reliable during disasters. The plan would aim to reduce methane leaks from the oil and gas sector 90% by 2030, noted Stokes, who reviewed the full report. Oil and gas companies would no longer get “unnecessary tax breaks” and the US would place a price on carbon to make companies pay for their pollution. Under the plan, Congress would also implement policies to make sure heavy industries cut pollution in vulnerable communities, so that poor Americans and communities of color do not suffer from the transition. The roadmap would “put [environmental justice] at the center of federal climate and environmental policy.” It would also establish a national climate adaptation program and protect at least 30% of all US lands and ocean areas by 2030. A national economic transition office would help displaced workers, and coal industry veterans would get healthcare support. Finally, the proposal would invest in “climate literacy”. “Turning this plan into reality will build a safer, healthier, and fairer America, restore our global climate leadership, enhance our national security, and provide a livable climate for today’s youth and future generations,” the documents say."

2019 was the third consecutive local body election in which I have compiled a voting guide. In 2013, [it was a couple of pages knocked together](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK1309/S00728/the-affordable-auckland-voting-guide.htm), with a considerable amount of self-interest invested into it. The Affordable City nationwide local body ticket – Affordable Auckland in our case – had three candidates for Council, two for local board and myself standing for Mayor. 



Affordable Auckland Results 2013  




In 2016, I’d withdrawn from the Mayoral race when the centre-right got too crowded, Palino had a very similar platform to mine and I’d now been transferred to open a new supermarket. It’s hard to sit and watch, quietly, from the sidelines. [Hence, a 2016 voting guide.](http://community.scoop.co.nz/2016/09/stephen-berrys-guide-to-voting-auckland-2016/) It took a couple of days to complete but again, not that detailed.



When the 2019 candidates had been confirmed, I figured it wouldn’t be that difficult to do an assessment of every race if I started immediately, but hyper-focus and the desire not to be sued for defamation resulted in each article taking 2 to 5 hours at a time to write. Local boards such as Manurewa with 22 candidates and Devonport-Takapuna with 18 were especially demanding. Underestimating the size or difficulty of a task is a mistake I think I’m doomed never to learn, though the accompanying excessively optimistic outlook is compensation enough.



For a blatantly biased voting guide, I was determined to be as fair and systematic as possible by reading every candidate profile and googling each candidate to ensure I had as much information as possible. This was most difficult with local board contests. I’ve had a long and sufficiently intense interest in politics for most names or affiliations to ring a bell, though some had virtually no google footprint at all. 



Incumbents are among those with virtually no online presence, including incumbents no longer affiliated with the tickets they were elected prior. The absence of evidence for their newfound independence speaks just as loudly as the absence of any other visibility on google. They did as little as their former colleagues claim. Conversely, a much smaller number of incumbents with new affiliations also stood for re-election and their google footprints indicate the fault resulting in parting ways with their colleagues isn’t their own.



Some candidate profiles were either obviously rushed, showed a lack of effort or were grammatically indecipherable. Others said plenty about themselves or careers and little about their priorities, then had the nerve to send me criticisms for portraying them poorly, not doing enough research or failing to understand how that experience would make them excellent representatives.



Candidates write the candidate profiles themselves. If I have failed to understand the value you would add as a representative, using your candidate profile and google searches using the keywords within, the fault is entirely yours. Do better. Others, standing for election for the first time emailed their appreciation of being reviewed, some of which were blunt but came with suggestions for improvement. The clickbait nature of mass mainstream media meant it was almost the only coverage they had and that’s a frustration I completely understand. Considering the number of elections I’ve lost, it is legitimate to question the value of that advice but much of it comes from politicians I look up to and failing teaches at least as many lessons as success.



I’ve lived in a variety of Auckland suburbs in my life; Manurewa, Mt. Roskill, St. Lukes, Ponsonby, Massey, Lynfield, Onehunga, Remuera, Meadowbank, CBD and Forrest Hill. Most of the contests I researched with no preconceptions of whom I would support and in some cases completed the review with a decision very different from expected. I didn’t even open my voting papers until the articles on Orakei and the Mayoralty were written and published. The irony of being unable to make a decision until reading the voting guide I authored isn’t lost.



Numerous contests, especially the local boards, I knew virtually nothing of the participants, their policies or the nuances of the unique issues of their locality until the article was completely researched and published. The public responses that followed were sufficient evidence I’d got it right. Some were so disproportionate and bizarre, they only helped the reputation of the candidate they opposed.



On occasion, I got it wrong, inevitable given the enormity of the task. The spelling of a couple of candidate names had to be fixed. One candidate who I stated had championed an unsuccessful petition for a dog park, produced evidence showing not only was the petition not rejected but the local board in question was very close to implementing its request. Naturally I was only too happy to publish a correction in every facebook community group possible. There was also the case of two female candidates, listed one after the other on the same ballot who had both worked in their local MP’s office and one was missed from the guide. Credit goes to the persistence and politeness of their many supporters for the injustice being corrected.



Sometimes, I’d encounter candidate names that I only recognised as having liked the facebook page recently. Many I’d met and liked personally despite their politics. Those were the most difficult to write. Politics is an enterprise in which uncomplimentary interactions or language are routine and necessary. It varies wildly depending on the individual, but a significant proportion of the insults and criticisms levelled at rivals aren’t enjoyable.



To my knowledge, _Stephen Berry’s Guide to Auckland Local Elections_ is the most comprehensive, complete and detailed guide compiled in New Zealand political history. If not, it certainly is the case for one compiled single-handedly. 



Unfortunately, I fell short of achieving a review of every election contest, though the Mayoralty, all Council Wards, 1 DHB, 16 from 32 local board contests and the Waitakere & Portage Licensing Trusts were completed.



Several other organisations also wrote guides recommending voting choices;



All of these guides shared a fatal flaw. They required candidate participation. Not every candidate likes answering policy questions for a publisher they perceive to be hostile or unimportant. Communities & Residents didn’t participate in any in Auckland. _Stephen Berry’s Guide to Auckland Local Elections_ (aka The BFD’s _An Absolutely Biased Guide to Auckland Local Elections_ ) wasn’t compromised by that handicap because I asked virtually no candidates. The names of those who contacted me will stay with me.



There were 40 individual contests rated, once local boards are split into subdivisions where appropriate.



That’s 282 candidacies, compiled at the end of this article though, with 1 day left for people to physically deliver their vote, I doubt that will make any further impact.

"What to do about invasive species, which are having a growing and generally detrimental effect on Europe’s environment and economies, is the subject of discussion in both the European Parliament and UK Parliament this week. Invasive alien species are animals and plants introduced accidentally (or deliberately) into an environment where they are not normally found. Although estimates indicate that there are some 12,000 alien species in Europe, only 10-15% have become invasive, that is, have become damaging and of concern. However, just these 10-15% cost Europe €12 billion a year. So while the European Union has put in place its 2020 biodiversity strategy, it has not yet managed to provide a comprehensive framework to address this threat to European biodiversity. The EU legislation pending a vote has been under discussion since September 2013 and has steadily gathered support from various European bodies and committees. The case for new legislation is persuasive, and in all likelihood it will pass and become a new EU regulation, bringing with it legal obligations on member states to ban the import, keeping, sale, exchange and so on of specific species. But foresters and horticulturists, whose professions depend on valuable exotic plant species, have raised concerns. After all, many “alien” species of plants have long been cultivated for timber or for ornamental purposes – too broad a ban and these will be drawn into it. Some of the poorer member states have argued that the proposed measures for surveillance, monitoring and control of invasive alien species will put a heavy burden on their already over-stretched budgets. It’s estimated that this legislation will cost the EU €560,000 between 2015 and 2021 – small change compared to the cost the damage these species cause, but an extra cost nonetheless. But, most importantly, questions remain about the results: experience from around the world suggests that the large sums of money spent on control and eradication programmes have not yielded the promised results. Some colleagues and I carried out a historical analysis of the spread and management of Lantana camara, wild or red sage, one of world’s top 50 worst invasive species. We found that despite many different measures – mechanical removal, chemical poisoning, biological control – Lantana continued to spread throughout subtropical regions during the 19th and 20th centuries. It was evident that countries spent large sums of money trying to control the plant. For example, in 1973 the cost of Lantana control in Queensland, Australia was estimated at A$1 million (US$800,000) per year. In South Africa, chemical poisoning cost an estimated 1.7 million rand (US$250,000) per year in 1999. Indian estimates in 2009 put control costs at 9,000 rupees per hectare (US$200) – reaching a total of US$2.6 billion to tackle the 13m hectares where it has spread in India, a sum greater than the GDP of the neighbouring Maldives islands.  Despite all this money spent in Australia, South Africa and India, the notorious weed has continued to spread. And unfortunately it is not the only invasive species that has proved unmanageable: hundreds or thousands of others have spread across the world, defying all attempts by countries to make their borders “biosecure”. To deal with alien and invasive species that have already made it through porous borders and have established themselves in their new homes, we need more creative approaches than throwing mechanical excavators, chemicals, and enormous amounts of money at the problem.  With the help of NGOs, some rural communities in India have started a cottage industry of making baskets and furniture from Lantana. Other radical solutions that have been proposed to control invasive species include eating them. A Chicago restaurant owner sells Asian carp burgers at his specialist fish shop to help the problem of this giant fish infesting North America’s Great Lakes. Others making dinner out of invasive alien species include Miya’s Sushi in New Haven, Connecticut, which has a special invasive species menu, through which they “return to the roots of sushi, meaning simply to use what we have available.” Crayfish Bob in London offers a variety of invasive crayfish dishes, providing “quality food for a better environment”. So the new EU legislation is a precautionary measure to prevent the ecological, economic and social costs that invasive species might in future impose. This will try to ensure Europe is more biosecure through a variety of control measures at borders, tackling those species that have made it through, and efforts to eradicate those that have become a nuisance.  But the costly failures elsewhere in controlling and managing invasive species makes one wonder whether we should find more creative ways of dealing with the problem: local economies based on harvesting invasive species, or recreational hunting, fishing or foraging as a part of nature tourism, perhaps. In any case, a new approach is needed."
"The colossal challenge facing human civilisation, of ending our reliance on fossil fuels in short order, has almost certainly been made harder by the pandemic. Ever since scientists discovered that the Earth was warming as a result of human activity, it has been a struggle to get people, governments and businesses to do anything about it. Even in those countries least resistant to the evidence of rapidly approaching danger, something else was usually seen as more important. In the past few months, once again, the climate emergency has been knocked off the top of world leaders’ to-do list by the more immediate threat of the virus. Recognising this, the environmental movement came up with the excellent idea of a green recovery. The annual report published on Thursday by the Committee on Climate Change, which provides official advice to the UK government, is a crucial, national component of that global effort. It sets out to tell Boris Johnson, his ministers and the British public how we can embed the lessons of Covid-19 in the next phase of carbon cuts.  There is some hopeful news, amid the destruction: because of the economic contraction caused by the pandemic, global emissions are expected to fall by 5-10% in 2020. In the UK, the switch to home-working has been far swifter and more dramatic than anything envisioned by climate policymakers. If this can be sustained post-pandemic, the reduction in transport emissions could be huge. To what extent the overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can be sustained, either domestically or internationally, will depend on the policies pursued. The committee identifies post-pandemic stimulus spending on high-carbon infrastructure as a threat. Changing attitudes to public transport due to the risk of infection is another. On the other hand, the kind of transformation that will be required if we are to become a zero-carbon world has arguably been made easier by the pandemic. Once people see how fragile and interconnected we really are, pressure for rapid decarbonisation could be expected to grow. In the UK, the report identifies buildings and transport as key priorities, and has a raft of recommendations geared towards progress in these two areas. Regulations on housebuilding have been disgracefully lax, allowing 1 million new homes to be put up that already require retrofitting to meet energy standards (and allow owners and tenants to benefit from lower bills). Low-carbon heating must be pushed into a dominant position, and out of its current eco-specialist niche. On surface transport, which is now responsible for more emissions than any other sector in the UK (24% in 2019), the popularity of energy-intensive sports utility vehicles (SUVs) is one problem that leaps out. Their market share jumped from 6% in 2008 to 25% in 2019. The shift is mirrored in other countries. Beyond such practical indications of where action is needed, and highlighting of inconsistencies in areas from agriculture to aviation, the report makes a case for “fairness as a core principle”. This applies domestically, and requires ministers to think about the differential impact of any changes – for example to energy taxes. But it also has global implications, and entails a new way of counting emissions that includes consumption as well as production. Sound advice is one thing. The capacity to take it is another. Boris Johnson has only chaired one meeting of the cabinet committee on climate change set up last October. This fact on its own is dismal. But the opportunity remains. Next week he is expected to set out how the UK government will approach the recovery. Preparations for the postponed Cop26 climate talks are the ideal way to make this a global discussion. Can Mr Johnson show more effective leadership in the climate crisis than he has during the pandemic? For the UK in 2020 there are few more important questions."
"**Northern Ireland is going to start a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown on Friday 27 November.**
It follows the use of a 17-day ""firebreak"" to try to stem Covid cases in Wales.
A circuit-breaker is a tight set of restrictions designed to reverse the tide of the epidemic and bring the number of cases down.
The rules could feel a lot like the original national lockdown - but crucially a circuit-breaker is for a fixed period of time.
The hope is they are less damaging - to the economy and people's mental health - than a longer lockdown, because people can plan ahead more easily.
How far Covid rates drop would depend on how severe the restrictions were, and how much we stick to them.
The UK as a whole has not yet had a circuit-breaker, with the nations opting to introduce their own measures.
During Wales's circuit-breaker:
From next Friday in Northern Ireland:
Dr Adam Kucharski, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""The overarching aim is you don't want intensive care units filling up again, but you also have increased options at lower levels of the virus.""
The government's test-and-trace programme is currently only reaching half of infected people's close contacts in some areas, the BBC has learned.
Dr Kucharski said: ""As cases and hospitalisations increase, there is less information on what the outbreak is doing, as test and trace can't pick it all up, you don't know where the outbreak is.""
The minimum duration is seen as two weeks.
Anything shorter and the risk is people who are infected just before the start of the circuit-breaker may still be able to spread the virus when it ends.
The longer the circuit-breaker, the more it would reduce cases - but the greater the other impacts on society.
Not until after it was lifted.
It can take a week between being infected and developing symptoms, the same again between getting sick and needing hospital treatment, and up to a month before people die.
All of these lags mean the statistics on deaths and hospital admissions are expected to look worse throughout the whole of a circuit-breaker.
It is only later that the benefits begin to trickle through.
Wales' 17-day firebreak ended on 9 November.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said the chief medical officer's analysis was the evidence was now ""good enough"" to show it did ""succeed"".
He said the number of Covid patients in hospital was ""stabilising"" and the R number \- the number of people someone infects - in Wales the following week ""could have been below one"".
After Wales' firebreak ended, restaurants, pubs, gyms all reopened and infection rates generally fell the following week in most places.
Cases will go up again unless something fundamentally changes.
""With a managed short-term lockdown, you buy yourself some time,"" says Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick.
""But you may find yourself in a cycle of short-term lockdowns until you have an exit strategy like a vaccine or herd immunity.""
Yes.
The state of South Australia has just entered a six-day lockdown to try to curb an outbreak - its first in six months.
Israel used a circuit-breaker in October after its ""traffic-light"" system did not get infections under control.
A temporary lockdown in New Zealand, which successfully allowed contact tracers to get back on top of the outbreak there, can be seen as a circuit-breaker even though it was not called that.

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has been hailed as an economic liberalizer, having sharply criticized rising U.S. protectionism under the Trump administration. Yet Modi too has embarked on measures to protect and support manufacturing jobs in India. The latest Indian budget in February 2018 raised import duties on more than 40 items, ranging from auto parts and toys to candles and furniture, in order to protect uncompetitive small businesses and create jobs in labor‐​intensive industries. Earlier, India had raised import duties on several electronic items, from phone components to TVs and microwave ovens. This was in pursuance of a Phased Manufacturing Program aiming to check massive imports from China and ensure that cellphone assembly and the manufacture of components are done mostly in India. An official task force has been appointed to look into ways of reducing import dependence.



Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not a conventional right‐​wing party. It rejects both socialism and Western capitalism and seeks a homegrown solution called Integral Humanism. It supports private enterprise but also runs India’s biggest trade union and believes in a wide‐​ranging welfare state. It has highly protectionist affiliates that have always been wary of multinational corporations and international institutions. It believes in government intervention to create national champions, increase employment, and protect small businesses. The party also contains many liberalizers who succeeded in opening up the economy when the party ruled from 1998 to 2004, overcoming objections from BJP affiliates.



When Modi came to power in 2014, he was seen as a liberalizer, bearing the slogan, “Minimum government, maximum governance.” In fact, he expanded the role of government in welfare even while liberalizing the economy incrementally. He now faces the same global headwinds that Trump does: fear of China, automation, and lack of good jobs. These pressures are driving India’s new protectionism, just as they have done in the United States. Optimists hope the new import tariffs are only temporary. The risk is that the new protectionism will get entrenched and reverse the major gains India has made since economic reforms began in 1991.



At the 2018 Davos meeting of the World Economic Forum, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi made a stirring plea for globalization and open trade, implicitly attacking the “America First” policies of the Trump administration. He said, “Many countries are becoming inward focused and globalization is shrinking, and such tendencies can’t be considered lesser risks than terrorism or climate change.”1



Modi’s speech was widely welcomed by economic liberals across the globe. It echoed similar pro‐​globalization statements made by Chinese president Xi Jinping. Some theorists began to speculate on the possibility that India and China would keep the world open and globalized in the 21st century even as the United States turned inward.2



Alas, such theorizing was revealed as wishful thinking a few weeks later when India’s budget for 2018–2019 was presented. It raised import duties on 40‐​odd items “to provide adequate protection to domestic industry” and “promote creation of more jobs.”3 The language of the budget speech was not cloaked by any subterfuge: it was nakedly protectionist. One columnist remarked that Modi’s slogan of “Make in India” was becoming “Protect in India.”4 Duties were raised by 15–20 percent on items as varied as auto parts, candles, kites, sunglasses, lamps, cigarette lighters, toiletries, toys, watches, footwear, and furniture. The duty on fruit juices and miscellaneous processed foods went up to the range of 25–50 percent. India itself is a substantial exporter of some of these items—auto parts, textiles, and footwear—and that made the selection of protected items puzzling. One World Bank expert examined the list of items and said he could find no coherent or logical thread connecting them.5



In July 2018, the government increased the import duties on 76 textile items6 and followed up with increased duties on 328 textile items the next month.7 It also appointed a task force under the cabinet secretary, the senior‐​most civil servant, to look into ways of reducing import dependence. The stated aim is brazenly protectionist.8



The new protectionist approach also means India is going back to the bad old days when it had dozens of different tariff rates for different items. This encouraged misdeclaration of imports (to pay relatively low rates of import duty) in cahoots with corrupt customs officers. Worse, it encouraged lobbying by different industry groups for special tariff protection, creating an inequitable form of crony capitalism. In the 2000s, successive governments began trying to reduce the dispersion of rates to discourage lobbying, misdeclaration, and corruption. By 2008, the peak import duty on nonagricultural items was reduced and unified at 10 percent, with limited exceptions. The latest budget raises fears of a return to the old protectionism and cronyism, marked by widely varying import duties on different items, that India followed for decades after independence, with disastrous economic consequences.9



After India gained independence in 1947, the Congress Party, cashing in on its advantage of having spearheaded the independence struggle, ruled for more than four decades. It was a socialist party seeking economic self‐​sufficiency over globalization, aiming for state control of the commanding heights of the economy, and making Five‐​Year Plans inspired by what at the time looked like the successful economic model of the Soviet Union. During the independence movement, the party strongly campaigned for Indians to buy only domestically produced goods and burn imports from Britain, the colonial power.



That bias remained after independence. Leaders of all political parties sought “economic independence” to buttress political independence. This took the form of discouraging international trade and foreign investment and relying on import substitution at almost any cost. This was motivated by the theory that infant‐​industry protection would ultimately make India a great, competitive industrial power. Industrial licenses were used to tightly regulate all production, and imports competing with newly licensed items were banned or taxed at high rates often exceeding 100 percent. This approach failed to create world champions and instead created uncompetitive high‐​cost industries that harmed consumers and investors alike. This approach also reduced India’s share in global trade from 2.2 percent in 1950 to 0.45 percent by 1985, yet many socialists cheered this as a success rather than deploring it as a disaster. Such inward‐​looking policies yielded GDP growth of just 3.5 percent per year for three decades after independence, half the rate achieved by the trade‐​friendly “tiger” economies of Asia. Some GDP acceleration in India occurred in the 1980s, partly because of limited economic liberalization but mostly because of a fiscal spending spree.10



This came to a sorry end in 1990, when India ran out of foreign exchange reserves and went hat in hand to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1991. That set the scene for much‐​needed economic reforms that gradually liberalized the economy, reducing the dominance of the public sector and encouraging foreign trade and investment. Gradual liberalization eventually helped India achieve a record 8 percent growth per year in the 2000s. Growth slowed after the Great Recession, but even today.



India is growing at around 7 percent per year and has overtaken China as the fastest‐​growing major economy in the world. Gradual success in liberalization and record growth in the 2000s helped tame India’s instinctive protectionist tendencies built up over decades. But those tendencies always triumphed in some areas (like agriculture) and remained just beneath the surface in other areas. They are now rearing their heads again.11



Various unstable coalitions ruled India after 1991. Different parties came to power, often using left‐​wing rhetoric, but liberalization continued regardless of who ruled—including the once‐​socialist Congress Party—with occasional steps backward and sideways. From 1998 to 2004, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a Hindu nationalist party, ruled India at the head of a coalition called the National Democratic Alliance. It significantly liberalized the economy in these six years. Subsequently, a Congress Party–led coalition returned to power in 2004 and remained until 2014, an era marked by high growth but also a high level of corruption.12



The BJP swept back into power in the 2014 election under Modi. He subsequently led the party to victory in 20 state assemblies, making the BJP the major political force in India.



Right‐​wing parties in most countries are pro‐​business, wary of trade unions, and gung ho about privatization, foreign trade and investment, and globalization in general. The BJP is right‐​wing but does not follow this pattern at all. It strongly favors the small‐​business owners and traders who have always been its core supporters, and it wants to give them special protection rather than risk their failure in open competition with large companies. It is wary of global institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), the IMF, and multinational corporations (MNCs), whom it suspects of being political tools of Western powers. The party thinks MNCs have unfair advantages because of global networks and cheap capital. It is pro‐​business but also believes strongly in a caring welfare state. It espouses _antodaya_ , which means the uplifting of the very poorest in every habitation.



The BJP aims to create national champions in both the public and private sectors, providing them with government support against foreign rivals. The party philosophy rejects both communism and Western‐​style capitalism and promotes a fuzzy concept called Integral Humanism. It does not view capital and labor as fundamentally opposed but as elements that must be combined to produce a strong state. And so, even while being pro‐​business, the BJP also operates the largest trade union in India, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh. This is one reason the party has failed to liberalize restrictive labor laws that make it difficult to fire workers.13



The BJP does not think free enterprise will work for the millions of Indian farmers owning tiny plots of a hectare or two, and views them as handicapped people who deserve subsidies, freedom from plant patents, and other forms of government support. This agenda is pushed by a BJP farmers’ affiliate called the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS).The party is not very keen on privatization and is happy to reform public‐​sector enterprises and run them efficiently rather than privatize them en masse. (This was in fact Modi’s model when he was chief minister of Gujarat for 12 years.) It views a strong, well‐​run public sector and a strong indigenous private sector as tools to keep MNCs at bay and promote a powerful Hindu state. The BJP favors slashing red tape and reducing the power of sundry inspectors to fine or close offending units (a power widely misused to extract bribes). This mix of policies makes the BJP very different from the typical right‐​wing party in the West.14



The party’s origins lie in the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925 as a nongovernment organization propagating the values and culture of traditional Hinduism. It deplored the modern secular values of other parties that opposed a Hindu state and felt that Muslims and other minorities should respect and absorb Hindu culture and values. The RSS was associated with many anti‐​Muslim riots. One of its members, Nathuram Godse, assassinated Mahatma Gandhi in 1948 for being too pro‐​Muslim during the Hindu‐​Muslims riots that wracked India at the time of its partition into India and Pakistan. The RSS aimed for a Hindu state that would make India as great a power as it had been in ancient times. It deplored tendencies to ape Western culture and values.15



The RSS and its economic wing, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), were historically protectionist. They feared that foreign trade and investment could be the thin end of the wedge for foreign economic and cultural domination. They were at one time very worried about Indian culture being undercut by economic liberalization. When Kentucky Fried Chicken first entered India in the mid‐​1990s, the SJM attacked its outlets and campaigned for banning fast food MNCs that would threaten the traditional Hindu way of life. They grossly underestimated consumer loyalty to India’s many cuisines. Indian consumers disliked KFC’s standard international menu, so the company had to close temporarily and relaunch later with items tailored to Indian tastes.



McDonald’s never had a hope of bringing its standard beef burgers into India because Hindus view the cow as sacred and do not eat beef. McDonald’s considered introducing a lamburger instead, but that idea failed. Many years of experimentation led it to settle on a menu dominated by chicken and vegetable burgers, spiced to suit Indian palates. Initially the SJM campaigned against McDonald’s too, saying hamburgers and potato chips (known in the United States as french fries) were junk foods that India did not need. Indeed, the election campaign of the BJP in 1998 had the slogan, “Computer chips yes, potato chips no!” However, Indian fast foods (and slow foods) soon showed that they could more than hold their own against foreign chains, which had to alter their menus drastically to suit Indian tastes. The fear that McDonald’s would change India’s culture proved groundless. Rather, India changed the culture of McDonald’s, prompting the company to depart from a standardized menu.16



From 1998 to 2004, the BJP ruled for the first time in New Delhi at the head of a disparate coalition under Atal Behari Vajpayee. He was far more liberal in outlook than the RSS or SJM. So were his two finance ministers, Yeshwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh. They were able to liberalize the economy much faster than the RSS and SJM would have liked. Contrary to RSS fears, liberalization helped increase GDP and Indian companies (including food chains) proved they could stand up to foreign competition. This reduced RSS resistance to foreign investment and helped liberalizers within the party. Indeed, in the 2000s many Indian companies began to acquire companies across the globe and become multinationals. LN Mittal acquired Arcelor to form the biggest steel company in the world. The Tata group acquired Britain’s Jaguar and made it a great success. This showed that globalization was not a recipe for foreign domination and could in fact assist the rise of Indian dominance abroad, bringing back memories of glorious past centuries when India was one of the world’s most powerful and prosperous trading nations.17



While the RSS and SJM are now willing to accept many more forms of foreign investment, they remain paranoid that global giants like Walmart will kill millions of small Indian shopkeepers. Indian trader outfits fought the entry of foreign retail chains, garnering support from all political parties. India became the only country in the world to have different policies for single‐​brand and multibrand retail. Single‐​brand chains like Apple and Puma were not seen as killers of small shopkeepers, and their entry was allowed. But multibrand chains like Walmart were seen as threats and were limited to holding minority stakes in joint ventures headed by an Indian partner. They could, however, open wholesale stores (along the lines of Sam’s Club). Onerous conditions on local sourcing were placed on foreign retailers: the RSS worried that foreign chains would flood India with cheap items from China, hitting Indian manufacturers. These onerous sourcing conditions were gradually eased, but they delayed the entry of companies like Ikea by years. Walmart entered into a joint venture with the Bharti group for retail stores, but these failed and Walmart exited the venture. It did continue with wholesale stores modeled on its Sam’s Club chain.18



Meanwhile, the e‐​commerce revolution threatened brick‐​and‐​mortar stores, regardless of ownership. Modi always saw “Digital India” as part of his vision for India’s future and told the RSS and all shopkeepers they would have to adapt to this phenomenon. But as a measure to protect shopkeepers, e‐​commerce companies had to restrict themselves to being “marketplaces” that brought together consumers with third‐​party sellers. Amazon could not sell anything produced by its own subsidiaries. In May 2018, Walmart acquired Flipkart, which meant Indian e‐​commerce would be dominated by the two American giants. The SJM has bitterly protested, but the takeover will almost certainly go through, since it has taken place with the full knowledge of (and without resistance from) Modi.19



The RSS and SJM, as Hindu nationalists, are today more worried about China than about Western MNCs. Politically, they view China as Pakistan’s greatest supporter and as wanting to grab control of the Indian Ocean through a string of naval bases. This explains why India is one of the few countries to oppose China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The BJP fears China will try to grab Indian territory in the Himalayan region. Economically, it is paranoid about the ability of China, with its massive subsidies, to dump enormous quantities of cheap goods on the Indian market. Indian big business shares these fears. Small labor‐​intensive industries are even more at risk. In 2017, China exported $68 billion of industrial goods to India while importing only $16 billion (mostly raw materials like iron ore and cotton).20



The SJM has run campaigns against cheap Chinese imports and helped launch antidumping suits on items such as electronics, steel, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fishing nets, and electrical equipment. Of the 370 antidumping suits ending with the Indian authorities, 220 relate to Chinese goods. The SJM has influenced the government’s decisions to oppose new rules on e‐​commerce and insist on the right to high agricultural tariffs in the WTO. The SJM disagreed strongly with two of Modi’s star economic appointees, central bank governor Raghuram Rajan (formerly chief economist of the IMF) and Columbia University economist Arvind Panagariya (appointed chief of a government think tank called Niti Aayog). It viewed them as excessively favoring free trade and foreign investment and had a role in their exit. The SJM was critical of the few free trade agreements that India had signed, claiming that these helped foreign exporters much more than Indian ones, and has so far succeeded in thwarting new free trade agreements. The SJM and BKS (the farmers’ affiliate of the party) have succeeded in preventing trials for genetically modified crops. The RSS has influenced the government’s decision to greatly expand price controls on medicines and medical appliances, and on hospital fees. Many such illiberal ideas coexist uneasily with liberal reforms in Modi’s government.21



Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 promising “minimum government, maximum governance.” This misled optimists to believe he was a liberal free trader. In fact, he was only an incremental liberalizer, as became evident in the measured pace of his reforms. He was willing to reverse gears when it seemed likely to pay political dividends.



By “minimum government” he merely meant a reduction in red tape and harassment by corrupt bureaucrats, not a reduced role for the government in the economy. His most important reforms include a Goods and Services Tax to unify and rationalize the vast jungle of indirect tax rates previously levied by state and central governments on different goods and services. His Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code promises to end the old practice of industrial cronies evergreening loans (i.e., constantly rolling over loans that could not be serviced) from public‐​sector banks. His _jan dhan yojana_ (a plan to provide personal bank accounts for every household) has succeeded in opening bank accounts for almost the whole population, making it feasible for government entitlements to be deposited directly in individual bank accounts, avoiding the corruption and delays of earlier schemes. He has ended subsidies on gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as price controls on most petroleum products. Voters believe he is the only politician at all serious about tackling black money, which is why they did not penalize him in subsequent state elections for the disruption caused by his demonetization of high‐​value notes in November 2016. High‐​value notes were deemed not to be legal tender and had to be exchanged for new currency notes at banks, the aim being to identify and indict people with large amounts of black money in the form of hoarded cash.



However, Modi has moved only slowly on liberalizing the markets for land, labor, and capital. India’s quasi‐​bankrupt state electricity sector remains deep in the red. No privatization has taken place, and a proposal to privatize Air India was linked to so many conditions that no bids were received.22



Modi’s election campaign in 2014 promised good jobs for all, with special emphasis on jobs in manufacturing. His industrial policy coined the slogan, “Make in India.” He emphasized the need to promote and nurture small‐​business owners, who also happen to constitute the BJP’s core support. He created a new government agency called the Mudra Bank to refinance loans to micro, small, and medium‐​sized enterprises (MSMEs). He also created a new Ministry of MSMEs to advocate their cause more strongly than the Ministry of Industry, which tends to focus on big business.



Economic growth in Modi’s first four years in office has been around 7 percent per year, which looks good by international standards yet is well below the rate India achieved in the 2000s. The great computer software boom of the 2000s has run its course, and no new growth champions are in sight. Industrial growth has been tepid, barely 5 percent per year in Modi’s four years, though it is now picking up. Industrial woes have led to massive nonperforming loans that threaten to drown public‐​sector banks. Exports have fared poorly, and the 2017–2018 level ($302.8 billion) was below the peak ($312 billion) achieved in 2013–2014.23



Agriculture has been a problem area, with the media highlighting many farmer suicides. Under Modi, India suffered major droughts in 2015–2016 and 2016–2017. The rains then returned, but global agricultural prices started falling, hitting Indian farmers, most of whom farm just one or two hectares (2.5–5 acres) and have a limited ability to absorb shocks.



India has always viewed agricultural protection as essential to assuage rural distress; other safety nets are so riddled with corruption, sloth, and delay as to be ineffective. For this reason, India has always opposed agricultural opening up in the WTO, even while liberalizing other fields since 1991. Modi has followed the same policy. After world agricultural prices fell in 2017, he increased import duties on a wide range of agricultural goods. The import duty on wheat was doubled to 20 percent. An import duty of 30 percent was imposed on chickpeas and other lentils in 2017 and was raised to 40 percent in 2018. The duty on edible oils was raised to the 25–40-percent range, and sugar duties doubled to 100 percent in February 2018.



Agrarian distress, lackluster industrial growth, export stagnation, and automation have combined to create stress in the Indian labor market. Good formal‐​sector jobs are growing but not fast enough to quickly absorb millions of educated unemployed. This has disappointed many who had looked to Modi as a champion job creator. In his home state of Gujarat, the Patels—the dominant rural caste—have launched a massive campaign for getting a quota in government jobs. The law already provides for job quotas for Dalits (a caste once called “untouchables”), tribes folk, and backward classes. Patels cannot by any stretch of the imagination be called backward; they include the largest landowners and businessmen. Historically, they graduated from agriculture to industry and trade and have shown little desire to enter government service.



The situation has now changed dramatically. In 2015, Hardik Patel, a 20 year old with no political backing or experience, attracted record crowds when he started campaigning for a job quota for Patels. His associates say that the old path from farming to small business ownership has been blocked because cheap Chinese imports of a wide range of goods have decimated small businesses. Similar agitations by dominant rural castes have occurred in several other states: by Jats in the state of Haryana, by Marathas in Maharashtra, and by Ahoms in Assam. These are clear signs of massive disgruntlement among the aspiring classes that voted Modi into power.24



When Indian Railways, India’s national railway system, advertised 90,000 posts being vacated by retiring staff, it received no less than 25 million applications.25 Amroha district in the state of Uttar Pradesh advertised job vacancies for 114 posts for sweepers, who keep the streets, drains, and other infrastructure clean. These jobs traditionally have been considered too filthy to be done by any but the lowest Dalit caste. The district received a whopping 119,000 applications, some from MBAs and engineers. More than 500,000 people, including college graduates, applied for 3,250 sweeper posts in Kanpur municipality.



The formal sector accounts for only 15 percent of all jobs, while informal jobs lack decent pay or security, and so even the lowliest government jobs are eagerly sought. Some recent employment indicators suggest that job growth in the formal sector has indeed improved, and real wages have been rising. But the shortage of quality jobs remains a major issue, especially among the educated unemployed.26



India is the largest importer of defense equipment in the world. One of Modi’s aims on coming into office was to boost defense production and accompanying jobs. This is typically done for national security reasons and is not usually viewed as a form of protectionism, though it could be called that. Earlier, almost all defense production was done by the public sector. Modi has greatly increased the role of private‐​sector companies. These have partnered with foreign arms manufacturers to gain expertise in how to make everything from ammunition to sophisticated fighter planes, missiles, and submarines. However, defense contracts continue to be awarded at a sluggish pace.27



Thanks to its historically inward‐​looking policies, red tape, and high corporate tax rates, India has failed to become part of the global value chains that today are spread across Asia (the one exception being the auto industry). India has become a massive importer of electronics, especially cellphones and computers. The Modi government wants to get into such value chains and has offered a capital subsidy of up to 40 percent for setting up silicon semiconductor wafer fabrication plants. Even this has proved insufficient to attract investment.28



The government has levied import duties on a wide range of electronic items to encourage domestic electronics production. The vast majority of cellphones used to be imported, but now most are assembled locally. To increase value addition, the Modi government has decreed what it calls a phased manufacturing program (PMP). This seeks to use import duties and informal political pressure to get top electronics firms to find local vendors to make components. A start was made in 2016–2017, with local subassembly of the charger, adapter battery pack, and headset. This was followed the next year by die‐​cut parts, microphones and receivers, keypads, and USB cables. In 2018–2019, the items incentivized by higher import duties include printed circuit boards, camera modules, connectors, and antennae. In 2019–2020, the list will include touch panels, cover glass, vibrator motors, and ringers. The protective duties have increased by up to 25 percent. The Indian Cellular Association, which includes companies like Samsung, Apple, and Micromax, estimates that the three‐​year scheme will increase local value addition to the 39–50-percent range.29



Some experts in the earlier Congress Party government preceding the Modi era were also in favor of selective protection and PMPs to ensure that India got into global value chains.30 Optimists believe that the PMPs will help create scale economies that will eventually bring down the cost of production dramatically, make import protection unnecessary, and so create a competitive world‐​class industry, exactly the way China has. However, this approach looks dangerously similar to the infant‐​industry protection that India followed for four decades in its socialist phase, with disastrous results—including the creation of a high‐​cost, uncompetitive economy. The new policy lacks any sunset clauses to ensure that protection will be temporary.



In pursuance of PMP, the government in December 2017 raised import duties by up to 20 percent on a variety of electronic items. These extended well beyond cellphone components, to TVs, microwave ovens, and digital cameras.31



As previously noted, Modi created the Mudra bank to refinance loans to small businesses, whose owners form the core of his voter support. But large bad debts in the banking system have discouraged lending to the smallest businesses. Modi has also attempted to help small businesses by cutting red tape and improving the ease of doing business. In the World Bank’s rankings for ease of doing business, India has moved up from 142nd position (out of 190 countries) in 2014 to 100th position in 2018. It is still a long way from the 50th position Modi is aiming for.32



Many small businesses and retailers used to evade excise and sales taxes and do business largely in cash to avoid getting noticed by the taxman. But this dubious form of competitiveness was hit hard by three Modi reforms. The first is the demonetization in November 2016, which aimed to catch hoarders of black money, make future tax evasion difficult, and move the economy from cash payments to digital payments, increasing tax compliance and government revenues. Demonetization devastated cash‐​based businesses because currency notes disappeared from circulation for months. It accelerated the shift toward digital payments, which was laudable for modernizing the economy but harmed the small businesses that had long flourished on cash payments and tax evasion. Many small businesses that went bust during demonetization will never come back.33



The second blow to small businesses was the launching of the aforementioned Goods and Services Tax in July 2017. This was a much‐​needed reform, debated for over a decade. It replaced the old jungle of innumerable different central and state tax rates for different items, helped eliminate check posts at state and city borders (which were notorious for corruption and delays), helped create a unified all‐​India market, and created a paper trail that greatly reduced the scope for tax evasion. The new system was inevitably accompanied by many glitches but will gradually settle down into a much improved (though still flawed) tax system. However, it hit the same small businesses that were earlier hit by demonetization, a double whammy for Modi’s core supporters.34



They suffered a third blow, in gradual fashion, with the rise of e‐​commerce. While still modest in volume compared with traditional commerce, e‐​commerce threatens the future of small retailers. Modi simply had to do something to relieve the suffering of small businesses that were so important to him politically.35



His solution is the new protectionism, exemplified by import duties on 40‐​odd items in the budget. On a TV program, a Finance Ministry official said the duties were levied on “simple” items that could easily be manufactured in India by small manufacturers. Another official in the prime minister’s office argued that India gained nothing by letting the Chinese dump simple items like plastic toys, kites, candles, clocks, and the like onto the Indian market, and protecting their domestic manufacture would not affect India’s overall competitiveness or productivity. The problem with this approach is that it has no cut‐​off point: notions of what are “simple” or “can easily be made in India” are highly subjective and can be stretched very far.36 Instead of creating world‐​class champions, it may simply create high‐​cost, uncompetitive products that hit consumers and investors. The same is true of the increase in textile import duties in July and August 2018. Even more worrisome is the appointment of a task force to reduce import dependence.



The new protectionism is not identical to the old protectionism of the socialist era. First, the old protectionism arose from fear of Western multinationals, whereas the new protectionism arises from fear of China. Second, the old protectionism focused on creating national champions in the public sector, whereas the new protectionism mostly protects private‐​sector players. Third, the old protectionism aimed for self‐​sufficiency, while the new protectionism claims it wants India to gain a foothold in global value chains. Fourth, the old protectionism claimed to be protecting infant industries till they matured. Modi’s new protectionism goes beyond global value chains to blanket protection of relatively simple manufactures, ranging from electronic components to a wide range of consumer goods. He does this simply to save jobs and small businesses, with no pretense of protecting only infant industries. This approach has something in common with the old socialist era’s reservation of 800 items for production only by small‐​scale industries. That list was whittled down in stages in the era of economic reform and disappeared in the 2000s. It now shows signs of coming back in a new tariff‐​based avatar.37



Optimists point out that the new areas protected by Modi amount to only a small fraction of India’s imports. India’s pattern of liberalization has often been two steps forward and one step back, so optimists hope the recent import duty hikes will turn out to be a blip, not a trend. They suggest it may be premature to ring alarm bells on protectionism.38



That would be a mistake. Modi is on a slippery slope that could take him much farther down the protectionist path. The problems he faces are deep seated and global. They are the same as those faced by President Trump in the United States and by politicians across the globe. As in the United States, the unemployment rate in India looks okay, and GDP growth is pretty good. But the combination of three things—fear of China, automation, and lack of good jobs—that is driving Trump’s populist protectionism is also driving Modi’s. These strong roots carry the risk that the new protectionism will worsen over time. That could reverse the huge economic gains India has made since 1991.

"**Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo RossellÃ³ has announced his resignation after days of mass street protests in the US territory.**
Mr RossellÃ³, who had only on Sunday insisted he would stay on, said he would continue working until 2 August to allow an orderly transition.
He has been at the centre of a group text message scandal that has already led two top officials to resign.
The leaked messages revealed sexist, profane and homophobic comments.
The chat, which contained 880 pages of exchanges between the governor and 11 male allies, was leaked on 13 July and led to days of protests outside the governor's mansion in San Juan.
He recorded a video statement that was broadcast on Wednesday evening.
""I announce that I will be resigning from the governor's post effective Friday, 2 August at 5pm,"" Mr RossellÃ³ said.
""I feel that to continue in this position would make it difficult for the success that I have achieved to endure,"" he added.
Mr RossellÃ³'s announcement triggered celebrations on the streets of the capital San Juan.
On Monday, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets, demanding Mr RossellÃ³'s immediate resignation.
The 40-year-old governor is leader of the New Progressive Party, a Puerto Rican political party which advocates US statehood.
Mr RossellÃ³ will be replaced by the US Caribbean island territory's Justice Secretary, Wanda VÃ¡zquez.
Ms VÃ¡zquez was next in line under the constitution because the secretary of state, who would have succeeded the governor, resigned last week as part of the texting scandal.
On Sunday, in an attempt to appease protesters, he said he would not seek re-election next year.
""I hear you,"" Mr RossellÃ³ said in a Facebook video. ""I have made mistakes and I have apologised.""
""I know that apologising is not enough,"" he added.
Mr RossellÃ³'s announcement came just hours after the leader of Puerto Rico's House of Representatives said that lawmakers were planning to commence impeachment proceedings to remove the governor.
His ousting is viewed by many as both a repudiation of the governor and a rejection of the dysfunction and corruption that has plagued the island.
Several of the texts mock victims of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017 and may have led to more than 4,000 deaths.
In one instance, Mr RossellÃ³ criticised the former Speaker of the New York City Council, Melissa Mark-Viverito, saying people should ""beat up that whore"".
When the island's chief fiscal office wrote that he was ""salivating to shoot"" the mayor of San Juan, Mr RossellÃ³ replied: ""You'd be doing me a grand favour.""
**What has been the reaction to the scandal?**
Local newspaper El Nuevo DÃ­a called on the governor to resign in its Monday editorial.
""Puerto Rico has spoken up, not only as a strong, broad and united voice, but as the right voice,"" the editorial said. ""With a gesture of nobility and humility, Governor, it is time to listen to the people. You have to resign.""
San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz said in a Twitter message on Monday: ""They can't deny it: The power is in the street.""
Singer Ricky Martin, who was targeted in the secret messages, was among those calling for the governor to resign, as well as Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and reggaeton star Bad Bunny.
""They mocked our dead, they mocked women, they mocked the LGBT community, they made fun of people with physical and mental disabilities, they made fun of obesity. It's enough. This cannot be,"" Martin said in a video on Twitter.
The island's political crisis also made headlines throughout mainland US. Many echoed the New York Times editorial board, which wrote that the ""callousness and partisan self-dealing"" exposed by the messages serve as exorbitant strain for the long-suffering island, effectively ""rubbing salt into a long-festering wound"".
""The Puerto Rican people have no use for petty political feuding,"" the New York Times wrote. ""Their territory is struggling under the weight of government corruption, incompetence and indifference. Having been failed by their leaders at every level, they are out of patience. They deserve better.""
US President Donald Trump had also called on the governor to resign."

Putting Sir Isaac Newton on the right path
Short story by Christopher Bowring
When lay global warming skeptics point out to alarmists that the recent seventeen year period of steady global temperatures invalidates their climate models which predicted runaway global warming, there is often a standard response.
‘How can you, global warming (or climate change) denier, who have no experience of climatology, dare to argue with me, a renowned expert in my field of science?’  Let us return to the England of the seventeenth century to see what is wrong with this rebuttal.

I am in Grantham in Lincolnshire.  It is a sunny day.  A respectable looking man in a wig is sitting under an apple tree.  It is Sir Isaac Newton.  I greet him.  He smiles back, but looks agitated.  ‘What is wrong?’ I ask.  ‘I have made a wonderful discovery,’ he replies.  ‘I call is my Law of Gravitation’.  ‘What does it say?’ I enquire.
‘It says that any two bodies in the universe repel each other with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance apart’.  ‘Really?’ I respond.  ‘But that is nonsense!’  ‘Nonsense?’ explodes the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.  ‘Nonsense?  How can you, a nobody, a nonentity, dare to question the mind of the greatest living scientist in the world?’
‘Sir, I refute your law quite simply’.  And with that I take an apple from the tree and drop it on Sir Isaac’s head.

"President Trump, asked by an interviewer on Saturday why he respected President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia even though he is “a killer,” seemed to equate Mr. Putin’s actions with those of the United States. “You got a lot of killers,” he told the interviewer, Bill O’Reilly of Fox News. “What, you think our country’s so innocent?” Mr. Trump has long expressed his admiration for the Russian leader’s strength. But his willingness to seemingly draw a moral equivalence to actions by Mr. Putin, who has brutally suppressed dissent by eliminating political enemies, led to an eruption on social media. Many asked how conservatives would have reacted had President Barack Obama, or other Democrats, compared American actions to Mr. Putin’s. The exchange surfaced on Saturday night in an excerpt from the interview, which is to be broadcast on Sunday before the Super Bowl. What Mr. Trump was specifically referring to or whether there was added context that came after his comment was not immediately clear based on the excerpt that was made available. In the interview, Mr. Trump was asked if he respected Mr. Putin. He said he did, adding that he respected “a lot of people, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to get along with him. ” Mr. Trump continued: “He’s a leader of his country. I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS  —   which is a major fight  —   and Islamic terrorism all over the world  —   major fight  —   that’s a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea. It’s very possible that I won’t. ” Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to mend ties with Moscow has raised questions over his administration’s commitment to maintaining sanctions against Russia for its involvement in the fighting and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. He said he was willing to work with Kiev and Moscow to resolve a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, after a telephone call on Saturday with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, Reuters reported. The call was the first direct contact between the two leaders since Mr. Trump’s inauguration. “We will work with Ukraine, Russia and all other parties involved to help them restore peace along the border,” Mr. Trump said in a White House statement. His comments contrasted with those of Nikki R. Haley, the new American ambassador to the United Nations, who on Thursday condemned Russia for its “aggressive actions” in eastern Ukraine. She said the United States wanted improved relations with Russia, but added that American sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea would remain in place. She said “the dire situation” demanded “clear and strong condemnation” of Russia’s actions. In another excerpt from the Fox interview, Mr. Trump was asked whether it was irresponsible for him to say that three million illegal immigrants voted in the election while lacking the evidence to support that assertion. “When you see illegals, people that are not citizens and they’re on the registration rolls,” he started to say before shifting. “Look, Bill, we can be babies, but you take a look at the registration, you have illegals, you have dead people, you have this  —   it’s really a bad situation, it’s really bad. ”"
"Both the Scottish and UK governments have published new contributions on the energy and independence debate in recent days. Energy Secretary Ed Davey visited Edinburgh to coincide with the Department for Energy and Climate Change’s 100-page “command paper” on the subject.  It was far more substantial than the Scottish government’s 11-page publication, which was released two days before. For the Scottish media this was a headline news item, with both Davey and Fergus Ewing, his Scottish counterpart, giving interviews.  The UK government paper presents detailed arguments and cost estimates for the historic, current and future benefits to Scotland of being part of an integrated GB energy market. It emphasises that Scottish businesses and consumers enjoy substantial net benefits from being part of the UK. For example, the costs of renewable energy subsidies are supported by all UK electricity bill payers, and almost 30% of the total goes to wind farms and other generators based in Scotland. This is despite the fact that Scotland accounts for only around 10% of UK electricity sales.  DECC’s report points to similar benefits from supporting Scottish electricity grid investment (key for getting renewable energy to users further south) and subsidising remote and off-grid Scottish consumers.  As costs grow in the next few years to meet policy targets for decarbonisation and renewables expansion, DECC estimates that Scottish consumers would pay between £38 and £189 extra per head each year on their energy bills by 2020 if the country was independent. Other costs and risks of independence are also set out: the threat posed to major Scottish-based but UK-funded public investments such as the Green Investment Bank, which is based in Edinburgh; and the proposed Peterhead carbon capture and storage demonstration plant – one of two in the UK earmarked for support through the UK Government’s £1 billion support fund (the other is in Yorkshire).  DECC also notes a broader problem of attracting capital for a newly independent small country – touching on the bigger issue of currency stability in the absence of a shared pound.  The Scottish government’s statement is not a systematic and detailed counter to the UK government’s arguments. Instead it describes how Whitehall has mismanaged energy policy.  The Scottish government has to tread a delicate line here, arguing the failure of current arrangements while also noting successes such as the growth of the Scottish renewables sector and continued oil and gas revenues.  The main points of criticism are underinvestment and the looming capacity crunch in UK electricity supply; Conservative/Lib Dem divisions on energy policy leading to loss of investor confidence; and the UK’s costly commitment to new nuclear power stations.  The Scottish government claims its own approach to energy policy has been “clear and consistent”. In contrast to DECC’s arguments about the subsidy benefits to Scotland from GB market integration, this report talks about how the UK relies on Scotland to “keep the lights on” by acting as its energy reserve.  Read alongside each other, the Scottish paper is more selective and overtly political. There has been a lack of detail in the Scottish government’s statements on energy matters and independence to date, though that may change with the imminent report from the Scottish Regulatory Commission on Energy Regulation.  As with the currency question, the Scottish government essentially argues for continuity after independence: continued operation of an integrated GB market reflecting common interests in energy supply security and the growth of low carbon generation.  The UK government argues that independence would lead to losing the benefits of integration, with post-independence governments and regulators on each side of the border required by statute to serve self-interest rather than common interests.     Admittedly, this ignores wider factors. DECC argues the case for the benefits of scale and integration but at the same time the UK faces a possible withdrawal from the EU after the 2015 general election.  For the Scottish government, the largely unanswered question is: “What is Plan B if the UK government refuses to recognise the common interests in an energy partnership after independence?”  As with independence matters more generally, undecided voters are left frustrated by the absence in much of the public debate of a balanced and thorough analysis of the claims and counter claims. This piece is one of two that The Conversation has published on this subject today. The other can be read here. "
"Trillions of dollars will be invested by governments in reviving their economies over the next two or three years. If those dollars are well spent, ensuringlow-carbon, nature-restoring prosperity, we have a real chance of avoiding runaway climate change and ecosystem collapse. If they’re spent on taking us back to pre-coronavirus days, we’re screwed. The climate’s screwed. The planet’s screwed. And all future generations are screwed. It’s as simple – and as binary – as that.  This year was meant to be the year of major breakthroughs in addressing the climate emergency and the biodiversity crisis. It will be neither. It will live in the minds of most people as the Year of Covid-19. And rightly so. But those twin emergencies of climate and collapsing ecosystems haven’t gone away while we’ve been straining humankind’s every sinew to mitigate the impacts of the deadliest public health threat in 100 years. Yet what made the climate emergency and the biodiversity crisis so urgent before Covid-19 guarantees that they will be even more daunting and even more disruptive at the end of this traumatic year – with a whole 12 months lost in terms of political engagement and leadership. Ignore all the over-excited coverage there will no doubt be at the end of this year celebrating a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 10%, towns and cities temporarily purged of the horror of toxic air quality (killing far more people, by the way, every year, than Covid-19 will), and nature back in our lives through the magic of birdsong and wild creatures returning to our denatured urban landscapes. Look on all that as a short-lived respite, a beautiful but evanescent manifestation of how things could be, for citizens the world over. All those silver linings will rapidly disappear unless we start doing things very differently. A mighty choir of voices (from Prince Charles and Greenpeace to countless multinationals and academics) are now singing from the rooftops to remind our politicians that we have a glorious opportunity to bring forward lasting improvements that would have been unimaginable even six months ago. Their mandate now is crystal clear: restore purchasing power; create new jobs; prioritise the least well-off – and do all of that in ways that simultaneously make it possible for us to deliver climate stability and a thriving planet. So is there any indication that the UK government is thinking in those terms? The short answer is “possibly”. Beyond the standard waffle from the prime minister (“We owe it to future generations to ‘build back better’ and base our recovery on solid foundations, including a fairer, greener and more resilient global economy”), there have been much stronger declarations of intent from both the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury, with specific talk of a “green industrial revolution” to create tens of thousands of new jobs. Even the Department for Transport has been getting in on the act, announcing plans for 2,500 electric charging points along motorways and A-roads by 2030, as well as a £250m active travel fund to support the development of pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements and cycle- and bus-only corridors – a down-payment, apparently, on a much bigger programme under consideration. But all this is very small beer indeed compared with the plans of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to spend up to £27bn over the next five years to expand Britain’s road network – locking us into decades of carbon-intensive car dependency at precisely the time when every company in the country is developing post-coronavirus work and travel planning, specifically to reduce car use and commuting, doubling down on more flexible, tech-enabled ways of working. So just flip it, Rishi! Transport is the UK’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Hang on to that scale of ambition by making the £27bn available to our cities and towns to invest in cycle lanes, better pedestrian facilities and improved public transport – as cities such as Bristol and London are already starting to do. This will deliver jobs at the local level (especially in many of our northern cities, which one assumes Boris Johnson hasn’t yet entirely forgotten about), cleaner air and improved health (reducing the burden on the NHS) and potentially massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 10 years.  Similar, massive benefits are available if the government chooses to invest in a nationwide housing retrofit programme, a pre-existing commitment that has come and gone on several occasions, simply because no previous government ever put its money where its cynically gabby mouth was. As the Green New Deal group has shown, as well as the government’s own Infrastructure Commission, an ambitious retrofit programme means jobs in every constituency (many of them available to young people staring out on a blighted, jobless post-coronavirus world), a huge uptake in construction skills and trades, a rapid reduction in the kind of fuel poverty that has blighted the lives of tens of millions of people (simultaneously costing the NHS billions every year), with significant reductions in greenhouse gas emission by the end of the decade.  Once the Treasury opens its mind to the potential of a far-reaching Green New Deal, we should also be borrowing unashamedly from President Roosevelt’s original New Deal back in the 1930s by creating a 21st-century equivalent of his Conservation Corps to help restore this nation’s desperately degraded environment. It’s only six months since the major political parties were trying to out-green each other by committing to massive tree-planting programmes in their election manifestos. Since then, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has pretty much sat on its hands. Nothing is ever quite as “shovel-ready” as advocates would have us believe, but local transport solutions, housing retrofits and nature-climate solutions could all be brought forward, at speed and at scale, in ways that would be hugely popular with citizens across the country. There is now not one good reason why this government shouldn’t soon be announcing one of the most ambitious rescue packages anywhere in the world. • Jonathon Porritt is an environmentalist and author.

"It is difficult to make a conclusive link between human-caused climate change and the record drought in California, record freezes in parts of Canada and the US, Britain’s wettest-ever winter and Australia’s hottest summer. But there’s no doubt that they have pushed climate change back up the agenda, and will add pressure to the need for a deal at the Paris climate talks next year. Directly experiencing such extreme weather can make a (small) difference to public sentiment too. Researchers at Cardiff University found that those affected by flooding in Wales in 2012 were more likely to believe climate change is happening now than those who hadn’t (74% versus 65%). There is similar recent research in the US, which reveals that for every degree the temperature rises above the 12-month average, there is a 7% increase in belief in climate change, especially amongst those without strong convictions. Cold snaps can have the opposite effect. But an aspect of this weird weather that gets less discussion is how the widespread uncertainties around the nature of such extreme weather, and of climate science itself, hand golden opportunities to those sceptical of climate change to spread doubt. A classic example is the recent debate on the BBC Today Programme between Lord Lawson of the Global Warming Policy Foundation and Professor Sir Brian Hoskins of Imperial College. Lawson managed to use the phrase “nobody knows” three times in the first minute, and criticised mainstream climate scientists for “pretending they know when they don’t”. Lawson himself was widely criticised for misunderstanding the science and misrepresenting the scientists. But the general public often misunderstand uncertainty, interpreting it as a complete rather than relative lack of knowledge. Some scientists have found it helpful to make the distinction between what might be called “school science” (as popularised by the likes of Brian Cox), which is a source of solid facts and reliable understanding, and “research science” where uncertainty is ingrained and is often what drives the direction of further investigation. So when sceptics stress the “nobody knows” narrative, they are misrepresenting the existence of any uncertainty at all as meaning that, for example, no action to reduce carbon emissions is necessary. It’s the nature of climate science that there are lots of uncertainties, but this doesn’t mean scientists know nothing, or are simply speculating. But it can be difficult to do this in a sound bite.  Rather, they try to assess what degree of certainty they have about different aspects of the science. For example, authors of the IPCC reports spend a lot of time trying to assess the degree of uncertainty and level of confidence they have in each of their statements. These are difficult concepts to get across to the general public and to legislators. Take for example the headline finding of the last IPCC report in September that the authors are now “95% certain that humans are mostly to blame for temperatures that have climbed since 1951”. On the day the report was published, one IPCC author was asked by a BBC presenter: “so what do the other 5% of scientists believe?” In other words, there was a confusion between what the authors of the IPCC report collectively had concluded was true with a very high degree of certainty, and what percentage of scientists were in agreement with the statement. For scientists, 95% certainty is taken as a gold standard, likened to the degree of confidence scientists have in decades’ worth of evidence that cigarettes cause lung cancer. So the same degree of confidence holds for something like melting of Arctic sea ice or the amount the world has warmed, but there is less confidence in for example explaining the lack of increase in global surface temperatures since 1998. Scientists and journalists need to get better at explaining the way these uncertainties work. They don’t know everything but they know enough to be able to assess the risks of not acting. During the Today programme the presenter also implicitly introduced the concept of risk management, comparing 95% scientific certainty to a 95% chance, or risk. With high odds of 95% – or even equal odds of 50% – it would seem to make sense to take action to lower the risk. Framing the climate challenge as risk assessment has been gaining considerable traction among some politicians. Lawson’s response to the question was to argue that even if there is a problem of global warming, it will have only marginal effects. It is worth asking how he can be so certain of this low likelihood, what his level of confidence is and on what science it is based. This is what would be required by any risk assessment: he would have to show how he had come to this risk evaluation and why he was so confident in it, when so many other scientists are saying the impact could be huge. In any case, merely saying “nobody knows” doesn’t make his case."
"The phrase “Natural History” is linked in most people’s minds today with places that use the phrase: the various Natural History Museums, or television programmes narrated so evocatively by renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough. As times have changed, used in its traditional sense the phrase now has an almost archaic ring to it, perhaps recalling the Victorian obsession with collecting butterflies or beetles, rocks or fossils, or stuffed birds and animals, or perhaps the 18th century best-seller, Gilbert White’s The Natural History of Selborne. Once natural history was part of what was equally archaically called natural philosophy, encompassing the enquiry into all aspects of the natural world that we inhabit, from the tiniest creature to the largest, to molecules and materials, to planets and stars in outer space. These days, we call it science. Natural history specifically strives to study and understand organisms within their environment, which would these days equate to the disciplines of ecology or conservation.  In a recent article in the journal BioScience, a group of 17 scientists decry what they see as a shift away from this traditional learning (once typical parts of biology degrees) that taught students about organisms: where they live, what they eat, how they behave, their variety and relationships to their ecosystems in which they live. Partly by the promise of a course-specific career, and perhaps partly because of poorly taught courses that can emphasise rote learning, students are enticed into more exciting fields such as biotechnology or evolutionary developmental biology (“evo-devo”), where understanding an organism is less important than understanding the function of a particular organ or limb. But their challenge is not simply a revolt against the new: they note that 75% of infectious diseases that affect humans, such as bird flu, cholera and rabies, have links to other animals at some point in their lifecycle. By understanding more about these other creatures and how the disease affects them – their natural history – we are better placed to tackle the effects of the disease on us. The authors make the same argument for other fields of study: useful sustainable agricultural practices such as companion planting, crop rotation, and pest control are making a comeback after having been largely discarded under modern farming methods. A more thorough understanding of fish lifecycles and surveys of their population could prevent disastrous fishery collapse, such as happened with walleye pollock in the Bering Sea. And the decision to rigorously suppress forest fires in the western US – on the basis of forest management principles imported from different places with different species – now costs US$1 billion a year, a cost that could have been avoided if the important natural role of fire in the ecosystem had been recognised. It is a fact that at university level we produce fewer and fewer field-based biologists – experts who know and understand the range and variety of creatures found in real world environments, and how they live. Everything is becoming increasingly modular and based on computer models in labs as biology becomes more technologically driven.  Many of our greatest natural historians probably caught the bug precisely because of fieldwork excursions at school – the wonders of nature seen in samples taken after pond-dipping, for example. How often does that happen now? (Due to health and safety restrictions, curriculum pressures on teachers, or the absence of staff with sufficient knowledge or interest, or indeed all three, it may not happen at all.) Scientists increasingly want to analyse data to look for trends, connections, and signs of the bigger picture. But where does this data come from? From field collections. And crucially, this data is dependent upon the fidelity of records – such as those held in such natural history museums, no less. Who are or were these collectors, what is their level of expertise, how reliable their record-keeping? And who assesses the quality of such data? The answer depends on whether such expertise is valued, intellectually and economically, because only then will career paths emerge that will attract the future Darwins, Huxleys, Tinbergens, Fords, Southwoods, Krebs and Davies. Sir David Attenborough and Gerald Durrell have done wonderful jobs to pique our interest (and our conscience) when it comes to the natural world, and the BBC’s programmes such as Springwatch also play their part. But where are the careers for the next generation? The authors aim to provoke and have a serious point to make. But theirs is a small voice within a deafened and distracted world. We need to realise that it is not just the data-wranglers, modellers and manipulators, but genuine expertise and enthusiasm that is needed on the ground. Keen amateur natural historians are fine, but they are not a career path for today’s future scientists. Only by expending more effort (and money) on ensuring there is training and careers for the next natural historians and biologists can we be sure that we can rely on their expertise to guide future conservation, management or policy decisions that could avoid us repeating past mistakes. Without new naturalists, our museums with their extraordinarily rich collections of creatures and much more besides will appear as increasingly archaic, pointless stockpiles that fewer and fewer people appreciate."

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan secured near dictatorial powers in the recent constitutional referendum. Yet all is not well for the would‐​be sultan. He predicted that he’d win 60 percent or more of the vote, but barely broke 51 percent after rigging the ballot, destroying a free press, and criminalizing criticism. The opposition is divided and broken, but Erdogan increasingly is feared rather than loved. His reign may be shorter than expected.



The Republic of Turkey was created amid the wreckage of the Ottoman Empire by Mustafa Kemal, a military officer later anointed with the name Ataturk, or father of the Turks. The state eventually evolved into an authoritarian democracy, with heavy‐​handed military interference which limited political and religious liberty. Coups were common, with civilian politicians often ending up in prison and on occasion on the gallows,



Islamic parties were routinely ousted from the political process and Erdogan, then Istanbul’s mayor, was jailed for reading an Islamic poem in public. Secular liberals weren’t safe either: to publicly criticize the philosophy of “Kemalism” risked job loss and imprisonment.



In the early 2000s the country was ruled by an unstable nationalist coalition. Erdogan led the relaunch of the principal Islamic party, winning the 2002 election. He became prime minister the following year. A series of election victories for the Justice and Development Party (AKP) followed.



Erdogan liberalized the economy, spurring growth which especially benefited the rural poor. He sought peace with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, and expanded Kurdish participation in Turkish society. He revamped Turkish laws to meet requirements for European Union membership. In 2008 he barely avoided a legal attempt to outlaw the AKP, but rebounded to systematically dismantle the authoritarian “deep state,” returning the military to its barracks.



Although his power base was conservative, traditional, and religious Turks, he won the backing of liberals, secularists, and women. Journalists enjoyed greater freedom and Europeans believed he could bring Turkey into their continent’s orbit. People prospered. Erdogan appeared to be creating the moderate Islamic democracy that Turkey always had been said to represent, even when it was in reality a secular autocracy.



Alas, many observers, this writer included, overestimated Erdogan’s commitment to a Western model. What looked too good to be true turned out to be so. Journalist Claire Berlinski contends that the AKP was illiberal from the start, though in ways the West chose to ignore. However, Erdogan was moving the country in a freer direction, which even Turkish liberals saw as positive.



Analysts debate why Erdogan changed, but the best guess may be that his ambition fully flowered after he’d cemented his electoral dominance and defanged the military. He apparently meant it when he said “Democracy is like a streetcar. You ride it until you arrive at your destination and then you step off.” Once he felt unchallengeable, he abandoned democracy.





The United States cannot fix the world. But Washington should not ignore the betrayal of fundamental values by supposed allies.



Around 2010 or so Erdogan began using his authority in a more illiberal fashion, punishing academics, businessmen, and journalists, in particular, who challenged him. He went to extraordinary lengths to not just break the military’s ability to intervene in politics but destroy individual military officers, accusing them of participating in fantastically crazed conspiracies (some of which he repudiated years later).



Erdogan prosecuted even his most harmless critics, including children, for insulting him on social media. He morphed from an ambitious politician seeking to silence those who could hinder his rise into an egocentric narcissist outraged that anyone would tar his dignity. If Kemalism was receding, Ottomanism was advancing.



His political brutality grew along with challenges to his rule. In 2013 Erdogan’s government was hit with serious corruption allegations from police and prosecutors apparently linked to Hizmat, the movement headed by Muslim teacher and cleric Fethullah Gulen. Erdogan and Gulen had been allies, but as differences emerged their partnership dissolved. Secure in his control of the state, Erdogan purged the legal system of those thought to be disloyal to him.



Two years later the AKP lost its parliamentary majority. Erdogan responded by abandoning his conciliatory policy toward the PKK and hyping security issues. Some critics saw his hand behind alleged terrorist attacks by the PKK and ISIS. He impeded attempts to form a coalition government and forced another election five months later, which restored his party’s majority.



Along the way he purged the AKP of officials insufficiently subservient to him. In 2014 he effectively forced Abdullah Gul, his predecessor as president (also prime minister and foreign minister), into retirement. Two years later Erdogan pushed out his activist successor, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Others similarly fell afoul of their onetime mentor.



Thus, democracy was in dismal shape, though not quite dead, last July when some members of the military attempted to stage a coup. Most of his critics joined his supporters in rallying against the putsch. Although it is very unlikely that Erdogan organized the effort as a black flag operation or knew of it and allowed it to occur, as charged by some, he called it “a great gift from god.” Erdogan then treated the failed coup as his Reichstag Fire, allowing him to aggrandize his own power.



Before the coup even had been suppressed Erdogan charged that Gulen was the mastermind. The claim was far‐​fetched: the aging cleric had lived in rural Pennsylvania for years. Those who struck at Erdogan included some Gulenists, but were a varied lot. In fact, the military had long resisted Gulenists’ efforts to join its higher ranks.



A committee of the United Kingdom’s parliament as well as German and European intelligence officials reported that they found no evidence backing Erdogan’s claim. Rep. Devin Nunes, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, was similarly dismissive. The plotters apparently were responding to leaked plans for another purge of the military by the AKP. At this stage reliable evidence is almost impossible to obtain: mass arrests based on flimsy pretexts and highlighted by bouts of torture irredeemably taint Turkey’s legal and judicial processes.



After the coup’s collapse Erdogan won emergency powers from parliament. He closed publications and jailed journalists—more now languish in prison than in any other country, including China and Russia. He charged opposition leaders and lawmakers who had opposed the coup with backing terrorism. He restricted freedom of assembly and punished critics. He ordered private companies to fire employees and had the latter’s bank accounts frozen. He closed private schools and civic organizations. He replaced university administrators and dismissed professors. He fired government officials.



The extent of the ongoing purge is extraordinary—so far some 47,000 have been imprisoned, 113,000 detained at least temporarily, and another 140,000 or more ousted from public sector jobs and banned from civil life more generally. The equally devastating private firings go uncounted. For many people Turkey now is an open‐​air prison.



Prosecution was nominally tied to the coup attempt, but no evidence of involvement in the coup was necessary for the government to fire or arrest any individual, seize or dissolve any organization, or otherwise penalize anyone anywhere. The vaguest connection to Hizmat, including attending a Gulenist school, owning a Gulenist book, or frequenting a business founded by Gulenists, was taken as evidence of guilt. Possessing a one dollar bill became a supposed sign that one was a Gulenist conspirator.



The Turkish authorities did not bother attempting to demonstrate those punished had anything to do with the coup. Nor did Erdogan only target Gulenists. Anyone critical of him or linked to someone critical of him was at risk. Those who criticized the brutal war against the Kurds or denounced Erdogan for his calculated destruction of civil and political liberty also were arrested and accused of terrorism. On the rare occasion when judges dismissed dubious charges, the government often rearrested the defendants on new charges and dismissed the jurists.



Those fired, even from private businesses, found it difficult if not impossible to find other work. Many were shunned by friends and family and left dependent on handouts for their survival. People not charged with any crime were prevented from leaving the country. Those who fled before the authorities targeted them had their passports cancelled, marooning them in foreign nations. Unlike other Turkish expatriates, they were barred from voting in the recent referendum. Some Americans were caught in the dragnet.



Indeed, Turkish prosecutors announced that they were investigating several Americans for their alleged roles as closet Gulenists and coup plotters. On the list: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, former CIA director John Brennan, former CIA deputy director David Cohen, former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, Turkic American Alliance President Faruk Taban, the Wilson Center’s Henri Barkey, American Enterprise Institute scholar Michael Rubin, political analyst Graham Fuller, columnist Ralph Peters, and almost a dozen others. If Erdogan was not deadly serious the “case” could be dismissed as self‐​parody. His apparent paranoia brings to mind Joseph Stalin.



After spending several months tracking down most anyone brave or foolish enough to oppose his rule, Erdogan should have felt secure. The rule of law was dead. An independent police and judiciary had vanished. The elected parliament was supine. A free press was destroyed. No meaningful checks or balances remained on Erdogan and his government.



Even before the referendum Freedom House rated Turkey as only “partly free” and moving in the wrong direction. The group found that Ankara performed poorly on political rights and worse on civil liberties; in terms of the press Turkey was unfree. Freedom House cited multiple examples when constitutional protections were ignored and violated. In practice, there evidently was no effective limit on Erdogan’s power.



Similar was the State Department’s assessment, which ran 75 pages. Among the problems cited were “inconsistent access to due process,” “government interference with freedom of expression,” “inadequate protection of civilians,” and a potpourri of issues including a climate of fear in court, overcrowded prisons, and violence against religious minorities.



Nevertheless, murdering democracy was not enough for Erdogan. His ambition was reflected by his $615 million presidential residence; with 1150 rooms it rivals the homes of the Ottoman sultans, such as Istanbul’s Topkapi Palace. After taking over the presidency, a position of little formal power, he had proposed changing Turkey from a parliamentary system into a hyper‐​presidential government, akin to that dominated by Russia’s Vladimir Putin.



After the coup attempt he coopted the nationalist opposition and placed a package of 18 constitutional amendments on the ballot to expand presidential power. The vote would merely ratify reality and few imagined that he could lose. Even if he lost, few imagined that he would retreat. As in 2015, it was believed, he would simply concoct another security crisis, justifying another ballot, this time backed by even more extreme tactics.



As he prepared for the referendum he declared: “If we were not sure of [winning] we would not have embarked on this business.” Yet he left little to chance, rigging a process which European observers said created an “uneven playing field” and “fell short” of international standards. The Stockholm Center for Freedom cited “widespread and systematic election fraud, violent incidents and scandalous steps taken by the biased Supreme Board of Election.”



The entire campaign occurred during a state of emergency with the government doing everything it could to hype a climate of fear. Several Kurdish areas under military control mysteriously returned majorities for Erdogan. Opponents were intimidated, criticism was muted, opposition rallies were barred, critics were accused of promoting terrorism, impartial electoral information was absent, election monitors were prohibited, opposition demonstrators were beaten, positive press coverage was forced, and displaced Kurds were prevented from voting.



The election commission allowed the counting of up to 2.5 million uncertified ballots, an open invitation to massive vote fraud. Multiple examples of intimidation and cheating were reported and occasionally filmed. Election monitors were often evicted and sometimes beaten.



Despite all of this, the measure barely passed. The 60 percent of which Erdogan originally spoke likely would have been against him in a fair ballot. He and other embarrassed Turkish officials immediately declared the issue closed.



While some of Erdogan’s critics hoped that the narrow victory would humble him, he sounded irritated, even angry. His paranoia likely flaring, he insisted to an end to “unnecessary discussions.” The debate “is now over,” he insisted, and “We are not going to stop.” Which offered a foretaste of what was likely to come.



Some observers still believed that after constitutionalizing his authority and trampling his enemies underfoot, Erdogan might return to a reform path, perhaps reaching out to opposition forces and restarting peace talks with the PKK. However, Erdogan’s reform persona disappeared years, not months, ago. Even before the attempted coup his repression was equal parts petty and vicious. The vast majority of those penalized since last July posed no threat to Turkey or him. Politics has become very personal. Moreover, the referendum’s result undoubtedly scared him. Eric Edelman of SAIS, who served as U.S. ambassador to Turkey, warned that “the combination of empowerment and paranoia is likely to be a toxic mix.”



After the vote Erdogan’s subordinates took the lead. For instance, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, chosen by Ergodan last year precisely for his lack of independence, asserted: “Against the traitors and dividers, we stood united as a nation.” He promised that “Our struggle with internal and external enemies will be intensified.”



There certainly was no hint of conciliation in the government’s response to demonstrations against the rigged referendum, which Yildirim termed “unacceptable.” Protestors were arrested, many in dawn raids as if they were terrorists. The government charged Abdurrahman Atalay, a political activist who filed an election appeal, with “inciting hatred.” Law, courts, constitution, indeed most everything in Turkey, now is subordinate to Erdogan’s wishes.



Still, the referendum, by highlighting Erdogan’s willingness to subvert the vote of all Turks, may end up undermining his legitimacy. He looks like any other dictator wannabe seeking a democratic gloss for his oppressive rule. His claim to represent the Turkish people is further tarnished.



Even some AKP members and former supporters balked at his reach for dictatorial power. Istanbul, where he served as mayor, voted against him for the first time. He lost Ankara, the seat of government, Izmir, the third most populous city, and virtually every other major urban area. Even the Istanbul district, Uskudar, in which he owns a home and where he voted, came out against him.



These divisions almost certainly will deepen. Moreover, the economy has been deteriorating, threatening what many people view as his government’s greatest achievement. With no peaceful means to oppose Erdogan, some of his opponents might eventually turn to violence. The only good news may be that it won’t be easy for Erdogan to intensify the repression.



Turkey’s saga of liberty lost is not only a tragedy for the Turkish people. It undermines the country’s relationship with the West. Of course, Erdogan’s Turkey is not America’s only authoritarian ally. But Erdogan hasn’t just destroyed freedom for Turks. He’s turned his country into something other than an ally of the U.S. and Europe.



Obviously, as a sovereign nation Turkey is free to change direction—in fact, public opinion long has been among the most hostile to the U.S. But then Ankara’s membership in NATO should be reconsidered. Erdogan long played footsie with the Islamic State; his government apparently helped arm, sell oil from, and open Turkish territory for use by ISIS. More recently he has targeted the Syrian Kurds, U.S. allies against ISIS. Erdogan’s government has limited military cooperation with Washington while promoting lurid conspiracy tales against the U.S. government and snuggling close to Putin’s Russia.



Claims that Turkey is a “vital” member of NATO suggest a throwback to the Cold War when Ankara was an anchor against the Soviet Union. Today, despite the Ukraine conflict, Russia exhibits no aggressive designs against Europe and is not constrained by Turkey. Moreover, noted AEI’s Michael Rubin, Ankara’s purge carefully targeted pro‐​Western military offices. Unfortunately, he added, “The Turkish military tilt toward Russia has gone beyond the symbolic.” Overall, Ankara is an inconstant, untrustworthy partner, actively flouting the alliance’s democratic values while hindering its geopolitical goals



Nevertheless, President Donald Trump made a cheery phone call to congratulate Erdogan after the vote and apparently invited Erdogan to visit for formal talks. The State Department gamely issued a statement backing Turkey’s “democratic development” and urging protection of “the fundamental rights and freedoms of all its citizens,” but no one believed that reflected the president’s position. Sadly, those betrayed by President Trump are America’s closest friends, liberals, secularists, and others who believe in a free and tolerant society. The president’s apparent hope that Erdogan will lead the fight against Islamic radicalism seems a long‐​shot at best. The latter is more likely to become its exponent and practitioner.



The United States cannot fix the world. But Washington should not ignore the betrayal of fundamental values by supposed allies. In the case of Turkey, President Erdogan has abandoned its long‐​standing affinity for the West. The problem today is not a conflict between America’s moral and strategic interest. Unfortunately, the Erdogan government flunks both tests.

Earlier this month, I was in Venice to participate in the Aspen Institute Italia’s transatlantic dialogue on the theme, “Pivot to Europe: options for a new Atlantic century”. There were wide‐​ranging discussions on the ways out of the global economic crisis, the Atlantic link on the issues of global security and crises, and on the prospects for the ongoing negotiations for a transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP).



It rained all the five days my wife and I were there. Piazza San Marco, where the participants gathered in the grand Sala dello Scrutinio of the Doge’s Palace, was flooded. This was a reminder of the fragility of this ancient and beautiful imperial city, which seemed to be slowly sinking into its bay. This was reflected in the gloom about Europe’s prospects emanating from the meeting, despite the attempts by various European functionaries to talk up its prospects.





Current European politics is unlikely to provide the necessary cure for the euro zone’s economic woes.



On the economics themes, a number of points emerged. First, as Allan Meltzer, a historian of the US Federal Reserve, pointed out, the various rounds of quantitative easing (QE) have merely increased bank reserves on which the Fed pays 0.25 per cent interest to keep them idle. So most of the reserves created by QE have not led to an increase in the money supply. Bank reserves had risen 31 per cent in the 12 months to July, but money supply increased by only 6.8 per cent. No wonder the US recovery has been so slow and inflation so low. The banks, by contrast, are sitting pretty; they hold $2 trillion in excess reserves and get $5 billion a year without any risk.



In my contribution, I pointed out that the unsustainable entitlements to politically determined income streams, which had led to the crisis, had not been seriously tackled. For these include not only the explicit entitlements of the welfare state, but also the even larger implicit ones created for the Masters of the Universe of the financial system, which, according to the estimates of Bank of England’s Andrew Haldane, often exceed the value added by the financial sector to the gross domestic product [see his “Control Rights (And Wrongs)”, Economic Affairs, June 2012]. Only a Glass‐​Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking will end them — as all the rules being devised, from Dodd‐​Frank to Basel, will inevitably be gamed by universal banks. It may be necessary to remove limited liability from investment banks, and convert them into unlimited liability partnerships, with “skin” in the risk‐​taking games they must play.



The other major economic issue that was discussed was the implications for Europe of the shale oil and gas revolution in the US. This poses both an economic risk for Europe, with its energy prices a quarter to a third higher than those in the US, and a security risk, with the US’ growing energy independence from suppliers in West Asia. The former implies that much of heavy industry is likely to shift from the continent to the US — a prospect made more likely by Europe’s green climate change agenda and the high costs and unreliability of the various renewable sources of energy being promoted. Now that Germany has turned its back on nuclear power, and France has imposed a ban on fracking for shale gas and oil, Europe’s industrial future looks bleak.



The security prospects are worse. With increasing domestic availability, the US’ strategic interest in West Asia to ensure security of supply of fossil fuels will decline. The Europeans have been free riders in the post‐​war global order of the US imperium. This will now have to change. But since the only two serious European military powers — the United Kingdom and France — are unable to maintain their recent levels of defence spending, and since the Germans have the means but not the will to fill the breach, the impending US withdrawal will require Europe to bear the burden of continuing West Asian turmoil by itself — including terrorist threats, and refugees fleeing from the conflicts in North Africa. This will prove a challenge, particularly given the growth of anti‐​immigrant far‐​right political parties during the current slump in the euro zone. The tragedy of the sinking of the refugee boat near the island of Lampedusa on the first day of the conference highlighted this danger.



Given all these challenges, leaving aside the continuing problems of the euro — which the German economists at the conference emphasised will not be solved by any implicit or explicit German bailout — the major hope of the European participants was that TTIP would be their salvation. Most agreed with Harvard Kennedy School professor Robert Lawrence’s economic assessment that, as their tariff levels are low, the main gains would come from harmonising regulatory policies ranging from food safety to automobile parts.



But it soon became clear that the major purpose of these negotiations for the Europeans was the construction of a transatlantic fortress against the rising emerging economies (particularly China and India). The Americans hope that, by excluding these “refusniks” of the multilateral Doha agreement, TTIP will be a lever in changing their mind. More sinister to my ears was the suggestion that agreements on labour and environmental standards in TTIP could become the gold standard for future trade agreements.



A lot of what I heard was whistling in the dark — hoping that the clouds threatening Europe would lift. But this is to misdiagnose their problem. For, while Europe still contains enormous entrepreneurial talent and a highly skilled labour force, its dirigiste economic policies have failed its citizens. This was evident as one walked around the narrow Venetian streets, with the shops stocking Italian designer clothes, crafts and a myriad other products. The thrifty Italians have little private debt. They have been laid low by the entitlement economy of the Mezzogiorno and by the euro. As I suggested at the meeting, instead of the various dirigiste remedies that were being proposed to cure Europe’s woes, the simplest was for Germany to exit the euro for a new Bismark, leaving the European Central Bank to manage a highly devalued euro for the Club Med and France. But current European politics is unlikely to provide the necessary cure to prevent both Venice and Europe from sinking.

"**A Puerto Rican woman has received a life prison sentence for hiring a hitman to murder her wealthy Canadian husband 14 years ago.**
Ãurea VÃ¡zquez Rijos, who fled to Europe after the killing, professed her innocence as she learned her fate.
VÃ¡zquez Rijos had fled to Italy and Spain after watching her husband, Adam Anhang, fatally knifed on the streets of San Juan in September 2005.
In court she angrily told the victim's father: ""I hope you're happy now.""
""Shut up!"" responded 80-year-old Abraham Anhang after he was accused of character assassination by the former beauty queen.
""You lost [a son] but I lost, too,"" she said during Friday's hearing, according to the Winnipeg Free Press.
""I lost a man I love. I was murdered. A part of me died... I am innocent and time will prove it. That is all.""
In the hearing, which was held at a federal court near where Anhang died, the judge recommended she spend the rest of her life in a Fort Worth, Texas, prison.
The details of her time on the run, during which she gave birth to three children including one in jail, makes for extraordinary reading.
Investigators say Anhang, a 32-year-old Winnipeg real estate developer who earned millions of dollars from online gaming, was murdered days after he declared his intention to seek a divorce from VÃ¡zquez Rijos - six months after they wed.
He was killed by a restaurant worker hired by VÃ¡zquez Rijos, who promised to pay $3m (Â£2.3m) for the crime to appear to be a mugging gone wrong.
VÃ¡zquez Rijos was slightly injured in the attack, and was not suspected until a witness came forward.
The witness said they had seen the assailant speak to VÃ¡zquez Rijos before lightly striking her after Anhang had been brutally beaten and stabbed.
An innocent man was convicted and spent eight months in jail as VÃ¡zquez Rijos fled to Florence, Italy, and sued her deceased husband's parents for $9m from his estate.
US Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez said in a statement: ""Today's sentence concludes a process which required a lot of effort and perseverance. Justice was finally served for the victim and his family.""
Also sentenced on Friday was her sister, Marcia VÃ¡zquez Rijos, and her ex-boyfriend, Jose Ferrer Sosa, who authorities say helped her evade capture.
The main suspect, Alex Pabon Colon, pleaded guilty 10 years ago to killing Anhang, and has been co-operating with investigators since then.
The victim's father told the Associated Press that ""it certainly helps to put it behind us, but you can't forget your own child who dies before you do"".
""If you lose a child, there's never closure,"" he added."
"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   President Trump said in an interview that aired on Sunday that a replacement health care law was not likely to be ready until either the end of this year or in 2018, a major shift from promises by both him and Republican leaders to repeal and replace the law as soon as possible. “Maybe it’ll take till sometime into next year, but we’re certainly going to be in the process,” Mr. Trump said during an interview with Bill O’Reilly of Fox News, after Mr. O’Reilly asked the president whether Americans could “expect a new health care plan rolled out by the Trump administration this year. ” “It statutorily takes awhile to get,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to be putting it in fairly soon, I think that, yes, I would like to say by the end of the year at least the rudiments but we should have something within the year and the following year. ” Mr. Trump acknowledged that replacing former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act is complicated, though he reiterated his confidence that his administration could devise a plan that would work better than the law  —   despite having provided few details of how such a plan would work. “You have to remember Obamacare doesn’t work, so we are putting in a wonderful plan,” Mr. Trump said. Speaker Paul D. Ryan has vowed to move legislation for a replacement for the Affordable Care Act by the end of March. But some Republicans are worried about a political backlash if they repeal the law without an adequate replacement  —   potentially throwing millions of people off their insurance  —   and have urged a more methodical approach. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, recently proposed repairing parts of the health care law ahead of scrapping the whole package. Mr. Trump said last month that he wanted to present a replacement soon after the Senate confirmed his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia. The Senate is scheduled to vote on Mr. Price’s confirmation this week. “We’re going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary is approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan,” Mr. Trump said in January. Last month, the president signed an executive order to begin unwinding the Affordable Care Act. It gave the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to ease what it called “unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens” from the existing law."

The most noticeable thing about Extinction Rebellion is just how **bourgeois** the whole Krazy Klimate Kult really is. While the rest of Australia firmly rejected the left’s climate policies at the May election, the two wealthiest electorates in Australia voted for candidates running almost exclusively on climate change. The movers and shakers of Extinction Rebellion are Eton toffs living off Mummy and Daddy’s trust fund. The “schools climate strike” was notably swelled by the ranks of pampered private school elites.



 **“Climate emergency” really is the ultimate first world problem.**



Ordinary folk have much more real problems than fretting about an absurdly improbable “climate catastrophe”. And they’re fast getting fed up with a bunch of rich layabouts getting in their way.



The people are rising up against the elites. No, I don’t mean Extinction Rebellion. I mean the Rebellion against Extinction Rebellion. Today’s clashes on the Tube between the commuting working classes and the time-rich, bourgeois fearmongers of the XR cult is a wonderful illustration of the elitist nature of eco-politics and of rising public fury with the eco-agenda.



For more than a week now the XR elitists have been disrupting everyday life. They’ve stopped flights from taking off, preventing people from going on well-earned holidays or visiting loved ones abroad. They’ve clogged up roads in city centres, irritating cab drivers and people on buses. And they’ve stormed Smithfield meat market and Billingsgate fish market – smug middle-class vegans lecturing hard-working traders about the correct way to think and live.



But today their sneering campaigning went too far.



It’s all very well to glue themselves to roads in Westminster, where road users can afford to pay congestion taxes for their beemers and mercs, but the Tube system is the vital daily commute for millions of working-class Londoners. Absurdly, it’s also run on electricity, which you’d think the Krazy Klimate Kult would welcome. But the Kult is really about screaming for attention – and this time, the Kultists really got some.



People got pissed off. Really pissed off.



Across the Tube system commuters confronted the XR irritants. In one videoed scene a commuter can be heard asking about people who have hospital appointments to keep. What about them? ‘The point is…’, replies a plummy XR protester, no doubt about to launch into a snooty green lecture for the little people, but she gets cut off by other angry commuters. One points out that the train she has glued herself to is electric. Why target this transport system? ‘Are you guys really THAT fucking stupid?’, he asks. ‘That’s why you ain’t got jobs…’



…In Canning Town an angry crowd of working people even dragged XR protesters off the top of a Tube train. The sight of one of the protesters kicking at the commuters to prevent them from reaching him really showed how nasty and contemptuous of the public these green extremists have become. This is the reactionary middle classes insulting and assaulting ordinary people.



That particular protester soon got more than he bargained for. Dragged off the roof of the train, the video seemed to show the crowd giving him an old-fashioned London kicking before police intervened.



Some leftists and greens have been shocked by today’s rebellion against Extinction Rebellion. They’re saying XR should change tactics. But the problem here isn’t tactics…[working] people reject this elitist movement. They reject its alarmism, its snobbery, its anti-humanism, and its demands for crippling austerity. We saw that today. Commuters’ message was ‘Fuck Extinction Rebellion’. And that’s a positive, progressive, forward-looking political demand we can organise around.



It might be the better part of valour for the Extinction Rebellions snobs to slink back to their posh digs, pop some Bolly, and have a good long think about what they’re bringing down on themselves. Because, if they keep pissing off working people for much longer, there’s going to be a lot more kickings dealt out. Or worse.

The government set rules in place last year where residential housing can only be purchased by people living in New Zealand, Australia and, because of a quirk in the trade agreement, Singapore. Many of us breathed a sigh of relief because we would prefer New Zealand to be owned by New Zealanders. Some of us hoped that this government might extend these rules to include industrial and agricultural land so that New Zealand really will belong only to the people that live here.



Well, no. After a lot of farmland was sold to Chinese companies over the last decade, we are now faced with a new foreign buyer. The government, led by Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage, is going to allow the sale of land for forestry… to Japanese forestry companies, without the need to apply to the Overseas Investment Office.



Land Information Minister and Green MP Eugenie Sage has given a foreign-owned forestry company **a free pass** to buy thousands of hectares of New Zealand land without applying to the Overseas Investment Office (OIO). 



Japanese-owned Pan Pac Forest Products was given the special approval to bypass the OIO to purchase land for forestry for the next three years as the government sought foreign forestry money to help meet its tree planting targets. 



So much for getting Shane Jones’s nephs off the couch. Now, not only are we bringing in foreign workers to do the job that Kiwis should be doing, but we are allowing them to buy the land to do it.



The pre-approval was given to Pan Pac **despite the Green Party having strongly protested land sales to foreigners** and Forestry Minister Shane Jones [saying he was sympathetic to rural concerns](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/400696/foreign-forestry-companies-could-face-oil-and-gas-style-ban) that converting productive farm land to forestry could cost jobs.



Associate Finance Minister David Clark signed off on Pan Pac’s pass, known as a ‘standing consent’, alongside Ms Sage.



The free pass allows Pan Pac to make 25 transactions involving 20,000ha of land and is valid until 2022.





 **Why are we talking about selling fertile agricultural land and converting it to forestry?** Why would we do that when the south island, in particular, is awash with scrubland that could be converted to forestry easily without damaging our agriculture in any way?



What a bunch of hypocrites the Greens really are. They will do anything to kick farmers in the guts. They seem to forget that some farmers grow crops… like kale and mung beans, the staples of the average Greenie diet. Good luck with trying to eat pine trees, Eugenie.



Ms Sage defended the decision, saying Pan Pac had been in New Zealand since the 1970s, was a large exporter of quality timber and needed to secure its wood supply.



“They’ve got a long standing reputation in New Zealand. They’ve increased their investment here, they’ve got a strong workforce. We want to add value to our forestry exports not just have log exports and Pan Pac is a company that can do that.”



[RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/401655/govt-gives-japanese-owned-forestry-company-pan-pac-forest-products-free-pass-to-buy-nz-land)



Yes… and all the profits go offshore, to Japan. Smart thinking, Eugenie, but like Jacinda, economics is not your strong point either.



My main question here is this. Wasn’t Shane Jones allocated $3 billion of taxpayers’ money, in the form of the Provincial Growth Fund, to develop a project that would see us plant 1 billion trees? So why is it that, instead of that, we are now selling land to foreign companies, without OIO approval, to plant some of those trees? What new madness is this?



The project to plant 1 billion trees was always an ambitious one, but it was intended to provide work in the regions and has been funded by taxpayers to do exactly that. Instead, we are selling more land to foreigners, reducing prime agricultural land to forestry and sending the profits overseas. 



Yet another of the government’s promises is an abject failure, but in this case, we are sacrificing a valuable asset – prime agricultural land – on the altar of climate change.



Wow. What an enormous fail on the part of this government. They really know what they are doing, don’t they?

Share this...FacebookTwitterRight on schedule, winter will be making its real debut at the end of this week as a colder air mass pushes westward into Central Europe, so writes German weather portal donnerwetter.de here. 
This does not come as any surprise to those who ignore the warming hysteria in the media and follow the observed data. Today, according to the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here, data from the DWD German national weather service shows that winters in Germany have been cooling significantly and in parallel with those in Austria for close to three decades – despite rising CO2 emissions. If Co2 has a warming effect, it hasn’t been seen in Central Europe since James Hansen testified before Congress in 1988!

Germany’s mean winter temperature has been falling since NASA scientist James Hansen warned in 1988 of a rapidly warming planet. Chart: Josef Kowatsch, EIKE.
EIKE also presents a mean winter temperature chart for Germany since 1882. Here we see the long-term trend is modestly upward.

Germany mean winter temperature, based on DWD data.
But EIKE adds that there is a good explanation for this modest warming:
The reason for this heat is mainly the consequence of the urban heat island effect. During the above period, Germany has changed profoundly. Compared to the much smaller and far less frequent heat islands back then, today’s heat islands are far more expansive and involve heat zones. And the surface measurement stations in 2014 are sited differently than they were 130 years ago. Forest chalets at the edge of wilderness and unheated monasteries no longer exist. The surface measurement stations, often under the same name, have been moved to inside heat islands where people live and heat mightily in the wintertime. And also the weather stations next to the landing strips of our airports in conjunction with the hot exhaust of jet engines did not exist 130 years ago. All homes are heated entirely today, and not just 2 or 3 rooms like 50 years ago. This applies to both Germany and Austria. Today’s thermometers are simply measuring man’s additional heat along with that of nature.”

"**Regular theatre-goers will no doubt be familiar with a pre-show announcement advising that ""the use of recording equipment is strictly prohibited"".**
Anyone found breaking this cardinal rule risks being thrown out, with actors rarely taking kindly to those pointing a camera at the stage.
This was the case in Puerto Rico when Hamilton creator and actor, Lin-Manuel Miranda, interrupted his performance to beg an audience member to stop filming.
But not exactly.
The man who wrote the music and lyrics to Hamilton made a self-edit live on stage, as he changed the words to one of the show's songs to get the message across.
He sang: ""Lady filming in the fourth row, please stop it.""
Had Miranda not spotted the audience member attempting to pirate the show, he would have sung the original line, ""the problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish"".
The new lyric came part-way through the first act song My Shot, which chronicles Alexander Hamilton's first meeting with John Laurens, Hercules Mulligan and Lafayette.
And Miranda suggested his colleagues on stage were taken aback by his lyrical improvisation in a subsequent Twitter post.
Though it is unusual for someone to attempt to film a stage show, it is not unheard of.
Piracy is a well-known problem within the stage industry, with some audience members uploading and exchanging their bootlegged recordings online.
Some fans have justified the practice by citing the price of theatre tickets, particularly when also taking into account the travel costs for those living outside major cities.
But Miranda has previously had people removed from the theatre for recording, which he has said ""misrepresents"" his work.

From the Carnegie Institution and the mind of Ken Caldeira, comes this “back to the future” style impossible to verify prediction (at least impossible now). Of course, in model-world and Hollywood, anything is provable possible.

Climate change: Fast out of the gate, slow to the finish the gate
Washington, D.C.— A great deal of research has focused on the amount of global warming resulting from increased greenhouse gas concentrations. But there has been relatively little study of the pace of the change following these increases. A new study by Carnegie’s Ken Caldeira and Nathan Myhrvold of Intellectual Ventures concludes that about half of the warming occurs within the first 10 years after an instantaneous step increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, but about one-quarter of the warming occurs more than a century after the step increase. Their work is published in Environmental Research Letters.

The study was the result of an unusual collaboration of a climate scientist, Ken Caldeira, who contributed to the recently published Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, and Nathan Myhrvold, the founder and CEO of a technology corporation, Intellectual Ventures LLC. It is the third paper on which they have collaborated
The study brings together results from the majority of the world’s leading climate models. Caldeira and Myhrvold analyzed more than 50 climate simulations, which were performed using 20 different climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5).
They found a fairly high degree of consensus on the general character of the pace of climate change. In response to an instantaneous increase in greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is fast out of the starting gate but then slows down, and takes a long time to approach the finish line.
There is substantial quantitative disagreement among climate models, however. For example, one model reaches 38 percent of the maximum warming in the first decade after a step increase in CO2 concentration, while another model reaches 61 percent of the maximum warming in this time period. Similarly, one model reaches only 60 percent of maximum warming in the first century after the step increase, while another achieves 86 percent of maximum warming during this interval.
There is also substantial uncertainty in the ultimate amount of warming that would result from any given increase in atmospheric CO2 content. The most sensitive model predicts more than twice as much warming as the least-sensitive model.
Uncertainty in the amount of warming combines with uncertainty in the pace of warming. From an instantaneous doubling of atmospheric CO2 content from the pre-industrial base level, some models would project 2°C (3.6°F) of global warming in less than a decade while others would project that it would take more than a century to achieve that much warming.
“While there is substantial uncertainty in both the pace of change and the ultimate amounts of warming following an increase in greenhouse gas concentration,” Caldeira said, “there is little uncertainty in the basic outlook. If we continue increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations with emissions from the burning of coal, oil, and gas, the Earth will continue to get hotter. If we want the Earth to stop getting hotter, we have to stop building things with smokestacks and tailpipes that emit CO2 into the atmosphere.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterCNN recently published an online op-ed by Germany’s Federal Minister of Environment, Barbara Hendricks, titled: How Germany banishes climate myths, where she brazenly declares Germany’s Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) a success story.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
In reality her op-ed piece ranks right up there close to George W. Bush’s famous “Mission Accomplished” declaration – shortly after Saddam Hussein’s regime was toppled in 2003. Shutting down nuclear power plants and massively subsidizing the installation of solar and wind systems to the tune of hundreds of billions of euros was also easy and “successful”. But now comes the terrible costs and abject failure no one wishes to talk about.
Even the tree-hugging center-left DIE ZEIT has called the German Energiewende “a blunder with ugly consequences“. Forbes asks if the country has gone insane. Max Planck Institute researcher Axel Börsch-Supan says Germany’s Energiewende is bordering on suicide.
Even the German government’s own commissioned independent committee of expert advisors recommends that the EEG renewable energy feed-in act be scrapped altogether.
In the op-ed piece Hendricks for example claims that Germany is on track to reduce its CO2 emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels. The truth here is that Germany’s CO2 emissions have been rising over the past couple of years and the token (illusory) measures Germany decreed some weeks ago are widely viewed as mere actionism.
Hendricks also claims that between 1990 and 2012 greenhouse gas emissions in the EU fell by 18% while the overall economy grew by around 45%. That kind of growth over a twenty two year period is anemic at best. Moreover, the 18% reduction claimed by Ms Hendricks is likely an exaggeration. According to CDIAC data, the EU has reduced CO2 emissions only by 10.7%, see chart right (hat-tip: W. Eschenbach).

Much of the achieved reductions resulted from the shut-down of filthy, dilapidated, communist-run Eastern European industries after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall.
Another misleading whopper is her claim that the “economic impact has been broadly extremely positive” and that “renewable energy sources now account for nearly 30% of our electricity demands“. Here Hendricks forgets to mention that almost every single solar system manufacturer in Germany has gone bankrupt – resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs, read here and here.
Hendricks also fails to mention that much of the generated 30% renewable electricity is done so when the energy is not even needed. Germany at times has to pay countries to accept the unwanted surpluses in production, leading to “negative prices” on electricity exchange markets. Also Germany’s leading power companies such as RWE have been shedding thousands of high-paying power sector jobs and spilling red ink.
Hendricks says that “1.5 million people working in this sector“. She does not say where. Europe? Worldwide? She also does not mention that each “renewable energy job” in the wind and solar branch cost far more in subsidies than what the jobs themselves earn.
Finally, Hendricks makes it sound as if the green industry is a huge benefit to poor people, claiming “money that would otherwise have been needed to import expensive fossil resources now instead goes to individuals, cooperatives, farmers, and small and medium-sized enterprises, that can all themselves become energy suppliers.” Here the opposite is true. Not only are German power consumers paying among the highest utility prices worldwide but Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act is called by many experts the biggest wealth redistribution scheme from the poor to the rich. What’s worse is that hundreds of thousands of households have had their electricity shut off because it is no longer affordable.
The op-ed piece by Barbara Hendricks resembles nothing a normal person would ever expect from a minister of a government based on democratic values.

The past several years have been tumultuous ones for U.S. trade policy. After strident rhetoric from Donald Trump during his presidential campaign, his administration followed up with a wide range of aggressive actions. Congress, U.S. trading partners, businesses, and consumers have all been pushed to their limits by an administration that has taken U.S. policy in a protectionist and unilateral direction.



If Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wins the 2020 election, he will face the challenge of developing a coherent U.S. trade policy that provides stability and certainty. This paper presents an overview of the trade issues a President Joe Biden would likely face, with some suggestions on possible approaches his administration might take. It covers seven major topics, with some overlap among them: 



When it comes to trade agreements, trade officials must address two big questions: What should those agreements say? And with whom should they be negotiated?



In terms of what issues trade agreements should cover, the modern version of trade agreements emerged in the 1930s, and these agreements have always been about more than just tariffs. Early trade agreements recognized that domestic taxes and regulations could also be used as a means of protectionism, and they established obligations to address this problem. But since the early 1990s, when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the WTO were established, the scope of trade agreements has expanded considerably. The question for trade officials today is, what is the proper scope of these agreements? In other words, what policy areas should be included? 



Of the wide range of options, each potential issue has appeal for one interest group or another and generates opposition from other interest groups. The main substantive policy areas that have been included in trade agreements are tariff liberalization (the scope of which is affected by rules of origin); the liberalization of trade in services; opening government procurement to foreign competition; regulatory trade barriers, including the regulatory process; digital trade; intellectual property; investment protection (and investor‐​state dispute settlement); labor; environment (including climate change); competition policy; corruption; currency practices; gender rights; and the rights of indigenous peoples. Sometimes drawing the line as to what belongs in a trade agreement and what does not is difficult, but strong arguments exist for a traditional focus on protectionist measures, with other issues addressed by specialized treaties and international organizations.1



Beyond substantive policy, issues also arise related to governance in trade agreements. Examples include the enforceability of the dispute settlement process (e.g., whether panels can be blocked); the role of monitoring and oversight, through regular committees or occasional review under a “sunset clause”; and the process for withdrawal by a party.



With all these issues in the conversation, designing an agreement that the negotiating governments can support and that can also secure domestic ratification is a challenge. The balance needs to be crafted carefully, and it may change over time, depending on the political balance at a given moment (such as which parties have control over the different branches of the U.S. government).



A Democratic president is likely to push for rules that certain nongovernmental organizations on the left prefer (e.g., the environment and labor) rather than for those sought by business groups (e.g., intellectual property and investor‐​state dispute settlement). If the Republicans keep control of the Senate after the 2020 election, the balance a Biden administration tries to draw may need to shift a bit toward the business side. If the Democrats take over the Senate, the calculation will be different.



In addition to decisions about what should be in trade agreements, there is also the question of whom to negotiate with. A Biden administration would have many options. Rejoining the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP), now in a slightly different form after some revisions by the other parties, is an obvious possibility that many people, including Biden himself, have suggested.2 Doing so would require some degree of renegotiation, but the other TPP parties would likely welcome the United States back in. Reviving negotiations with the European Union, which the Obama administration undertook as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), could also make sense. But these large‐​scale negotiations are challenging and could run into hurdles, which they did the first time around. Perhaps a one‐​on‐​one negotiation with an eager United Kingdom would be easier. This type of smaller‐​scale negotiation could also work with New Zealand, which is looking to ensure that it does not become too dependent on China. And Japan presents an interesting case because the Trump administration has negotiated a partial deal already; that deal could be expanded (or folded back into the TPP). The Trump administration has mentioned several other governments as trade‐​negotiating candidates as well, including India, Kenya (where free trade agreement negotiations are just starting up), and Switzerland. (Of course, China is the big trading partner out there and is addressed separately later in this paper.)



For the Trump administration, a key consideration has been a preference for bilateral deals over those with multiple partners. But that approach has always been more of an idiosyncratic preference than an evidence‐​based view, and a Biden administration should be more practical about this issue. It should evaluate all its options and focus on the negotiations that offer the most value in terms of economic benefits and mending relations with allies.



The overarching trade agreement that loosely governs the world trading system is the WTO Agreement, which is overseen by the WTO, the leading multilateral trade institution. Since taking office, the Trump administration has challenged the WTO in a number of fundamental ways. 



First, it rightly complains about the failure of the WTO to achieve new liberalization. Of course, some of the blame for that failure falls on the United States, which has not been eager to liberalize in recent years. Nevertheless, it is true that, if the WTO cannot facilitate new liberalization, governments must look elsewhere. Some possible areas to focus on are fisheries subsidies, e‐​commerce, and environmental goods, where progress has been made in recent years. A Biden administration could emphasize moving things forward in these areas, but it would need to keep in mind that it would have to give something in return.



The Trump administration has also raised concerns about the limited commitments made by some of the more advanced developing countries,3 the failure of certain countries to notify trade measures properly,4 the need for new rules on subsidies, and more generally the issue of how the WTO deals with countries, such as China, that have significant nonmarket aspects to their systems.5 A Biden administration should pursue these issues but should of course be willing to listen to the many concerns other WTO members have expressed about U.S. protectionism.



Finally, on the WTO, the Trump administration has blocked appointments to the Appellate Body, the highest tribunal in the WTO’s dispute settlement system, over concerns about its behavior, including judicial overreach and failure to follow its stated rules.6 The Trump administration raises some legitimate issues here, and previous administrations also expressed their disagreement with the Appellate Body. Absent from the Trump administration’s approach, however, is an explicit statement of what changes would alle­viate the concerns. There are certainly plenty of options here, and a Biden administration should put together a detailed proposal and make the case for it. A revived Appellate Body is important to maintain the proper functioning of the system. Right now, the European Union is leading an effort to put together a temporary alternative appeals mechanism.7 For the United States to remain on the sidelines during nego­tiations of fundamental aspects of the WTO is bad for the United States and for the system.



China’s accession to the WTO in 2001 was a momentous event. Unfortunately, although China’s entry into the WTO was an important first step in its integration into the world economy, a proper follow‐​through did not occur. The Bush administration was distracted by 9/11 and then the financial crisis; the Obama administration argued that it was pushing for liberalization with other major trading countries as a way to write the rules rather than letting China do so, but its major initiatives failed. Then the Trump administration came along and started a trade war with China, with a goal of pressuring China to liberalize; but that administration has also started trade wars with many other countries, undermining its China strategy in the process.8 A Biden administration will inherit a difficult situation.



Trade with China poses real concerns: subsidies and overcapacity, the behavior of state‐​owned enterprises, national security threats related to tech products and data, and dependence on China for medical supplies, among others. In general terms, a Biden administration would need to search for a reasonable balance on these issues while taking into account competing concerns. Short‐​term economic benefits have to be balanced with longer‐​term security concerns. To illustrate the point, the United States could ban Huawei from using Android as its operating system in smartphones. This policy might slow Huawei’s growth in the short term, but the long‐​term implications may be negative if the policy leads Huawei to develop its own operating system. As the U.S. government continues its refinement of the investment reviews carried out by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and of various export control regulations, it needs to think carefully about how to draw the right balance.



A more challenging issue will be evaluating what to do with the Trump administration’s Section 301 tariffs and phase one U.S.-China trade deal. One option would be to remove all the tariffs and terminate the deal by executive order (which could be done because Congress did not formally sign off on the deal) and then start over with a new process that involves working with allies in a joint effort to put pressure on China. Alternatively, because the phase one deal includes useful provisions, and because we may have a better sense by the end of the year whether it is leading to any progress, perhaps the deal could be adapted and used to some extent. Aspects that are more about managed trade and unilateralism, such as the purchase commitments and unilateral enforcement mechanism, should be discarded; but some of the substantive provisions may represent real progress.



A signature trade policy achievement of the Trump admin­istration is the renegotiated NAFTA, now called the USMCA. As a matter of domestic politics, the deal is done, and President Trump can tout it as a victory. In terms of policy, however, there are still some questions to answer. Two of the most important ones relate to the rules of origin for automobile production and the new rapid‐​response labor mechanism.



One of the great benefits of NAFTA was its integration of auto production in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. It eliminated tariffs on most autos and auto parts, which made production more efficient. This improved efficiency allowed North American production to be more competitive and led to lower prices for consumers. 



The USMCA tries to change this situation by imposing stricter conditions in order to qualify for these zero tariffs. In particular, companies in this sector will now need to include a higher percentage of North American content in the finished product to meet the rules of origin and will also have to satisfy minimum wage requirements for a certain portion of their workforce.9 The Trump administration’s goal seems to be to make it more difficult to trade freely and, as a result, to push companies to relocate production to the United States.



But those conditions are sketched out only vaguely in the USMCA itself, and the actual impact of the agreement is still unclear. Implementing regulations still need to be designed and put into place. The Trump administration is pushing hard to get this next step finished quickly, but it may take some time with the auto industry expressing concerns.10 A Biden administration would have to evaluate the state of the issue when it comes into office, but it may have an opportunity to apply the regulations in a more flexible manner in an effort to avoid undermining one of NAFTA’s key economic achievements.



The other big USMCA implementation issue is the new labor enforcement mechanism. In response to demands from House Democrats, the Trump administration convinced Mexico to sign on to a completely new and untested rapid‐​response labor mechanism.11 This procedure may lead to a flood of labor rights cases brought against Mexican factories. How this mechanism will play out is unclear, but a Biden administration will be faced with decisions on how actively to enforce the new rules.



As discussed in more detail in the next section, over many decades Congress has delegated a good deal of power over trade to the executive branch. The Trump administration has used this power to the fullest. Some of its actions have been simply a more intense exercise of the procedures that all admin­istrations use. For example, the Trump admin­istration has been a particularly active user of trade remedies (antidumping, countervailing duties, safeguards) and has not been shy about telling everyone about it.12 With regard to tariff preferences for developing countries, the admin­istration has undertaken vigorous reviews in an effort to extract new market access commitments or other concessions from trading partners.



In other areas, however, the Trump administration has gone beyond what came before. The biggest unilateral action by the Trump administration is the use of Section 232 to impose tariffs and quotas on steel and aluminum imports, purportedly on the basis of national security but with an extremely flimsy national security rationale.13 The next section considers general reforms to Section 232, but one of the most productive steps—for both the U.S. economy and relations with our allies—a Biden administration could take is to repudiate the Section 232 reports put out by the Commerce Department during the Trump administration and to remove the resulting tariffs and quota arrangements for steel and aluminum.



The Trump administration has pushed the boundaries of executive authority over trade. Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution gives Congress power over tariff duties and regulating commerce with foreign nations (although the president does have authority over foreign affairs), but Congress has delegated a fair amount of this power over the years. The Trump administration has made use of these delegations, interpreting various statutes in a creative and flexible way so as to give itself more discretion. A Biden administration could take a look at the state of congressional‐​executive power over trade and push for a rebalancing. Several areas merit consideration.



First, the conventional way that the U.S. government negotiates trade agreements is through a time‐​limited congressional delegation of negotiating power to the executive branch, with a wide range of conditions attached, known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The USMCA renegotiation called into question whether those conditions could actually be enforced, and the Trump administration has not seemed to feel very constrained by congressional guidance. TPA, or something like it, as a means to negotiate comprehensive trade agreements has been the norm for decades. It may be time to consider whether this process needs to be rethought, with congressional oversight more clearly defined.



Whereas TPA delegates the power to liberalize trade, other statutes delegate the power to impose tariffs. Two statutes in particular have caused trouble under the Trump admin­istration: Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Trump administration has repeatedly used them to threaten and to impose tariffs. A number of legislative proposals under consideration could reassert some congressional power over the use of tariffs under these statutes.14 Although presidents are naturally reluctant to rein in their own power, Biden has plenty of experience as a legislator and recognizes the importance of the congressional role on these issues. Members of Congress from both parties have been frustrated by the Trump administration’s abuse of its executive authority, but congressional Republicans have been reluctant to go against a president from their own party. A Biden administration might present a unique opportunity for Congress and the president to work together in reforming these statutes.



Finally, President Trump has frequently threatened to withdraw from various trade agreements, although it is not clear if a president has such authority.15 The varying texts of the implementation statutes for each agreement add a layer of complexity to the issue. A Biden administration should think about how it wants withdrawal to operate and in this regard could consider putting forward a statement of its under­standing on the matter. In terms of the appropriate policy here, it seems clear that Congress should have an important role. If Congress signs off on trade agreements in the first place, shouldn’t it also have a say in the decision to withdraw? This goes for provisions such as the USMCA sunset clause as well. If trade agreements are to terminate after a set period unless the parties agree to extend (which is a bad idea to begin with because it guarantees uncertainty, but USMCA has such a provision nonetheless), Congress should have to affirmatively agree in order for termination to take place.16



Making changes here depends, of course, on the makeup of the next Congress. The Republican‐​Democrat breakdown is important, but the trade supporter–trade skeptic balance is also relevant because each party now has a mix of protectionists and trade liberalizers.



U.S. trade policy has been formally led at times by someone from outside the field. In some cases, that may have been just what was needed because specialists can get lost in the weeds and miss the bigger picture. But sometimes effective trade policy leadership requires someone with experience and insider knowledge—someone who can navigate complex substantive disagreements and make all the key players happy.



When choosing a U.S. trade representative, a Biden administration should consider candidates with specialized trade policy backgrounds. Having such an individual in place would allow his administration to get moving right away and would increase the chances of succeeding on these complex and contentious issues. Of course, sometimes administrations assign positions on the basis of political considerations; if that happens with trade policy, a Biden administration should put in place a strong deputy to manage the process from one step below.



With all this in mind, I suggest the following concrete steps for a Biden administration to take on trade policy:

"The British government should prioritise spending on green projects to create jobs and kickstart the economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis, the International Monetary Fund’s chief economist has said. Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s economic counsellor, said that mounting unemployment triggered by the Covid-19 crisis would require swift action to prevent lasting damage, and that spending on low-carbon projects could be used in response.  Speaking to MPs on the commons Treasury committee, she said countries such as the UK had an opportunity to “do public investment that also addresses the need for a greener planet, and at the same time as a jobs-rich recovery”. Boris Johnson outlined plans this week to bring forward investment in projects worth £5bn – including roads, bridges, hospitals and schools to reboot Britain’s economy. However, the prime minister was criticised for not spending more or making enough of a priority of green projects. Gopinath said countries had no option but to tackle global heating and that responding to Covid-19 presented them with an opportunity to do so. “For many countries we can see a very good argument for them to undertake public investment spending, because this is going to be a crisis where people are going to hold back spending for a while. The private sector will hold back from spending for a while, so there is a role for public investment,” she said. Gopinath was speaking alongside Laurence Boone, the chief economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and both economists from the influential international organisations said Britain needed to tackle rising unemployment by ramping up support for people losing their jobs. Gopinath said a temporary increase in unemployment benefits was among options ministers should consider. Boone said reviewing social protection schemes and increasing funding for training was also key to supporting workers. Investing in a green economic recovery could create as many as 1.6m new jobs in Britain as the Covid-19 crisis subsides, according to a report published on Thursday by the Institute for Public Policy Research. Calling on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to use his summer economic update next week to prioritise the creation of new low-carbon jobs, it said three quarters of adults in a survey believed the government should spend more on fighting global heating. The IPPR warned that without government intervention, unemployment could rise by more than 2.1 million to almost 10% of the workforce. Setting out a plan to create jobs and tackle the climate emergency, it said 560,000 new roles could be created by increasing funding for the energy efficiency of homes. As many as 700,000 jobs could be created in social care, while 230,000 jobs could be created by investing in sustainable public transport – such as walking and cycling infrastructure, and electric vehicle charging points. As many as 46,000 jobs could also be created with the help of more funding for tree planting and peatland restoration. Luke Murphy, IPPR associate director, said: “Our report finds that clean recovery investments are good for jobs and good for the environment – and what’s more, the public agree.”"

A media without shame drives us towards energy poverty.
By: Dr. Tim Ball and Tim Harris
Said Thomas Jefferson: “The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers.” Jefferson’s comment may be expanded to include most of today’s mass media; this is especially true of television. As American linguist Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa said: “In the age of television, image becomes more important than substance.” It is effectively visual lying, dictated by Marshall McLuhan’s observation: “The medium is the message.” For example, TV news programs often illustrate air pollution with a smoke stack emitting water vapor, implying it is pollution when it is anything but.

Distortion and deception are accentuated by hyperbole. Television news and documentaries frequently report normal weather as “extreme weather,” implying it is abnormal and caused by human activity. But while a hurricane, for example, may inflict serious damage to our structures and cause major loss of life, it is a normal event in hurricane-prone regions, where it is foolish to live without preparing for the weather patterns of the area.
The problem is accentuated when supposedly prestigious newspapers like the New York Times present provably false information. “Summer’s Beast is Loose,” published in the Times on July 16, was an obvious attempt to sensationalize warm, but normal, summer temperatures:

"It’s getting hot in the city, and our overheated cities are only going to get hotter still as more people pile in and development and energy use intensifies. But planting away the problem could be a surprisingly low-cost solution to create cool roofs that will reduce office temperatures and improve working conditions for millions. As more people move into urban areas and the effects of climate change steadily increase, it’s not surprising that urban warming is projected to worsen in the future.  One means to counteract this heat and cool things down is through planting various types of vegetation to form a green roof. Another option is to paint roof surfaces white, as is common in the Mediterranean, known as a cool roofs. These simple measures can help reduce the urban heat island effect, where built-up areas experience higher air temperatures than rural areas due to higher-density buildings that trap heat.  As you’d expect, this leads to more overheating and energy use (from use of air conditioning) within buildings during the summer, and less energy needed for heating during winter.  The roofs of office buildings within central London are often flat and unused, offering up plenty of space for either plants or an easy white paint job. In our study we examined just how effective these measures could be in a London office, typical of any UK city. We found that the amount of heat felt by an office worker can be reduced by installing a green or cool roof, without the need for additional air conditioning. To explain the results in further detail, we need to understand how these roofs work.  A green, planted roof decreases the amount of solar energy that enters the building and provides added insulation. The air directly above the layer of plants is cooled, and this varies depending on whether the vegetation is sufficiently watered. Dried-out roof plants provide less cooling than irrigated ones, which may be a disadvantage in possible drier summers of the future. Cool roofs are typically painted white because lighter surfaces reflect more light than darker ones. This lowers the air and surface temperature and less heat energy finds its way into the building. How well a white-painted roof works depends on weather conditions. For example a building in Boston, US, which experiences warm summers and cold winters, saved more energy from heating and cooling by doubling the insulation (13%) than from planting a green roof (12%). But a similar building in Lisbon, Portugal, with hot summers and warm winters made energy savings of 26% with a green roof, whereas insulation made almost no difference (0.01%). Trying to establish just how much the air directly above the plants or white-painted roof was cooled, we examined a particular area around Victoria Station, London – an area that has been highlighted as a potential site for green and cool roofs.    Our findings showed that a cool roof was most effective at reducing air temperature during the day, when solar energy is greatest, whereas a green roof reduced air temperatures mostly during the evening. The cooling effect of a green roof lasts longer, but both will have a cooling effect on the local environment and so reduce the urban heat island effect. It’s crucial that we fully understand the net effects of green and cool roofs, so we can predict the how they will change urban temperatures.   Using a simulation, we also looked for the point of overheating – the level at which the building’s occupants felt uncomfortably hot – in typical office buildings under two possible climate scenarios, one in today’s climate and one in the projected climate of 2040-2069.  For the present day model, without the addition of a green or cool roof, the office building overheated for 8% of occupied hours over the summer period. After adding a green or cool roof, this was reduced to less than 3% of occupied hours, with the cool roof being most effective. In the future climate scenario, the building overheated around 25% of the time – a significant amount – but with the addition of a green or cool roof, overheating was reduced to 14% and 11% of occupied hours respectively.  So our study shows that without adding some measure to counteract the heat, office buildings are set to become uncomfortably hot during the summer during projected 2050s temperatures. Because of this, work is currently being completed at UCL that will show exactly how urban climate impacts will effect buildings, this research will also develop guidance on how to combat these issues.  This and other related studies highlight how in a changing climate, new and innovative designs will have to be considered to ensure comfortable temperatures without excessive energy use, with ongoing projects at UCL continuing to explore the nature of changes to the urban climate and sustainable ways of tackling the problem."

One of the flashpoint issues that cost Labor so dearly at the last Australian election was coal mining. The ferocious voter backlash against anti-coal activism also put the wind up the Queensland state Labor government. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk couldn’t [backflip fast enough](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/05/qld-labor-panicking-and-squawking-like-a-plucked-chook/) on her government’s forced delays on approvals for the mine.



Not that Queenslanders would be fooled, anyway. In a spectacular display of comic timing, King Climate Clown himself, Al Gore, [flew into Queensland](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/al-gores-climate-clown-show-comes-to-australia/) for a state-government sponsored climate junket just weeks after Australian voters roundly rejected climate fearmongering (again).



Now, it’s emerged that Big Al wasn’t just collecting his usual gargantuan appearance fee: he was pulling Queensland Labor’s strings.



A veteran anti-coal activist, controversially appointed as a top public servant in Queensland’s En­vir­onment Department, sent drafts of a proposed online panel discussion critical of Scott Morrison for vetting by Al Gore’s US-based climate change organisation. Emails obtained under state Right to Information laws show Tim Seelig, a former Wilderness Society official, drafted an exchange­ between Environment Minister Leeanne Enoch and the former US vice-president ahead of his taxpayer-funded visit to Queensland in June.



Behind this orchestrated climate clown show lurks “Pluckachook”’s deep-watermelon deputy, Jackie Trad, who was apparently busily arranging jobs for her greenie mates.



Dr Seelig, who has a doctorate in urban sociology and is a long-time ally of Deputy Premier Jackie Trad, was appointed as prin­cipal adviser (strategic policy) to department director-general Jamie Merrick in July last year despite missing the cut-off date for applications for the newly created job.



His appointment has since been probed by the Public Service Commission.



Still, at least he’s doing what Trad tells him to – and making sure everyone else says what they’re told to, as well.



The emails between Dr Seelig and Ms Enoch’s media adviser, Pamela Frost, show his direct contact with Mr Gore’s organisation and the suggested questions and answers between the American anti-climate change crusader and the state minister…



“Below is the proposed question which I have confirmed is fine with the Climate Reality (Al Gore org) Australian Branch, along with an indicative suggested answer­,’’ he wrote…



Attached to the emails is a transcript of the proposed exchange­, with Mr Gore pointed­ly saying to Ms Enoch, “your prime minister would not agree with you on many points”, which leads her to attack Mr Morrison.



“That’s right. We don’t need a prime minister who thinks bringing a lump of coal into parliament is a way forward,’’ Ms Enoch is proposed to say in the draft exchange.



Trad’s greenie puppet master all but had his hands up their arses for this climate muppet show.



A spokesperson for Ms Enoch last night failed to answer why a public servant was representing Ms Enoch to Mr Gore’s organisation and not her ministerial office.



In a statement, Ms Enoch’s spokesperson claims the…“Statements were not vetted­”.



Well, that’s true enough. **They were scripted.**

The Investing in a New Vision for the Environment and Surface Transportation (INVEST) in America Act passed by the House of Representatives last week is a transportation bill for the ‘20s — the 1920s, that is. The bill, which has yet to be considered by the Senate, would massively increase spending on obsolete forms of transportation that are irrelevant to most Americans.



The bill would quintuple federal subsidies to Amtrak and intercity passenger trains to nearly $10 billion a year. I love passenger trains more than most people, but unlike some I don’t think other taxpayers should be forced to subsidize my hobby.



The bill would further increase federal subsidies to urban transit by 50 percent, to $21 billion a year, much of which would go for rail transit. It would also increase federal spending on highways, but with a poison pill: states will not be allowed to expand their highway systems until they get all of their existing roads and bridges in a state of good repair. While that sounds sensible, no similar requirement is applied to Amtrak or urban transit even though Amtrak has a $52 billion maintenance backlog in the Boston‐​to‐​Washington corridor and transit agencies have a $100 billion backlog (in today’s dollars), mostly for rail transit.



The bill would massively increase spending on obsolete forms of transportation that are irrelevant to most Americans. 



The state highway backlog is actually small as most bridges and roads that need maintenance are locally‐​owned (and even that is declining). But the fix‐​it‐​first requirement would impose needless red‐​tape on the states and could prevent necessary expansions in fast‐​growing regions.



In short, the bill represents a strong bias towards intercity passenger trains and rail transit. That would make perfect sense in 1920, when American usage of both intercity passenger trains and urban rail transit peaked. But ridership of both declined through the 1920s as more people bought cars and buses replaced trains.



In 1920, buses cost less to buy but more to operate per seat‐​mile than streetcars or passenger trains. But in 1927, a company called Twin Coach introduced the first bus that was less expensive to operate as well as less expensive to buy than railcars. Over the next decade, hundreds of streetcar companies replaced their streetcar lines with buses.



The president of the Great Northern Railway, Ralph Budd, realized that buses were more economical than trains in short‐​haul service. In 1925, he bought a small bus company called Northland Transportation and gave it millions of dollars to expand. The company soon changed its name to Greyhound. A few years later, when Budd was president of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, he helped start Trailways.



In 1949, Budd was made chairman of the board of the Chicago Transit Authority, which was trying to operate streetcars and elevated trains without taxpayer subsidies. Budd quickly figured out that buses were more economical than streetcars and scrapped all of CTA’s streetcar lines, and even some of its elevated lines, and replaced them with Twin Coach buses.



In 2018, according to the Department of Transportation, urban transit carried 1.0 percent of all surface (that is, non‐​air) passenger travel in the United States, of which 0.6 percent was rail transit. Amtrak carried 0.1 percent. Even in the Boston‐​to‐​Washington corridor, Amtrak carried only about 6 percent of intercity travel.



Cars and light trucks, meanwhile, moved well over 90 percent of passenger travel, with the remainder divided among non‐​transit buses and motorcycles. Highways also moved close to 40 percent of freight ton‐​miles.



Despite transit’s and Amtrak’s insignificance, the House bill would give 22 percent of federal funds to transit and 12 percent to intercity passenger trains. This is futile: since 1970, the nation’s taxpayers have spent more than $1.5 trillion propping up intercity passenger trains and urban rail transit, yet per capita ridership of both has declined by about a third.



Proponents say the government should emphasize these outmoded forms of travel because they are supposedly more energy efficient and climate‐​friendly. Yet transit uses more energy, per passenger mile, than the average car in all but 4 out of more than 400 urban areas with transit systems, and it emits more greenhouse gases than the average car in all but eight of those urban areas. Amtrak is also inefficient outside the Boston‐​to‐​Washington corridor.



In the few places where transit and Amtrak are greener than driving, it is usually because they use electrical energy in states that rely heavily on by nuclear or hydroelectric power plants. Driving an electric car would do just as well.



The INVEST Act was designed for a century ago. It’s time to let go of the past and write a bill for the future.

Until now, conventional wisdom held that candidates of both major parties had to back ethanol welfare to win the Iowa caucuses. Like cotton was in the antebellum South, corn--in the form of ethanol--is king in Iowa.   
  
Most of today’s candidates have fallen into line. However, Sen. Ted Cruz has broken ranks to criticize farmers’ welfare. He holds a narrow polling lead over Donald Trump leading up to the upcoming caucuses. (Sen. Rand Paul also rejects the conventional wisdom, but he remains far back in the race.)   
  
Cruz’s political strength has dismayed ethanol makers. The group America’s Renewable Future, whose state director is the governor’s son, is deploying 22 staffers in the presidential campaign. The lobby doesn’t want to look like a paper tiger.   
  
Ethanol subsidies once included a high tariff and generous tax credits, both of which expired at the end of 2011. However, the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires blending ethanol with gasoline, operates as a huge industry subsidy. Robert Bryce of the Manhattan Institute figured the requirement cost drivers more than $10 billion since 2007.



Ethanol is a political creation. Three decades ago, the Agriculture Department admitted that ethanol could not survive “without massive new government assistance,” which “cannot be justified on economic grounds.” What other reason could there be for an ethanol dole?   
  
Petroleum is the most cost-effective energy source available for transportation, in particular. Ethanol has only about two-thirds of the energy content of gasoline. Given the energy necessary to produce ethanol—fuel tractors, make fertilizer, and distil alcohol, for instance—ethanol actually may consume more in fossil fuels than the energy it yields.   
  
The ethanol lobby claims using this inferior fuel nevertheless promotes “energy independence.” However, ending imports wouldn’t insulate the United States from the impact of disruptions in a global market. Moreover, the price of this energy “insurance” is wildly excessive.   
  
Bryce figured that “Since 1982, on average ethanol has cost 2.4 times more than an energy-equivalent amount of gasoline.” In some years, the former was three times as expensive.   
  
Last year, Terry Dinan of the Congressional Budget Office told House members that “the marginal cost of reducing gasoline consumption by one gallon through substituting corn ethanol” could run as much $3.20. With the United States likely to become a net oil exporter, the call for energy independence makes ever less sense.   
  
As I point out on _American Spectator_ online, “by creating an artificial energy demand for corn—40 percent of the existing supply goes for ethanol—Uncle Sam also is raising food prices. This obviously makes it harder for poor people to feed themselves, and raises costs for those seeking to help them.”   
  
Nor does ethanol welfare yield an environmental benefit, as claimed. In fact, ethanol is bad for the planet.   
  
Two years ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that “Increasing bioenergy crop cultivation poses risks to ecosystems and biodiversity.” _Scientific American_ ’s David Biello pointed to fertilizer run-off from cornfields which created “vast oxygen-deprived ‘dead zones’ in the Gulf of Mexico.”   
  
Jerry Taylor and Peter Van Doren, formerly and currently at Cato, respectively, also cited research which, after taking “evaporative emissions” into account, determined that ethanol mixed with gasoline “actually increases emissions of total hydrocarbons, non-methane organize compounds and volatile toxins.” Moreover, additional land used for corn production means “more water pollution, less water for other uses, and more ecosystems destruction.”   
  
What of combatting climate change? One study estimated a drop of between one and five percent in greenhouse emissions from the blended fuel, which makes the cost extraordinarily high.   
  
Other reviews don’t even find this reduction. Princeton’s Timothy Searchinger told Biello, “We can’t get to a result with corn ethanol where we can generate greenhouse gas benefits.” Similarly, warned Dinan, “replacing gasoline with corn ethanol has only limited potential for reducing emissions (and some studies indicate that it could increase emissions).”   
  
Ethanol is a bad deal by any standard. Whomever Iowans support for president, King Ethanol deserves a bout of regicide.

"**Puerto Rico's governor has called for the cancellation of a contract given to a tiny Montana firm to help rebuild the island's power grid.**
The head of the US-controlled island's power authority said he accepted Ricardo Rossello's recommendation and intended to cancel the deal.
The contract was given to Whitefish Energy, which has little experience of work on such a scale, without a public bid process.
Several inquiries are under way.
More than 70% of people on Puerto Rico were without power as of Sunday morning - more than five weeks after the powerful hurricane devastated the power grid.
The governor said he had asked the board of governors of the Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority (Prepa) to cancel the Whitefish contract.
""There can be no distraction to alter the commitment to restore the power system as quickly as possible,"" he said.
In response, the Prepa Executive Director Ricardo Ramos said he was seeking the contract's cancellation.
The governor also said he had instructed Prepa to ""immediately coordinate with the states of Florida and New York to reinforce brigades"" that are currently rebuilding the grid on the island.
Concerns had also been raised about why Puerto Rican authorities had not requested ""mutual aid"" from other public power authorities, as is typical during disasters in the US.
In a statement reacting to the news, Whitefish Energy said it was ""very disappointed in the decision"" and that the decision would ""only delay what the people of Puerto Rico want and deserve - to have the power restored quickly in the same manner their fellow citizens on the mainland experience after a natural disaster"".
The White House and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) distanced themselves from the deal late last week.
The company has its headquarters in the town of Whitefish, the hometown of US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Mr Zinke has denied any involvement or wrongdoing.
Whitefish has said that it secured the $300m (Â£228m) deal in a legitimate manner.
Earlier this week, Fema denied allegations by Prepa, the US territory's main utility, that it had reviewed the deal.
The contract states that ""Prepa hereby represents and warrants that Fema has reviewed and approved of this Contract"".
In a statement on Thursday, Fema said: ""Any language in any contract between Prepa and Whitefish that states Fema approved that contract is inaccurate.""
Fema also said it had ""significant concerns"" with how Prepa had procured the contract and had ""not confirmed whether the contract prices [were] reasonable"".
It is unclear what will happen to any outstanding costs.
Walt Green, a former director of the US National Center for Disaster Fraud, told BBC News earlier this week that it was ""impossible"" to say at this stage who was responsible for costs.
""Any dispute may result in appeals, administrative hearings and lawsuits,"" he added.
Puerto Rican authorities initially said Fema would pay for the deal.
They later said there was ""nothing illegal"" about the contract.
Prepa and the Puerto Rican government are saddled with massive debts. The power authority declared bankruptcy in July.
The US House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Caribbean island, is also scrutinising the contract.
On Friday, top Democrats from that panel and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent a letter asking the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general to launch an investigation.
The correspondence follows similar requests from other members of Congress to the interior department's inspector general."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI don’t have much time to spare today, so here’s a short one.
The German language, Austria-based Kronen Zeitung here has an online article on what sociologist Hubert Eichmann proposes to help save the climate: 30-hour workweeks for everyone in Austria.
Apparently Austria has been “hard hit” by climate change and so something really needs to be done about it. So Eichmann proposes a 30-hr work week to reduce productivity, which in turn would reduce CO2 emissions.
Not only that, the Kronen Zeitung writes:
Secondly commutes to work would be reduced as well and, thirdly, citizens would have more leisure for more environmentally protective behavior.”
Eichmann says for example that the “extra time would allow people to ride their bicycles to work instead of driving, and to separate their garbage.”

Also university Professor Jörg Flecker is also a supporter of the short workweek, and he advised policymakers to implement the reduced work-hours model.
Fortunately, the economic madness spawned by the obsession of rescuing the planet from fictitious manmade global warming has not fully infected the minds of politicians, at least for now. The Kronen Zeitung writes that Austria’s Ministry for Employment, Social and Consumer Protection views the plan of shortening the work week as “not achievable”. It seems the Austrian government still has enough sense remaining to realize that the 30-hour workweek would lead to less output, and thus also to lower tax revenues. That’s not what they want.
Moreover, which foreign company would be insane enough to set up shop in a country where the workers have an efficiency that is roughly equal to that of the average wind turbine? (30 hours/168 hours = 17.9%)
Income by Austrian workers would also necessarily drop by around 20%. What would the Austrian citizen get for all that sacrifice? The resulting CO2 savings theoretically would reduce global warming by something like 0.001°C by 2100!
Boy, what a deal!
Yes, some professors really are that dim. Hat-tip: DkS.

"**Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Puerto Rico to demand the resignation of the island's embattled governor, Ricardo RossellÃ³.**
It comes a day after Mr RossellÃ³ said he would not step down over a leaked online chat in which he and top aides exchanged obscenity-laced messages.
He said he would leave office next year, at the end of his term.
But protesters have said he must stand down immediately and the number of marchers on the streets has increased.
The leaked text messages included homophobic slurs as well as insults about victims of the deadly Hurricane Maria in 2017.
Asked about the matter, US President Donald Trump said Mr RossellÃ³ was ""a terrible governor"".
""You have totally grossly incompetent leadership at the top of Puerto Rico,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""The leadership is corrupt and incompetent.""
Footage early on Monday morning showed crowded trains headed to the capital, and long lines of protesters preparing to march in the sweltering Caribbean heat.
Some protesters were seen blocking highways while chanting ""Ricky resign"". The hashtags #RickyRenuncia (""Ricky resign"") and #ParoNacional (national strike) both trended on Twitter.
Experts predicted the crowd size would eclipse the largest protest in the island's history 15 years ago, when Puerto Ricans successfully petitioned the US military to end training missions on the island of Vieques.
The chat, which contained 880 pages of exchanges between the governor and 11 all-male allies, was leaked on 13 July and has led to days of protests outside the governor's mansion in San Juan.
Several of the texts mock victims of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017, and may have led to more than 4,000 deaths.
In one instance, Mr RossellÃ³ criticised the former speaker of the New York City Council, Melissa Mark-Viverito, saying people should ""beat up that whore"".
When the island's chief fiscal office wrote that he was ""salivating to shoot"" the mayor of San Juan, Mr RossellÃ³ replied: ""You'd be doing me a grand favour.""
On Sunday, the 40-year-old governor refused to resign, but said he would step down as leader of the New Progressive Party, a Puerto Rican political party which advocates for US statehood.
In an attempt to appease protesters, he said he would not seek re-election.
""I hear you,"" Mr RossellÃ³ said in a Facebook video. ""I have made mistakes and I have apologised.""
""I know that apologising is not enough,"" he said.
""A significant sector of the population has been protesting for days. I'm aware of the dissatisfaction and discomfort they feel. Only my work will help restore the trust of these sectors.""
The island's largest newspaper, El Nuevo DÃ­a, called on the governor to resign in its Monday editorial.
""Puerto Rico has spoken up, not only as a strong, broad and united voice, but as the right voice,"" the editorial said. ""With a gesture of nobility and humility, Governor, it is time to listen to the people. You have to resign.""
San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz said in a Twitter message on Monday: ""They can't deny it: The power is in the street.""
Singer Ricky Martin, who was targeted in the secret messages, was among those calling for the governor to resign, as well as Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and reggaeton star Bad Bunny.
""They mocked our dead, they mocked women, they mocked the LGBT community, they made fun of people with physical and mental disabilities, they made fun of obesity. It's enough. This cannot be,"" Martin said in a video on Twitter.
The island's political crisis has made headlines throughout mainland US.
The New York Times editorial board wrote that the ""callousness and partisan self-dealing"" exposed by the messages serve as exorbitant strain for the long-suffering island, effectively ""rubbing salt into a long-festering wound"".
""The Puerto Rican people have no use for petty political feuding,"" the New York Times wrote. ""Their territory is struggling under the weight of government corruption, incompetence and indifference. Having been failed by their leaders at every level, they are out of patience. They deserve better.""
Similarly, the editorial board for the Washington Post said that while Puerto Ricans may be aware that the mainland treats them ""like second-class citizens"", the messages are evidence that their local government also regards them with contempt.
And the island's problems run much deeper than Mr RossellÃ³, the Post wrote.
""It is clear that the island's problems won't be solved simply with his departure. Serious, systematic reform is needed.""
Indeed, several outlets described the scandal as a consequence of foundational failings among Puerto Rico's political class.
""You may think the protests erupting in Puerto Rico are all about the government's texting scandal,"" CNN reported. ""But the problems run much deeper.""
The last two weeks ""are just the culmination of the worst political crisis in modern Puerto Rico's history"", a journalist for NBC wrote. ""All of this dysfunction is a product of a corrupt (mostly white, mostly privileged) political class that has ruled the island for decades."""
"The diplomatic travails of President Trump and his past Twitter fixation with Kristen Stewart provided plenty of fodder for “Saturday Night Live” this weekend. But a sketch lampooning Sean M. Spicer, the White House press secretary, in which he was impersonated by Melissa McCarthy, the comic actress and a surprise guest star, stole the show as “S. N. L. ” continued to take swings at a president who delights in hitting back. In the show’s cold open, Alec Baldwin returned for another outing as Mr. Trump, phoning up other world leaders under the guidance of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon (actually an “S. N. L. ” cast member dressed as the Grim Reaper). As Mr. Trump, Mr. Baldwin first called Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia (Beck Bennett) who reminded him that President Barack Obama promised to receive 1, 200 refugees held in detention in Australia. “No refugees,” Mr. Baldwin said hastily. “America first, Australia sucks. Your reef is failing. Prepare to go to war. ” He went on to call President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico (“Guy who’s going to pay for the wall says what? ”) Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany (“I’m going to write a memoir about this struggle, and call it ‘My Struggle’  —   what would that be in German? ”) and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Mr. Mugabe (Kenan Thompson) was not impressed or intimidated: “I will rip out your spine and drink from your skull,” he told Mr. Baldwin. In her opening monologue, Ms. Stewart, the show’s host, recalled a period in 2012 when Mr. Trump posted several tweets about the relationship she had with her “Twilight”   Robert Pattinson. (In one tweet Mr. Trump wrote that Ms. Stewart “cheated on him like a dog  will do it again,” and in another he invited Mr. Pattinson to attend the Miss Universe pageant.) “To be fair,” Ms. Stewart said, “I don’t think Donald Trump hated me. I think he’s in love with my boyfriend. ” She added, “The president is not a huge fan of me. But that is so O. K. And Donald, if you didn’t like me then, you’re really probably not going to like me now. Because I’m hosting S. N. L. and I’m, like, so gay, dude. ” Still, the night belonged to Ms. McCarthy, the star of “Bridesmaids” and “Ghostbusters,” who came out in thinning blond hair and an   suit to play an aggressive,   version of Mr. Spicer as he led a daily White House press briefing. “I know that myself and the press have gotten off to a rocky start,” she said, starting off the session. “When I say rocky start, I mean it in the sense of ‘Rocky,’ the movie, because I came out here to punch you in the face. And also I don’t talk so good. ” As Mr. Spicer, Ms. McCarthy then told the press corps she would be “apologizing, on behalf of you, to me, for how you have treated me these last two weeks. ” “And that apology is not accepted,” she added. Discussing Mr. Trump’s recent announcement that he would nominate Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Ms. McCarthy said, “The crowd greeted him with a standing ovation, which lasted a full 15 minutes. And you can check the tape on that. Everyone was smiling. Everyone was happy. The men all had erections, and every single one of the women was ovulating left and right. And no one, no one was sad. Those are the facts forever. ” An addled Ms. McCarthy then read her own email password, and tangled with a New York Times reporter (played by Bobby Moynihan) who asked why Mr. Trump did or did not use the word “ban” when describing his executive order prohibiting travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. “You just said that,” she told the reporter. “He’s quoting you. It’s your words. He’s using your words, when you use the words and he uses them back, it’s circular using of the word and that’s from you. ” When a Wall Street Journal reporter simply asked, “Are you O. K.?” Ms. McCarthy charged at her with her podium and threatened, “I will put you in the corner with CNN. ” (The screen then showed a CNN reporter in a cage.) Mr. Trump has posted complaints and criticisms of “Saturday Night Live” on his Twitter account over the past several months, though he has not weighed in on the show in the weeks since his inauguration. (Nor, as of this writing, has Mr. Spicer.) Mr. Baldwin, whose impression of Mr. Trump has often been a target of the president’s ire, is scheduled to host “S. N. L. ” next Saturday, Feb. 11."

 _Viv Forbes has science qualifications and field experience in reading the history of extinctions in Earth’s rocky archives._



We don’t need rowdy Extinction Reb-hellions on our streets – we need Education on Extinctions in our science academies, classrooms and media. 



Extinctions are natural events that close every chapter of Earth’s history – they remove species that can’t cope with competition or change. 



The rocks are Earth’s archives, recording past climates, extinctions, ice ages, droughts, planetary impacts and volcanic activities. There is NOTHING unusual about current conditions or trends except for today’s huge human population. (Dinosaurs also were very numerous and successful, but only remnants of their line remain today.) 



There are at least 17 major extinctions recorded in Earth’s archives. They are revealed by discontinuities in surface outcrops, and in drill logs and core samples taken from deep drilling, sea sediment sampling, lake strata, tree rings, stalactite rings and ice cores. 



There is zero evidence in Earth’s archives of an extinction event caused by high levels of carbon dioxide or by gradual global warming. In fact, we see the reverse – warm eras like the modern warming are followed closely by higher levels of carbon dioxide, which encourages plants and supports abundant life on Earth. Past extinctions were caused by meteor impacts, earth movements, geomagnetic reversals, volcanism, tidal waves and changing sea levels. Most eras are closed by life-extinguishing ice ages. 



**Increasing ice is the big thing we have to fear.** This is always followed by declining levels of the gases of life (carbon dioxide and water vapor) in the atmosphere. This twin disaster will herald widespread starvation of all plants and animals on Earth. 



The planet’s archives will then record one more Extinction Event.

Well, as Bokonon said, “Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God”. So as a result of the usual mix of misconceptions and coincidences, we’ve got the house-sitter to stay in the house when we’re gone, and the ladies and I are going to England. The ladies, in this case, are my gorgeous ex-fiancée and our daughter, she’s 21. They’ve been to England before, but I’ve always travelled in the third world, never made it to the land of my ancestors, or at least some of them.
In any case, here’s the current travel plan, subject as always to time, as in “time yet for a hundred indecisions. And for a hundred visions and revisions. Before the taking of a toast and tea.”
We arrive in London on Monday the second of September, and we’ll be there for four days, ’til Thursday. Then a week or so to drive up the west coast of the island, and another week or so to go across and drive down the east coast.
Anyhow, that’s the scheme. If you happen to live along that route and wanted to say hi, post your town and where it’s near, maybe a few words about yourself. If we happen to go by there, all I can say is we MAY get in touch … or not. Heck, once I get to London, I may never make it out of the city much, who knows? I just attempt to follow the dancing lessons, but it’s generally not as simple as when you have the dance steps painted on the floor …
Best to all,
w.

I have zero sympathy for _MediaWorks_ and their impending demise. In fact, I’m pretty positive that the vast majority here could give them a collective ‘we told you so’ as they walk out the door with their desk contents in a biodegradable cardboard box!



As small children, I’m sure we all had occasion to end an argument by putting fingers in ears and singing la, la, la, la to the persons view we were opposed to. If you actually shut your eyes, you could take it to the next level where all you could hear was the sound of your own voice. Of course, when the noise stopped and the ears were unplugged, reality set in that what the other person had said was correct and the situation had not changed.



Yet another prime example of the above was witnessed yesterday on talkback radio when the hapless Stephen McIvor valiantly sang the praises of _MediaWorks_ for having the ‘best news’ and would immediately blag anyone saying anything to the contrary. All these la, la singers (including Williams and Plunket), need to do is have a listen to one of their own news readings in which there is obviously a rule of 3 being implemented:



2\. Imminent world destruction soon from Climate Change



3\. Trump is an idiot. 



Yet every time I have heard these three commentators confronted with this truth, the messenger is immediately shot and labelled a right-wing nut job. Of course, most of us ‘nut jobs’ trying to advise them either run our own businesses or have a fairly intimate knowledge of the simplicity of business being to make money so that you can eat!

When Pope Francis comes to the US to speak about environmental and economic issues he would do well to stop in Chicago and ponder the remarkable story of that city’s river. The Chicago River made the city, and then the city made the river.



As the chief waterway connecting the mid‐​continent to the Great Lakes, the Chicago River was a magnet for settlement and trade in the early 1800s. The city that rose on the shores of Lake Michigan had unstoppable commercial potential. Even the devastating fire of 1871 that left 100,000 people homeless—nearly a third of the population at the time—proved only a temporary setback. By the end of the decade the city was home to half a million people.



But the bigger threat was from water, specifically sewage. The city dumped human and industrial waste into its river, and drew its drinking water from cribs located far out in the lake beyond where the sewage plume could reach. But periodic rainfalls would push the sewage out past the intakes and contaminate the water supply. Public works projects over the previous decades had failed to solve this risk and every year there were outbreaks of deadly cholera and typhoid.



On August 2, 1885, a massive storm dropped six inches of rain on the city, and the resulting sewage plume overwhelmed the intake cribs. The resulting epidemic killed over ten percent of the city’s population. The crisis had to be solved.





Economic growth and environmental protection can go hand‐​in‐​hand, as long as people focus on real issues and effective strategies.



The solution came in the form of the construction of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, a trench through the continental divide that would allow drainage of water from Lake Michigan into the Mississippi River via the lower branch of the Chicago River. It took 15 years and over 8,000 workers to build, but in 1900 the final cut was made. In what would later be called one of the greatest civil engineering feats of the millennium, the flow of the Chicago River was reversed. The water contamination crisis ended and the city of Chicago entered a century of extraordinary prosperity.



Not everyone was happy with the project though. Not surprisingly, cities downriver like St. Louis, tried to block the plan. But in time, and as resources became available, construction of proper sewage treatment plants alleviated the downstream pollution load.



Why should the Pope care about this story? Look closely and it tells us much that we need to know about what the poor in today’s world need to do to achieve their own path of economic development.



Imagine how differently the story would play out today. When the flood hit in 1885, nobody thought to blame it on “climate change” or to claim that households burning coal to heat their homes were responsible for the deaths. Nobody suggested that the solution was to raise the cost of fuel for poor people and use the money to subsidise battery‐​powered cars for the rich, or to try and shut down the industries on which people depended for their livelihood in the hope that it would somehow modify the weather and, in a hundred years or so, slightly reduce the probability of future floods.



Or at least if anyone did propose such foolishness, nobody paid attention. Instead the leaders of the day confronted the reality of the situation and called for a practical, adaptive solution. It involved a massive reconfiguration of the natural landscape, for the betterment of the humans who were suffering from its ravages. The result was not only relief from disease and death, but a pathway to the prosperity that then paid for, among other things, effective pollution control that saved the river.



Like waterways across the USA, the Chicago River is far cleaner today than it was a hundred years ago, and while it is not perfect, it is once again home to a rich variety of fish and plant life. In the same way, air quality in Chicago has improved, despite the massive growth of the city and its industry, because the wealth from economic growth paid for technologies that have decoupled economic growth from air pollution.



The lesson for the Pope is that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand‐​in‐​hand, as long as people focus on real issues and effective strategies. When discussion of environmental issues degenerates into abstract, ideological concepts, money and effort get wasted on futile symbolic gestures. This is the biggest failure of the international obsession with global warming. In the American context such measures have included subsidies for wind turbines and solar panels, tax breaks for expensive electric cars, regulatory overkill, and excess compliance costs for industries and power plants that get passed disproportionately onto low‐​income households. And far too many poor countries are emulating the worst of these measures, to their own economic detriment.



This is not to say that every massive civil engineering project is a good idea—far from it! But the reversal of the Chicago River was an effective response to a real crisis that was killing thousands of people. It saved countless lives and helped lay the groundwork for a century of human and environmental improvement. By focusing on a real issue and implementing a practical project that directly tackled a genuine problem, an earlier generation of Americans set an example that holds important lessons for world leaders today.

Danish Chinese scientists discover important relationship: Arctic sea ice development of the last 5000 years is controlled by solar activity
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Satellites began systematically measuring sea ice about 35 years ago. Such a data series is much too short to allow conclusions to be drawn concerning long-term trends. Thus it is necessary to use geological studies to trace back sea ice development far into the past. In October 2010 we reported on such a study and found that Baltic sea ice cover over the last 500 years has been coupled with solar activity. In October 2013, we also wrote another blog article on the subject (see our blog article “Arctic sea ice melted and grew in sync with the sun over the past 500 years“).
In June 2014 in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, a Danish-Chinese team published a paper led by Longbin Sha. They reconstructed sea ice over the past 500 years at a bay located in Western Greenland The result in shown in Figure 1 and shows that sea ice was in sync with solar activity. The authors also found that fluctuations in solar activity were an important factor of influence for changes in sea ice over the last 5000 years. What follows is the abstract of the paper:
Relatively warm conditions with a strong influence of the Irminger Current (IC) were indicated for the early part of the record (~ 5000–3860 cal. yr BP), corresponding in time to the latest part of the Holocene Thermal Maximum. Between 3860 and 1510 cal. yr BP, April SIC oscillated around the mean value (55%) and during the time interval 1510–1120 cal. yr BP and after 650 cal. yr BP was above the mean, indicating more extensive sea-ice cover in Disko Bugt. Agreement between reconstructed April SIC and changes in the diatom species suggests that the sea-ice condition in Disko Bugt was strongly influenced by variations in the relative strength of two components of the West Greenland Current, i.e. the cold East Greenland Current and the relatively warm IC. Further analysis of the reconstructed SIC record suggests that solar radiation may be an important forcing mechanism behind the historic sea-ice changes.”

The scale shows that solar activity was the primary driving factor over centuries, while ocean cycles played an important role on a decadal scale. In January 2014 a Norwegian-German-US research team published a paper on this in the Geophysical Research Letters. The scientists found a clear natural rhythm of 60-90 years where the Arctic sea ice grew and shrank. The research showed that the sea ice cycles apparently were driven by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). As a result the authors also believe that the sea ice will grow once again in the years and decades, (see Figure 2).

The following is the abstract of the study:
A signal of persistent Atlantic multidecadal variability in Arctic sea ice
Satellite data suggest an Arctic sea ice-climate system in rapid transformation, yet its long-term natural modes of variability are poorly known. Here we integrate and synthesize a set of multicentury historical records of Atlantic Arctic sea ice, supplemented with high-resolution paleoproxy records, each reflecting primarily winter/spring sea ice conditions. We establish a signal of pervasive and persistent multidecadal (~60–90 year) fluctuations that is most pronounced in the Greenland Sea and weakens further away. Covariability between sea ice and Atlantic multidecadal variability as represented by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) index is evident during the instrumental record, including an abrupt change at the onset of the early twentieth century warming. Similar covariability through previous centuries is evident from comparison of the longest historical sea ice records and paleoproxy reconstructions of sea ice and the AMO. This observational evidence supports recent modeling studies that have suggested that Arctic sea ice is intrinsically linked to Atlantic multidecadal variability. This may have implications for understanding the recent negative trend in Arctic winter sea ice extent, although because the losses have been greater in summer, other processes and feedbacks are also important.”
In 2014 Paul Homewood wrote about this at WUWT. Homewood also sees cooling for the Arctic over the coming 30 years due to the AMO:
All these stations, ranging from western Greenland to Siberia, show essentially the same pattern, a warm period around 1940, comparable to now, and a much colder interlude in the  1960’s and 70’s. And, of course, these all closely follow the ups and downs of the AMO. There seems little doubt that the Arctic will be in for another cold period during the next 30 years or so, and that, as Judith Curry indicates, we will see a long term recovery of Arctic ice extent.”

"Aditi Ashok is only 18 years old, but like any aspiring pro golfer, she knows the story of Ok Hee Ku and Se Ri Pak, who in the 1980s and ’90s changed women’s golf by starting the South Korean wave. Ashok may be that trailblazer for India. She was among the early leaders in the women’s tournament at the 2016 Rio Olympics and parlayed that experience into two victories in the fall on the Ladies European Tour, where she earned top rookie honors for 2016 and finished second in earnings with seven   finishes. Golf is an emerging sport somewhere behind cricket, soccer, field hockey and tennis in India, a nation of more than 1. 3 billion people. But that may change soon, thanks to players like Ashok. Anirban Lahiri is the only native of India with full status on the PGA Tour. Currently ranked 86th in the world, Lahiri has been ranked as high as 33rd. Arjun Atwal, currently ranked 969th, remains the only Indian winner on the PGA Tour, with his victory at the 2010 Wyndham Championship. Daniel Chopra, winner of two PGA Tour titles, grew up in India but is a Swedish citizen. But no Indian woman has ever won an L. P. G. A. Tour event. Ashok, at No. 100, is the   Indian woman since Simi Mehra, who played on the tour for several years beginning in 1997 and attained a   ranking of No. 17 in 1998. Only six Indian women are currently world ranked, compared with 148 Indian men. “Golf is definitely growing in India, but for the number of people we have, we still don’t have enough players, especially women players,” said Ashok, who is from Bangalore. Ashok found herself in the spotlight when she returned home as an Olympian last summer. Weeks later, she won the Ladies European Tour event in India and added a second win the next week in Qatar. “There was clearly a huge sense of pride from the local crowd when Aditi won the Hero Women’s Indian Open,” said Bethan Cutler, who handles communications for the Ladies European Tour. Cutler called Ashok’s win a “game changer for female golfers” in India. When asked what she thought it would take for her country to embrace golf, Ashok was pragmatic. “It’s not just about golf, and it takes more than talent,” she said. “It’s the culture. It’s about sports in general, and once the   changes and girls start picking up sports, there will be more players in golf. ” The Professional Golf Tour of India offered 25 tournaments last year for male professionals, many of whom also competed on the Asian Tour and the European Tour. But Indian women had fewer opportunities, with 16 tournaments on their Hero Women’s Professional Golf Tour. With significantly fewer women playing the game in India, it took more than a decade for the small professional Women’s Golf Association of India to grow to 30 members. Champika Sayal, secretary general of the association, and Mehra helped establish a professional tour for Indian women. Mehra organized a Skins Game in 2005, inviting three L. P. G. A. players to India to play an exhibition. A young Indian pro also competed in the event, alongside Mehra. “I remember it being quite historic and emotional for everyone involved,” said Heather   one of the invited pros and now the L. P. G. A.’s chief tour operations officer. Mehra won 25 amateur tournaments throughout Asia before turning professional and becoming the L. P. G. A.’s first Indian player by qualifying for the tour in 1996. She won three times on what is now the   Symetra Tour and posted two   finishes on the L. P. G. A. tour, where she played until 2008. Professional sports for women was a foreign concept in India in the 1990s, when Mehra began her golf career. She had no support from her country on any level and was encouraged only by her peers on the L. P. G. A. Tour. “I felt completely alone and a bit lost during my first few years on tour,” said Mehra, now 44. “But I had amazing women as my idols and friends who made me feel like I belonged there. ” Those L. P. G. A. peers donated their used golf equipment and balls to Mehra, who shipped the golf gear to India to help girls get started in the game. She would travel back and forth between the United States and India, shuttling equipment, playing in tournaments to support fledgling Indian events, and reminding her compatriots that opportunity existed. “It’s a little easier when you see someone else do it,” Ashok said when asked about India’s history in golf. “I still listen to Simi because of all she’s gone through. ” The number of Indian women playing professional golf still lags behind the number of female pros in many other nations, but it has grown from Mehra’s early roster of one. At last year’s Hero Women’s Indian Open, now sanctioned by the Ladies European Tour, the field of 113 players included 17 Indians. The growth of the Women’s Indian Open has become a visible milestone since the first national championship for Indian women was started in 2007 by Sayal, Mehra and others  —   43 years after the men’s inaugural national championship. Another sign is the increase in girls playing golf. “There were three or four girls between ages 7 to 12 when I was a junior,” Ashok said. “Now, there are between 15 to 20 girls. That’s not a lot, but it’s getting better. ” Access to golf is also an issue in India, Ashok said, adding that there were six courses within one hour of her Bangalore home. “We don’t have a lot of space in India, but even if there were more driving ranges, it would help make golf more accessible and help promote the game,” she said. Ashok embraced golf at 5½ while having breakfast with her parents at a golf club in Bangalore. Their breakfast table overlooked the driving range, where players were hitting balls. After breakfast, the family walked over to the practice green, where Ashok was handed a putter and some golf balls. Two hours later, she left in love with a new game. She and her parents began taking lessons and playing golf together. “We were very intrigued,” said her father, Pandit Gudlamani Ashok, who works in real estate. Aditi played her first round of golf when she was just over 6. Her father thought she would be tired, but was surprised when she wanted to play more. Her mother, Mash Ashok, said: “We played regularly as a family, but as soon as she was keen and started playing it competitively and started to set her goals, we couldn’t play as often because of her schedule. It was more about being her support than playing golf ourselves. ” India did not offer separate tournaments for girls when Ashok began playing, so from age 7 to 12, she competed with boys. She could not outhit the boys in distance, so she sharpened her short game as the equalizer. Ashok captured attention in her homeland for the first time at 13 when she went head to head against Mehra in a 2011 professional event. She beat Mehra in a playoff. “That was huge,” Ashok said. “Simi is a fierce competitor, but she encouraged me. When I won that event, I knew I wanted to be a professional. ” When Ashok won the Women’s Indian Open in November, she edged out the L. P. G. A. veterans Brittany Lincicome and Belen Mozo. In Qatar, she won by three shots over the European Solheim Cup player Caroline Hedwall. “Aditi has a bright future, and India has an iconic young female golfer,” Sayal said. “Golf is finally coming of age for women in India. ” Ashok passed another milestone in early December when she earned high conditional status at the L. P. G. A.’s annual qualifying tournament in Florida, which will allow her to play in a number of tour events and give her the opportunity to move up should she play well. Now the second Indian member of the L. P. G. A. Ashok plans to play at least six European Tour tournaments this year, and as many L. P. G. A. events as possible. “What she has achieved is truly remarkable,” Mehra said. “I wish her all the success in a wonderful journey. ” Others hoping to follow Ashok’s success include seven Indian women who competed in the recent Ladies European Tour qualifying tournament in Morocco. When Ashok won the 2015 event, there were only two Indians in the field. “I think our country never thought that we could have contenders in golf,” Ashok said. “But if golfers from a small country like Korea can have success, it can be done by top players from India. ”"

The chart below shows the four coldest summers: 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2014.

Temperature vs calendar day for the 4 coldest summers above 80°N latitude. Blue horizontal line is 0°C . Four of the last six Arctic summers have been the coldest on the DMI record. Graphics snipped from the dmi.dk.
Arctic summers can be examined going back to 1958 using data from the Danish Meteorological Institute here. The 4 coldest Arctic summers have all occurred in the last 6 years. Not even the summers of the 1960s were colder.
Ocean currents impact the Arctic
It’s obvious that ice melt involves a lot more than just surface atmospheric temperature, and claims it is due to greenhouse gases are misleading and naïve. Other major factors involved are ocean cycles and weather and wind conditions.

From 1980 to 2000, both the AMO and PDO saw warm phases, and so the Arctic ice melt of the late 2000s was likely a reaction to the warmth. The PDO has since flipped to its cooler phase and the AMO is starting its entry into its cool phase. Many experts are expecting an Arctic summertime sea ice recovery over the next 2 decades.
Even Arctic sea ice experts are now backing off their projections of continued sea ice decline over the next 20 years, see here.
Global sea ice normal 2 years
Not only the North Pole is cooling, but so is the South Pole, which has been smashing record highs for sea ice extent a second year in a row, see here. Global sea ice has been slightly above average for almost 2 years now, thus flying in the faces of alarmists who obstinately cling to the belief of a warming planet.

"Despite the evidence that shows greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels are leading to changes in the planet’s climate, the development of large scale technologies to slow or stop these effects has been painfully slow. None more so than carbon capture and storage (CCS), the technology to extract CO2 from the exhaust gases of power stations, or from industrial processes such as cement, steel, fertiliser, petrochemicals and paper manufacturing, and bury it in porous rocks deep underground. But now the UK government has pledged £50m towards CCS at Peterhead gas power station in northeast Scotland. A joint venture between Shell and power company SSE, it is intended to become the world’s first CCS system attached to a gas power station, and would store CO2 in the depleted Goldeneye gas field 60 miles offshore. It is now the second CCS scheme to get recent UK government funding – the first, the White Rose CCS scheme at the Drax coal- and biomass-fired power station in Yorkshire, Britain’s largest power station, won a similar part of a total £100m investment in December last year. That these two projects are underway is the culmination of more than 10 years’ effort from industry, government, and academic research. While this is a unique industrial and energy engineering selling point for the UK, a compilation of CCS projects worldwide reveals that, at the most optimistic, only 21 projects are operating or under construction. This is considerably behind the schedule proposed by the International Energy Agency of more than 100. A common problem preventing wider roll-out of CCS is the perceived high costs of construction and operation, compared to running power plant without any measures to reduce CO2, despite numerous studies demonstrating that cleaning up emissions without CCS will be much more expensive, and slower to achieve. A major failure of governments and international bodies is the lack of binding CO2 emissions reduction targets. Even in Europe, the most climate-conscious of all the major trading blocs, the proposed Strategic Energy Plan for 2030 leaves CCS as an “option” to be “explored” by member states, which then, by a mysterious process yet to be invented, will contribute towards meeting the EU’s stated carbon reduction target.  All this translates as “lack of business model” – a polite way of saying that no sensible company would commit to CCS for many years yet, until government policy is sufficiently stable to safeguard their investment of time and money. What is needed is clarity and commitment from many governments in parallel – at the same level that has fostered the development of the renewable energy industry. But that means confronting Treasury, businesses and consumers with the unpopular news that their payments for electricity and heat must eventually rise by 15%. The British Isles are uniquely well placed to develop CCS: electricity generation is dominated by just six large power companies which the government should be able to influence, and there is an active, innovative engineering sector. Best of all, the British Isles are surrounded by some of the most extensive and best-known geological reservoirs to store CO2, with the expertise and technologies to develop these readily available within the North Sea offshore oil and gas workforce. But there have been a series of false starts. The first was a proposition from BP for a CCS at the Peterhead power plant using the Miller oil field for storage, which would have produced low-carbon electricity at less than the subsidies awarded to offshore wind farms today. It was rejected by the UK government in 2005. In 2007, the government opened the first UK CCS competition to bidders for funding. Eventually, the only remaining project was Scottish Power’s proposal for Longannet power station, but this was also scrapped in 2011 when the Treasury decided the extra £200m it would have cost was too expensive – despite receiving a record £11 billion of North Sea oil and gas tax revenue that year. This second, much more carefully controlled, competition was opened in 2012 and is now bearing fruit. The projects at Drax and Peterhead now enter an 18-month phase of technical, engineering, and financial design. Final decisions are not due before late 2015, and so will inevitably be complicated by the UK’s general election. At the most optimistic reading, CO2 could be injected into storage during late 2018. But these are just two experiments, to demonstrate that known technologies can work practically at a large scale – three other power plant projects have also been proposed, but are un-funded. To achieve sufficient de-carbonisation to make an impact on the UK’s 2030 carbon budget another 20 CCS projects will be needed. However, these three projects offer a different twist on the technology, by injecting the captured CO2 into depleted offshore oilfields to extract oil that would otherwise be left underground. Estimates of how much this would raise production rates range from 5% to 20%. Our research at SCCS shows this is feasible and can even be configured to store more CO2 than is produced by the extra oil. A useful side effect is a further £200 billion of oil tax revenue brought to the UK exchequer. But this needs joined-up co-operation, as demanded by Sir Ian Wood’s review of the North Sea oilfields, and is complicated by issues of ownership between the UK and Scottish governments, with the independence referendum looming. If the UK is serious about using CCS, then bringing these follow-on projects to commercial realisation is the single most urgent item to tackle, now that the first two grant-funded projects are on their path. The UK has the engineering skills, the technology, and plentiful storage sites, supported by skilled civil servants, regulations, and a unique financial package through the government’s contracts-for-difference that offer higher prices to low-carbon power generators. Whether CCS emerges from pilot projects to widely deployed industrial reality depends on the political priorities, courage and credibility of this government, and the next."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen alarmist climate institutes roll out papers claiming global warming is going to cause severely cold winters, then you have to wonder if they know something is up and are acting preemptively to salvage their crumbling climate science, which not long ago predicted with high confidence balmy snowless winters.
A few reports have already come out indicating this winter could be a real doozy – at least for wide parts of North America. But now we are starting to see such reports popping up for Europe as well.
“Damned cold winter”
Now the Swiss online news site Blick here has an article warning of a “damned cold” winter. Blick begins:
Meteorologists and weather enthusiasts agree: This winter is going to be damned cold. Responsible for this is the early snow in Siberia.”
Blick describes how much of Siberia is already covered with snow, in some places by “up to a half meter”, and it’s only October. This claim is based on the latest NOAA snow cover data. The ECMWF also shows:

Projected snow cover by the ECMWF. Much of Russia will be already covered by snow, providing the ideal breeding grounds for a powerful midwinter Siberian high. See sunriseswansong.wordpress.com. 
Early Siberian snow – already snow covered!
But what does that have to do with the winter weather in Europe? Blick explains:
The earlier that snow is on the ground in Siberia, the stronger a Siberian high develops. This blows icy winds also to us in Switzerland.”
Looks like Europeans will have to get used to Russia exporting bitter cold instead of gas. If things develop so, then things could get nastilly interesting for Europe and its winter energy needs. Not to worry though. The old continent has much green energy capacity, which will especially help out (in the springtime when the sun is high enough to power solar panels).

“Warmest year on record” sees early Siberian snow, forecasts of severe winter?
This cold winter development seems to fly in the face of one particular dataset, which claimed 2014 was on track to be “the hottest on record”. Swiss Radio here also reports on how Siberian snow can impact Europe’s winters:
The story is simple: the earlier snow covers the ground in Siberia, the colder it gets there at the start of winter. And the colder it gets in Siberia at the start of winter, the stronger and more powerful the Siberian high becomes in mid winter. And when the Siberian high is strong, then we get invasions of cold air masses. The winter will be cold.”
SRF adds that “one has to go back a few years” to find so much snow in Siberia this early. The SRF even links to a paper on the subject.
Massive Siberian snow also bodes ill for North American winter
weathersavior.com writes here as well:
The rapid increase of snow cover across Siberia in October usually leads to a potentially colder winter in the US due to a negative Arctic Oscillation. A negative AO will allow Arctic air to infiltrate the U.S and is one of the driving factors for snow lovers in the Northeastern U.S.”
Meanwhile, sunriseswansong.wordpress.com writes that the early Siberian snows are what is needed for “breeding bitter cold” and that Joe Bastardi says the current Northern Hemisphere snow cover for this time of year is the 3rd highest!
Finally Kirk Mellish writes that the “Eurasia snowfall is off to a record fast start, which is historically a harbinger of cold winters as shown by research by Dr. Cohen of MIT. It does not guarantee it, but makes it more likely.”
No one can know how the winter will really pan out, and other outcomes just can’t be ruled out. But one thing is sure: the present. And it is showing that the northern hemisphere winter is off to a really nasty start.

As Britain leaves the EU, is it time to re‐​examine our membership and funding of another international institution — the United Nations (UN)?



Asking such a question will no doubt rile those who see the UN’s existence as inherently virtuous. A genuine forum for sovereign nation states to discuss international affairs and cooperate is a worthy aim.



Yet the UN is increasingly toothless when needed, and its bloated bureaucracies pollute policy debates with socialist platitudes, all funded by taxpayers. With President Donald Trump promising major cuts to US funding, it is surely time for Britain to support a robust reform agenda.





It’s high time the UN’s activity was critically evaluated.



Just last week, a UN committee sharply criticised the UK government’s failure to fulfill its commitments under the convention on disabled people’s rights. Theresia Degener, who leads the UN’s Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, went further, describing welfare reforms here as a “human catastrophe”.



Whatever one thinks of the Conservative government’s record, it is reasonable to hope such UN employees would be more careful with language. In some UN member states, such as Ghana, disabled people are beaten and chained. In others, such as Venezuela, people of all mental and physical capabilities are dying of starvation.



But no matter — a lack of prioritisation and hysterical incursions in UK domestic debates are nothing new. In 2013, a former Brazilian housing minister was sent by the UN to collect some anecdotal evidence, and in turn declared the so‐​called “bedroom tax” “shocking”. Presumably the existence of shanty towns in other member states (including Brazil) was a second order concern.



Highly partisan reports like this, which always tend to be particularly critical of major Western capitalist democracies, are commonplace.



According to the UN, Britain is ranked 156th out of 165 participating countries for “kids’ rights”.



If you think this is a genuine reflection of the welfare and rights of children here relative to other countries — including Venezuela and Saudi Arabia — who are ranked higher than us, then I have a bridge to sell you.



Then again, what are we to expect from an organisation whose Human Rights Council recently appointed a representative from Saudi Arabia to its 2018–2022 “Commission on the Status of Women”, which is “exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality”? In Saudi Arabia, women are still banned from driving.



But no doubt we can look forward to that Commission criticising Britain’s so‐​called “gender pay gap”, as representatives from Sudan and Algeria did in our 2012 Universal Review. This featured other delights, such as Russia criticising “police brutality” in the UK, Vietnam denouncing our “austerity”, Cuba urging us to protect economic and social rights, and China discussing the freedom to protest.



Then there’s the UN’s often bizarre incursions into economic debates.



In 2014, its Conference on Trade and Development published a report which seemingly argued in favour of protectionism and significant industrial policies, rather than trade liberalisation.



In 2015, Christiana Figueres, who was then the executive secretary of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, appeared to announce her belief that to combat climate change we needed to “intentionally… change the economic development model” which has produced untold prosperity in the past 200 years.



This is not even to mention the UN’s repeated anti‐​Israel bias, and its failures in the field of foreign policy.



Why are British taxpayers funding this nonsense?



Though only on the hook for around £100m per year to the regular budget (and additional funds for its peacekeeping one), what exactly are we getting out of this?



That’s certainly a question the Trump administration is asking for US taxpayers, and with the US paying out a whopping $8bn per year, who can blame him?



It’s high time the UN’s activity was critically evaluated.



No doubt there are some worthy projects. But we need to be honest about the organisation’s opaque and inadequately robust performance management, high costs and overheads, not to mention the lack of accountability for UN staff (with rumours circulating of a major scandal expected soon), and the culture of agencies creaming off funds and replicating work unnecessarily to the detriment of taxpayers.



Any international body which incorporates as many non‐​democratic countries as the UN is by construction always going to be imperfect. But that makes it all the more important for countries such as the UK and US to continually review their roles.



At the very least, government ministers have a responsibility to ensure UN funds are spent on worthy areas of international cooperation, rather than the left‐​wing virtue signalling we have seen in recent years.



In Trump’s administration, the UK may find an ally willing to countenance more meaningful reform.

[ **Croaking Cassandra**](https://croakingcassandra.com/2019/10/10/rents-should-have-been-falling/)



Statistics New Zealand Thursday morning released its monthly residential rentals series. I don’t usually pay any attention to these data but since I’d been thinking about the very low level of real interest rates, I decided to take a quick look for once.



The series goes back to November 2006. They have both stock and flow-based measures, the latter being available on a regional basis. Nominal rents have risen by about 50 per cent since 2006, and these are the changes in real (CPI-adjusted) rentals on each of these measures over that period.



Something like a 15-20 per cent increase (depending on whether you prefer the stock or flow measure) over 13 years might not seem too bad. That’s a rate of increase of about 1 per cent per annum.



But that really is the wrong way to look at the issue. After all, renting a house/flat involves paying for the use of a long-lived asset. And the key influence that should influence any change in the supply price of such assets changes in the cost of finance, returns to alternative uses of money etc.



In November 2006 the real 10-year government bond rates was about 3.25 per cent (roughly so whether one uses the one indexed bond then on issue or takes a nominal bond yield and subtracts surveyed medium-term inflation expectations). The real 10-year bond rate is now about 0.15 per cent. What about the risk premium? The Treasury guidance to government agencies suggests using an equity risk premium of 7 per cent. One could play around with different estimates, and with assumptions about how much diversification housing might add to a portfolio. But it doesn’t seem unreasonable to work with a rough estimate that the required rate of return should have fallen by perhaps a third since 2006. All else equal, in a well-functioning market, we might reasonably have expected to have seen a significant **fall** in real rentals over that period.



Of course, the standard counter is “oh but falling interest rates raise the price of fixed assets”. Often enough that isn’t even true for assets in genuinely fixed supply – since long-term real interest rates rise and fall for reasons that often have something to do with the expected future returns in the wider economy – but even to the extent it is true, in a well-functioning housing market the only component of a “house plus land” bundle that is in genuinely fixed supply is unimproved land itself. The supply of anything else can be augmented, and in a well-functioning market almost without effective limit.



In a free market, in a country with as much land and as few people as New Zealand, most unimproved land isn’t very valuable at all. Just suppose it was worth $50000 a hectare (and actual New Zealand farmland [traded](https://www.interest.co.nz/rural/resources/farm-sales) at a median of just under $25000 a hectare most recently) and that you could get 7 houses to a hectare (a decent sized section and the associated roads and footpaths), the value of the unimproved land under a standalone house would be worth less than $10000. As something like a perpetuity, the lower interest rates might have raised that value by a third, an amount that – relative to New Zealand median residential prices – is really almost lost in the rounding.



The substantial reduction in real interest rates shouldn’t dramatically affect the supply price of a new building. Raw materials prices – timber, cement, fittings etc – should not be affected. Nor, really, should the price of labour: perhaps interest rates are low partly because productivity growth is low but, broadly speaking, any such weakness will be matched over time by lower growth in real wages. If anything, there is an in-principle argument that much lower interest rates may have lowered the supply price of new developments, because there is often quite a lag between acquiring land for development and being able to put the finished product on the market (inevitable market delays and regulatory delays), Lower interest rates mean lower costs of financing those lags.



In a well-functioning market it might not have been unreasonable to have expected, say, no change in nominal rents nationwide over the 13 years, not a 50 per cent increase.



But, of course, we don’t have a well-functioning market at all. We have one consistently and systematically rigged against competition and development by local councils and their central government enablers. There is no scarcity of unimproved land in New Zealand. But councils – councillors and staff planners – combine to create an artificial scarcity of developable land, such that in the face of one of the largest falls in real interest rates in history, to unprecedentedly low levels, rental housing is not abundant and cheap (as readily reproducible longlived assets should be in this climate) but scarce and expensive. Utter government failure if ever I saw one.



Bits of both arms of government occasionally talk a good game about freeing up land supply, but **it is central government that is currently consulting on making less peripheral land available.** It is a senior member of the Labour Party council – a Wellington city councillor – who when she rang me on a canvassing call a few weeks ago offered the unprompted observation (when I asked about fixing housing) that she didn’t want any more of that “sprawl” – this in a city with abundant, if often undulating, land. In many cases, their vision is to have us packed in like sardines – more “efficient” like that, supposedly – and they feed that personal preference, or sense of inevitability, by making land so expensive that many people feel they no longer have that historic New World option of space – in cities that, by global standards, remain pretty small.



When people complain about rents, and particularly the plight of people at the bottom with few choices but to rent, **they need to sheet home responsibility to our governors – central and local.** Perhaps a future National government would be different, but they too talked a good talk when they were last in Opposition and did nothing then. There isn’t yet much reason to think they’d be different next time.



Whatever the other risks, downsides, and complications of exceptionally low interest rates, the market has delivered a climate in which the real cost of decent housing should never have been cheaper. It takes governments – central and local, left and right ( in this area a distinction without a difference as they all enable planners) – to have produced rising real rents in a decade like this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast Wednesday Seva Energie AG, located at the north German Ecopark in Emstek, announced insolvency. According to company 160 employees are affected. The news is the latest blow to the German renewable energy sector, which has seen a long string of similar insolvencies due to reduced subsidies and strong competition from abroad.
Seva Energie is specialized in thermal power stations, biogas and fuels.
The north German daily Münsterländische Tageszeitung here writes that the company is a “victim of the changed feed-in act conditions“. Especially hard hit was the company’s biogas systems area, which earlier had been massively supported through government subsidies for the growth of biofuel crops.
Seva Energie’s homepage motto:
SEVA Energie AG: We take responsibility for the next generation!
SEVA ENERGIE AG are focusing on the domain of regenerative energy and, by doing so, take on responsibility for those generations to come. With our technology, we would like to make a contribution towards a considerate treatment of resources which are available on our planet and towards the generating of energy without inflicting harm on the environment.”
That may be all fine and good, but perhaps policymakers and managers ought to first begin by taking responsibility for today’s generation – by promoting sustainable jobs that can survive without subsidies.
According to the mission statement, the company was founded in 1982 having recognized “anticipated scarcity of fossil fuels” and…”the enormous potential in the utilisation of regenerative energies.”
Unfortunately that potential was one merely fabricated by exorbitant, non-sustainable government subsidies – based on the junk science of global warming. Now 160 workers are facing uncertain futures, joining thousands of other victims of the German renewable energy illusion.

@bkparallax @IamDonCheadle the power to change climate lies in hands of every individual on the planet, not a single gov't–or technology!
— Katharine Hayhoe (@KHayhoe) August 29, 2013

With the way Hayhoe described that, I couldn’t help think of, and embellish, this famous opening segment. With apologies to, The Outer Limits. 

There is nothing wrong with your planet. Do not attempt to adjust the temperature. We are controlling the climate. If we wish to make it warmer, we will bring up the climate sensitivity. If we wish to make it cooler, we will tune it to a whisper. We will control the Carbon Dioxide. We will control the solar insolation. We can roll the temperature, make it flutter. We can change the data to a soft blur or sharpen it to crystal clarity. For the next decade, sit quietly and we will control all data you see and hear. We repeat: there is nothing wrong with your planet. You are about to participate in a great adventure. You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to – The Climate Limits.

"A Russian technology executive who was named in a dossier containing unverified allegations about connections between President Trump and the Russian government has sued BuzzFeed News, which published the information. The defamation suit was filed in court on Friday in Broward County, Fla. according to lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, the chief of XBT, a technology company based in Luxembourg. The suit focuses on allegations, made near the end of the dossier, that Mr. Gubarev and his company were involved in hacking operations against the leadership of the Democratic Party. In the complaint, Mr. Gubarev’s lawyers say that BuzzFeed acted recklessly that none of the statements have any basis in fact and that Mr. Gubarev’s association with the dossier has left his reputation “in tatters,” compromised his family’s security and damaged his company’s business prospects. It called BuzzFeed’s decision “perhaps one of the most reckless and irresponsible moments in modern ‘journalism. ’” The publishing of the dossier was one of the most startling moments of the weeks before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Compiled by a former British intelligence operative who was hired by Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals and later by supporters of Hillary Clinton, the document had circulated for months among   government officials and journalists. The veracity of its claims had been investigated but never proved. But after CNN reported last month that intelligence officials had presented a summary of the allegations to Mr. Trump and President Barack Obama, BuzzFeed decided to publish the document in full, saying that “Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the   that have circulated at the highest levels of the U. S. government. ” When it published the dossier, BuzzFeed noted that it contained errors and that its claims had not been verified. The publication’s editor in chief, Ben Smith, later wrote that its reporters in the United States and Europe spent weeks investigating the report. BuzzFeed ignited a debate over both the claims in the report as well as the outlet’s decision to break from typical journalistic practices in publishing it. Mr. Trump denounced the unproven claims as a   smear, and called BuzzFeed a “failing pile of garbage” during a heated news conference on Jan. 11. Mr. Gubarev’s lawsuit claims that while more than 30 publications tried to contact him after the dossier’s publication, he was not contacted by BuzzFeed for his response to the allegations. Mr. Gubarev, 36, lives in Cyprus with his wife and three children. He founded the site Webzilla  —   which is also identified in the report, the complaint notes  —   and built it into an international business, XBT, with more than 300 employees around the world. The lawsuit was filed in Florida, where Webzilla is registered. A federal lawsuit over the publishing of a sex tape featuring the wrestler Hulk Hogan that led the website Gawker to file for bankruptcy and eventually shut down was also filed in the state. That case, over invasion of privacy, remains a cautionary tale in the media world. After learning of the lawsuit on Friday, BuzzFeed removed the names of Mr. Gubarev and his company from the dossier. “We have redacted Mr. Gubarev’s name from the published dossier, and apologize for including it,” the company said in an emailed statement to The New York Times. A spokesman for BuzzFeed said it had redacted other names in the document and should have redacted Mr. Gubarev’s, but the spokesman defended the company’s decision to publish the dossier. Mr. Gubarev’s lawyers have also filed a lawsuit in Britain against the former intelligence agent who compiled the report and his consulting company. The lawsuit against BuzzFeed comes at a tense moment for the news media. Mr. Trump’s administration has castigated journalists for challenging unverified or false claims presented by the White House as fact, and the president’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, has labeled the news media “the opposition party. ” Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment scholar and lawyer, said the lawsuit was a “difficult situation for BuzzFeed to be confronted with. ” “It seems inevitable that BuzzFeed will say in some fashion that subjecting it to crippling damages for publishing the dossier would, in the end, imperil the public’s right to know just what misconduct an American president” is suspected of, he said. He added that he could foresee lawyers arguing to move the case to federal court or to a court outside Florida. In the complaint, Mr. Gubarev’s lawyers argue that he is not a public figure. But if the court disagrees, Mr. Gubarev’s lawyers would have to prove that BuzzFeed acted not only negligently, but also maliciously. One potential argument for defense lawyers is a principle called neutral reportage, which defends the publishing of some defamatory material if it is a matter of public interest and “does it in a fair and disinterested manner, without endorsing a defamatory charge,” Mr. Abrams said. The principle has been rejected by some courts, however, and has not been tested widely, he added. “I would think that wherever this case is heard, an absolutely central issue will be whether a court would adopt the neutral reportage principle and say basically precisely what the editor of BuzzFeed has been saying  —   that this is an enormous matter of public interest, we reported it fairly, we did not endorse it, we made very clear that these were simply charges that were well known to everyone but the American public,” he said."
"One of the few upsides of lockdown was that, if a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square, you had a chance of hearing it. City dwellers across the globe delighted in the silence, the freedom from the incessant rumble of traffic, and the joy of birdsong. How cleaner the air seemed, and how splendid the blue skies without their usual grid of aeroplane contrails! Those memories might now be receding but for some scientists they were not just silver linings to a grim situation. The enforced experiment in which human activity was brought almost to a standstill created an opportunity to conduct studies that are normally impossible, in topics ranging from acoustics to atmospheric science to ecology. “We are being given an extraordinary experiment,” said climatologist Nicolas Bellouin of the University of Reading.  Take the UK-wide scheme called The Quiet Project, which enlisted a network of acoustic engineers and researchers to map out changes to the ambient soundscape during lockdown. It has been building up a database of sound measurements that should act as an invaluable resource for understanding our acoustic environment: how sound correlates with economic activity, say, and how it affects wellbeing. The Quiet Project has been soliciting and archiving observations from members of the public. “We’re taking lots of technical measurements, but we’re also gathering a lot of soundscape data that reflect what people actually feel,” said Lindsay McIntyre, director of the consultancy company KSG Acoustics in Glasgow, who is one of the leaders of the project. “Everyone I speak to has got an opinion on how the changes in noise makes them feel.” Urban noise – from traffic, subways, sirens, and neighbours – is known to cause stress, but we don’t know so much about its true social costs. Yet it’s not just about the negative effects of shattered peace: for many people, the hum of life and entertainment is a positive part of the urban experience. “Some people are really missing the vibrant sounds of the city, which is perhaps linked to concerns about lack of work and earning,” says McIntyre. Often it’s a question of finding the happy medium. “You might like waking up when it’s quiet, but in the evening you might want the vibrancy,” said Stephen Dance, professor of acoustics at London South Bank University and another of the project’s leaders. The value associated with these positive and negative effects of sound has never really been measured, he said – but this has been a chance. Dance said that lockdown seemed to have lowered urban noise by about five decibels, mostly because of absent traffic. That’s a 60% reduction – certainly enough to be aware of. This acoustic information could be useful for planners – for example, for cost-benefit analyses of how designated “tranquil areas” in cities can be preserved from development, or to plan for potential changes in the future. It should help to make better predictions of what things would be like if all vehicles were electric, say – which is possible in 10 years’ time. “You could quantify what you’d get to acoustically,” said Dance, “and put a value on it – which is a factor in the economic costs of making that change.” Some of the noise created by human activities lies beyond the threshold of hearing, especially at very low frequencies of around a few oscillations per second (a few hertz or Hz). Vibrations like these are detectable using technologies attuned to seismic waves – trains and construction, for example, shake the ground at such frequencies. Usually the seismic effects of human activity are a mere distraction or nuisance for seismologists. “We think of anthropogenic noise as obscuring the natural signals from the planet that we’re interested in, be they earthquakes or other signals,” said earth scientist Zach Eilon of the University of California at Santa Barbara. So researchers tend to install seismometers far from sources of anthropogenic noise. But some stations are installed within cities, perhaps to monitor the earthquake threat – and these, Eilon said, are now supplying useful information about how human activity leaves a seismic trace. There is now an international effort, involving around 100 seismologists worldwide and coordinated by Thomas Lecocq of the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels, to collect lockdown data. Eilon said their studies so far, using seismic data from China and Italy, allow them to identify different noise sources from their seismic frequencies. Foot traffic and factories or businesses cause vibrations of 1-8Hz, traffic on motorways is around 10-30Hz, and trains around 20-30Hz. Purely from the seismic trace, it’s possible in normal times to identify working hours, lunchtimes, nightlife, holidays and big sporting events. Lecocq said that there are even some seismometers installed in schools that register pupils’ footsteps – and that fell silent while schools were locked down. “The really exciting thing about our research is what it can teach us about human behaviour,” said Eilon. “We have never had this sort of lockdown scenario where many countries and cities around the world are so drastically changing their societal patterns.” The changes in seismic noise that they have seen far outstrip the variation normally seen between weekends and weekdays, or even national holidays. By comparing these with data on mobility, changes in factory output, toll road use, and changes to train schedules, they can figure out how each societal activity creates seismic noise, so that in future seismic measurements can be used to measure what we’re doing. And because seismic data – unlike phone tracking, say – can’t identify individuals, there are no problems about violations of privacy. Data like this could even be helpful for controlling the pandemic, for example by showing how well people are adhering to social distancing and travel restrictions. “Several locations in the US were already showing increases in seismic noise in early May as citizens became less compliant with lockdown,” said Eilon. He and his colleagues also saw differences between Italy and China, probably because public transport was not shut down in the former case. The findings are also revealing more about very low-level earthquake activity. The signals from small earthquakes are generally in the same frequency range as these human sources, said Eilon – so “that noise can prevent us from seeing below a certain threshold of earthquakes. Basically, we are probably missing a lot of the small earthquakes that we might otherwise detect because they are getting drowned out.” But these might become visible in the lockdown data. “This is exciting because it can tell us more about the state of stress and movement in the crust,” Eilon said. As well as the cities and the skies, another environment that became less noisy was the oceans, thanks to suspensions of shipping. Low-frequency noise from ships’ engines can travel over thousands of kilometres. “Most ocean basins have a persistent background hum generated by ships”, said David Barclay, an oceanographer at Dalhousie University in Canada. This noise can disrupt the communications of marine animals that rely on acoustic signals, such as whales and dolphins. “Fish, marine mammals and crustaceans use sound to hunt, forage, communicate, mate and navigate,” Barclay said. “High levels of sound can physically harm and kill marine animals, or cause permanent or temporary hearing loss, and can trigger behavioural responses like flight, stress and disruption of feeding.” He and his co-worker Dugald Thomson have studied how such noise changed during lockdown, both in the open ocean (in the north-east Pacific) and in an inland waterway in the Strait of Georgia outside the port of Vancouver. They saw a small drop in the weekly average noise at frequencies of about 100Hz in the open ocean, and a larger decrease in the strait. “We would like to understand which factors – ship traffic density, speed, tonnage, type of ship – are playing the biggest role,” Barclay says – information that could help to plan ocean transportation so it is less disruptive to marine life. “This is an opportunity for marine biologists to make observations under far-from-normal conditions – or that would have been normal 50 years ago,” he said. “I would say that every marine-related biologist or ecologist has at least one key research question that they can address during this period of relative pause.” An improvement in air quality was seen over many urban areas as pollution from traffic fell . While nitrogen dioxide levels plummeted, other changes in air quality were more modest, Bellouin said. Transport is just one source of small particles called aerosols, for example, and “other sources, like domestic heating or agricultural fertilisers, have not changed” – not to mention natural sources like wildfires and desert dust. But that’s useful, Bellouin said, because it allows these different contributions to be identified and measured. Aerosols have an impact on climate. They reflect sunlight back into space, can act as the seeds of droplet formation for clouds, and can increase the reflection from those clouds. Overall, they generally have a cooling influence – but some aerosols, like soot, warm the air by absorbing sunlight strongly. “The links between aerosols and the climate are many and complex,” said Samset. “They’re difficult to pin down and are still a source of major uncertainty when we try to project what will happen to the climate over the coming decades.” Usually it’s hard to disentangle the climate effects of aerosols from those due to rising emissions of greenhouse gases. But the lockdowns might have helped us do that. “What Covid-19 gives us is a rapid, short change in one of these influences,” said Samset. “Aerosols drop out of the air in a matter of days, so we should be able to see the effects if we look closely. Researchers are now planning to simulate the climate with and without the lockdown, to see if their models can match the observations. “This will help us improve our weather and climate models,” said Samset. “These lessons can then be applied to bigger questions of the overall influences of aerosols on climate and society.” These opportunities are not completely without precedent. The eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland in 2010, for example, stopped air travel for a week, not only reducing aeroplane noise but also that from road traffic close to airports. And the 9/11 attacks in New York reduced international traffic by sea as well as air. Still, said Barclay, “It’s hard to imagine any other voluntary scenario where we would have the opportunity to study the marine habitat under these conditions.” “We’re all hoping that we can make the best of a bad situation and learn something useful,” said Samset."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn today’s post you will find a Russian National Television film below, viewed only 70 times so far at Youtube, where Russian scientists express doubt on the IPCC’s version of the CO2 story, and warn of a coming cold period. It is the kind of film alarmists do not want the public to see.  It is dubbed over in English
Photo: Andrey Proshutinsky 
In fact Russian scientists warn that the recent Arctic melt may actually forbode a coming cold. It’s happened before.
In yesterday’s post here I wrote about how Max-Planck-Institute Arctic scientist Dirk Notz said he would not bet on the Arctic ice decreasing in the years ahead, saying in a nutshell that there are just too many poorly understood factors and play.
In his response Notz brought up Andrey Proshutinsky (photo above), a senior Russian scientist at the Department of Physical Oceanography at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. I sent him an e-mail for comment, and I’m very pleased to say he replied (my emphasis):
Dear Pierre,
I am sorry for delay with my response. I just got your message because of traveling.
Answering your question I can say that the situation with Arctic ice changes is highly uncertain. Our observational record is too short, models are not perfect and initial conditions used for model runs are also very far from ideal. We speculate that Greenland ice melt could be a factor influencing Arctic-Subarctic processes but how it will work is not clear yet. More observations and modeling studies are needed.
Thanks,
Andrey”
His advisories are unmistakable: 1) initial conditions for model runs are “very far from ideal” and that 2) “the observational record is too short“, and thus taken together ought to be a very loud and clear message to policymakers who are in a rush to declare the science settled and to build a phony climate thermostat.
Russian scientists warn of “cold” ahead 
Minutes later a second email from Dr. Proshutinsky landed in my mailbox. It contained a link to a highly fascinating, balanced Russian National Television of December 2013 film titled “Cold”, see below.
His second e-mail:

In addition to my previous message, I am sending you a link to our website front page www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre where we have two movies (one of them I showed during my talk at Royal Society). The second movie was made by Russian National Television last year. There are two options there: in English and in Russian. This is about 50-minute film “Cold” with opinions of different scientists about future climate changes. Of course, this is information to entertain general public but you can see that there are many factors which can influence climate and some of them are well predictable (like astronomic parameters) but others are not predictable (like volcanic eruptions).
Thanks,
Andrey”
As Proshutinsky points out, it was made “to entertain general public” but shows the “many factors” driving the climate. Be patient the good stuff starts after the 20-min. mark.
Arctic melt forebodes coming cold, Russian scientists theorize
In the video starting at about the 25 minute mark, Russian scientists warn why they think cooling is a real threat, and remind us there are many factors at work within our climate system.

At the 37:40 mark a Russian scientist is quoted saying:
Besides excessive amount of cartbon dioxide adds some fractions of a degree to the dangerous warming. However to be honest, the weather is controlled by forces that are beyond our control. We can only adapt, if we are able to of course.”
“This warming is not forever”
And at the 45:17 mark:
Warm winters of the recent years no doubt has made many of us pretty relaxed about the cold. Stories about the cold of 1941 and 1812 are perceived as tales of the past. But the climate is a variable thing. History can repeat itself and this warming is not forever.”
If the film makes anything clear, it is that the Russian view of climate science is far more balanced and calm-minded than what we are used to seeing in the west. It is little wonder Russia is not signing on to extend Kyoto.

"**Mobile phone data services have been boosted in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico by balloons provided by Google's parent company, Alphabet.**
The Project Loon devices beam signals between each other and to users on the ground.
This extends communications networks in places where infrastructure is scarce or has been damaged.
The balloons will allow residents with LTE phones to send and receive text messages and access the web.
However, much of the country is still without electricity, and more than a quarter of the population lacks safe drinking water.
""This is the first time we have used our new machine learning-powered algorithms to keep balloons clustered over Puerto Rico, so we're still learning how best to do this,"" said head of Project Loon Alastair Westgarth.
""As we get more familiar with the constantly shifting winds in this region, we hope to keep the balloons over areas where connectivity is needed for as long as possible.""
Alphabet launched the balloons in collaboration with the government of Puerto Rico, the US Federal Communications Commission, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency and telecoms firm AT&T.
Earlier this year, Alphabet sent its balloons to Peru following serious floods."

September 30, 2013
The Honorable John Kerry
Secretary of State
Washington D.C. 20520
Dear Mr. Secretary:
Your press release dated September 27, 2013 Release of the Fifth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change clearly expresses your beliefs about climate science. It included:
This isn’t a run of the mill report to be dumped in a filing cabinet. This isn’t a political document produced by politicians.
It’s science.

Excuse me if I make a few clarifications. In reality, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Summary for Policymakers for their 5th Assessment Report was initially written by climate scientists for politicians. The language of the IPCC’s Summary for Policymakers was then amended by politicians during days of negotiations in Stockholm prior to publication.
Additionally, the vast majority of the scientific research reflected in that document was funded by governments. As a result, the IPCC Summary for Policymakers presents only research efforts that adhere to the agendas of the political entities that financed it.
Simply stated, the IPCC’s Summary for Policymakers was bought and paid for by politicians for political purposes.
You concluded your press release:
We do so because this is science, these are facts, and action is our only option.
I would have to guess that you have confidence on the IPCC’s projections of future climate. Climate models are used for those predictions. Those predictions are based on projections of future emissions of manmade greenhouse gases and of other anthropogenic factors. But, climate models are not facts; they are computer-aided speculation.
Further to climate models, the predictions assume the models properly simulate climate on Earth. I hate to be the bearer of bad news: the climate models used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report simulate Earth’s climate so poorly they are not fit for their intended purposes.
I am an independent climate researcher, Mr. Secretary. I receive no funding other than from book sales and occasional tips from generous souls. I publish my findings at my blog Climate Observations and at the award-winning science blog WattsUpWithThat? I recently presented the modeled and observed warming rates of global land surface air temperatures and of global sea surface temperatures, covering the past three decades. That blog post was Models Fail: Land versus Sea Surface Warming Rates. The cross post at WattsUpWithThat is here. (See that post for the specifics on the datasets, model outputs and the time period used.) I compared the warming rates in a table, but the relationships are much easier to see in the two time-series graphs that follow.
Figure 1 compares the warming rates of the modeled and observed global land surface air temperatures over the past three-plus decades. The models performed well. They only overestimated the observed warming rate of land surface air temperatures by about 25%. The problem: they achieved that similarity in trends with skewed climate dynamics within the models.

The vast majority of the warming of global land surface air temperatures, Mr. Secretary, is in response to the warming of the sea surface temperatures of the global oceans. [See Compo and Sardeshmukh (2009) “Ocean Influences on Recent Continental Warming.”] In order to achieve the close match with the observed warming rate of land surface air temperatures, the modelers had to double the observed rate of warming of the surfaces of the global oceans over the past 31 years, as shown in Figure 2.

That clearly indicates the basic underlying physics within the models are unsound. Therefore, there are no reasons to believe the climate model-based predictions of future climate or any study that attempts to use climate models to attribute global warming and climate change to human influences.
In my earlier post linked above, I presented what appear to be the reasons why the modelers needed to force the oceans to warm at twice the observed rate. I won’t bore you with the details here. But, in summary, the climate models used by the IPCC do not — cannot — properly simulate the naturally occurring, coupled ocean-atmosphere processes that cause the surface of the oceans to warm and cool over multidecadal timeframes. (See Guilyardi et al. (2009) and Ruiz-Barradas, et al. (2013))
Those climate model failings stem from the focus of the climate science community on human-induced global warming and climate change — not on global warming and climate change regardless of the cause.
I have been publishing comparisons of data with climate models outputs for about two years. The climate models used by the IPCC clearly cannot simulate Earth’s surface temperatures, precipitation or sea ice area. Additionally, there are numerous scientific research papers that are very critical of how climate models perform specific functions. Looking at those papers independently, the faults do not appear too bad, but collectively they indicate the models are fatally flawed.
In my book Climate Models Fail, I have collected my past findings about climate models, and illustrated others, and I’ve presented highlights from the research papers critical of climate models. I would be happy to forward a link to a free copy of Climate Models Fail to your offices for your personal use. Please have one of your staff members leave a comment at my blog Climate Observations if that interests you.
In closing, I would like to ask a favor. I will ask that you help to change the focus of climate change research from “understanding the scientific basis of [the] risk of human-induced climate change” to “understanding the scientific basis of the risk of climate change”. (See IPCC organization History webpage)
The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) is concerned about the IPCC’s focus. See their document titled Submission by The Netherlands on the future of the IPCC. Under the heading of “The IPCC needs to adjust its principles”, KNMI begins:
We believe that limiting the scope of the IPCC to human-induced climate change is undesirable, especially because natural climate change is a crucial part of the total understanding of the climate system, including human-induced climate change.
Now consider that suggested change of focus came from a country with 20% of its land surface below sea level and about 50% of it only a meter above sea level. If any country should be concerned about climate change, it’s the Netherlands, and they have asked for a better understanding of natural climate change. I suggest to you that the United States should also ask for that same change in research scope.
With that change of focus, I personally believe, based on my own research, that climate researchers will find that the global warming and climate change we’ve experienced over the past three decades is primarily a response to naturally occurring coupled ocean-atmosphere processes, not manmade greenhouse gases. I also believe with the change in focus that, to the relief of most persons, future global warming and climate change will not be found to be catastrophic, but that we will have to plan for a long-term, naturally occurring rise in sea level. Sea levels were 4 to 8 meters (13 to 26 feet) higher during the Eemian (the last interglacial period) than they are today. (Refer to the press release for the 2013 paper by Dahl-Jensen, et al. “Eemian Interglacial Reconstructed From a Greenland Folded Ice Core”.) It would be prudent to plan for those same sea levels during this interglacial. Thankfully, with the slow rate of sea level rise, there should be loads of time to make sound economic decisions.
The people of the United States should be receiving honest appraisals of human-induced and naturally occurring global warming and climate change, not politically motivated conjecture.
Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Secretary.
Sincerely,
Bob Tisdale

"Following the wettest winter for 250 years, it would seem fair to assume that drought-induced food shortages are unlikely to be a problem for Britain. But in the near future we may find that water is a factor in shortages of commodities we rely on, such as crops, meat, fish, fuels, pharmaceuticals and paper – the shortages of water and land are not in Britain, but elsewhere. In recent research with colleagues from Loughborough University published in the journal Climate Research, we examined the international dimension of how commodities are supplied to import-dependent countries, such as the UK. Increasingly, understanding the impact of climate change on a global scale is critical when considering the impact on supply chains and the availability of commodities in the future. The UK is among the most dependent nations on imports from overseas. The role of international trade and access to water in other countries is essential if the people of Britain are to continue to access the range of commodities they currently enjoy. Our work looked at 25 of Britain’s most economically significant and climate-sensitive imports, examining the amount of water needed to produce these goods. Based on 2010 figures, these 25 products represented 30% of Britain’s imports and required 12.8 billion cubic metres of water. We found that rearing beef cattle, and manufacturing plastics and paper require the most water of all UK imports, closely followed by growing rice, wheat and rearing pork. We compared the overall water requirements for these imported commodities with projected change up to 2040. This included climate-related changes  and economic changes such as increased demand or a growing population. Data from the United Nations Environment Programme has revealed that many of the countries Britain relies on for imported commodities already suffer from absolute water scarcity, specifically those in North Africa and the Middle East. There are also a number of countries that are under relative “water stress”, notably the large growing economies of China and India, Eastern and Southern Africa, as well as Poland and Denmark. Population size will be a major factor in determining how hard global water shortages will hit. UN data suggests that the current upward trend in the world’s population will continue until at least 2030. The medium projected population is 8.9 billion by 2050, an increase of 28% on 2012, and this will cause new regions to experience water stress over the coming decade. The study has given us some insight into where the water-related weak links are among Britain’s imports, and so how secure the country’s supplies may be in the future. We now have a clearer picture of how Britain will become increasingly susceptible to the lack of water in other nations – even as our own is drenched in excess. Britain’s national water footprint and import dependency are relatively high, even without considering any effects of climate change and population growth. Without introducing water-saving and efficiency measures, or by making environmental compromises, there is little scope for producing at home those highly water-dependent goods we currently import, unless prices rise. But countries dependent on climate-sensitive imports  can invest in improved production methods and efficiency improvements in exporting nations that would reduce water use. For example, India and Pakistan are the largest exporters of rice to Britain. But compared to the world’s second largest rice exporter, Thailand, they are inefficient when it comes to water. Investment, education, improved manufacturing processes and agricultural technologies and greater emphasis on water management will be important to secure rice supplies in the future. Improving trade relations with other nations that could potentially supply Britain’s needs is also important, especially those countries where the effects of climate change are likely to be less severe. These findings have national implications for politicians – the risks to water supply in the UK posed by climate change will need to be managed alongside other, better understood, factors driving water demand such as trade, population, consumer behaviour, dietary trends, agriculture and the environment."
"Global heating will make it much harder for tropical plants around the world to germinate, with temperatures becoming too hot for the seeds of one in five plants by the year 2070, according to a new study. Global heating will impact the ability of more than half of all tropical plants to germinate if emissions of greenhouse gases remain high.  The tropics are home to many of the world’s richest areas for biodiversity and scientists have long held concerns they could be especially susceptible to climate change. Published in the journal Global Ecology and Biogeography, the University of New South Wales researcher Alexander Sentinella examined germination data for 1,312 plant species held at the Millennium Seed Bank at Britain’s Royal Botanic Gardens. The seed bank is the largest and most diverse collection of seeds in the world. Sentinella said it was assumed tropical plants had a narrower temperature range they could tolerate than species at higher latitudes. But his study found the risk to tropical plants from global heating exists because they are already sitting towards the higher end of their temperature limits, not because they had a narrower range to begin with. The study also suggests that global heating could benefit the germination of most plant species above 45 degrees latitude, but this benefit might be offset by other issues. The study comes after research earlier this year found tropical areas that conservationists had thought would be safe havens may not escape global heating. The seed bank database includes a range of germination experiments and Sentinella and colleagues examined only species where results covered the same species from the same locations. Then the study looked at the warmest three months of each year from 1970 to 2000 where those plants existed, and compared those temperatures to what was expected by 2070 under a scenario where greenhouse gas emissions remain very high. By 2070, the results showed more than half the tropical plants had been pushed beyond the best temperature range for germination. For about 20% of species, the study suggested temperatures would be too high for the plants to germinate. The study found no difference in the response of different kinds of plants – for example, between woody species and softer greener plants, or between long and short living species. Sentinella told Guardian Australia: “We know warming will affect species regardless of where they are, but we wanted to look at how much warming these species could cope with.” He said tropical areas were being hit by deforestation, which had already raised ground temperatures close to cleared areas, and the impact on germination of tropical species was likely already happening. “This just adds to the pressures these ecosystems are facing,” he said. Commenting on the study, Dr Alex Cheesman, an expert in tropical plants at James Cook University, said the study was important because very little was known about how seed germination would be affected by global warming. The study would likely prompt further work, he said, but if the central findings of the study held firm then it showed how global heating had the potential to “substantially impact the composition and functioning of biological systems across the globe”. Prof Bill Laurance, the director of James Cook University’s centre for tropical environmental and sustainability science who was not involved in the study, said the focus on germination was important because this was “a critically vulnerable life-stage for plants.” “Many old-growth-rainforest plants, for instance, need relatively cool, shady conditions on the forest floor for their seeds to germinate.” Prof Corey Bradshaw, an ecologist at Flinders University who was not involved in the study, said the issue of germination temperatures had been “flying under the radar” and the study represented a “stark warning”. He said the issue needed further investigation, particularly because there were several factors that influenced germination, such as how deep a seed was or what the soil moisture levels were. But he said in the 50-year future the study had used, there would likely be more important impacts on tropical plants, including fire and habitat loss, than pressures on germination."
"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve mass use of a Covid vaccine for people aged 16 and over.**
Immunisations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, approved by the British medicines regulator, the MHRA, could start early next week for people in some high-priority groups, with 800,000 doses arriving in the UK in the first delivery.
**When will I get a vaccine?**
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has advised that people are given the vaccine in the following order, although there is likely to be some overlap between groups:
The complex logistics of distributing the vaccine mean that hospitals, which have the large-scale storage required at freezing temperatures, will act as vaccination hubs at the start, and NHS staff are likely to be protected first.
The priority groups cover 90-99% of those at risk of dying from Covid-19, according to the JCVI.
The older you are, the higher your risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from the virus - and that risk rises sharply beyond 70. People with underlying health conditions are also vulnerable to the virus.
After these nine priority groups, there will be a second phase of vaccination for younger groups in the population.
Local NHS and public health teams will be given some flexibility to allocate vaccines to other at-risk groups, including people from ethnic backgrounds and deprived communities.
People will be vaccinated twice - 21 days apart - and immunity starts seven days after the second dose.
You'll be invited to book an appointment to get a vaccine as soon as it's your turn, probably by letter.
In England, more than 1,000 GP surgeries will act as local vaccination centres, and sports stadiums and conference centres will act as major vaccination hubs.
The first doses are likely to be given via 50 hospital hubs next week, which means healthcare staff and patients will probably be immunised first, followed by care home residents.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the first vaccines will be administered on Tuesday in Scotland.
Northern Ireland will receive 25,000 doses next week and NHS staff have been told they will be vaccinated on 14 December, although this could be brought forward.
The roll-out of the vaccine in Wales will start in a matter of days.
The NHS is recruiting 30,000 volunteers to help with the rollout, including lifeguards, airline staff and students - who will be trained to give the jabs.
No - this vaccine is being rolled out free to people via the NHS.
You can't jump the queue by paying for it, but there should be plenty of vaccine to go round.
If you're eligible for a flu vaccine, you should get it as soon as possible, particularly if you will also be in a high-risk priority group for a Covid jab.
Having both infections at once this winter could be dangerous.
At its last meeting, the JCVI recommended leaving at least seven days between the vaccines.
The UK medicines regulator does not authorise any vaccine unless it believes it is safe.
The MHRA assesses all the data, ensures a vaccine works and that all the necessary trials and checks have been completed.
It studies:
It is doing this as quickly as possible without cutting corners, because these vaccines are a priority.
Drug companies making the vaccines have continually been sending trial data to the regulator for review, which has also shortened the process.
The MHRA also seeks advice from another independent body, the Commission on Human Medicines, before advising the government on a potential vaccine.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the fastest ever to go from concept to reality, taking just 10 months.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca team has now sent all the data on its vaccine to the MHRA for approval, and other vaccine developers will follow.
In the event the UK has a choice, the JCVI would advise on which vaccine should be used for different groups of people.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is the first to be approved in the UK, is being manufactured and distributed from Belgium.
The vaccine will be packed in specially-designed ""thermoboxes"" containing dry ice, and transported to the UK by lorry or plane.
It will go straight to major hospitals to be stored at freezing temperatures of about -70C, which is required to keep the vaccine stable.
It can only be moved once from there, and must be kept in batches of 1,000 doses.
At that point, it's a race against time - they can be kept at fridge temperatures (2-8C) for five days and up to six hours in a cool bag to enable them to be taken to care homes and other sites.
The first batch of 800,000 doses is expected to arrive in the UK in the coming days.
The eventual aim is that as many people as possible over the age of 16 receive a Covid-19 vaccine.
If everyone over 16 in the UK is offered one, that would be more than 50 million people - a huge challenge.
There is no timeframe on this momentous task, but it's clear that's the long-term plan in 2021.
The NHS has plenty of experience delivering vaccines to huge numbers of people, for example this winter's flu jab should reach 30 million.
A Covid vaccine won't be compulsory though - no other vaccines in the UK are, and experts say this approach doesn't help create confidence in the vaccine.
At present, the government has ordered seven different types of vaccine and expects to receive 355 million doses, including 100 million of the Oxford/AstraZeneca one.
If everyone needs two doses, that would certainly be enough for every adult in the UK."
"BUENOS AIRES  —   Argentina is so used to celebrating immigration as a cornerstone of society that a   saying  —   to govern is to populate  —   remains in use to this day. But in an abrupt shift coinciding with the immigration restrictions put in place by the Trump administration, President Mauricio Macri has issued a decree curbing immigration to Argentina, with his government declaring that newcomers from poorer countries in Latin America bring crime. The measures announced by Mr. Macri in recent days made it much easier to deport immigrants and restrict their entry, prompting irate comparisons to President Trump and igniting a fierce debate over immigration. “A decree like this scares people,” said Arfang Diedhiou, 33, a Senegalese immigrant who runs his own clothing store here in the capital, Buenos Aires. “It came out just after what Trump did, a coincidence that seems very strange to me. ” Argentina’s president, the son of an immigrant, has echoed some of Mr. Trump’s “America First” theme, making it clear that his “first concern” should be “caring for Argentines, caring for ourselves. ” “We cannot continue to allow criminals to keep choosing Argentina as a place to commit offenses,” Mr. Macri said during a news conference. His decree has also rekindled criticism of his ties to the American president, whom he calls a friend. In the 1980s, Mr. Macri worked with his father, an Italian immigrant and industrial magnate, on a real estate project in New York that the family ended up selling to Mr. Trump. Mr. Macri’s immigration measures, while not as   as Mr. Trump’s decision to halt refugees from around the world and freeze visas from seven predominantly Muslim nations, are raising diplomatic tensions in the region. Some South American leaders are attacking what they view as an attempt to mimic Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and nurture xenophobic sentiment. “Brothers, Latin American presidents, we can’t follow the immigration policies of the North,” President Evo Morales of Bolivia said. But opinion polls in Argentina showed widespread support for limiting immigration, and some say the new decree does not go far enough. One   congressman is even calling for a wall to be built on the border with Bolivia. Claudio Suárez, 65, a worker at a bakery in Buenos Aires, called the immigration curbs “fantastic. ” “Nobody wants scum to come in from other countries,” he said. “Many foreigners come here because health services and education are free. The law should be even stronger. ” Argentina’s history has been written by waves of immigration over the decades. After   wars of conquest killed off many indigenous people, the authorities encouraged millions of immigrants to come, largely from Europe, to help populate and develop the country. More recently, governments welcomed newcomers from Latin America, Asia and Africa, opening a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of immigrants and ensuring their access to public schools and health care. Officials in Mr. Macri’s government, which took over in 2015 by vowing to ease polarization and roll back the economic policies of his leftist predecessor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, contend that they are still upholding Argentina’s openness to immigrants. “Everyone should remain calm, because Argentina will continue to be a hospitable and open country,” said Horacio García, Argentina’s top immigration official. The new immigration decree says it is focused on fighting crime, arguing that 22 percent of inmates in the federal penitentiary system are foreigners. (When all of the country’s prisons are taken into account the figure is closer to 6 percent.) The decree specifically mentions “organized crime” as a reason for the crackdown, but it expands the offenses that justify expulsion or blocked entry to include any crime that could lead to a prison sentence. Many worry that immigrants can now be expelled for minor crimes, like blocking a road during a protest. Immigrants hoping to fight a deportation order will have less than a week to file appeals. Previous measures granted 30 days to prepare a defense and the right to a government lawyer. “Immigrants are hanging by a thread because anything could be cause for deportation,” said Gabriela Liguori, director of the Argentina Commission for Refugees and Migrants, an immigrant rights group. But the immigration official, Mr. García, said deportations “will only focus on serious crimes. ” He contended that the measure was necessary because Argentina had become “defenseless to criminals from other countries. ” Faced with criticism, officials in Mr. Macri’s government have had to make it clear that they are ruling out building a   wall on the Bolivian border. “The problem isn’t immigration, but drug trafficking and contraband,” Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said after the Bolivian authorities questioned why she was publicly singling out Bolivian, Paraguayan and Peruvian immigrants for scrutiny. Despite Mr. Macri’s longstanding connection to the American president, Mr. Trump’s victory put the government here in an awkward spot. After all, Mr. Macri had made no secret that he was rooting for Hillary Clinton, saying that Mr. Trump was focused on building walls. But then Mr. Macri seemed to draw on his ties to Mr. Trump, becoming one of the first Latin American leaders to speak with him after the American presidential election. The call was quickly mired in controversy. A prominent Argentine journalist claimed that Mr. Trump had used the occasion to request Mr. Macri’s help in obtaining regulatory approval for a real estate project in Buenos Aires. Spokesmen for both leaders denied the assertion, though it emerged that Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who had no security clearance, had joined the phone call. Argentine authorities later confirmed that the Trump venture did not have the permits needed to begin construction. But in the end, plans for a Trump tower in Buenos Aires were called off as Mr. Trump came under pressure over potential conflicts of interest involving pending international deals. Critics say the new restrictions focus on poor immigrants to distract attention from the economy, which remains sluggish more than a year after Mr. Macri rose to power promising that   policies would usher in growth. Scrutinizing immigrants at times of stress is nothing new in Argentina, with the authorities long praising the country’s history of receiving European immigrants while portraying immigration from neighboring countries as less desirable, said Guillermo Cantor, a sociologist who specializes in immigration. In the late 1990s, President Carlos Menem’s government similarly cracked down on immigrants by associating them with street crime. In 2014, Mrs. Kirchner, the former president, threatened to expel foreigners who committed crimes in an overhaul of the penal code even after her government had legalized the irregular status of many immigrants. Other parts of Latin America are also grappling with bursts of   sentiment. With his nation suffering broad economic declines, Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, ordered a crackdown on Colombian immigrants in 2015, forcing many to flee across the border. An influx of Haitian immigrants to Chile is fueling a debate there over racism and discrimination. On the streets of Buenos Aires, immigrants had varying reactions to Mr. Macri’s decree. Jesús Oriona, 45, a Bolivian who moved to Argentina as a teenager, said the government was simply “throwing the blame at immigrants. ” But Maria Alejandra Alviarez, 39, a nurse from Venezuela who moved here a year ago and works in a health food store, said Argentina had been “too free and open” before the decree. “Macri’s not saying people can’t migrate, and qualified people like me will still be able to come here,” she said. Still others here contend that the shift is strategic, seeking   political points by blaming foreigners for ills in Argentine society ahead of legislative elections this year. “Of course, we have our share of xenophobia, and now, in the glow of Donald Trump, they want to dilute the fact that a large share of us are children or grandchildren of immigrants,” said Raúl Kollman, 68, a radio show host whose mother emigrated illegally to Argentina to flee the Nazis."
"**Tesco has announced that it is repaying the Â£585m worth of business rates relief that it received as support during the coronavirus pandemic.**
The supermarket giant said the help to retailers had been a ""game-changer"" and hugely important at the time.
The move comes after Tesco was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders.
Tesco said its business had proven ""resilient"" and it had now decided to return the money in full.
""We will work with the UK government and devolved administrations on the best means of doing that,"" it said.
Business rates relief was extended to all retailers as part of a package of measures announced in March.
At that time, there was ""a real and immediate risk to the ability of supermarkets to feed the nation"", Tesco said.
""We are immensely grateful for the financial and policy support provided to us by the governments of the UK. This was a game-changer and allowed us to ensure customers got access to the essentials they needed,"" it added.
In October, Tesco defended paying a Â£315m dividend to shareholders. Finance chief Alan Stewart told reporters it was the right policy.
In March, Tesco was accused of ""whipping up a huge lobbying operation"" against a decision not to give its biggest stores in Wales financial help.
The Welsh government changed its mind and decided to grant business rate relief to all retail, hospitality and leisure firms.
Tesco is understood to have asked the Welsh government for an explanation of its thinking rather than a change in policy.
""The decision to repay business rates relief is one for individual companies to consider for themselves,"" said Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium.
""Many have used this money to cover increased costs as a result of covid - hiring extra staff and making significant investment in the safety and protection of their premises. As such, there are many firms who simply cannot afford to repay this Government relief.""
While most of the public focus has - for obvious reasons - been on the furlough scheme, the business rates holiday for retailers and hospitality companies has been one of the main ways the government has tried to keep alive the companies most affected by pandemic closures. Like all coronavirus schemes, however, the rates relief was a blunt instrument - it went also to retailers who have stayed open throughout.
When those retailers decided to pay dividends to shareholders, there was an understandable outcry. Tesco was the object of most opprobrium; it said it would pay Â£315m to investors after reporting that pandemic trading had been buoyant.
Directors at the supermarket chain have obviously read the headlines. The company said it would repay the Â£585m it has had so far this year in business rates relief, while pointing out in passing that it estimated the pandemic had brought it Â£725m in additional costs.
The question now is whether other essential retailers - especially the big grocery chains such as Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda - will follow Tesco's lead. It would be surprising if they did not.
And while the repayments might appear like a public-spirited move, bear in mind the board may have had other motivations: in particular, a desire not to have the public support they have received hanging over them and preventing them from exercising their normal commercial judgement in paying dividends, approving bonuses and making deals.
Tesco said the money meant that it had had the immediate confidence, in the face of significant uncertainty, to invest in colleagues and support its customers and suppliers.
""Every penny of the rates relief we have received has been spent on our response to the pandemic. Our latest estimate at our interim results in October was that Covid would cost Tesco [about] Â£725m this year - well in excess of the Â£585m rates relief received.
""Ten months into the pandemic, our business has proven resilient in the most challenging of circumstances. While all businesses have been impacted - many severely so - we have been able to continue trading throughout, serving many millions of customers every day and although uncertainties still exist, some of the potential risks faced earlier in the year are now behind us.""
Chief executive Ken Murphy said: ""Giving this money back to the public is absolutely the right thing to do by our customers, colleagues and all of our stakeholders."""
"We are going to track back to the week’s developments on energy policy, but I want to open this weekend in Eden-Monaro, with voters in the seat heading to the polls next Saturday. The truisms of federal byelections are well known. Governments don’t normally win. Usually, voters use these contests as an opportunity to “send a message to Canberra” – often the message is “up yours”. Conventional wisdom suggests Labor will more than likely hold the seat vacated by the popular Mike Kelly, particularly given the backlash in parts of the electorate about Scott Morrison’s handling of the bushfires. But here are a few counterfactuals to consider. This contest is happening in a seat that Labor has held by a wafer thin margin. It is happening at a time when Morrison is enjoying an approval rating north of 60%, and the country is battling a pandemic. Because community anxiety is high, incumbency is a bankable commodity, and incumbency is the central pitch of the Liberal campaign to take the seat. Voters in the electorate are being invited in the Liberal party’s television advertising to decide whether they want their local member to be a member of a government who can deliver things – the clear inference being the local champion standing for Labor might look friendly and relatable, but she will lack influence and friends in the nation’s capital. Labor isn’t behaving like it thinks it has this byelection in the bag. The intelligence from the Liberals is they are behind, but still in the contest. I don’t know who is going to win next Saturday, and nobody I trust in politics does either. But I do know this: the result is important for the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese. If you reside happily outside the #auspol matrix, but you follow events reasonably closely, I suspect you can see Morrison is carrying all the major risks over the next six months. The prime minister is trying to work though how to gradually unwind the fiscal support unleashed during the pandemic, while working with the states to try to head off a second wave of Covid-19 infections. But if you position yourself at the vantage point of Labor MPs, they see a prime minister confident enough to be crowding them out, a prime minister certain enough of his own trajectory to be measuring up soft furnishings for another term in office. So even though the prime minister is juggling a bunch of wicked problems which he may or may not be able to solve, and masking the complexity and delicacy of his position with characteristic relentlessness and bluster, it is Labor doing the fretting. If Labor loses Eden-Monaro next Saturday, it will be a significant blow to already battered internal morale, and it will be a green light for internal mischief. The Labor party has watched the Coalition win three elections while churning through three prime ministers. The unity mantra Bill Shorten invoked during the past two terms didn’t ultimately translate to electoral victory, and there is already pre-positioning in the event that things change. If you look closely, you’ll see a modest beauty parade is under way among rightwingers. Nothing too showy, or provocative. Just ticking over. People are putting themselves on the grid because the right will be divided about any post-Albanese strategy in the event the party reverts to old, destructive habits. With that in the back of your mind, let’s make our way back to energy. Albanese this week made an overture to the prime minister about energy policy. He mapped out some positions that could form the basis of a bipartisan conversation about a mechanism if anyone was interested in having that conversation. The pitch was conceived by Albanese and Mark Butler, Labor’s climate and energy spokesman. Joel Fitzgibbon, the loudest voice in the opposition in favour of winding back climate ambition, supported the terms. The proposal Albanese outlined was largely status quo in terms of Labor policy: let’s agree on a policy mechanism (so long as it’s not your risible one, the emissions reduction fund) and as long at the mechanism contains an emissions reduction target that can be scaled. Then there was some signalling on carbon capture and storage. Labor would cop taxpayer support for CCS as long as projects weren’t funded through the renewable energy agencies, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. This wasn’t a shift of position. It was a shift of emphasis. In government, Labor threw many millions at CCS development. In more recent years, Labor certainly hasn’t been out extolling the virtues of CCS, but it hasn’t disavowed the technology either. Albanese just turned the volume back up on terms that wouldn’t cause a boil over in his own left faction, or among members of the inner-city Labor right who view the climate debate differently to Fitzgibbon. The government grumbled that Albanese’s alleged energy policy armistice was pure politics, and there’s some truth to that. Certainly the main purpose of the overture was didactic. Think of it as a small morality play about reasonableness. Morrison has spent the Covid crisis styling himself as Mr Reasonable, a leader of practical solutions, not ideology. By asking Morrison a direct question: do you want to be reasonable about climate and energy, do you want to fix something that pretty much everyone except the hard-boiled reactionaries agree needs fixing, you invite voters to gather around for the answer, or non-answer. You invite voters to reflect on whether Mr Reasonable is truth, or spin. As morality plays go, this one was relatively cost-free for Labor. There was some blowback about Labor rebirthing CCS in progressive circles, and on social media – but a range of stakeholders not unimportant to the Coalition backed Albanese in, because on the substance of the central question, he is right. Australia desperately needs a durable solution to this problem, and the main reason we have a hot mess instead of a practical outcome is because the Coalition has weaponised this issue for short-term partisan advantage. The Liberal and National parties have engaged in diabolical behaviour. There is no other word for it. Morrison has a choice in this term: he can either continue the diabolical behaviour, or he can do something different. That was, in essence, the framing question Albanese put to Morrison – are you going to continue to hold the country hostage because you’ve forged the goat track through central and north Queensland to win elections, or are you interested in doing what’s right for the country? While it’s absolutely correct for Albanese to ask this question, and kindly request that someone bother to hold Morrison and the Coalition accountable for their obduracy and wrecking if the answer to the question is no, asking the “deal or no deal” question also hangs a lantern over Labor’s difficulties in landing a climate and energy policy during this term of opposition. If Morrison isn’t interested in an armistice on any terms, and most likely he isn’t, then Labor is back to working through a policy repositioning on energy and climate that will be really painful, both externally and internally. While Labor is united behind a net zero emissions target for 2050, it is divided about where to set a medium-term target for the 2030s. Hard heads inside Labor insist there is no way back to government unless the ALP can connect with people in central and north Queensland and in the outer suburbs of cities like Perth. Another critical mass inside Labor – the larger group in my observation – says backing off climate action is absolutely impossible, both morally, and electorally. This conversation will be fraught, and the sorry, shameful, soul-destroying history on both sides of Australian politics tells us when it comes to this most lethal of issues, leaders best embark on difficult conversations from a position of strength."

It has been a busy week for the much‐​delayed Keystone XL oil pipeline. The proposed project, intended to carry heavy crude oil from Canada’s Alberta tar sands to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast, won approval on Tuesday from Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, after its planned route had been adjusted to address environmental concerns. The following day, 53 senators signed a letter to President Obama urging speedy federal approval. “There’s no reason to deny or further delay this long‐​studied project,” the senators said.



Let’s hope the president listens. It was also this week that the State Department, which is reviewing the TransCanada Corp. project, announced that it would not reveal its findings until the spring. The department had previously promised an announcement by the end of March.



Environmentalists, who in the past have had Mr. Obama’s ear, continue to voice strong opposition to the Keystone XL project. An anti‐​pipeline rally is being organized for next month in Washington, D.C.





Science says the oil pipeline will be safe. But approval isn’t certain.



But the arguments against the pipeline have all but evaporated. The route now largely bypasses the most ecologically sensitive regions. The overall contribution of its activity to global warming is too small to measure. It is time for the project to move forward.



According to the State Department, which has final say because the pipeline crosses the border with Canada, the project must be determined to be “in the national interest.” The department defines that as projects that “facilitate the efficient movement of legitimate goods and travelers across U.S. borders” so long as they are within “the context of appropriate border security, safety, health, and environmental requirements.”



The Keystone XL pipeline, as it is now proposed, certainly meets all of these criteria. The new route, which bypasses the environmentally fragile Sand Hills region of Nebraska, was approved after a report this month by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality determined that it will have “minimal environmental impacts” if properly managed.



A study last year by the Congressional Research Service found that the greenhouse‐​gas emissions from energy produced from Canadian tar‐​sands oil delivered by the pipeline would increase U.S. annual greenhouse gas emissions by a paltry 0.06%-0.3%. These additional emissions have virtually no impact on the rate of global warming, increasing it by an infinitesimal 0.00001 degrees Celsius per year. This amount is too small to detect, much less to worry about.



The last and perhaps most desperate argument from opponents is that the pipeline will demonstrate the viability of the Canadian tar‐​sands deposits and unleash an oil rush that will ultimately result in sufficient greenhouse‐​gas emissions to push global warming beyond some critical limit. This is nonsense.



Any such limit is simply a human construct — the more pessimistic you are, the less global warming you’re willing to tolerate. But everyone can take comfort in new scientific research that revises down the future warming for each unit increase in greenhouse‐​gas emissions. This means that current estimates of how much warming is locked up in the Canadian tar sands is exaggerated.



Neither are the benefits of tar sands an unproven secret that the Keystone XL pipeline will reveal. The Canadian tar sands — sandy deposits with oil in them — are already an important global oil resource. Production has tripled since the mid‐​1990s, with most of the oil exported to the U.S. through a network of existing cross‐​border pipelines.



Keystone XL’s sister pipeline, simply known as Keystone, started delivering oil in 2010 to refineries in Illinois. There are a number of proposals in Canada to develop routes to deliver the tar‐​sands oil to burgeoning markets in Asia.



The expansion of tar‐​sands development will happen with or without the approval of Keystone XL. A likely consequence of U.S. rejection of the pipeline would be acceleration of the establishment of an Asian outlet.



Opponents are trying to cast the Keystone XL pipeline as a symbol of the type of energy development that the president — with his newly dusted‐​off promise for action on climate change — must act to stop. But the symbol we need is of leadership and presidential approval of the pipeline — a sign that substance, rather than style, underlies determinations of “the national interest.”

"Climate scientists long thought Antarctica’s interior may not be very sensitive to warming, but our research, published this week, shows a dramatic change. Over the past 30 years, the south pole has been one of the fastest-changing places on Earth, warming more than three times more rapidly than the rest of the world. My colleagues and I argue these warming trends are unlikely the result of natural climate variability alone. The effects of human-made climate change appear to have worked in tandem with the significant influence natural variability in the tropics has on Antarctica’s climate. Together they make the south pole warming one of the strongest warming trends on Earth. The south pole lies within the coldest region on Earth: the Antarctic plateau. Average temperatures range from -60℃ during winter to just -20℃ during summer. Antarctica’s climate generally has a huge range in temperature over the course of a year, with strong regional contrasts. Most of West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula were warming during the late 20th century. But the south pole – in the remote and high-altitude continental interior – cooled until the 1980s. Scientists have been tracking temperature at the Amundsen-Scott south pole Station, Earth’s southernmost weather observatory, since 1957. It is one of the longest-running complete temperature records on the Antarctic continent. Our analysis of weather station data from the south pole shows it has warmed by 1.8℃ between 1989 and 2018, changing more rapidly since the start of the 2000s. Over the same period, the warming in West Antarctica suddenly stopped and the Antarctic Peninsula began cooling. One of the reasons for the south pole warming was stronger low-pressure systems and stormier weather east of the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea. With clockwise flow around the low-pressure systems, this has been transporting warm, moist air on to the Antarctic plateau. Our study also shows the ocean in the western tropical Pacific started warming rapidly at the same time as the south pole. We found nearly 20% of the year-to-year temperature variations at the south pole were linked to ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific, and several of the warmest years at the south pole in the past two decades happened when the western tropical Pacific ocean was also unusually warm. To investigate this possible mechanism, we performed a climate model experiment and found this ocean warming produces an atmospheric wave pattern that extends across the South Pacific to Antarctica. This results in a stronger low-pressure system in the Weddell Sea. We know from earlier studies that strong regional variations in temperature trends are partly due to Antarctica’s shape. The East Antarctic ice sheet, bordered by the South Atlantic and Indian oceans, extends further north than the West Antarctic ice sheet, in the South Pacific. This causes two distinctly different weather patterns with different climate impacts. More steady, westerly winds around East Antarctica keep the local climate relatively stable, while frequent intense storms in the high-latitude South Pacific transport warm, moist air to parts of West Antarctica. Scientists have suggested these two different weather patterns, and the mechanisms driving their variability, are the likely reason for strong regional variability in Antarctica’s temperature trends. Our analysis reveals extreme variations in south pole temperatures can be explained in part by natural tropical variability. To estimate the influence of human-induced climate change, we analysed more than 200 climate model simulations with observed greenhouse gas concentrations over the period between 1989 and 2018. These climate models show recent increases in greenhouse gases have possibly contributed around 1℃ of the total 1.8℃ of warming at the south pole. We also used the models to compare the recent warming rate to all possible 30-year south pole temperature trends that would occur naturally without human influence. The observed warming exceeds 99.9% of all possible trends without human influence – and this means the recent warming is extremely unlikely under natural conditions, albeit not impossible. It appears the effects from tropical variability have worked together with increasing greenhouse gases, and the end result is one of the strongest warming trends on the planet. These climate model simulations reveal the remarkable nature of south pole temperature variations. The observed south pole temperature, with measurements dating back to 1957, shows 30-year temperature swings ranging from more than 1℃ of cooling during the 20th century to more than 1.8℃ of warming in the past 30 years. This means multi-decadal temperature swings are three times stronger than the estimated warming from human-caused climate change of around 1℃. The temperature variability at the south pole is so extreme it currently masks human-caused effects. The Antarctic interior is one of the few places left on Earth where human-caused warming cannot be precisely determined, which means it is a challenge to say whether, or for how long, the warming will continue. But our study reveals extreme and abrupt climate shifts are part of the climate of Antarctica’s interior. These will likely continue into the future, working to either hide human-induced warming or intensify it when natural warming processes and the human greenhouse effect work in tandem.

"The Macy’s of today grew from the union of several great names in American retailing, including its namesake chain, Bloomingdale’s and Marshall Field’s. But the ambitious owner of Saks Fifth Avenue has broached the idea of taking the union even further, combining with Macy’s to create a department store juggernaut at a time when the industry is reeling. Hudson’s Bay Company, the Canadian owner of Saks, has approached Macy’s about a potential takeover, people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly said on Friday. Talks between the two companies are at an early stage and may still fall apart or lead to a partnership of some kind rather than a sale. While it is unclear whether a deal will happen, a combination could lift the fortunes of Macy’s, the country’s biggest department store, which has been struggling. Investors certainly appeared to see it that way. Shares of Macy’s rose as much as 12 percent on Friday, its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 11, according to data from Bloomberg. Once a retail titan, Macy’s has struggled to remain relevant as   and discount retailers have decimated the traditional    business. Last month, Macy’s announced plans to cut more than 10, 000 jobs and close some of its 880 stores. Terry Lundgren, its chief executive and the architect of Macy’s last big merger, is expected to step down by the end of March. He will be succeeded by the company’s president, Jeffrey Gennette. Since the recession, shoppers have grown accustomed to hunt for bargains and to not pay full price. Discount stores and outlet malls have flourished. Traditional stores have been compelled to respond by trimming prices, which cuts into their margins. Departments stores have been hit especially hard, particularly as shoppers migrate away from malls. What has emerged, analysts say, is a virtual race to the bottom. That has been particularly difficult for Macy’s, born of a series of mergers over the past two decades that made it a juggernaut in the industry. A stalwart of the middle tier of retail, the company has neither the advantages of   retailers like HM nor the   stores. In addition, Macy’s faces increasingly fierce competition online from sites like Amazon and elsewhere. Macy’s troubles have drawn the attention of a prominent activist hedge fund, Starboard Value, which has urged the company to generate cash by selling the real estate beneath its stores. Starboard, which held just under 1 percent of Macy’s shares as of Sept. 30, had previously estimated the value of that land at about $21 billion. On Friday, analysts at Citigroup estimated that Macy’s   holdings could be worth at least $18 billion. Macy’s market value, by comparison, was just under $11 billion as of Friday morning. Macy’s has taken some steps to sell or redevelop stores, and last year, it added an expert on real estate transactions to its board. But the company has largely resisted more ambitious efforts to divest its real estate, including     deals, in which a company sells the underlying land beneath its stores and then rents it back. The company’s suitor, Hudson’s Bay Company, is far smaller  —   its market value was about 1. 9 billion Canadian dollars, or $1. 5 billion  —   but is known for its bold steps. Hudson’s Bay Company has assembled a growing empire that includes the Hudson’s Bay department store chain, Lord  Taylor and its crown jewel, Saks. And the governor and executive chairman of the Hudson’s Bay Company, Richard Baker, has shown little fear of using debt: In November 2014, the company borrowed nearly $4 billion against the Saks flagship in Midtown Manhattan. He has spoken often of retailers’ need to highlight the value of their real estate. Financing a bid for Macy’s may be trickier, however, because the it carries about $6. 5 billion in   debt. That may mean that the Hudson’s Bay Company will have to bring in a partner or borrow against more of its real estate holdings. A spokesman for the Hudson’s Bay Company declined to comment on the talks, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. “We do not comment on rumors and speculation,” a representative for Macy’s said. A representative for Starboard Value did not respond to a request for comment. Some analysts said that they saw the merit of a potential combination, particularly given Macy’s operational woes and Mr. Baker’s expertise in wringing money out of real estate. “There is a clear logic, despite disparity in   cap” between Macy’s and Hudson’s Bay Company, Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a research firm, said in a note. Referring to Macy’s stock ticker symbol, he added, “The retail market has been changing faster than M has been able to keep up with, whether the flight from the mall or the migration online. ”"

In his new encyclical, _Laudato Si_ , Pope Francis challenges people to adopt a new “ecological spirituality.” But his economic and policy prescriptions are more controversial than his theological convictions.   
  
The Pope’s commitment to the poor and our shared world is obvious. Yet when he addresses policy, his grasp is less sure.   
  
The Pontiff ignores the flawed nature of government. He is disappointed with its present failings, but appears to assume that politics, unlike humanity, is perfectible.   
  
Most environmental problems result from the absence of markets and property rights. For instance, since no one owns the great common pools of air and water, “externalities” abound.   
  
When possible, government should create quasi-markets or apply market incentives. In contrast, where government acts as property manager, it typically performs badly. For example, at the behest of business interests, Washington subsidizes grazing and timbering on its lands, opening up areas which otherwise would not be developed.



Politics does no better in caring for future generations. Politicians have a short time horizon, usually to the next election.   
  
There’s even a more basic point. The Pope notes how hard it is “to find adequate ways of solving the more complex problems of today’s world,” which “cannot be dealt with from a single perspective or from a single set of interests.” He goes on to complain how hard it is “to take into account the data generated by other fields of knowledge.”   
  
However, officials often come from “a single perspective” and cannot consider the mass of knowledge available in the world beyond. In contrast, markets act--imperfectly to be sure--with the widest number of participants, arrays of information, and variety of perspectives.   
  
While _Laudato Si_ largely ignores government’s woeful record as environmental steward, it does express frustration at politicians’ failure to pass the kind of program the Holy Father advocates. Public choice economists long ago explained how interest groups with concentrated benefits so often defeat a disinterested public bearing diffuse costs.   
  
As I point out for the Acton Institute: ""Apparently unrecognized by the encyclical, not everyone claiming to speak for the common good does so. Many ecological interest groups seek to impose their visions and policies on others, rather than achieve a responsible balance, in this case of ecological values, human liberty, and economic prosperity.""   
  
Moreover, it is not enough to blame special interests for influencing government. Politicians are no more virtuous than the people they represent.   
  
In spite of all this, the Pontiff pushes for not just more government, but more _global government_. He does so despite recognizing that this approach has failed in the past. While universal problems may require global solutions, international bureaucracies are least accountable to the poor and dispossessed.   
  
Despite the many well-documented reasons for questioning both the severity of environmental problems and wisdom of entrusting government with new powers, _Laudato Si_ appears to doubt the legitimacy of opposing views. The document complains that “Obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions.” This lack of openness to dissenting viewpoints is evident in the encyclical’s brief discussion of climate change.   
  
The Pope offers a detailed policy agenda and then insists that his proposed program should not be subject to electoral change or oversight, since “continuity is essential.” This undermines the democratic principles so important for those without economic and social influence.   
  
True, the Pontiff hopes for a new kind of politics and politician, but that runs against thousands of years of experience. There is no guarantee increasing the power of parliaments, officials, and agencies will solve problems.   
  
Despite his failings as a policy analyst, Pope Francis is right to ask, “How much is enough?” But expanding government power will not fill the empty hearts that he sees.

"WASHINGTON  —   Decades before he began writing legal opinions, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, was a student columnist at Columbia University. And he had no shortage of opinions. His topics ranged broadly, from life on campus to the   affair. His conservatism was a constant. And he had a lively writing style that persists to this day. He and his collaborators seemed to sense that their writings would survive the years. “We ought not forget,” they wrote in an unsigned 1987 editorial for The Federalist Paper, which Judge Gorsuch helped start, “there is something vital and useful in the curious, if imperfect youth  —   something that shall not be stifled. ” Here is a selection of that youthful curiosity. While mounting an ultimately unsuccessful bid for a seat on the university Senate as a freshman in 1986, Judge Gorsuch was asked by The Columbia Daily Spectator for his views on   issues, including the question of whether the Marines should be allowed to recruit on campus. The Spectator commissioned a series of columns on the lessons that should be learned from the   affair. Judge Gorsuch, whose mother had served in the Reagan administration, saw a need for a more decisive American foreign policy. In a February 1987 column, he took the university to task for what he called its failure to promote diversity (“that cherished buzzword”) of thought. In March 1987, Judge Gorsuch argued against making Columbia’s fraternity system coed as the university more fully integrated women. Writing with his friend Michael Behringer in The Federalist Paper, Judge Gorsuch, a member of Phi Gamma Delta, once more cited freedom of association. In 1988, Columbia was embroiled in debates about its fraternities, new university rules governing protests, and a student council election. Judge Gorsuch, never a fan of student protesters, derided “progressives” in a Spectator   column as being anything but progressive as they claimed “a monopoly on righteousness. ”"

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
I’ve been investigating one of my favorite datasets in the last few days, the CERES satellite-based top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation dataset. In particular, I’ve taken month-by-month global and hemispheric averages of the data. The dataset consists of observations of three variables—downwelling solar radiation, upwelling longwave (infrared) radiation, and upwelling shortwave radiation (reflected sunlight). From these I derive a further dataset. This is the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) imbalance. It is calculated as downwelling solar minus upwelling (reflected) solar minus upwelling longwave. That gives a fascinating look at the overall radiation picture.
I got to thinking about this because of a curious claim in a recent paper published in Nature Climate Change entitled Model-based evidence of deep-ocean heat uptake during surface-temperature hiatus periods (paywalled). I did love the whole concept of “model-based evidence”, but that wasn’t what caught my eye. It was this statement (emphasis mine):
There have been decades, such as 2000–2009, when the observed globally averaged surface-temperature time series shows little increase or even a slightly negative trend (a hiatus period). However, the observed energy imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere for this recent decade indicates that a net energy flux into the climate system of about 1 W m−2 (refs 2, 3) should be producing warming somewhere in the system (refs 4, 5). Here we analyse twenty-first-century climate-model simulations that maintain a consistent radiative imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere of about 1 W m−2 as observed for the past decade. [References are listed at the bottom of this post.]
Anyhow, here’s some news regarding that claim of a consistent TOA imbalance, from the CERES satellite dataset:

Figure 1. CERES satellite-measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation levels, starting in January 2001. Numbers on the horizontal axis are months. Shown are the solar energy entering the system (red line), solar energy leaving the system (dark blue line) and longwave (infrared) energy leaving the system (light blue line). The overall monthly imbalance at the TOA is shown at the bottom in purple. The 12-month running average for each variable is shown as a thin line. Curiously, the variations in upwelling longwave are about 6 months out of phase with the downwelling radiation. All radiation values are positive. TOA Imbalance is solar less reflected solar less outgoing longwave, i.e. inflow less outflow. Twelve-month averages vary too little for the changes to be visible at this scale. 
Now, there are a number of things of interest in this chart. The first is the fact that while the seasonal variations are fairly large, tens of watts per square metre, the annual variations are so small. At this scale we can hardly see them. So let’s expand the scale, and take a more close-up look at just the variations in the overall TOA energy imbalance (purple line at bottom of Figure 1). Figure 2 shows that result.
Figure 2. Closeup of the overall energy imbalance. Horizontal scale is months. Narrow line shows running centered 12-month averages of the TOA imbalance data. All radiation values are positive. TOA Imbalance is solar less reflected solar less outgoing longwave, i.e. inflow less outflow.
Here, we can begin to see the small variations in the 12-month running average. However, the average itself is around five watts per square metre … not good. That much out of balance is not credible.
This shows the difference between precision and accuracy. You see that the measurements are obviously quite precise—the 12-month running average only varies by about three-quarters of a degree over the whole period.
However, in absolute terms they’re not that accurate, we know that because they don’t balance … and it’s very doubtful that the earth is out of balance by five watts per square metre. That’s a very large amount, it would be noticed.
Now, I’ve previously discussed how James Hansen deals with this problem. He says:
The precision achieved by the most advanced generation of radiation budget satellites is indicated by the planetary energy imbalance measured by the ongoing CERES (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System) instrument (Loeb et al., 2009), which finds a measured 5-year-mean imbalance of 6.5 W/m2 (Loeb et al., 2009). Because this result is implausible, instrumentation calibration factors were introduced to reduce the imbalance to the imbalance suggested by climate models, 0.85 W/m2 (Loeb et al., 2009).
As a result, Hansen used the Levitus data rather than the CERES data to support the claims of a ~ one watt per square metre radiation imbalance. However, all is not lost. The precision of the CERES data very good. In Figure 2 we can see, for example, how one year’s TOA radiation imbalance  is different from another. So let’s expand the scale once again, and take an even closer look at just the 12-month running averages, for all four of the radiation measurements shown in Figure 1.
Figure 3. An even closer look, this time at just the tiny variations in the 12-month running averages of the CERES data as shown in Figure 1. All radiation values are positive. TOA Imbalance is solar less reflected solar less outgoing longwave.
Now we’re getting somewhere.
The first thing I noticed is the precision of the measurements of the downwelling solar radiation (red line). As you might expect, the sun is quite stable, it doesn’t vary much compared to the variations in reflected solar and upwelling longwave radiation. And the observations reflect that faithfully. So it seems clear that their instruments for measuring  radiation are quite precise.
Next, I noticed that the change in the imbalance (purple) is more related to the change in reflected solar (dark blue) than to the variations in upwelling longwave. I’ve highlighted the reflected solar (dark blue) in the graph above. This is confirmed by the correlation. The R^2 between TOA imbalance and reflected solar is 0.67; but between TOA imbalance and upwelling longwave, R^2 is only 0.07.
This seems like an important finding, that the imbalance is mostly albedo related, and that because of variation in the albedo, the variations in the reflected solar energy were on the order of ± three tenths of a watt within a few years.
Finally, I am once again surprised by the overall stability of the system. Twelve-month averages of all three of the variables (the TOA balance, reflected solar, and upwelling longwave) are all stable to within about ± 0.3 watts per square metre. Out of a total of 340 watts per square metre going each way, that’s plus or minus a tenth of one percent … I call that extremely stable. Yes, with a longer sample size we’d likely see greater swings, but still, that’s very stable.
And that brings me back to the quotation from the paper where I started this post. They say that there is
… a consistent radiative imbalance at the top-of-atmosphere of about 1 W m−2 as observed for the past decade …
Now, according to their references [2] and [3], this claim is based on the idea that the excess energy is being soaked up by the ocean. And this claim has been repeated widely. I’ve discussed these claims here. The claims are all based on the Levitus ocean temperature data, which shows increasing heat in the ocean. Here’s my graph of the annual forcing needed to give the changes shown by Levitus in ocean heat content:
Figure 4. Annual forcing in watts per square metre needed to account for the energy going into or coming out of the ocean in the Levitus data. Data is for the top 2,000 metres of water. Note that despite average values being used, both by Hansen and also in the study under discussion, neither the mean nor the trend are statistically significant. Further discussion here.
For current purposes, let me point out that Figure 4 shows that in order for the ocean to gain or lose the energy that is shown in the Levitus data, it requires a very large year to year change in the amount of energy entering the ocean. That energy has to come from somewhere, and it has to go to somewhere when it leaves the ocean. Since the solar input is about constant over the period, that energy has to be coming from a change in either the upwelling longwave or the reflected solar … and we have precise (although perhaps inaccurate) data from CERES on those. Fortunately, the lack of accuracy doesn’t matter in this case, because we’re interested in the year to year changes. For that all we need is precision, and the CERES data is very precise.
So … let me compare the forcing shown by the Levitus ocean heat content in Figure 4, with the CERES data. Figure 5 shows the difference.
Figure 5. Forcing given by the Levitus ocean heat content data, compared to the CERES data shown in Figure 3.
As you can see, they have a couple of big problems with their claims of a consistent 1 W/m2 imbalance over the last decade.
First, it is contradicted by the very data that they claim establishes it. There is nothing “consistent” about what is shown by the Levitus data, unless you take a long-term average.
The second problem is with the Levitus data itself … where is the energy coming from or going to? While the CERES TOA imbalance is not accurate, it is very precise, and it would certainly show a fluctuation of the magnitude shown in the Levitus data. If that much energy were actually entering or leaving the ocean, the CERES satellite would surely have picked it up … so where is it?
I’ve discussed what I see as unrealistic error bars in the Levitus data here. My current comparison of Levitus with the CERES data does nothing to change my previous conclusion—the precision of the Levitus data is greatly overestimated.
Finally, the idea that we have sufficiently accurate, precise, and complete observations to determine the TOA imbalance to be e.g. 0.85 watts per square meter is … well, I’ll call it premature and mathematically optimistic. We simply do not have the data to determine the Earth’s energy balance to an accuracy of ± one watt per square metre, either from the ocean or from the satellites.
Best regards to all,

"With floods sweeping the country, energy policy has slipped down the agenda since Labour’s attention-grabbing price freeze policy announcement. And this of course is unfortunate, as energy policy is central to any response to climate change. A refreshingly sensible view was put forward in a recent lecture given by senior Conservative politician (and former energy minister) Charles Hendry MP at Imperial College. In recent years it often has been painful to watch Conservative politicians speak about energy, facing as they do the difficult task of maintaining that the coalition is committed to being the “greenest ever”, despite considerable evidence to the contrary. But perhaps Hendry is sufficiently senior enough not to worry too much about toeing the line – and thank goodness for that. Political discussion of energy tends to revolve around what is often called the “trilemma” of energy policy: how to balance the issues of energy security, climate change and affordability. And while Hendry stayed within these topics, he was unafraid to stretch their interpretation beyond the conventional. He said: “Some people say we have moved too far away from the market, but it was the CEGB (Central Electricity Generating Board) of old that delivered much of the large scale investment which we now rely on, and there are real questions about whether the market can deliver energy security.” “Energy security” is too often narrowly interpreted as self-sufficiency, but Britain is no longer an island (Hendry joking that “many of my colleagues will be nervous to be told this”). And it has long been true: there are now four electricity interconnects to mainland Europe and Ireland, with more under construction. Connecting the UK with other countries and sharing energy supplies through supergrids should play a major role in Britain’s future, and the economic view supports this. For example, the proposed link to Iceland would allow the import of its huge geothermal energy potential and others that draw upon the solar energy resources of southern Europe and North Africa would be positive steps for UK energy security and for Europe’s efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. From the menu of low carbon energy supply options, Hendry said most about renewable energy, pointing out how quickly prices have fallen in recent years, even if this is more a result of Chinese and German leadership than from the UK. Supergrids are part of the solution to renewable energy’s intermittency problem. Another is demand response, in which the retail electricity prices respond in real time to demand and supply, and which has the potential to dramatically increase energy efficiency. A further element is energy storage, a field of technology in which Britain could contribute. But the devil is in the detail, and Hendry was also frank about some of the difficulties in making policy through a strange mix of targets, legislation and regulation. When the government set out the recent Energy Market Reform policy, he said, “we had no idea how complex it would end up being.” The sad fact is that current energy policy resembles an elaborate Heath-Robinson machine strapped to a huge, ageing and stubborn elephant. Ever more complex mechanisms and devices are added in an effort to prod and entice the beast in the desired direction, but despite various sticks and carrots the response is unpredictable and often unwanted. Hendry acknowledged this more clearly than I have ever heard a politician do, describing a situation where “for every mechanism put in place there is a side effect which needs a correction somewhere else.” He bemoaned some of the complexities of making policy, such as the importance given to economic impact assessments based on figures of spurious accuracy. When the Chief Scientist for the Department of Energy and Climate Change took up the post, Hendry said he was amazed to find there were more than 100 economists in DECC, but not one engineer. Hendry’s talk provides encouraging evidence that the elephant in the room is gradually being acknowledged. We are inching towards recognition of the need for a radical reshaping of how we conceive and structure our energy markets and how they are regulated. But there remains a long road to travel."

If one phrase encapsulated the Vietnam War, it was this: “We had to destroy the village in order to save it.” Those in the political class in Washington have learned nothing, but perhaps more accurately, many don’t care if their policy proposals and actions cause more misery than benefit.



On Sept. 29, Congress held a hearing on the rules proposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that would likely destroy much of the small‐​dollar loan industry and drive many low‐​income and poor credit‐​risk people into the arms of loan sharks. The CFPB rules are so costly that most lenders will likely go out of business — by government intent. The small‐​dollar loan industry has been criticized for charging high fees and engaging in aggressive collection practices. The problem is that it is expensive to lend money to poor credit‐​risk people, and if legitimate businesses are not allowed to make a reasonable profit because of government regulation, the black marketeers will be the only ones serving the poor. As Rep. Jeb Henslaring, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, noted to CFPB Director Richard Cordray: “These are the very loans many need to keep their utilities from being cut off suddenly or keep their car on the road so they can, in turn, keep their jobs.” Mr. Cordray had no answer as to how the poor will obtain necessary low‐​dollar loans once he has destroyed the legitimate lenders.





The political class, in its lust for power and control, is in the process of destroying the global “economic village” while falsely claiming to be saving it.



The Internal Revenue Service’s new Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act regulations have made it both very expensive and, in many cases, impossible for Americans living abroad to obtain bank accounts in the countries where they live. The new IRS and Treasury “know your customer” regulations have also made it extremely costly or impossible for low‐​income workers in foreign countries, all over the globe to send remittances back to their families in their home countries. The harm these regulations would do has been obvious to many of us who have been writing about the issue for the past several years. Officials in the Obama administration’s IRS and Treasury have been callous and mean‐​spirited in destroying the ability of millions to obtain needed banking services, without providing legal and low‐​cost alternatives.



President Obama has made clear his intent to kill the coal and other fossil fuel industries. The results are that energy costs are being driven much higher, that hundreds of thousands of workers in these industries are now losing their jobs, and that low‐​income people will suffer the most from unnecessarily high energy costs. Even by the administration’s own estimates, if all of the president’s proposals were enacted into law, it would only reduce the world’s temperature by two‐​hundredths of a degree Celsius by the end of the century. Greatly reducing the well‐​being of millions — and destroying the economic village — for virtually no benefit is the height of political arrogance.



A new report published last week by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, authored by former Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delegate Indur Goklany, calls for a reassessment of carbon dioxide. Mr. Goklany said: “Carbon dioxide fertilizes plants, and emissions from fossil fuels have already had a hugely beneficial effect on crops, increasing yields by at least 10–15 percent.” The carbon‐​dioxide fertilization effect is estimated to have increased the value of global crop production by about $140 billion per year. Other researchers have shown that the earth has become greener in recent decades, largely because of the increase in carbon dioxide. At the same time, reputable solar researchers have provided evidence that the output of the sun is likely to go through one of its cyclical declines over the next few decades. There are still too many unknowns to make firm conclusions about the offsetting global temperature effects of rises in carbon dioxide and diminished sunlight. But it is clearly irresponsible to destroy much of the potential for economic growth and to hurt people living today in order to benefit future generations who may or may not be adversely affected by climate change. And because of evolving technology and increases in income, those living in the future will be in a much better position to cope with any negative changes.



Finally, I was struck by the fact that during the Democratic Party debate last week, no one listed the rise in global government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product as a major risk. The debt crisis is upon us now and is only getting worse. The people of Greece have already suffered about a one‐​third decline in their per capita income as a result of the debt crisis and misguided financial regulation. This crisis will spread around the globe in the next few years. Because of too much debt, the Puerto Rican economy is now contracting rapidly. Without first solving the global debt crisis, there will not be the resources to deal with any future climate or other catastrophic events such as a global epidemic.



The political class, in its lust for power and control, is in the process of destroying the global “economic village” while falsely claiming to be saving it.

"I’ve been talking to farmers all this week, many of whom have had their fields underwater for a month or more. It is quite soul destroying to see the natural assets of your business, on which you depend on for your livelihood and to support the rich wildlife of the countryside, being slowly suffocated under a blanket of filthy water. One farmer said that, where the floods had receded, his fields are filled with all kinds of rubbish and debris. His first task is to decide how to remove all this, before he can begin to examine the effects the floodwaters have had on his crops and on the soil. I’d imagine he already knows what the answer will be with any crops planted last autumn: they will not have survived. But what condition the soil is in, and any long-lasting impact on it will take longer to fully understand. Farmers’ ability to produce food rests upon a plentiful, but not excessive, supply of sunlight and rainfall. Indeed, almost all of nature depends on these resources in equal measure. And while livestock can be moved to higher ground where possible, wildlife may not be so lucky. Populations of badgers, hedgehogs, voles and other small mammals, not to mention beetles and other insects, will have been devastated in those areas worst hit by the floods. And fewer insects means less food for birds and other creatures higher up the food chain. Changing and adapting farming systems to accommodate water now may help rescue crops from flooding in the future, but farmers will have to bear the costs now, of losing land to non-cash crops, or sourcing forage for their animals to replace their own that’s been lost. This will cut into profitability and cash flow – hard after several seasons where profit margins have been low or even negative. Bad weather and lack of sunlight throughout the summer of 2012 was followed by poor weather during planting season at the end of 2013 as crops were getting established. Farmers may survive a buffeting from the vagaries of nature for a time, but will need to rely on sympathetic bank managers and landlords in the months to come. In the long term, we need to identify a way we can address inconsistent rainfall, lack of sunlight at key times in the growing cycle, and the effects of heavy rains and being submerged on soil quality. One way would be to improve food security through resilient supply chains, so that any crop losses can be made up from other sources, but it also needs to be considered that the land serves many purposes, both in terms of financial stability for those that live and work on it, and the social benefits to others too, and how these can be best supported. The impact of extreme weather on wildlife is of great concern, especially when it comes to soil quality and providing habitat for insects, as these are vital for pollinating crops. Some farms have been involved in the the Government’s higher level stewardship to support increasing natural and social benefits for the nation and communities. However the funding of this mechanism alone cannot achieve what’s required. We need to combine new social policy with structural “hard” solutions, such as water retention and detention areas There is no quick fix, which makes it difficult for all those involved. Many may have to sacrifice short term objectives for long term benefits.  What is sure is that if farms cannot make a profit then they cannot care for and manage the countryside’s natural capital, nor sustain our food supply. So it’s time that we considered this issue collectively, not in a polarised town vs country fashion, nor as farmer vs environmentalist."

Copepods are small crustaceans and encompass a major group of secondary producers in the planktonic food web, often serving as a key food source for fish. And in the words of Isari _et al_. (2015), these organisms “have generally been found resilient to ocean acidification levels projected about a century ahead, so that they appear as potential ‘winners’ under the near-future CO2 emission scenarios.” However, many copepod species remain under-represented in ocean acidification studies. Thus, it was the goal of Isari _et al_. to expand the knowledge base of copepod responses to reduced levels of seawater pH that are predicted to occur over the coming century.   
  
To accomplish this objective, the team of five researchers conducted a short (5-day) experiment in which they subjected adults of two copepod species (the calanoid _Acartia grani_ and the cyclopoid _Oithona davisae_ ) to normal (8.18) and reduced (7.77) pH levels in order to assess the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on copepod vital rates, including feeding, respiration, egg production and egg hatching success. At a pH value of 7.77, the simulated ocean acidification level is considered to be “at the more pessimistic end of the range of atmospheric CO2 projections.” And what did their experiment reveal?   
  
In the words of the authors, they “did not find evidence of OA effects on the reproductive output (egg production, hatching success) of _A. grani_ or _O. davisae_ , consistent with the numerous studies demonstrating generally high resistance of copepod reproductive performance to the OA projected for the end of the century,” citing the works of Zhang _et al_. (2011), McConville _et al_. (2013), Vehmaa _et al_. (2013), Zervoudaki _et al_. (2014) and Pedersen _et al_. (2014). Additionally, they found no differences among pH treatments in copepod respiration or feeding activity for either species. As a result, Isari _et al_. say their study “shows neither energy constraints nor decrease in fitness components for two representative species, of major groups of marine planktonic copepods (i.e. Calanoida and Cyclopoida), incubated in the OA scenario projected for 2100.” Thus, this study adds to the growing body of evidence that copepods will not be harmed by, or may even benefit from, even the worst-case projections of future ocean acidification.

"In one of the strongest protests yet by a major cultural institution against President Trump’s executive order on immigration, the Museum of Modern Art has rehung part of its permanent collection with works by artists from some of the   nations whose citizens are blocked from entering the United States. Seven works by artists such as the Sudanese painter Ibrahim   the   architect Zaha Hadid, and the Los   Iranian video artist Tala Madani, were installed Thursday night in MoMA’s   galleries, replacing seven works by Picasso, Matisse and Picabia, among other Western artists. Alongside each work is a wall text that plainly states the museum’s intentions: “This work is by an artist from a nation whose citizens are being denied entry into the United States, according to a presidential executive order issued on Jan. 27, 2017. This is one of several such artworks from the Museum’s collection installed throughout the   galleries to affirm the ideals of welcome and freedom as vital to this Museum as they are to the United States. ” Except for Hadid and Mr.   the other artists are all Iranian by birth or heritage. They are Ms. Madani the sculptor Parviz Tanavoli the draftsman Charles Hossein Zenderoudi the photographer Shirana Shahbazi and the painter Marcos Grigorian. In addition, a large sculpture of aluminum and steel by Siah Armajani, an American artist born in Iran, was placed in the   lobby courtyard overlooking the garden. The   additions rupture the museum’s traditional narrative of Western modernism before 1945. Only very rarely has MoMA interrupted its succession of art from   to Cubism, Dadaism, and after  —   which still reflects the modernist vision of its first director, Alfred Barr  —   with works of postwar and contemporary art. Further additions are planned for the weeks ahead. The Museum of Modern Art has also scheduled four screenings later this month of films by directors subject to the travel ban. They include “ ” (1974) an experimental feature by the   German director Kais   and “Stars in Broad Daylight” (1988) by Oussama Mohammad, a Syrian filmmaker exiled in Paris."

By Paul Homewood
In an attempt to downplay the recent halt in global warming, the IPCC have claimed in their Summary for Policymakers that:
As one example, the rate of warming over the past 15 years (1998–2012; 0.05  °C per decade), which begins with a strong El Niño, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951 (1951–2012; 0.12 °C per  decade.)
Simply translated, this means that warming has slowed down to just under half what it was before. This message has been quickly picked up by the media, which, of course, was the main intention.
The dreadful Geoffrey Lean comments in the Telegraph:
The IPCC did, however, address a much more substantial sceptical point, that the temperature increase at the Earth’s surface has slowed down since 1998 to about 40 per cent of its average rate since 1951 – something it accepts it didn’t predict. One reason is that 1998, the year invariably chosen by sceptics, was one of the warmest ever.
So, at a stroke, the “pause” has become a “slowdown, but still significant” in the public’s eyes. But look deeper, and you will see this is a piece of devious trickery.

Is 1998 the best place to start?
First, let’s get rid of the 1998 red herring. The implication is that you can only get this “slowdown” by picking 1998 as the start year. The reality is that temperatures have been flat since 2001, which was a neutral ENSO year, and therefore comparable to this year. The Wood For Trees graph below shows this well.

Figure 1
http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:2001/to:2013/trend/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:2001/to:2013
They could also have mentioned that RSS satellite data actually shows a drop in temperature since 1998, not the small (and statistically insignificant) amount shown by HADCRUT4.

Figure 2
http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/rss/from:1998/to:2013/trend/plot/rss/from:1998/to:2013
Longer term trends
But much more important than this attempt to deflect attention form the pause, is the way the IPCC have totally misrepresented the longer term trends. Figure 3 shows HADCRUT4 numbers going back to 1941.

Figure 3
http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1941/to:1979/trend/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1941/to:2013/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1979/to:2001/trend/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:2001/to:2013/trend
Spot what they have done? Their base period of 1951-2013, against which they have measured post 1998 trends, includes:-

28 years of cooling – 1951-79
22 years of warming – 1979-2001
12 years of cooling again – 2001-2013

So, in total, during 40 out of the 62 years there has been a cooling trend. They are comparing a statistically insignificant amount of warming since 1998, with three decades of cooling. The result is to make this small trend sound much more significant than it is.
It would surely have been more honest to have compared the post 1998 trend with the 1979-98 period. If they had have done this, of course, most people would realised that the much trumpeted global warming really had stopped for the time being. And, in the IPCC’s eyes, that was not the message they wanted people to hear.
By this dodgy use of statistics and the 1998 red herring, they have also tried to distract attention from the clear fact that temperatures really have flatlined since 2001.
How temporary is the “temporary pause”?
It is commonly argued that a short pause in warming, of a decade or so, is not unexpected, amidst all the natural variability.. Back in 2010, the UK Met Office commented:
Recent Met Office research investigated how often decades with a stable or even negative warming trend appeared in computer-modelled climate change simulations.
Jeff Knight, lead author on the research, says: “We found one in every eight decades has near-zero or negative global temperature trends in simulations. Given that we have seen fairly consistent warming since the 1970s, the odds of one in eight suggest the observed slowdown was due to happen.”
But, if you go back to 1941, you have actually got 50 years of near zero or negative trends, and only 22 years of warming.
So which is the norm, and which is the rarity?
Footnote
It appears that the IPCC’s Thomas Stocker now claims that climatic trends should not be considered in periods of less than 30 years.
I don’t remember the IPCC suggesting that after just a decade of warming, when they wrote their first report.

Indonesia has much to celebrate. The world’s most populous Islamic nation surmounted the Suharto dictatorship to create a democratic and increasingly prosperous state. If it can overcome secessionist pressures in what remains an artificial country, Indonesia may become an important counterweight to China in Southeast Asia.



Indonesians also could encourage Islam to move in a more tolerant direction. The population is 88 percent Muslim, 9 percent Christian, 2 percent Hindu, and 1 percent Buddhist. Despite the size of its Muslim population, Indonesia’s politics traditionally have been secular. The Islam practiced by most of its adherents is moderate. In its new report, “In Religion’s Name: Abuses against Religious Minorities in Indonesia,” Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted that “Indonesia is rightly touted for its religious diversity and tolerance.”



Yet like Iraq, Tunisia, and Egypt, the end of dictatorship in Indonesia has loosed intolerant religious forces. Observed HRW, increased freedom has encouraged a number of “long repressed” viewpoints, including “religious militancy.” The success of Islamic radicals, in particular, “stands in stark contrast to the Indonesian government’s claims of adherence to the country’s constitutional guarantee of religious freedom,” noted Phelim Kine, deputy director of HRW’s Asia division.



The victims are many. Reported HRW: “Targets have included Ahmadis (the Ahmadihay), Baha’is, Christians, and Shias, among others.” Offenses range from state discrimination to social bullying to mob violence. Although religious minorities have not been without blame in areas where they dominate, “In most cases, the perpetrators of the intimidation and violence have been Sunni militant groups… at times acting with the tacit, or occasionally open, support of government officials and police.”



As the most populous religious minority, Christians are most often the targets of intolerance and violence. Indeed, warned the group International Christian Concern, “anti‐​Christian hostility is only escalating in a country which lacks the political will to enforce the values of its constitution.” Explained ICC, the shift of power from Jakarta after Suharto’s fall “empowered local leaders to let conflicts simmer and delay, if not entirely dismiss the rule of law, so that Christians fall prey to all manner of religious oppression, ranging from denial of building permits to bombings, threats, killings and forced conversions.”



One problem area, explained HRW, is that religious minorities “have difficulties obtaining permits to build places of worship and, in the worst cases, become targets of violence.” From 2005 and 2010, for instance, 430 churches were forcibly closed.



HRW found “at least 12 cases in which militant groups have used [the regulations issued in 2006] to block the establishment of new houses of worship and to close 31 existing houses of worship.” Moreover, “Even in cases where a permit is issued for a house of worship, vociferous responses from militant groups have caused local officials to rescind them or the groups prevent the applicants from constructing or using the building. The Indonesian government and local authorities routinely fail to take measures against the Islamist groups.” Local officials, whether out of conviction or fear, sometimes take up the radicals’ “call to encourage minority congregations to move to different areas.”



The report detailed “sustained campaigns against two high‐​profile Christian churches, that of the GKI Yasmin church in Bogor, and the HKBP Filadelfia church in Bekasi, West Java. Both of these churches had not only secured all administrative documents and political approvals, but won Supreme Court challenges to secure their building permits. Despite these favorable court decisions, local government authorities denied building permits to the two churches.” Then Jakarta failed to enforce the judicial rulings.



Sunni fundamentalists also have targeted Hindus and even Shia communities. HRW found one case when Christians in a predominantly Christian area used similar tactics to build a mosque, and the group suspects that there are other instances. Although religious liberty should be respected in all cases, the position of Rev. Judith Nunuhitu‐​Folabessy reflects a certain logic: “Our Christian brothers and sisters in Java have to obey the 2006 regulation. We want that regulation to be implemented here as well. If we don’t want to follow that regulation to the letter, then it should not be implemented that way in other parts of Indonesia.”



Moreover, HRW pointed to the use of blasphemy and conversion laws “to impose criminal penalties on members of religious minorities in violation of their rights to freedom of religion and expression.” Such abuses are common in Pakistan, where violent jihadist sentiments are strong. All religious minorities, as well as atheists, are at risk.



Expansive state control gives government many other avenues for discrimination if not persecution. HRW reported: “state discrimination on the basis of religion extends beyond the building of churches, mosques, and temples. Various government regulations discriminate against religious minorities, ranging from the provision of ID cards, birth and marriage certificates, and access to other government services.”



For instance, officials refuse to register marriages if the government doesn’t recognize the religion of one of the parties. Without registration children are not issued birth certificates listing both parents. National ID cards are required, but sometimes cannot be obtained without choosing among five officially recognized religions. Refusing to list a religion can lead to charges of atheism and blasphemy.



Many of the problems faced by religious minorities result from flawed laws. Reported HRW: “The harassment and violence directed at minority religious groups is facilitated by a legal architecture in Indonesia that purports to maintain ‘religious harmony,’ but in practice undermines religious freedom.”



Indonesia’s constitution recognizes religious liberty and Jakarta has signed international agreements affirming this fundamental right. However, even the United Nations, hardly a hotbed of freedom of conscience, cited Indonesia’s “tendency to discriminate against any religion or belief for any reason” and laws which “can violate freedom of religion or belief.” The ever‐​diplomatic State Department in its latest report on religious liberty in Indonesia acknowledged that “some laws and regulations restrict religious freedom.”



The HRW report cited several measures which undermine religious liberty. One is a constitutional amendment from 2000 which requires citizens “to accept the limitations determined by law” in order to promote other social ends. Explained HRW: “The latter provision has been and continues to be invoked to demand that religious minorities cater to the demands of the religious majority. By 2010, Indonesia had at least 156 statutes, regulations, decrees, and by‐​laws that restrict religious freedom, many of them justified by reference to” this constitutional article.



The 1965 blasphemy statute, enacted under Suharto’s predecessor, was approved under “Pressure from Muslim conservatives.” In contrast to Pakistan, at least, the punishment prescribed is prison rather than death. Two government ministers defended the law in court; reported HRW, “They said Muslim mobs would probably attack religious minorities if the blasphemy law were overturned, believing it their duty to defend their religion if Islam is being tarnished.”



Two decrees regarding the construction of houses of worship restrict “the construction of houses of worship.” The measures require the approval of local authorities and support of local communities. No surprise, noted HRW, “These regulation have especially been used to discriminate against Christians who seek to build churches.”



Laws and decrees covering proselytizing, child protection, and the Ahmadiyah also have been used to directly interfere with religious liberty. These measures are backed by “various governmental and quasi‐​governmental institutions [which] have played a key role in promoting a Sunni Islamic identity in Indonesia at the expense of minority religions.” Although the Ministry of Religious Affairs nominally addresses all faiths, its current head, Suryadharma Ali, explained HRW, “has been outspoken against religious minorities.” Despite his image as a modernizer, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has allied himself with some of Indonesia’s most retrograde elements.



Misuse of legal rules and processes to hinder religious practice is bad enough. Worse is the government’s failure to protect religious minorities from violence. Such attacks, while not exactly common, are not unusual either, and are becoming more frequent. The Indonesian human rights group, the Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace, reported 264 violent attacks in 2012, up from 244 and 216 incidents, respectively, in 2011 and 2010.



Over the years I visited a church and Bible school destroyed by mobs, as well as a church which was bombed — costing the pastor’s wife a leg. In none of these cases were the culprits apprehended, let alone punished.



The violence continues. ICC pointed to an attack in January by Islamic radicals on the minister of a Protestant church in West Java while he was leading a worship service. None of the thugs were arrested, but two days later the pastor was charged for acting without a building permit. Earlier this year Setara’s deputy chairman Bonar Tigor Naipospos observed that “Cases of intolerance against Christians remained high in the country.”



Although Christians are targeted for violence most often, they are not alone. The State Department reported on Ahmadiyas displaced by mob violence in 2006 who remained displaced, essentially refugees in their own country. HRW cited a 2011 attack on a Shiaboarding school in which “more than 200 Sunni militants entered [the facility] and destroyed school property. In the course of defending themselves, nine teenage students were injured.”



The authorities rarely do act. HRW reported on “incidents in which police failed to take action to prevent violence against religious minorities or provided no assistance in the aftermath of such incidents. Police all too often have been unwilling to properly investigate reports of violence against religious minorities, suggesting complicity with the perpetrators. Nor has the justice system proven to be a defender of religious minorities. In the few cases of violence that have gone to the courts, prosecutors have sought ridiculously lenient sentences for the perpetrators of serious crimes, which the judges seem content to oblige.”



In this way the Indonesian government is not fulfilling its most basic responsibility. Even State reported that “Due to inaction the government sometimes failed to prevent violence, abuse, and discrimination against individuals based on their religious belief.”



The examples are many, well documented by HRW. Explained the organization: “In some instances, police actively collude with the attackers for religious, economic, or political reasons; in other instances, they lack clear instructions from above or feel outnumbered by militants. In all cases, the poor police response reflects institutional failure to uphold the law and hold perpetrators of violent crimes to account.” Prosecutorial and judicial failures reinforce the refusal to protect the most vulnerable in Indonesia.



And the problem is not just occasional and episodic. Noted HRW: “In some areas of Indonesia, the intimidation and threats against religious communities by Islamist groups have persisted over time, with little effort from government officials to curtail the violations. Of particular note is the continued coddling of the Islamic Defenders Front (Front Pembela Islam, FPI), which has engaged repeatedly in acts of violent vigilantism.” Government and police officials even have appeared at FPI events and called the organization a partner in preserving law and order. The International Crisis Group noted that “Taking on allies known for their intolerance is not the way to inculcate religious harmony.”



Not that the Indonesian government appears to be concerned. Bahrul Hayal, Indonesia’s Secretary General of Religious Affairs, acknowledged “one or two cases” of violence, “but I want to say that the achievements [in responding] are better and getting better and I expect that the maturity of the people will also improve over time.”



One can only hope. Last year the State Department warned of “some deterioration in the protection of the right to religious freedom” in Indonesia. Moreover, noted HRW, Jakarta’s failure to respond decisively when “intolerance is expressed through acts of harassment, intimidation, and violence” is “creating a climate in which more such attacks can be expected.”



Indonesia has the potential to become a regional and even global leader. It could become the model of a tolerant Islamic democracy. But not if it continues to deny many of its citizens the most basic right to practice their faith. If the Indonesian government wants to lead, it must take the nation’s constitution and international human rights norms seriously. And treat its religious minorities as equals to its Sunni Muslim citizens.

================================
Much of Europe has been enjoying a mild fall, and early winter thus far as a long series of Atlantic lows laden with warm, Atlantic air masses have been sweeping regularly across the continent.
For winter sports enthusiasts this has not been good news. But for people on a tight budget, the reduced heating bills and low heating oil prices are very welcome news.
Cold returning after Christmas
But the warm weather pattern is about to be interrupted, and now is certainly no time to be putting the winter coats and snow shovels away.
Over the last few days, the weather model runs have been converging on a cold weather pattern taking over Europe right after Christmas. Weatherbell Meteorologist Joe Bastardi also briefly mentioned this in his latest Saturday Summary (5:27), showing the European model for the 5 days after Christmas:

Meanwhile over the last couple of day GFS models have been consistently showing a return to winter on December 26, which for many places in Europe is called the “second day of Christmas”. Some places in Central Europe may even see light snow, even though not long ago a number of meteorologists were telling the public to write off snow for Christmas.

European winters getting colder
So is Europe seeing fewer white Christmases? Wetter.net meteorologist Dominik Jung recently wrote a few weeks ago that there has been no trend in the last 100 years showing white Christmases are becoming less frequent. Overall weather data show that Central European winters have been getting colder over the last 15 years.
Moreover the “Beast from the East” type winters tend to occur when solar activity is low, which means as solar cycle 24 begins to die off, cold and vicious winters may be more common in the second half of the current decade. And should solar cycle 25 be a weak one, as many experts expect, then Europe may be on the doorstep to a couple of decades of generally brutal winters.
Happy shivering New Year
Back to this winter, for the next 15 days or so, a slight thawing is shown to take place before cold really returns in time for New Year’s day. The latest GFS model runs shows widespread frost gripping most of Europe on January 1, 2015 and continuing for a few days.

The good news is that the upcoming cold does not appear to be the stubborn “Beast from the East” type, which is notorious for sometimes lingering all winter long, as was the case in 2009/10. But as variable as European weather can be, nothing can be ruled out.

In Kerryn Phelps’ brief and unlamented career as a parliamentarian, her sole achievement was to be a watermelon wrecker. Phelps glommed onto the rich peoples’ protest vote at the removal of their wealthy paragon, Malcolm Turnbull. A millionaire representing Australia’s wealthiest electorate, Phelps naturally obsessed over the sort of things rich people are comfortable enough to obsess about: climate change and refugees.



Safe in the knowledge that refugees only get dumped in poor suburbs, Phelps indulged in some top-tier virtue-signaling and abused the newly minted Morrison government’s then-minority status to force through the idiotic “Medevac” bill. This is the absurd, Clayton’s open borders bill that gave fakefugees a golden ticket simply on the say-so of any virtue-signaling medico.



But times and the parliamentary balance-of-power have changed.



The Morrison government is shaping up for another parliamentary brawl over refugee medical transfers. A Senate committee examining the coalition’s push to scrap so-called medivac laws is due to report back on Friday. The repeal bill will then be debated in the upper house as early as next week. Independent senator Jacqui Lambie, who is likely to cast the deciding vote, has indicated she will be guided by the inquiry.



Lambie casts herself as a political maverick, who has trenchantly criticised the Greens, proposed a burqa ban and the death penalty for foreign fighters. These are all issues that have played well in her blue-collar Tasmanian electorate. She might want to keep that in mind.



She certainly wants to turn a deaf ear to the bleating of the media.



Despite near-universal calls to keep the medical evacuation laws in place, Attorney-General Christian Porter insists the government is reflecting the will of the people. “Our position on these sort of matters, I think, is accepted by middle Australia — it’s rejected by some — but it’s absolutely crystal clear,” he told ABC Radio on Monday. “We took our vision as to how border protection should work … to a full election and it was fully endorsed.”



 **“Near-universal”, according to whom?** Opinion polls and election results (where border protection was a significant issue) have shown, repeatedly, that Australians oppose these kind of open-borders policies.



“Part of that was retaining the orderly system of medical transfers that successfully worked to date, where the minister does have an ultimate discretion.” The medevac laws, which were enacted against the coalition government’s wishes earlier this year, gave clinicians a greater say in the medical transfers of asylum seekers. The bill created a specialist medical panel to approve evacuations on advice from doctors rather than government officials.



And, just like that, there are thousands of illegal immigrants allowed into the country for “medical reasons”. **Apparently, addiction to welfare is considered a medical condition these days.**



The Morrison government is harking back to John Howard’s election-winning statement that “We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come”.



“It is the government’s position that it should determine who is allowed to enter Australia, and the terms and conditions to be imposed on that entry, as is the right of every sovereign nation.”

"The US is to join with other major powers including China, India and the EU in formulating plans for a global green recovery from the coronavirus crisis, in the only major international summit on the climate emergency this year. The idea of a green recovery to prevent a dangerous rebound in greenhouse gas emissions to above pre-Covid-19 levels has been gathering steam, but few governments have yet committed to plans.  If they fail to do so in the next few months, the economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis risks locking in high carbon emissions that would lead to climate catastrophe. Next week, the International Energy Agency (IEA) will host an online summit for the world’s biggest economies as well as developing countries, covering 80% of global emissions. It aims to set out plans for boosting renewable energy, energy efficiency and other emissions-cutting projects that would generate tens of millions of “shovel-ready” green jobs around the world to replace those lost in the pandemic. Dan Brouillette, the US secretary of state for energy, will attend, along with China’s energy minister, Zhang Jianhua, the EU commission’s vice-president, Frans Timmermans, and the UK’s business secretary, Alok Sharma, who is president of the UN Cop26 climate talks, now postponed to next year. Key to success will be that governments can sign up to green recovery plans even if – like the US - they are sceptical on the climate crisis. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “Even if governments do not take climate change as a key priority, they should still implement our sustainable recovery plan just to create jobs and to give economic growth. Renovating buildings, for instance, is a job machine.” Birol fears a rerun of the recovery after the financial crisis of 2008, when emissions declined sharply in the recession but quickly returned to levels much higher than before, as governments invested in coal-fired power plants, constructed inefficient buildings, and rolled out road-building schemes. “To halt the rebound, we need to put emissions into structural decline,” he said. That can be done by renovating buildings to use less energy, constructing wind farms and solar plants – which now produce power at a lower cost than fossil fuels – as well as building out broadband and other telecoms networks, and the infrastructure for electric vehicles, which cut down on air pollution as well as carbon dioxide. Research has already found that pursuing a green recovery would create more jobs and a greater return on investment in both the short and the long term than a return to business as usual. The IEA summit on 9 July will be the only major meeting of governments to discuss the climate crisis this year, because the UN Cop26 summit has been postponed to next year due to the pandemic. US participation is crucial, because the White House is pulling out of the Paris agreement, with effect from 4 November, the day after the presidential election. Birol warned that unless governments put in motion plans for a green recovery within the next few months, the opportunity created by the lockdowns – which resulted in a 17% plunge in emissions in April – will be lost. Emissions are already rebounding faster than experts expected. If governments invest in high-carbon infrastructure to restart their economies, as many are already doing, the world will be on track for more than 3C of global heating, which would be catastrophic. “What kind of energy choices we make now will determine the decades to come,” Birol told the Guardian in an interview. “This will be critical for energy and climate change. If we see a rebound like 2008, the chances of reaching our climate goals will be much slimmer, if they exist at all.” The IEA plans to invite civil society groups from around the world to the July summit, as well as the chief executives of more than 70 global energy businesses, to gain broad backing for a green recovery. Birol said the IEA meeting would provide a vital “bridge” between the Covid-19 shock and next year’s UN climate talks. Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia and other major emitters will also attend. There was no time to be lost, he said, as those with vested interests against a green recovery were already working behind the scenes. “I am sure there are people who would not want to see this [green recovery], who want to see an unsustainable recovery plan.”"
"Investors managing trillions of dollars in assets have warned Brazil that escalating deforestation and the “dismantling” of policies to protect the environment and indigenous communities are “creating widespread uncertainty about the conditions for investing”. Amazon destruction rose to its highest level in more than a decade last year, Brazil’s first under the leadership of Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right nationalist who has vowed to develop the region and slash environmental protections.  And on Tuesday, in the latest chapter of an intensifying international pressure campaign, institutions from countries including the US, the UK, Norway and Japan told Brazil’s leaders the devastation – which has continued to increase this year – had to stop. “It is with deep concern that we follow the tendency of increasing deforestation in Brazil,” the group, which manages $3.7tn (£3tn) in assets, said in a letter to the Brazilian government. “As financial institutions, who have a fiduciary duty to act in the best long-term interests of our beneficiaries, we recognize the crucial role that tropical forests play in tackling climate change, protecting biodiversity and ensuring ecosystem services,” the letter added. Jeanett Bergan, the head of responsible investment at KLP, Norway’s largest pension fund and one of the letter’s 29 signatories, told the Guardian it was intended to signal to Brazil’s leaders that “what is happening there is going in the wrong direction”. “We have very strict guidelines for our investments in terms of if there is an unacceptable risk of contributing to serious environmental degradation or human rights violations then we need to consider divestment. And what is currently happening in Brazil is very alarming and poses a high risk for both environmental degradation and human rights violations,” Bergan said. “That is why we have to work very seriously with this issue.” The group – whose signatories also include Legal & General Investment Management and the Church of England – expressed concern over controversial legislative proposals to legalise occupation of public lands and forests and a Bolsonaro-backed push to open indigenous lands to commercial mining. They also highlighted recent remarks from Bolsonaro’s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, suggesting Covid-19 provided good cover to push through deregulation since journalists were distracted. “[We] urge the government of Brazil to demonstrate clear commitment to eliminating deforestation and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples,” the investors wrote. The letter comes after seven European investment firms last week announced they would divest from beef producers, grains traders and even government bonds in Brazil. “The trends we’ve seen in Brazil are very concerning,” Daniela da Costa-Bulthuis, Brazil portfolio manager for Netherlands-based asset manager Robeco, told Reuters. Over the past year, the Guardian has published a series of investigations showing the close link between the beef industry in Brazil and the deforestation of the Amazon. In December, a Guardian analysis showed that the fires which had burned in the rainforest were three times more likely to occur in beef farming zones. International condemnation of Bolsonaro’s handling of the environment, which reached a crescendo during last year’s Amazon burning season, has sparked some reaction from Brazil’s government. In January, Brazil announced the creation of an “Amazon Council” supposedly tasked with defending the world’s largest rainforest and placed vice-president Hamilton Mourão in charge of those efforts. But Rubens Ricupero, Brazil’s former environment minister, said he suspected the anti-deforestation plan was little more than “pure public relations” designed to hoodwink the world. “I am very sceptical,” Ricupero said, noting that the “disastrous” increase in deforestation had continued this year. “These are not small increases. These are gigantic increases – and so far there are no facts that would justify thinking that the government is genuinely concerned about this,” Ricupero added. “Even if the government now manages zero deforestation [for the rest of 2020], this year will still be worse than last year. And no Brazilian government has ever managed zero deforestation, no matter how hard they have tried in the past.” Ricupero said pressure from international investors would be a mid-term worry for Bolsonaro’s administration as it looked to rebuild Latin America’s biggest economy with a series of major post-pandemic infrastructure projects. “Right now, there is no investment, from Brazilians or foreigners. But the concern is that as the pandemic begins to weaken, the government will want to revive the economy … and for that the government will need to be able to attract investments from overseas.”"
"Anthony Albanese has dumped Labor’s former backing of Malcolm Turnbull’s national energy guarantee and opened the door for taxpayer support for carbon capture and storage technologies, in a major overture to Scott Morrison to reach bipartisan agreement on energy policy. The Labor leader will use a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday to set out his guiding principles for an agreement to end more than a decade of political warfare on climate and energy policy.  In a letter sent to the prime minister before Wednesday’s address, Albanese says Labor is open minded on a new policy mechanism to guide investment as long as the emissions reduction targets are scalable – meaning a future government of either persuasion could dial them up, or wind them back – and as long as the mechanism isn’t the Coalition’s existing emissions reduction fund. The Labor leader has also told the prime minister the opposition is open to CCS, which remains a controversial technology with many environmentalists, as long as projects are not funded through the national renewable energy bodies the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. But Albanese says Labor will not support domestic nuclear power. The Morrison government has flagged examining “emerging nuclear technologies” as part of Australia’s energy mix in the future in a new discussion paper kicking off the process of developing its much-vaunted technology investment roadmap. While Albanese has signalled that Labor cannot accept the Coalition’s emissions reduction fund – the heavily criticised policy that replaced Labor’s carbon price in 2013 – as the bipartisan mechanism, he says a future Labor government would not seek to unwind contracts entered during this parliament, including any contracts involving support for CCS. Labor’s new position reflects an attempt by Albanese to balance divided views within his own ranks. Some in the right faction believe Labor’s commitment to climate policy ambition has cost the party electorally, and Labor will not win the next federal election unless it reconnects with workers in carbon-intensive industries in New South Wales and Queensland. But it is also an effort to challenge Morrison to use the post Covid-19 recovery to display genuine bipartisanship in the service of fixing a problem that has festered in Australia for more than a decade. Albanese’s repositioning also comes as the major parties accelerate their campaigns in the marginal seat of Eden-Monaro, where climate change is an issue, with the byelection due on 4 July. The Coalition has successfully weaponised climate change against Labor at every federal election since 2013, but the government is also under pressure from business groups and major institutions to end the policy uncertainty that is undermining investment in critical infrastructure. Facing sustained pressure to adopt a 2050 target of net zero emissions, pressure it is continuing to resist despite signing the Paris agreement which has that ambition embedded within it, the government plans instead to develop the technology roadmap as the cornerstone of the Coalition’s mid-century emissions reduction strategy. Given that the government has launched the roadmap, Labor is taking the opportunity to launch its own pivot on energy policy, and attempt to open the door to a new round of discussions. A leading Australian business organisation, the AiGroup, has called for the two biggest economic challenges in memory – recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions – to be addressed together, saying that would boost economic growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing. A number of other community and investor groups have expressed similar sentiments. In his letter to Morrison, Albanese says Australia has lacked a national energy policy since the renewable energy target was met in late 2019 and Morrison dumped Turnbull’s Neg shortly after taking the prime ministership. Labor adopted the Neg as policy during the last parliament in an effort to see whether any common ground could be reached between the major parties, but that proved fruitless. The letter says the lack of a settled mechanism has increased investor uncertainty “and new investment in renewable energy generation fell by 50% in 2019, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia and industry analysis”. “We have an opportunity to move past partisan approaches to energy policy, to draw on the community’s clear desire for more bipartisan approaches to difficult policy areas, and to finally deliver an enduring, effective and bipartisan energy policy for Australia,” Albanese writes. Labor has adopted a net zero target by 2050 as policy post-election, but it remains unclear what interim emissions reduction targets will be."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot only has siting of weather stations near urban heat sources have been a real issue for weather measurement stations worldwide, but so maybe has the recently implemented automatic electronic weather measurement instrumentation.
Reports are appearing that the new automatic system may be producing exaggerated temperature readings. For example this may be the case in Germany: read here and here.
Now we find another example, this one coming from the Alice Springs, Australia station.
According to the Australian ABC news site, the new electronic thermometer measured a scorching 46°C (an all time high) last Tuesday. However an adjacent mercury thermometer showed only 41.5°C, i.e. a huge 4.5°C less! It turns out that the 46°C reading was a “spike” that lasted only a minute before disappearing.
As a consequence, the ABC writes, the “Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has withdrawn its advice Alice Springs recorded its hottest day on Tuesday, blaming a faulty thermometer for an incorrect temperature reading.”
The old record of 45.2°C was set 55 years ago, in 1960. The ABC quotes climatologist Joel Lisonbee:



<!--

It looks like we had an instrument fault with our automatic weather station at the Alice Springs Airport. […] We have some mercury and glass thermometers that did not show that spike to 46C. […]
They showed the maximum temperature yesterday to be only 41.5C.”
According to the ABC, the station is located right next to a “scorching” airport tarmac. So how could the new automatic thermometer produce such a faulty reading?
It seems that these new automatic systems are highly sensitive. As reported here at NTZ, one German weather instrumentation expert conducted an 8.5 year side-by-side comparison test of the new automatic electronic temperature measurement system and the former mercury glass thermometer. That test showed that the new automatic thermometers produced a mean temperature for the period that was a whopping 0.9°C warmer than the mercury thermometer. That result could possibly in part explain why Germany’s annual mean temperature jumped by a similar amount from 1985 to 2000, i.e. the period that Germany transitioned over to automatic measurement.
The Alice Springs inflated reading is an indication that the new measurement system indeed may be overstating temperature readings all over the world, thus adding uncertainties on top of those created by the urban heat island effect.
With the Alice Springs Station, the error was caught and the “record high” was withdrawn. Yet the question remains if this is the case all over the world. How many recent records are in fact not records at all, but rather are merely faulty readings produced from instrumentation and siting issues?

In a clear case of protesting just a tad too much, Australia’s ABC has spent nearly 3000 words shrilly “fact-checking” the claim that the taxpayer-funded broadcaster is biased toward the green-left. When Professor Sinclair Davidson claimed that ABC employees are five times more likely to vote Green than the rest of Australia, the ABC shrieked in protest.



I mean, forget the fact that the ABC gives [twice as much air-time](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/nation/greens-bias-alleged-onabc-radios-rn-breakfast/news-story/5b4ad67e52bf3ab82a36f009267448bf) to Green politicians as any others, or that Greens are far less likely to be heckled and interrupted by ABC interviewers.



But, here’s the thing: much of the ABC’s criticism of the study on which Professor Davidson based his claim is reasonably correct. **Which poses the question: why doesn’t the ABC apply the same skepticism to climate change alarmism?**



First, examine the study:



In making the claim, Professor Davidson referred to a study published in 2013 which surveyed 605 journalists from a variety of organisations on their voting intentions.



Fifty-nine of these journalists were from the ABC, and only 34 of them answered the question on voting intention, with 25 either undecided or electing not to answer.



Of the 34 who did answer, 41.2 per cent, or 14, said they would vote for the Greens.



That figure is indeed vastly more than the average 8% or so of Australians who voted Green in the past two decades (the number fluctuates from as low as 5%, but has never exceeded 11%). So, Sinclair is right on that point. But is the figure reliable? It’s here that the ABC finds its skepticism, for once.



But experts told Fact Check that the ABC sub-sample was too small and the rate of undecided and non-response too high to be able to draw accurate conclusions from the survey on ABC journalist voting intention, let alone voting intention of all ABC employees […]



Associate Professor Olivier said that […]there was no “magic response rate”, but the sample in the study was “clearly too small to accurately estimate the proportion among all ABC journalists”.



“Another issue is it is well-known that people who feel strongly about a survey are more likely to respond. With regards to this survey, the results could mean that Greens members are more passionate about their party affiliation than others and thus more likely to respond,” he said.



Now, all of this is absolutely correct, and the ABC might deserve some commendation for (for once) applying some proper, skeptical rigor. **If only they always did.**



Too small sample size? Low response rate? Results skewed by motivated responses? **Sounds exactly like some other dodgy studies that the ABC nonetheless accepts without question…**



All of the “studies” on which the “97%” claim is based are even more flawed than the one which has got the ABC’s hemp knickers in such a twist. Yet, the ABC regards them as gospel truth.



 **Funny how blinkered ideologues come over all “skeptical” only when it suits them.**



Even funnier: buried deep in the “fact check” is a concession that the ABC is indeed grossly biased to the Greens. Just a smidgen less than Professor Davidson claimed.



Fact Check asked Associate Professor Olivier for help […]”If I compare the ABC and Newspoll results for Greens preference in a simple analysis, ABC journalists are 2.4 times as likely to prefer Greens than the general public,” Associate Professor Olivier said.



Associate Professor Olivier gave his calculation a 95 per cent confidence interval of between 1.5 and 3.8.



The ABC really is biased – and it shows.

"ATLANTA  —   The most arresting vista in town comes into view around a curve on westbound Freedom Parkway, on the periphery of downtown. The road crests just before it intersects Boulevard, at a traffic light that always seems to glow red, as if to allow motorists a minute to savor the panorama before them. The striking thing is not the majesty of the skyline but its accessibility  —   here I am, the city beckons, come and gawk. For from that vantage point, Atlanta just is: a   mecca, the cradle of the civil rights movement, a magnet for transplants, a college football locus, the shimmering capital of the South, and more. All of which are accurate but still do not capture the city’s nuances. “I don’t think people understand Atlanta,” Doug Hertz said. Aside from his schooling at Tulane, in New Orleans, Hertz, 64, has lived here his entire life, which makes him a rarity. The city teems with people who moved here for work, school, family, or just to live nearer to the spinach and sausage meatloaf at Murphy’s. They have contributed to a booming growth  —   the metropolitan area’s diverse population has swelled to more than 5. 7 million, an increase of more than 1. 46 million since 2000  —   that over the past few decades has also shaped Atlanta’s layered relationship with its sports teams. Hertz is a limited partner of the Falcons, who on Sunday will play the New England Patriots in the team’s second Super Bowl appearance since its inception in 1966. They last reached the championship game in the 1998 season, losing to the Denver Broncos, when I was a freshman at Emory University here and, more to the point, was one of those people Hertz was talking about, struggling to understand Atlanta. That September, I joined surprising brigades of Philadelphia Eagles fans invading the Georgia Dome for the Falcons’ home opener. Not even three weeks later, a group of us arrived at Turner Field, maybe two hours before Game 1 of the Atlanta Braves’ baseball playoff series against the Chicago Cubs, and still managed to buy tickets. Six of them. In the same row. My frame of reference was Philadelphia, whose zealous fans in analogous circumstances would never accept such apathy. Season after season, the Braves won their division, destroying the Phillies, and this is how their fans responded? “Are we as rabid and overtly   like Boston or New York? No, we could be better,” Gavin Godfrey, a native Atlanta journalist who chronicles culture and sports  said over lunch in Castleberry Hill, a historic arts district by the Georgia Dome. “But that doesn’t mean we don’t care, and not every town has to be held to that standard. Not every city’s built the same. ” In the Northeast, for instance, with a deep and abiding sports culture that spans generations, and in some cases centuries, there is less competition for sports fans’ loyalty. The emotional connection with college football, for instance, is not as strong as it is with some professional sports. For years, the opposite has been  —   and to a degree, still is  —   true of Atlanta, where on autumn Saturdays fans pack bars and living rooms, or flee for Georgia, Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, South Carolina, Tennessee, all within a   drive. “Most of us, that D. N. A. is not there for professional sports franchises,” Hertz said. The Falcons have built a base of loyalists  —   the City Council president, Ceasar Mitchell, said he drove down to Miami for the Falcons’ last Super Bowl appearance despite not having a ticket  —   but so struggled to pack the Dome that home games were not shown on local television because of the N. F. L. ’s old blackout rule. The team’s middling history has also failed to entice the local residents and persuade the newcomers to come out. The arrival of the quarterback Michael Vick, in 2001, mirrored the city’s spirit at the time  —   ascending, vibrant and   forward  —   and his downfall, for his involvement in an interstate dogfighting ring, created tension, on a racial and cultural level, that lingered for years. Vick’s successor, Matt Ryan, is his antithesis in nearly every possible way  —   be it race, playing style, pedigree or personality. “Some of our fans will always be proud that an   quarterback succeeded,” Hertz said. “What I think has happened over a period of time is a growing appreciation and acceptance in Matt Ryan, and that his style is every bit as spectacular on and off the field. ” The city’s evolution, coupled with an effort by the owner of the Falcons, Arthur Blank, to promote a sense of community around the team, has strengthened its bond with the Falcons. Since 2012, when the Falcons lost in the conference championship game, the Georgia Dome, which seats 71, 250, has achieved at least 98 percent of its   capacity every year. This season’s mark of 98. 2 percent, 15th among the 32 teams and the lowest since 2011, bested that of, among others, the venues for the Giants, Jets, Chiefs and Patriots. As the Braves bolt northwest for a new stadium in Cobb County, a move that has left many fans feeling betrayed, the Falcons remain moored to Atlanta. Next season they move into a new home,   Stadium. “There’s something about the nature of fans here that makes them take pride,” said Molly Slavin, 29, who moved here in 2012 from Illinois. “Although it might not be in a way that translates to sports fandom as seen in other cities. ” Ryan Cameron, 47, an Atlanta radio personality and a   holder since 1998, explained that phenomenon like this: “There are people who will fight you about these Falcons,” he said. “But we’re not trying to prove to you that we’re so crazy. For us, it’s just being loud. We don’t have to brag. It’s Southern charm. ” Still, Atlanta’s gentility, a core virtue, would give way to utter delirium on Sunday  —   and for weeks and months thereafter  —   if the Falcons were to win. This city has been teased before, by those Braves behemoths of the ’90s, by the Falcons in 1998, even by the Hawks, who went   two seasons ago before losing in the conference finals. Counting the futility of its two departed N. H. L. franchises, the Flames and Thrashers, Atlanta can claim only one championship  —   Braves, 1995  —   across a combined 167 completed seasons. Pellom McDaniels, who played the final two of his eight N. F. L. seasons with the Falcons, suggested that a victory would register a psychological impact  —   an acknowledgment of the city’s trajectory, from aspirational to   and mature. During the 1996 Olympics, and in the years that followed, Atlanta seemed eager to convince others that it was cosmopolitan, sophisticated, worth exploring. Even as it grapples with its identity now, reckoning with gentrification and redevelopment forces that are at once eroding and improving neighborhoods, Atlanta projects a different image  —   of comfort and confidence in its direction, whatever that is. “It would be almost like a beacon,” said McDaniels, now the curator of   collections at Emory, said of a potential title. “That we’re working together as a community, and the success the Falcons have experienced is our success  —   that we’re doing something right. ” The term Mitchell used was runway, a point of departure for a nascent sports city that has added a Major League Soccer franchise set to begin play next season. The Falcons are thriving, interest is soaring, and from Mitchell’s perspective, he sure likes the view."

""3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter, without offering evidence for the claim.
He accused Democrats of inflating the official death toll to ""make me look as bad as possible"".
The official figure was released last month after an independent study.
On Thursday, Mr Trump tweeted that Democrats were attacking him ""when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico"".
The Republican president suggested the hurricane death toll was artificially boosted by adding those who had passed away from natural causes such as old age.
""Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!"" he tweeted.
Mr Trump's tweets came as Hurricane Florence - a category two storm projected to bring catastrophic flooding - bore down on the US East Coast.
A George Washington University study in July found that 2,975 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, which struck the island territory in September 2017.
The governor of Puerto Rico, who commissioned that research, said he accepted the estimate as official.
The study concluded the initial death toll of 64 only included those killed directly by hurricanes Maria and Irma - either by drowning, flying debris or building collapse.
George Washington University also counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water.
Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis.
Last May, Harvard University public health researchers published a study that estimated the death toll was even higher.
They said about 4,600 people died in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the hurricane from delayed medical care.
**Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington**
Donald Trump simply can't abide criticism of his performance as president. How else to explain his decision, as a hurricane looms off the US coast, to call adjusted Puerto Rican death-toll figures from Hurricane Maria a Democratic-inspired plot against him?
The politics of the Thursday-morning tweets are rough. The president has guaranteed coverage of the government response to Florence will be intermixed with talk of his feud with Puerto Rico officials and questions about the veracity of his assertions.
Mr Trump's dismissive attitude toward the loss of life also risks the ire of the tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who have relocated to Florida and can cast ballots in that state's key races in November's mid-term elections.
The president, with some justification, has said the situation in Puerto Rico after Maria was exacerbated by the island's remote location and pre-existing infrastructure issues, such as an antiquated power grid.
That could have been a reason to do more to help these American citizens. Instead, the recovery effort has devolved into a political tug-of-war that now includes debate over ""legitimate"" deaths from this tragedy.
In response, the Mayor of Puerto Rico's capital San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, tweeted: ""Mr Trump you can try and bully us with your tweets BUT WE KNOW OUR LIVES MATTER.""
""You will never take away our self respect. Shame on you!""
Earlier this week, Mr Trump hailed the US response in Puerto Rico as ""an incredible, unsung success"".
Ms Cruz then shot back: ""If he thinks the death of 3,000 people is a success God help us all.""
Last month she described Mr Trump's handling of Maria as a ""stain on his presidency"".
Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosello said in a statement this week that Maria was ""the worst natural disaster in our modern history"".
Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the US, is home to some 3.3 million people.
Even a few of Mr Trump's fellow Republicans have spoken out against him.
Florida Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring from Congress, called the president's tweets ""mind-boggling"".
She said it is a ""warped-mind that would turn this statistic into 'fake news'"", and it ""may be a new low"" for the president.
Florida Governor Rick Scott, who is currently running for the US Senate, tweeted: ""I've been to Puerto Rico 7 times & saw devastation firsthand. The loss of any life is tragic.""
Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who is also retiring, said: ""There is no reason to dispute these numbers.
""This is a devastating storm that hit an isolated island. And that's really no one's fault. It's just what happened.""
Democratic lawmakers were scathing.
The US federal government's response to Hurricane Maria has come under fresh scrutiny this week.
Photos have emerged showing 20,000 pallets of bottled water meant for victims still sitting on a runway in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, a year after the storm.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said it was investigating whether or not it placed the water bottles on the runway and if so it would ""fess up"".
Ottmar Chavez, head of the General Services Administration (GSA) in Puerto Rico, said he only became aware of the water bottles on Tuesday.
Mr Chavez said his agency had received complaints about the taste and smell of the water, and that Fema should accept responsibility.
Puerto Rican officials have previously blamed mismanagement on Fema, whereas President Trump has said authorities on the island are incompetent."
"Where did all the rocker guys go? In recent years, women have almost completely taken over the most highly visible gig in American pop: the Super Bowl halftime show, 12 minutes of music beamed worldwide. It is a ratings magnet, a marketing tool, a sponsor’s flagship, a cultural event and, of course, a live performance with no second chances, to be applauded or ruthlessly dissected, virtually in real time, via every internet resource. This Sunday, the halftime for the 51st Super Bowl belongs to Lady Gaga, along with, if preview video clips can be trusted, dozens of   dancers for a set that will include “Bad Romance. ” Lady Gaga has neither revealed any guests nor ruled out the possibility. Nor has she telegraphed whether her set will have any direct political messages. Lady Gaga has plenty to prove. Her 2016 album, “Joanne,” made a show of being more vulnerable and less glossy than her previous pop albums, bringing back the rock guitars she had welcomed on “Born This Way,” in 2011, and set aside on “Artpop,” in 2013. “Joanne” entered the Billboard 200 at No. 1 but faded fast its lead single, “Perfect Illusion,” fell short of the Top 10. But Lady Gaga is the kind of performer the Super Bowl has relied on since 2011: a veteran hitmaker who can put on a   spectacle. It’s a job category dominated by women. Women have all but taken over the Super Bowl since the Who  —   working hard, looking weary  —   headlined in 2010. Female pop stars might seem to offer the yin to football players’ yang, but in the   era, these women’s work requires its own athleticism, timing, discipline and unerring performance under pressure. Katy Perry, Madonna and Beyoncé have all presented themselves at the Super Bowl  —   as they do in their arena tours  —   as strong women, attended by masses of dancing disciples. Coldplay was the nominal headliner last year, but the N. F. L. hedged its bet on the band’s earnest British rock: It brought back Bruno Mars, who played in 2014, for part of the set and added 2013’s headliner, Beyoncé. And when Beyoncé strutted onto the field, performing “Formation,” with her dancers wearing Black   berets and Afros, Coldplay’s performance might as well have vaporized rock was forgotten. (Beyoncé and her dancers also leveraged the Super Bowl exposure by posting photos with references to the Black Lives Matter movement and fists raised in the Black Power salute, roiling social media.) For much of the preceding decade, the radio format for most Super Bowl headliners had been classic rock: Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney, along with the   Prince in 2007. The N. F. L. had decided to treat the Super Bowl halftime as a stadium concert, and these were acts with plenty of experience headlining stadiums. The Super Bowl simply added more lights and fireworks as the rockers performed a fraction of a concert. Besides Coldplay, the only other male headliner since the Who has been Bruno Mars (joined by the even more   Red Hot Chili Peppers) who played halftime as a throwback to older stadium shows. The string of rockers in the early 2000s was also a reaction to the   show in 2004 with Janet Jackson’s indelible “wardrobe malfunction,” which revealed less than what might have been seen any night on HBO, or on some red carpets, but which set off a   moral panic. (Moral panics are part of the Super Bowl fun M. I. A. Madonna’s guest in 2012, started one by raising her middle finger to the camera.) Grizzled classic rockers, the N. F. L. might have reasoned, were less likely to be separated from their tops (though the Red Hot Chili Peppers arrived   in 2014). But a major part of the impact of a stadium rock concert comes from being there as part of the crowd: feeling the power chords vibrating the bleachers, joining the singalongs, smelling the beer. But for the millions of viewers not in the stadium, the television experience is one of distance, and the perspective that of a more detached observer. The halftime show, unlike the game, doesn’t work best as a documentary of extreme physical exertion. Musicians are expected to work hard, too, but the N. F. L. came to realize that the halftime show is not so much a   as a   music video shot in one take  —   and pop stars, far more than rockers, have both the timing and the pizazz to please the camera as well as the local stadium audience. The Black Eyed Peas (led by Will. i. am but featuring the female singer Fergie) inaugurated the Super Bowl’s new pop era with a platoon of fluorescent, robotic   dancers. Since then, female Super Bowl headliners have made it their business to take over not just a big stage but also the entire field, filling it with dancers and bestriding it with outsize processions. Filling the giant field also fills the home screen. Could Lady Gaga be the one to merge the Super Bowl stadium rock concert with the pop parade? It’s an ambition she has flirted with for years, and one that   on “Joanne. ” Lady Gaga’s hits have been flamboyant,   dance tunes, but she has never been shy about unleashing the kind of   belting she brought to songs like “The Edge of Glory. ” On Sunday the Super Bowl may also rock again  —   with a lady at center stage."
"**It must have seemed like a good idea. As a taster for a big announcement about Oculus VR on Wednesday, send Mark Zuckerberg on a little virtual reality trip, including a stop in Puerto Rico.**
But the reviews are in - and they are not good.
The sight of Mr Zuckerberg using VR to survey the devastation of an island still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria may have been meant to convey Facebook's empathy with the victims.
The fact that he was there in the form of a cartoon seemed to many the perfect visual metaphor for the gulf in understanding between Silicon Valley and the real world.
Sure, he was talking about all the activities which his company had initiated to help the island, from helping people tell their families they were ok using Safety Check to sending Facebook employees to help restore connectivity.
But cartoon Zuck showing us a 360 degree view of a flooded street before zipping back to a virtual California just seemed a little, well, crass. Is Facebook really concerned about the plight of Puerto Rico, or is it merely a handy backdrop to promote Oculus, whose sales have so far proved disappointing?
It is not the first time the young tycoon has misread the public mood. Back in November following the US elections, he said it was ""crazy"" to suggest that fake news on Facebook had played any part in deciding the results.
Since then, as ever more detail has emerged about Russian use of his platform to try to influence voters, Zuckerberg has been on a journey towards understanding and acknowledging the power he has.
He's also been on a literal journey, with a mission to visit every US state this year. As he's been pictured at the dinner table with farmers in the mid-west or mused about religion, revealing he is no longer an atheist, some have seen another motive behind this odyssey. Could this be preparation for Zuckerberg 2020, a run at the White House?
Meanwhile, back at Mountain View headquarters problems are piling up in the CEO's in-tray, with politicians from left and right asking tricky questions.
Is he doing enough to stop terrorists using WhatsApp? Did Facebook promote fake news around the Las Vegas shootings? Is billionaire Peter Thiel, with his connections to the alt-right, a fit and proper person to serve on Facebook's board?
Like many a tech leader, Mark Zuckerberg has assumed that what is good for his company is good for the world, but now the world is not so sure.
As I was writing this, a reminder popped up on Facebook of a day in 2008 when I interviewed its founder during a trip to London.
Back then he seemed impossibly young, not very articulate - but very focused on building his business and ignoring the sceptics who kept telling him to sell up before the bubble burst.
Since then his vision of a company connecting the world has come true, and his business brain has out-thought all of his rivals and detractors. It's his political brain which still needs a bit of work.
Maybe it is time to retire the cartoon Zuckerberg and for the real one to spend a little more time out of the spotlight, reflecting on the impact his immensely powerful empire has on our lives.
**UPDATE 20:25**
Mark Zuckerberg has obviously been taken aback by the reaction to his virtual reality visit to Puerto Rico. He has posted this on Facebook in response to negative comments below his original post and video.
""One of the most powerful features of VR is empathy. My goal here was to show how VR can raise awareness and help us see what's happening in different parts of the world. I also wanted to share the news of our partnership with the Red Cross to help with the recovery. Reading some of the comments, I realize this wasn't clear, and I'm sorry to anyone this offended."""
"We’ve been told to get used to flooding. Whether or not the latest floods were caused by climate change, this winter has reminded us that floods are and will continue to be a fact of human existence, especially if we continue to build on flood plains and due to increased extreme weather events as predicted in a changing climate. The good news is that living with flooding is already a way of life for much of the world. The Netherlands for example has more than half its landmass below sea-level and building techniques there can teach us how to adapt where we live and to work with water, rather than against it. We can do this with a combination of improving the way we manage the water system, the amount that we build and the way that we build. We should build less, not more, in flood risk areas and increase the amount of space we give to water storage. This means more green spaces, storing water and permeable surfaces.  And, if we do build in flood risk areas, there are many designs for flood resilient buildings we can use. Here’s an outline of how we can adapt existing buildings and build new ones differently to protect and minimise damage to property (and life) when flooding happens. Architects such as Baca specialise in flood risk designs. In the UK, especially on new developments in the Thames Estuary, we tend to favour “sacrificial ground floors”. This constitutes a building with a raised ground floor, where residential areas on the first floor. The basement – which can be used for storage or as a car park in times of no flooding – is there to contain water when it floods and protect the residential areas from water damage.  This design is suitable in areas that have a low to medium probability of flooding and has the drawback of having to sacrifice the basement when it floods. The space has limited uses such as for storage and the contents will have to be moved above flood risk level in the event of flooding. Building on stilts is suitable in high flood probability zones and is more common in the Netherlands. This structure is useful in areas liable to a lot of flooding and particularly coastal areas. Added protection is still needed, however, from breakwaters to prevent debris damaging the stilts. Urban environments are less suitable to stilt structures. The area underneath the stilts is hard to manage and use effectively. Nothing can really grow under them so it’s difficult to make the area into a public space. A lack of surveillance and ownership of the area can cause security issues in an urban environment. Erecting buildings on stilts also creates the need for ramps, lifts and aerial walkways – all of which are tricky in urban areas.  Floating buildings are another option, but may not be suitable for much of the UK, as they are built directly onto water. They use special polystyrene slabs that are covered in concrete for the base of the structure. As the water level rises, the ground floor moves with it, up to around five and a half metres. This method is tested in the Netherlands – they even built a floating greenhouse. Building on water avoids the need to reclaim land and floating structures are suitable for areas with a high risk of flooding. Connected to a floating pier, smaller buildings of two storeys are most suitable for this. They can still be connected to services using pipework that is waterproof and flexible to allow for the vertical movement of the building. Another way of making buildings more flood proof is to ensure minimal damage occurs to properties by “wet-proofing” them. This may be achieved through the use of water-resistant materials, for example concrete or tiles for floors, and more robust walls and fixtures. Electrical controls, cables and appliances should be placed higher than the normal, usually above one metre from the ground. This can be done in all areas that may potentially flood.  As well as new building in the future bearing in mind these options, most existing structures can be wet-proofed. This means they are designed with possible future flooding in mind and result in only minimal damage to the property should this happen.  The exact timing of flooding is unpredictable, but the question of it taking place cannot be ignored and it’s time to start implementing more of these flood-proofing measures.  These, and many more, can be easily incorporated into current building procedures. If the right foresight and planning are given, we can have flood-resistant buildings that aid mitigation efforts and, if need be, support the future adaptation of our cities for years to come. This article is derived from my book The Environmental Design Pocketbook and chapter, “Future-proofing London” in Sarah Bell and James Paskins’ Imagining the Future City: London 2062."

 _Mae Sot, Thailand —_ For decades, the ruling military junta conducted brutal military campaigns against a score of ethnic minorities concentrated in the east of Burma, which it eventually renamed Myanmar. Among those who suffered the most were the Karen (or Kayin), the country’s second‐​largest ethnic group, which numbers between 5 and 7 million people, or about 10 percent of the population. Most Karen live near the central–southeast border with Thailand. A large percentage are Christian, their ancestors having been converted back in the 1800s.



The small Thai border town of Mae Sot suffered from the consequences of that fighting. U.N. organizations and private NGOs are located there, along with the Karen leadership. About 35 miles north sits Mae La refugee camp, established in 1984. Mae La’s population exploded as a result of military operations by the Burmese army, or Tatmadaw, across the nearby border. The army invaded Karen territory, destroyed villages, killed animals, conscripted porters, brutalized residents, and placed land mines. People had no choice but to flee, and perhaps a million Karen were displaced during the conflict. Over the years, the strength of the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) — the armed wing of the Karen National Union (KNU), which has been at war with the Burmese government since 1949 — ebbed, in part due to internal splits, causing the “liberated zones” it protected to shrink.



A ceasefire was agreed to in 2012. No longer do Tatmadaw attacks lead to periodic surges of new refugees across the Moi River into Thailand. Mae La’s population has fallen to some 50,000 Karen today, but it remains a de facto city, with traditional wooden homes on poles carpeting the undulating hills. Although the military junta that took control of Thailand in 2014 hoped to force all of Mae La’s residents back across the border, the camp feels like a permanent home for the Karen refugees who live there.





Burmese hopes for a more peaceful and prosperous future after decades of tyranny and strife are receding.



U.S.-based Christian Freedom International has worked with the Karen for years. CFI trained medics, opened rudimentary but vital clinics, subsidized orphanages and churches, and otherwise helped mitigate the impact of the seemingly endless war. At the group’s invitation I first visited the region nearly two decades ago, and saw how the Karen greatly appreciated the efforts of Americans devoted to standing with them in their time of need.



During some of the ugliest years of fighting, the George W. Bush administration allowed thousands of Karen refugees to settle in America. CFI, then headquartered in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., helped a number of these new residents, some of whom had attended CFI‐​backed schools while refugees, adjust to a very new culture and climate. The group set up tutoring, assisted residents in finding employment, and organized volunteers to help Karen families adapt to America. It even bought a motel and turned the rooms into apartments for Karen families.



CFI is not the only organization to assist the Karen refugees who have settled across the Burmese border with Thailand. But in recent years some international groups have left, believing their job to be done. Refugees at Mae La report that aid has declined. And with many displaced Karen still struggling, there is much work yet to be done.



In Mae Sot, CFI operates a small but intense school for Karen students mostly in their teens. The school, now called the Victory Bible Academy, teaches practical subjects within a Christian framework, hosting orphans as well as kids sent by fearful parents. In past years many of its students suffered through military assaults, family deaths, burning villages, and desperate escapes. Today, the students’ homes are largely at peace and they look forward to a more prosperous and peaceful future.



VBA is overseen by a redoubtable Canadian couple, Joe and Marnie Scott, who manage, teach, and serve the students. As the Scotts confront big practical challenges every day, they also promote their students’ spiritual education. It isn’t always easy, since for some Karen, Christianity is more an identity than a way of life, and it is not always easy to see God amid years of hardship and despair. But there is evidence that the message is having an impact on students. During their school breaks many students choose to return to Burma to promote their faith, and CFI’s Wendy Wright reports that half of the school’s recent graduates work in some way aiding their communities.



Unfortunately, the bright economic future that VBA’s students long for still looks far off. Educational and economic opportunities for Burmese citizens living in Thailand are limited. Karen State in Burma is mountainous and rural, often even primitive. Transportation and other infrastructure projects are underway, but good roads are few. Many people are isolated in hamlets or small villages. The provincial authorities have talked of attracting industry, but access to electricity is limited or nonexistent in many areas, and there would be little legal or regulatory protection for businesses that did choose to invest: Neither the KNU nor the Burmese government recognizes the other’s property titles.



What’s more, peace remains tenuous at best. The Karen, who fought with the British against Japan in World War II, took up arms for independence and autonomy after the war. The conflict has ended only provisionally. Although a civilian government effectively controlled by long‐​time democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi has taken root in the country’s capital, Naypyidaw, it does not control the military, which remains a state within a state. And negotiations with the Karen and other ethnic groups — including the Arakan, Chin, Karenni, Lahu, Mon, Pa‐​O, and Shan — to turn the current ceasefire into a permanent peace have achieved little.



Worse yet, the horrific attacks on the Rohingya people raise questions as to the military’s willingness to tolerate ethnic diversity. The Rohingya bear a special burden — they are Muslim and stateless, having been stripped of their citizenship and declared foreign interlopers by the government. Even Suu Kyi appears to share this view. Buddhist nationalism is on the rise in Burma, as it is in Thailand and Sri Lanka. And the army’s brutal depredations demonstrate that its character remains unchanged, that the apparent desire for peace in the east is more a matter of convenience than of principle.



Indeed, the Karen and other ethnic groups are still suffering under the Tatmadaw’s heavy hand. Last December, Burmese officials barred a Karen group from erecting a statue of an ethnic leader in a public spot in Karen State. In March, shortly after I visited, the military invaded the township of Hpapun, confiscating land and displacing thousands of Karen residents from more than a dozen villages to build a road. A month later, Burmese soldiers ambushed Saw O Moo, an activist on his way home from a meeting on humanitarian aid for these new refugees.



As yet, the possibility that widespread hostilities in Karen State could resume appears distant, but serious fighting continues against other ethnic groups, such as the Shan. Last month, combat flared with the Kachin, another largely Christian people, displacing thousands more civilians. An unprecedented protest against the fighting was held in Yangon, only to be roughly dispersed by riot police.



Life today is better for many Burmese. But though, in a welcome change from previous visits, I was able to freely cross into Karen State without danger, peace is still maintained only because those institutions and officers who not that long ago were ravaging the Karen people allow it to be maintained. Some Karen worry about the ability of their leaders, both in the KNU and the KNLA, to stand up to further pressure.



The West has few good options for changing this sorry state of affairs. Though the halting move toward democracy appeared to vindicate support for Suu Kyi, the brutal campaign of murder and ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya has discredited her government and the Tatmadaw. But few Western governments want to admit that their fulsome support for the iconic Suu Kyi and her government was a mistake. To reimpose sanctions might end any move toward fuller democracy.



How, then, to encourage the government to consummate peace with its citizens, including the Karen? Burma was once one of President Barack Obama’s few celebrated foreign‐​policy successes. Today it looks far less like a success, and the Trump administration doesn’t appear to be paying much attention, let along seeking a solution, to the increasing conflict. Which means that the situation will change only if the Burmese government ends its multi‐​front war on its own people — an outcome we should all hope for, as unlikely as it seems.

"**Entrepreneur Elon Musk has followed through on his plan to boost power resources in Puerto Rico after it was devastated by Hurricane Maria.**
Mr Musk's firm, Tesla, has set up solar panels and energy storage batteries at Hospital del Nino, a children's hospital in San Juan.
The batteries will provide energy from the panels when sunlight is scarce.
Tesla said on Twitter this was the ""first of many"" such projects going live.
Mr Musk has also donated $250,000 (Â£190,000) of his own money to support humanitarian efforts in Puerto Rico, where many people are still without electricity.
Earlier this month, Tesla's co-founder offered - via Twitter - to help rebuild energy infrastructure.
The US territory's governor, Ricardo Rossello, responded: ""Let's talk.""
Mr Rossello has since thanked Tesla for its work at the hospital - also on Twitter (in Spanish).
A $300m contract to repair the power grid was recently awarded to a small, two-year-old US firm with just two employees.
Following criticism from US lawmakers, Mr Rossello defended the deal this week.
He said the company, Whitefish Energy Holdings, was the only one that met Puerto Rico's requirements at a low enough cost.
Tesla is known for its electric cars, such as the Model S, but the company is expanding into the renewable energy sector.
It is installing a 100 megawatt set of its Powerpack batteries in Australia - the largest lithium ion battery storage project in the world.
And last week, it won a $160m contract with wind turbine maker Vestas to place batteries at a new wind farm, also in Australia.
The wind farm will feature solar panels as well as wind turbines and has been designed to provide power for more than 35,000 homes."
"An estimated 5,800 homes and businesses have been flooded in England and Wales this winter, now officially the wettest ever. By comparison, the total was 55,300 properties after the 2007 summer floods, and more than 10,000 following those in November 2000. So while rivers have been at their highest on record in some places this month, the flooding has been less widespread and less damaging than previously. This is little consolation to those currently underwater of course, but it leads to the obvious conclusion that this scale of flooding is not unprecedented. The fact is simply that we are not sufficiently resilient to floods. The Environment Agency estimates almost 500,000 properties in England and Wales are insufficiently flood protected. This figure is based on those properties that will flood on average at least once in 75 years, but will include many that will flood much more regularly. On a small island, our relatively large population is concentrated in lowlands and valley bottoms. Flat land next to rivers and coasts is attractive and cheap to develop, but most exposed. Planning controls have not been sufficiently restrictive, and as a wealthier society now than in the past we have more to lose. Risk is the combination of the probability of an event occurring and the loss it causes, and if the frequency of floods and the damage they cause rise, then flood risk will increase significantly. One can question the 500,000 figure, but one does not need to be a statistician to establish that there are many thousands of properties that can expect to flood every few years, and many tens of thousands that can expect to flood every decade or so.  So why do we seem continually surprised that floods occur? Collective memory tends to be short: people live more transient lives, less rooted to a particular community. Just because no one can remember a recent flood doesn’t mean the risk has disappeared. Our records of river flow and water levels are surprisingly short. Most monitoring equipment was installed in the 1960s and 1970s, and with only 30-40 years of data it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of extreme events that occur, on average, much less frequently. It’s not surprising then that new records are set in every major incident – the combination of only relatively recent historical data and the fact that each flood tends to affect a different set of places makes this statistically inevitable. Worse still, the usefulness of these already short records is reduced by both changing land use, which alters the way water flows through river catchments and the storage capacity of river channels, and by a changing climate, which alters the location, timing and duration of extreme rainfall events. We know natural variation brings us cycles of flood-poor and flood-rich decades. In the very few places where we have long records that stretch back 100 years or more there is clear evidence of this. The 1890s and 1920s were two examples, and over the last 50 years we have moved from the flood poor decades of the 1960-1980s, to the flood rich decades from the late 1990s to the present. This high natural variability in extreme weather events including flooding is probably driven by changes in global atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns, although this is by no means definitively established. This means estimating flood frequency from historical records is difficult, as records from flood-poor years may not tell us much about what to expect from the flood-rich period we currently find ourselves in. So floods are inevitable, and worse now than in the recent past, and we have made things worse for ourselves as a society in the way we have approached building and flood protection. Moving 500,000 homes is not a viable option. We can spend money on flood defences for vulnerable properties, or share the risk collectively through insurance. Both are elements of the solution, but the extent to which society as a whole should pick up the costs for the risky decisions of some needs to be widely debated. A better solution may be to ensure vulnerable properties are made more flood-resilient so homeowners can recover more quickly and cheaply when they are flooded, rather than the enormous cost of trying to protect them entirely with massive flood defences. In this respect the government’s offer of £5,000 to fund alterations to each flooded property that would make it more resilient – moving electric circuits and plug sockets up above flood levels, fitting flood-proof doors, waterproofing masonry – is a step in the right direction.  We also have to recognise that some of the uses to which we put our land are unsustainable. The profits from carefree building on floodplains benefit the developer, but the cost of flooding is borne by the homeowner and, in the long run, by society through taxpayer funded schemes and insurance costs. Intensive farming practices also exacerbate the problem, by compacting soil which prevents water being absorbed into the ground and encourages more surface run-off. This washes away sediments that clog drainage systems and rivers, and washes fertiliser into ditches and streams that stimulates excessive plant growth, forcing water out onto the floodplain more quickly. Both man-made climate change and natural variability are changing the frequency of flooding over time, but we don’t yet know which is more important. Our view is that over the next 20 years natural variability will have a greater impact, but over the next 100 years there is much greater scope to see an increase in flooding that is unequivocally the result of climate change. Change is certain; but the details of how, where, and why are still unclear. What is unarguable is that in the UK there are steps that can be taken now to reduce the impact floods have, and to ensure that our ability to cope and respond to floods is not compromised in the future – we would be wise to take them. Paul Bates is on the Royal Society working group examining human resilience to climate change and disasters, whose report is due later this year."

WUWT reader Jim Cripwell writes in a comment
I’m so annoyed with this…From today’s GWPF, I find http://www.thegwpf.org/uk-government-no-global-cooling-centuries/ I quote:

“The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Baroness Verma) (Con): The UK government has made substantial investment in research that concerns the likelihood and timing of future changes in global and regional climate.
 All of the climate models and policy-relevant pathways of future greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions considered in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) recent Fifth Assessment Report show a long-term global increase in temperature during the 21st century is expected. In all cases, the warming from increasing greenhouse gases significantly exceeds any cooling from atmospheric aerosols. Other effects such as solar changes and volcanic activity are likely to have only a minor impact over this timescale”

So, presumably the UK Met. Office used the IPCC models to prepare this reply. It is given in the House of Lords, by a Peer of the Realm, so by the rules of the British Parliament, it OUGHT to be accurate. Since the climate models are completely incapable of producing accurate predictions, the answer given by Baroness Verma is little more than a pack of lies.
It was this sort of statement by the Met. Office a few years ago that persuaded Heathrow Airport not to invest in snow clearing equipment, so the a mere 5 inches of snow closed one of the busiest airports in the world for several days. 5 inches of snow here is Ottawa, Canada, would barely cause any delays in service.
Surely it is about time that someone with both authority and courage to stand up and say this nonsense of CAGW must stop before even more damage is done.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAbout 10 days ago a press release by the Alfred Wegener Institute gave readers the impression that the Arctic sea ice would keep on melting. In response I sent e-mails to the two scientists cited in it, Marcel Nicolaus and Lars Kaleschke, and asked if they would advise a bet on it. I even posted my bet here.
My proposed bet: mean September sea ice for the period of 2017-2022 will be higher than the September mean for the period 2007 – 2012.
Not surprisingly I got no response.
I also sent versions of that e-mail to other institutes, some having a chronic habit of sounding alarm when it comes to global sea ice. My e-mail:
Dear —–
I’ve read with great interest the latest AWI press release on global sea ice. www.awi.de/en/news/pressreleases/de3
One easily gets the impression the experts believe the Arctic sea ice trend will continue its downward trend over the coming years. This surprises me. Myself I think the Arctic will actually recover over the next decade or two. I’m convinced enough to bet $1000 on this. I believe that the average September sea extent for the years 2017 – 2022 will be greater than the mean September 2007-2012 sea ice extent.
Would you advise me against making such a bet? Would you bet? Surely the science can provide a probability here. Your short comment on this would be very much appreciated.
Kind regards

Those who replied are printed in bold, and I’d like to thank them for taking the time to respond, particularly Dr. Dirk Notz and Dr. Andrey Proshutinsky. They both took the time to provide a real reply, see here and here.
Three of the 4 replying advised against betting the Arctic would melt, warning there is too much natural variability involved. Dr. Andrey Proshutinsky even hinted that the Arctic may in fact just do the very opposite.
Mojib Latif also sent a brief reply advising against a bet, citing “natural decadal variability”. He wrote:
I don’t bet. There is of course natural decadal variability which superimposes the long-term downward sea ice extent trend, but this decadal variability is hard to predict.”
Lisa at the NSIDC also sent a reply, providing two links: here and here. Scientists at the NSIDC also declined to bet.
The other eight scientists did not even reply. It seems some like shouting from the rooftops the sky is falling, but suddenly get real quiet when asked to put money on it.
In summary, no one expressed any interest in accepting the above bet and not one even advised anyone to accept it. Result: From a science with a “97% consensus” and “99% certainty”, 0% of the scientists are ready to bet on it.
Three of the 4 scientists who did reply say it is not possible to predict the Arctic sea ice over the next 8 years (yet many scientists claim that predicting the Arctic 50, 100 or 200 years into the future is 99% slam dunk?).
Of course we can understand scientists’ reluctance to bet on Arctic sea ice. But on the other hand why are so many of these scientists insisting that the rest of us bet our modern prosperity on their models being right (when obviously they themselves don’t even trust them 8 years out)?
It all smacks of a sham to me.

"The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives plans to send more agents to Chicago to help curb a surge in violence that claimed more than 750 lives there last year, a spokesman for the bureau’s Chicago field division said on Friday night. The spokesman, David D. Coulson, said that sending additional personnel to the city, where there were more than 3, 500 shootings in 2016, has been “in the works for some time to figure out how to leverage our resources. ” CNN reported that the bureau would send 20 additional agents. Mr. Coulson said he was unsure where that figure originated and that “everything is fluid. ” A final decision on the number of additional agents will most likely be made in the next week, he said. The field division, which covers Illinois and parts of Indiana, has more than 100 agents. About 35 are assigned to Chicago, Mr. Coulson said. The news comes as Chicago, the nation’s third largest city, has been reeling from an increase in gun violence, a sharply critical Department of Justice report and a series of remarks and postings on Twitter about the city from President Trump. In a tweet on Jan. 24, Mr. Trump threatened to “send in the Feds!” if the city did not fix the “carnage. ” CNN reported that the agents would be assigned to a “Chicago Crime Guns Strike Force. ” Mr. Coulson described that as “probably a good depiction. ” He said that agents already assigned to the city work on firearms trafficking cases, cracking down on gangs and those who are prohibited from possessing guns. Adam Collins, a spokesman for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, said on Friday night that city officials had not been told about the plans for additional federal agents but that the mayor would be glad for their help. “We have received no word from the federal government to confirm these reports, but it would be welcome news if the administration has indeed agreed to one of Mayor Emanuel’s requests for federal resources,” Mr. Collins said. “We remain hopeful that they will also provide added D. E. A. and F. B. I. agents, that they will boost the prosecution rate for federal gun crimes in Chicago, and that they will provide funding for successful violence prevention efforts. ” More than 750 people were   murdered in Chicago in 2016, the police said, a 58 percent increase over 2015, and the highest total since 1997."

[NZCPR.com](https://www.nzcpr.com/state-control/)



The Government of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is shaping up to be one of the most controlling in New Zealand’s history.



Like all socialist regimes that aim to impose the will of a few onto the many, they will eventually fail because most people by their very nature do not want to be controlled. Socialists refuse to understand that simple truth of the human spirit.



The attraction of socialism is that it sounds so good, especially to those who feel they would benefit from the taxing of others.



Winston Churchill described it well when he said, “Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy”. While he then went on to say, “Its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery”, he was not quite right. There are some who don’t have to share in the misery of socialism – namely the ruling elite.



The reality is that throughout history, socialism – which can be characterised as excessive government control – has led to widespread hardship and oppression. But rather than being persuaded by past failure that socialism doesn’t work, the socialists’ response is to increase Government control.



The relentless expansion of the State is most certainly Jacinda Ardern’s agenda.



After taking office in 2017, her ruling coalition wasted no time in ordering all businesses with workers on the minimum wage to increase their hourly rate by 27 percent from $15.75 to $20 an hour by 2021.



As a result of those directives and a raft of draconian industrial relations law changes – designed to satisfy the demands of the unions –[ business confidence](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/business-confidence-at-dismal-levels/) has now fallen to its lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis. 



The Coalition even took a punitive approach to reducing plastic waste. To be seen to be ‘doing something’, instead of supporting businesses who were phasing out single-use plastic bags, the Government [banned them](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/the-insanity-of-the-plastic-bag-ban/), imposing fines of up to $100,000 for anyone breaching the prohibition.



New licenses for offshore [oil and gas exploration](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/labour-fails-series-economic-growth/) were also outlawed – a whole industry undermined without warning. 



Now the Government is in the throes of legislating to penalise emissions of man-made greenhouse gases. This includes an initial 10 percent reduction in the [methane](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/reducing-methane-emissions-unnecessary-at-the-expense-of-food-production/) produced by cows and sheep eating grass, eventually increasing to 47 percent – threatening the viability of many farmers.



These regulations that are being introduced in the name of climate change – a mania now being led by a 16-year-old Swedish child, [Greta Thunberg](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/st-greta-dissected-line-by-line/) – represent a significant expansion of Government control of the economy. If Labour’s [zero-carbon legislation](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/the-zero-carbon-bill-hits-the-skids/) is supported by New Zealand First or National, it is expected to be passed by Christmas. Families will then begin to feel the financial pressure, as more of their household budget will be needed to cover the rising cost of power, fuel, and food.



More Government control over freshwater has also been proposed, with farmers again being unreasonably targeted with punitive and costly regulations.



Then there are the attacks on civil liberties, including yet more firearms regulations, and the PM’s call for restrictions on the freedom of expression.



These changes arose in response to the Christchurch tragedy. But instead of waiting until the Royal Commission of Inquiry reports back, to determine exactly what law changes are needed, public outrage and grief created an opportunity for Labour to impose heavy-handed restrictions that, under normal circumstances, would have been rejected by freedom loving Kiwis.



In her haste to be seen to be legislating faster than Australia after their Port Arthur massacre, Jacinda Ardern trampled on democracy and rushed into law [blanket bans on guns and parts](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/the-only-party-that-can-stop-the-gun-laws-in-their-tracks-is-nz-first/), undermining the long-established rights of Kiwi firearm owners to enjoy their sport.



Now the next phase of Labour’s attack on gun owners, the _Arms Amendment Bill_ , is being fast-tracked through Parliament, with submissions due on October 23rd – see [HERE](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/52SCFE_SCF_BILL_91272/arms-legislation-bill) for details.



The main purpose of the new law is to introduce a firearms register. In addition, it tightens gun licensing requirements by reducing the licensed period from 10 years to _5 years_ , imposes new regulations and costs on shooting clubs, establishes a new firearms advisory bureaucracy, requires doctors to share medical concerns with Police, and it substantially increases fees and penalties. 



Through more controls and restrictions, especially the registration of firearms, Labour is further punishing law-abiding New Zealand gun owners, since criminals and extremists who are responsible for most of the country’s gun crimes are highly unlikely to register their firearms! That was certainly the case in Australia, where 90 percent of firearms used in criminal offences are unregistered.



The gun registration scheme proposed in the Bill is likely to fail. Registration was first introduced in New Zealand in the 1920s but was eventually revoked through the 1983 Arms Act because it was inaccurate and too costly to maintain.



The new approach that was introduced was based on the common sense concept that it is the user, not the weapon, that poses a danger to society. The focus therefore changed to gun owners to ensure they were “fit and proper” and that their firearms were securely stored.



Based on our own experience, the firearm registration scheme being proposed by Labour, will not only become an expensive bureaucratic behemoth costing taxpayers far more than our politicians care to admit, but it will _not_ prevent future tragedies. The only gain will be political – it will be regarded as a ‘win’ by those Labour supporters who would like to see all guns in New Zealand banned.



The Police Minister Stuart Nash has estimated the cost of firearms registration will be up to $53 million over 10 years. But Canada’s [experience](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/opinion-analysis/114472787/plan-to-tighter-gun-laws-to-cost-up-to-53m-over-10-years--stuart-nash-says) should provide a warning.



When Canada’s gun registry was introduced in 1995, it was estimated to cost C$2 _million_. But the price blew out exponentially – to C$3 _billion_! The government finally abandoned trying to register shotguns and rifles and now just tracks restricted weapons including handguns and semi-automatics.



The problem was that the Canadian Government introduced gun registration in the wake of a mass shooting in Montreal. But firearm registration was not the _first_ legislative crackdown on legal gun ownership – it was the _second_.



As a result, law-abiding Canadian gun owners felt they were being unfairly targeted by their Government. Many protested by refusing to register their firearms. Some actively obstructed the process, by registering other items like soldering guns instead!



There were expensive court battles, and during its entire 17-year existence, Canada’s gun register was said to have recorded no more than a third of the guns otherwise legally owned in the country.



The point was made that registering guns is not like registering cars and boats, which are used on public roads and can be monitored by the police. Instead, most guns are privately owned and used, making enforcement difficult and expensive.



Through her ill-advised law changes just after the shooting, Jacinda Ardern has already alienated gun owners – repeating Canada’s mistakes. As a result, the outcome of gun registration in this country is almost certain to be an expensive disaster.



Not content with gun control in the aftermath of Christchurch, our Prime Minister also set her sights on restricting the freedom of expression.



In an unprecedented move, the Chief Censor was called upon to ban both the gunman’s video of the shooting and his manifesto. By classifying them as objectionable, anyone knowingly possessing or sharing them could be fined up to $10,000 or be sentenced to a prison term of up to 14 years.



Radio New Zealand [reported](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/397953/charges-laid-in-35-cases-over-sharing-of-video-of-christchurch-terror-attacks) that by August there had been 35 charges relating to possession of the video, leading to 14 prosecutions, 10 referrals to the Youth Court, one written warning and eight verbal warnings. One man is known to have been sentenced to two years in jail.



Hundreds of people are also on a Police ‘watchlist’ for the crime of free expression. The Police turn up at homes asking about opinions on a range of matters including immigration, colonisation, and politics. One person reported being accused by the Police of calling the Prime Minister “a socialist”. It is very troubling indeed when Police come knocking because someone is accusing the PM – a former president of the International Union of Socialist Youth – of being a socialist!



Under Labour, our free society is no longer free. But it’s going to get worse.



Not satisfied with just banning the video of the Mosque shooting in New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern wanted it prohibited world-wide. She began working with the French President Emmanuel Macron on the [“Christchurch Call”](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/05/is-the-christchurch-call-really-progressive/), an initiative to suppress terrorist content on the Internet.



Strong concerns were expressed that this could lead to the wholesale censorship of the Internet. Indeed, that is what now seems to be occurring.



This week’s NZCPR Guest Commentator Dr Bronwyn Howell, a programme director at Victoria University and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, has been closely following these developments and is now concerned that the _Christchurch Call_ is leading to widespread social engineering:



“Facebook’s September 17 announcement that it has updated its definition of _dangerous_ individuals and organizations, and would be extending its initiative to use algorithms to redirect individuals using terms associated with searches for _white supremacy_ to resources focused on helping people leave behind hate groups to include Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand, constitutes a significant development.



“Since March, US search queries on Facebook using terms algorithmically determined to be associated with white supremacy have been redirected to _Life After Hate_ , an organization founded by former violent extremists that provides crisis intervention, education, support groups and outreach.



“While there may be considerable popular support for Facebook’s use of algorithms in this manner, there are equally as many questions raised about the legitimacy of attempts to use platforms to ‘socially re-engineer’ or ‘reprogram’ individuals.”



Dr Howell asks where is the mandate to override an individual’s internet request, to deliver a pre-selected search result. She believes such an intervention would normally only be possible following a transparent and accountable process agreed by the community of users collectively.



However, the reality is that Jacinda Ardern’s _Christchurch Call_ appears to have encouraged Facebook and other Internet players into a greater use of censorship. It is highly likely they are responding to political pressure that if they do not do so voluntarily, a regulatory regime will be imposed on them.



The changes already made are significant. Try posting information on Facebook denying man-made global warming and you are likely to receive a notice telling you it has been categorised as “fake news” by their “fact checkers” and banned. You may also be told that if you persist in posting such content then your page or group will be downgraded so it does not feature in search rankings.



That Facebook’s ‘fact checkers’ claim the earth is now warmer than during the Medieval and Roman warm periods, raises concerns that they are conforming to crowd hysteria, and have become puppets of political control rather than the bastions of free expression and the truth.



It’s the same story with material supporting the role of colonisation. A meme for example, stating that poor social statistics for Maori were caused by such things as poor parenting, substance abuse, violence, and welfare dependency, rather than colonisation, was labelled as hate speech by Facebook and banned.



Whether such developments are the direct result of Jacinda Ardern’s closed-door talks with social media organisations is impossible to tell, but they certainly raise concerns that this new state of censorship is a taste of what’s to come in New Zealand if Labour delivers on their promise to introduce hate speech laws.



So while the mainstream media discourse is occupied with daily news, the bigger and more important story is the theft of personal freedoms as New Zealand heads down a path to state control. 



No democracy can survive without free speech and open public discourse. The suppression of controversial ideas – whether genuinely offensive or just contrary to the views of the liberal elites – is a worrying step toward tyranny.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe following by German scientists Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning exposes yet another classic example why we cannot trust climate institutes.
=======================================
Caught red-handed: Geomar omits crucial 1960s Arctic sea ice melt phase in press release
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The most well-known historical Arctic region melting period took place 1000 years ago when the Vikings sailed through the Arctic Ocean, which had little sea ice. Eventually they colonized Greenland and Iceland. Today no one wants to hear it because it doesn’t fit with the climate catastrophe storyline.
In 1887 the topic was less important. Back then the planet was emerging from the Little Ice Age and people were glad about the warming. Warm was good. There was no IPCC back then. For example in the New Zealand daily The Press on 8 November 1887 there was a story about the Viking journeys and a sharply reduced sea ice extent – something that would be unimaginable today (hat-tip Steve Goddard):

But one does not need to go back so far into history. Also between 1920 and 1940 there was a strong phase of melting in the north polar sea. Former Max-Planck director Lennart Bengtsson summarized the knowledge of the warm phase in the Journal of Climate in 2004. Already back then he saw a relationship with ocean cycles that influenced the climate with a 60-year period. What follows is the abstract of that paper:
The Early Twentieth-Century Warming in the Arctic—A Possible Mechanism
The huge warming of the Arctic that started in the early 1920s and lasted for almost two decades is one of the most spectacular climate events of the twentieth century. During the peak period 1930–40, the annually averaged temperature anomaly for the area 60°–90°N amounted to some 1.7°C. Whether this event is an example of an internal climate mode or is externally forced, such as by enhanced solar effects, is presently under debate. This study suggests that natural variability is a likely cause, with reduced sea ice cover being crucial for the warming. A robust sea ice–air temperature relationship was demonstrated by a set of four simulations with the atmospheric ECHAM model forced with observed SST and sea ice concentrations. An analysis of the spatial characteristics of the observed early twentieth-century surface air temperature anomaly revealed that it was associated with similar sea ice variations. Further investigation of the variability of Arctic surface temperature and sea ice cover was performed by analyzing data from a coupled ocean–atmosphere model. By analyzing climate anomalies in the model that are similar to those that occurred in the early twentieth century, it was found that the simulated temperature increase in the Arctic was related to enhanced wind-driven oceanic inflow into the Barents Sea with an associated sea ice retreat. The magnitude of the inflow is linked to the strength of westerlies into the Barents Sea. This study proposes a mechanism sustaining the enhanced westerly winds by a cyclonic atmospheric circulation in the Barents Sea region created by a strong surface heat flux over the ice-free areas. Observational data suggest a similar series of events during the early twentieth-century Arctic warming, including increasing westerly winds between Spitsbergen and Norway, reduced sea ice, and enhanced cyclonic circulation over the Barents Sea. At the same time, the North Atlantic Oscillation was weakening.”
Today in the press one hardly hears any mention of this melting phase. IPCC scientists would have us believe there has been only one single trend over the last 150 years, namely the steady death of Arctic sea ice.
In December 2013 in the journal PNAS a reconstruction of Arctic sea ice cover appeared for the past 650 years using algae as a proxy. The study was carried out by Jochen Halfar of the University of Toronto. Also involved in the study was Steffen Hetzinger of the Geomar Institute in Kiel, Germany. On November 19, 2013 a Geomar press release announced:
Since the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850, the archives of the red algae show a continuous decrease of the ice, a trend which continues through today. This decrease is stronger than anything we previously observed in the 650 year long history of the red algae record.“
The Austrian national daily Standard sounded the climate alarms, informing its readers:
For the first time a team of international scientists traced the development of sea ice in the Arctic all the way back to the Middle Ages. Here the scientists of the University of Groningen and others found out that the ice sheet has been melting continuously since the middle of the 19th century. They were helped by red algae which conserved the climate history of the last centuries. So far the data on the Arctic from satellites have gone back only to the late 1970s.”
The use of the word “continuously” leads us to understand that the ice is melting steadily, without any larger phases of ice growth in between. Only a very few readers have taken the time and effort to read the original paper. In press releases, authors certainly only tell the truth and nothing but the truth, right? One look at the publication, however, delivers a bitter disappointment. Figure 2b of the study shows the development of the sea ice curve for Newfoundland for the past 150 years in detail (Figure 1). The result: In the 1960s, in the pre-satellite era, sea ice had shrunk to levels seen today. However in the press release, that inconvenient condition never got mentioned.

Figure 1: The blue curve depicts the development of sea ice near Newfoundland for the past 150 years. High peaks indicate shrinking, low peaks depict growth. Source: Halfar et al 2013.
In the paper itself the authors correctly attribute the development to the impact of Atlantic ocean cycles:

//-->




Modeling studies have shown that the NAO exerts an influence on the spatial distribution of winter sea ice via wind-driven anomalies of sea-ice velocity, surface vertical heat flux, and possibly horizontal oceanic heat flux (7). There is strong observational evidence connecting Arctic sea-ice distribution with the positive NAO trend from the 1960s to the early 1990s.”
Conscious deception of the public
In the GEOMAR press release there is also not a word about the cyclic nature of sea ice. This is a conscious deception of the public. The ice is neither “shrinking continuously” nor is CO2 playing the only role as some scientists would like us to believe.
Does Steffen Hetzinger know what he is doing? He is a young man who probably is in search of a permanent position and thus has to play along with the climate panic game. Did the GEOMAR force him to write such a press release or what it his own idea to score big points with climate alarmism? One thing is clear: this has nothing to do with reputable science. Hardly a good way to begin a career.
What would the sea ice discussion be like today if systematic satellite-based measurement had begun already in 1960?
IPCC, German government removed 1960s melt
Measurements first began in 1979. The first IPCC report of 1990 was naively honest and openly revealed that shortly before satellite measurements began, there had been significantly less Arctic sea ice than there was during the measurement period beginning in 1979 (Figure 2). In the subsequent IPCC reports, they truncated the inconvenient start of the chart, thus taking it out of the readers’ view.

Figure 2: Development of Arctic sea ice from 1973-1990. Source: 1st IPCC Climate Report (1990).
Looking at the melt phase of the 1960s and 1970s shown in the above chart, one really has to wonder that the German Ministry of Environment is using a dubious IPCC chart which fails to show the melting of the 1960s (Figure 3).

Figure 3: IPCC chart that the German Federal Ministry of Environment has at its website for illustrating Arctic sea ice development. Shown is the supposedly “observed mean Arctic summer sea ice (July-September)”. Original source: IPCC.
The discovery of old Nimbus satellite images must have been very awkward for the Federal Ministry of Environment. The images document huge holes in the Arctic sea ice. Spiegel Online reported on November 4, 2014:
‘Nimbus’: Nasa releases old satellite images
They were forgotten in NASA archives: Scientists discovered satellite images from the 1960s. A huge hole in the Arctic sea ice, large masses of snow, intact lakes – the images offer some surprises.”
Already on October 21, 2014, Mashable had reported on the unexpected gaping holes in the north polar sea ice:
The Nimbus data provides the earliest known view of Antarctica’s sea ice, which has made headlines recently for setting a record for the largest ice extent, and spotted large breaks in Arctic sea ice where none were thought to have occurred. The modern satellite record of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic starts in 1979, so the added data gives scientists a longer-term view that informs their understanding of present-day events. […]  Sea ice extents in the Arctic were much larger in the 1960s than they are now, Gallaher said, which is consistent with the global warming-induced decline in Arctic sea ice. Still, even in years with higher volume’s of sea ice, the satellite spotted ice-free areas near the North Pole that were 200 to 300 miles across. “We found holes in ice at North Pole that we didn’t expect to find,” he said. “It’s a big hole,” said Garrett Campbell, who also works on the Nimbus project from the NSIDC.”

It’s difficult not to notice that green protesters almost always protest developments that are nowhere near where **they** live. Greens in Australia are the most urbanised people in the world, concentrated in wealthy innermost Melbourne and Sydney. The developments they oppose are almost always in rural and remote regions, often with chronic unemployment and low incomes.



Rich greens deny poor country people the economic luxury they already enjoy. Poor indigenous people, most of all.



Mining creates jobs. Mining executives like Twiggy Forrest have dedicated employment programs for Aboriginal people in place. Aboriginal communities want to see their property rights respected, and to reap the economic benefits of development.



Greens want to deny them all that. It’s the same all over the world.



[Mike LeBourdais is] the elected chief of Whispering Pines-Clinton Indian Band […]The chief is part of the Western Indigenous Pipeline Group and they have their sights set on buying a stake in the Trans Mountain expansion project, a $4.5 billion project to twin the current pipeline that runs from Edmonton, Alta., to Burnaby, B.C.



And the outcome of Canada’s upcoming election is critical for a possible deal […]the NDP and Green Party are against the expansion.



LeBourdais believes revenue from the pipeline will help give First Nation communities a brighter future.



“The pipeline is a piece of infrastructure that we want to acquire so we can have a better tomorrow,” says LeBourdais […]



“Pipelines don’t create climate change, actually they reduce it,” says LeBourdais. “When you’re trucking oil by rail or truck you are increasing CO2 emissions. However, First Nations understand that the environment is the important part so if you want to protect that you use oil pipelines rather than rail or truck.”



Gaia-worshipping, city-based greens treat Aboriginal people – whether in Australia or Canada – as simple children who share the same Rousseau-esque, romanticised worldview as themselves.



LeBourdais says he’s not against [the pipeline], but wants it done properly.



“Mostly when you talk about resource extraction, what we want to see is responsible, environmental resource extraction.”



Many jobs in Northern B.C. and the Interior are resource based – very different from the people living in the Lower Mainland.



“There’s a huge disconnect,” says LeBourdais.



“They think that this is where the pollution comes from…“We’re the ones that are supplying the resources to keep the economy moving.”



And they deserve the economic benefit that comes from having their property rights respected.



“We don’t have that jurisdiction over our own taxes and our own resources. And it’s not just me, you can go to any Indian Band in Canada, they’ll tell you the same dam thing, but in a different vernacular. And it’s always the same, it’s the Indian Act that holds us down […]They are well intentioned, but that is the road to hell, is well intentions. They do not achieve what they set out to achieve.



“What we want here is our jurisdiction back so that we can provide for our people as we have done for 10 thousand years.”

"With the collapse of the line at Dawlish in Devon cutting off railway services to Plymouth and the southwest for months, Secretary of State for Transport Patrick McLoughlin MP and Network Rail chiefs were brought before the Transport Select Committee to answer questions about the implications. In terms of future investment, while losing a railway line or road undoubtedly inconveniences some, the two questions to answer are over the economic impact of such a loss, and how often losses of such severity are expected. Within hours of the news, calculations adorned the backs of hundreds of envelopes, producing seven, eight or even nine-figure sums of economic turmoil. Any transport economist would first calculate the cost to the system’s users, following a well established tradition which shows that users value loss of their time during a disruption at around three times the rate that they value time saved on a journey. Typically these are for disruptions over the course of a day, not over a month or more as will be the case due to repairs at Dawlish. There are also well understood penalties for travellers that have to change between modes of transport – the dreaded replacement bus services do not score highly. So these costs can and will be quantified. As a rough measure, Plymouth station serves around 2.6m passengers per year and Penzance another half a million, so the costs generated by these comparatively quite modest passenger numbers (London Underground carries 3.36m passengers a day) won’t take us close to vast sums bandied about by the back-of-the-envelope economists. The really big figures are derived from the effects on the wider economy, as put forward by the Local Enterprise Partnerships, town and county councils from the southwest appearing before the select committee. They provided figures that claimed losses to tourism, trade, and potential investment of £4m-£5m a day to the Plymouth economy and £8m to Cornish tourism.  Can it seriously be argued that losing a train service alone has led to a 75% drop in tourist bookings? Clearly any research based on self-reporting by the local chambers of commerce is limited, and the impression given at the hearing by the councillors and executives was that the collapse at Dawlish was also an opportunity to argue for a reversal of historic underinvestment in the region. So while there will certainly be economic losses, we don’t know what or how much, nor how to disentangle the short term effects such as tourism bookings from the long term effects, for example of major businesses not locating to the region. To me, the figures thrown about are not credible, but to quibble is to miss the point: the effects of major transport disruptions on the wider economy are not well understood, and are not properly accounted for in the decisions that underpin infrastructure investment.  The implication is that those areas that are particularly vulnerable to severe damage and disruption from events like Dawlish will have been short-changed in terms of past investment. The second question is how often this scale of service outage is likely to occur. Network Rail and the Met Office have concluded that the combination of high winds, high seas and rain had led to a scale of damage not seen before – but the past is not necessarily a good guide to the future. While it was good news for the representatives of the southwest that it had opened up discussion around proposals for alternative bypass routes, or additional breakwaters around the Dawlish stretch of the line, that was as far as the good news went. Network Rail’s chief executive reeled off tales of weather-related woe: flooding at 250 sites across the network, and more than 50 landslips in Kent alone (compared to the usual three) at an estimated cost of £170m. Such extreme weather has led to calls for investment from areas besides just the southwest, and while £170m is a significant spend, the demand for investing in network resilience will surely force some re-evaluation of priorities. The problem is that we don’t know how often these types of events will happen – and that information is a major factor in whether to carry on with business as usual, or to call “all change”, and launch a much greater programme of investment in resilience measures throughout the network. New investments are assessed over a 60-year period: if we think another Dawlish-level-event will remain a rare, it makes little sense to spend heavily on preparing for it – however inconvenient it may be if, or when, such a severe event happens again. And if we should adopt some kind of precautionary principle, the question is what it would look like, and how much would we (the passenger or the taxpayer) be prepared to pay? When the water recedes and attention moves on elsewhere, I believe that in the absence of any clear evidence the purse strings will close and it will be business as usual. History is full of examples of major events that fail to bring significant change to policy, despite initial interest – security incidents on US domestic flights before 9/11 are a prime example, and the largely unfulfilled calls for institutional change in the UK after the MP’s expenses scandal another. This is a phenomenon Jones and Baumgartner call the Politics of Attention. The UK’s limited infrastructure spending is allocated on the basis of what benefits the user, primarily time savings on journeys that affect thousands of passengers every day. The recent passenger satisfaction surveys suggest that many louder voices will reassert themselves, each with arguments for different investment priorities. But it’s difficult to see an under-used emergency rail bypass around Dawlish making much headway against demands to tackle overcrowding on trains servicing London and the southeast. I hope to be wrong in some of what I have written above. I believe that the UK does not invest enough in its existing infrastructure, instead focusing on the promise of what economic growth new infrastructure might bring. In the absence of better evidence or perhaps a sudden lurch towards a more risk-averse attitude towards resilience, Dawlish will most likely be consigned to history as a particularly memorable storm in a tea cup."
"Certain districts of Bogotá, like the Zona G, seem to have more types of restaurants than they do people. There are   BBQ joints that look straight out of Brooklyn gastro pubs with cocktail gardens and a chain of crepe restaurants that has set up shop in nearly every neighborhood. Yet regional Colombian fare from outside the capital has long been the city’s weak spot. Until now. As Bogotá has increasingly become a melting pot of cultures from every part of Colombia, restaurants focusing on regional dishes and ingredients are opening with regularity. “We’re seeing not only an increase in the quality of food, and better service in restaurants, but a boom of interesting concepts,” said Gaeleen Quinn, who founded the Bogotá Wine and Food Festival. Leonor Espinosa has been exploring rural Colombian flavors for a decade at her upscale restaurant Leo Cocina y Cava, but in late 2014 she opened the less pricey Misia, a fresh take on traditional snack spots, in a space decorated with   clay tiles and recycled    . The restaurant showcases the popular cuisine of Colombia’s Caribbean coast with coconut milk ceviches and   cured meats, like blood sausages, and longanizas, made from smoked hen. The star plate is the posta negra, based on a family recipe of Ms. Espinosa’s, which features an eye of round roast doused in a rich, dark sauce made with garlic, various spices and an unrefined cane sugar called panela. Each table is set with bottles of   hot sauces and   vinegars, which can be bought on the way out. It has been such a success that a second location was opened in the Zona G last February. At El Panóptico, located a short walk from Misia inside the sprawling Museo Nacional, the chef Eduardo Martinez clipped herbs from a pot in the courtyard. Mr. Martinez, an agricultural engineer who also owns the restaurant Mini Mal in the Chapinero Alto neighborhood to the north, has worked with several foundations to foster culinary diversity in the country. With El Panóptico, which opened in 2013, he looks to neglected regional ingredients, many of them from the Andes or the Amazon, like ají negro, a fermented and reduced yuca extract. Mr. Martinez thinly slices a forgotten native tuber called guatila like a carpaccio, in the hopes of reintroducing it to local kitchens. “Many don’t like it,” he said. “They call it the ‘potato of the poor,’ or ‘food for pigs.’ All of these tubers seem strange to many people. They aren’t in supermarkets. We try to present them in a way they’ll understand. ” Some ingredients have been overlooked for so long that few can even remember how to use them. The recipe for a corn and peanut soup called samai, in fact, comes from a grandmother named Mercedes Tisoy, who serves it during celebrations in the   Sibundoy Valley, in the southwest of the country. You can smell the freshly baked pan de bono, a   cheese bread typical of Cali, Colombia’s   city, as you walk past Escuela Taller, a school for   youth just down the street from Bogotá’s Capitolo Nacional, the capital building. It houses the   La Escuela, a restaurant and bakery serving inexpensive dishes from remote regions like the Chocó and Arauca. Inside, 60 students enrolled in a   program do a range of tasks, like roasting their own coffee, which is sold in the cafe working the register and   plantains to make fritters. The   menu offers dishes like fried Magdalena River fish, called mojarra, with coconut rice, or the chuleta valluna, a breaded pork chop typical of the rural Cauca Valley outside Cali. The young servers also help decipher the long list of freshly pressed juices like arazá or camu camu. Colombia’s undeveloped and rarely visited Pacific Coast has a set of ingredients all its own, like a shark called a toyo, and an herb called cilantro cimarrón if you wanted to taste them, however, you were probably better off going to the port town of to Buenaventura. Now Rey Guerrero has established himself as Bogotá’s ambassador to the recipes of that region, which have gained recognition since his appearance on the Colombian TV cooking show “La Prueba” in 2014. His Bogotá restaurant, Rey Guerrero Pescadería Gourmet, a single, large dining room painted with vibrant   murals on the walls, serves a long list of   and   dishes, like the arroz tumbacatre, a spicy regional version of arroz con mariscos, or seafood rice. “In Europe they have foie gras, in the Pacific we have piangua,” he said, referring to the region’s flavorful,   black clam, with which he makes a ceviche. “Esto es puro Pacifico. ”"

Sen. Marco Rubio might fancy himself as a new type of leader for a new era, but his speech yesterday to the Council on Foreign Relations was trapped in the past. Invoking John F. Kennedy's final speech as president, more than 50 years ago, was bad enough. But Rubio's overarching message -- the Rubio Doctrine -- amounts to warmed over Cold War dogma, sprinkled with the language of benevolent global hegemony favored by so many Washington elites, but disdained by most Americans beyond the Beltway. It is difficult to understand the depths of his political and strategic myopia.   
  
Rubio misperceives the American public's willingness to sustain the current model indefinitely, and therefore fails to appreciate the need for a genuinely new approach to U.S. global affairs. He minimizes the costs and risks of our current foreign policies, and oversells the benefits. He ignores the way in which U.S. security assurances to a host of some-of-the-time allies have discouraged these countries from taking reasonable steps to defend themselves and their interests. And he fails to see any reasonable alternative to a world in which the United States acts -- forever, it seems -- as the sole guarantor of global security. Specifically, Rubio pledged: ""As president, I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space."" (Any? Whew!)    
  
To be sure, many people around the world may be happy to allow U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines to attempt such an ambitious undertaking, and to have American taxpayers pick up the tab. It is reasonable to guess that most foreign leaders are anxious to preserve the current order -- so long as the U.S. government provides for their defense, they are free to spend their money on other things. But the fact that foreigners like this arrangment doesn't explain why most Americans would. When Rubio calls for huge increases in the Pentagon's budget, he is telling Americans that they should be content to accept higher taxes, more debt, and less money to spend here at home, so that U.S. allies elsewhere can neglect their defenses, and feed their bloated welfare states.   




Americans, unsurprisingly, and by a wide margin, favor something else. A poll taken last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, for example, found a mere 38 percent of Americans who considered ""defending our allies' security"" to be a ""very important"" foreign goal, below ""combating world hunger"" and ""limiting climate change."" Several of Rubio's other major foreign policy goals, including ""promoting human rights abroad,"" ""protecting weaker nations against foreign aggression,"" or ""helping to bring a democratic form of government to other nations"" ranked even lower.   
  
To be sure, Rubio is hardly alone in his embrace of the decades-old status quo. A parade of politicians, Republicans and Democrats alike, routinely speak of the United States as the indispensable nation, and celebrate the U.S. miltary's role as a global constabulary. But it seriously undermines Rubio's claim to represent the hopes and aspirations of a new generation when he invokes the policies of the same-ol' generation, and the one before it. His relative youth and stirring personal narrative will appeal to some, including possibly younger voters turned off by a cast of familiar names and has-beens. But Rubio's fresh face alone is unlikely to compensate for his strangely stale foreign policies.

"**Ministers have been accused of showing ""disrespect"" to the Welsh Parliament because its members will not get a chance to vote on the latest coronavirus restrictions before pubs have to stop serving alcohol.**
An opposition request for a debate was denied by the Senedd's presiding officer
Elin Jones said a vote would be held in the chamber next Tuesday.
Laws banning alcohol in pubs and restaurants are due to start on Friday.
Hospitality venues will also have to close at 18:00 every night when the law changes on Friday.
The Welsh Government is facing calls to produce more evidence to support the restrictions, including from its own backbenches.
Ms Jones said MSs would be able to table amendments to a Welsh Government debate at the next full meeting of the Senedd on Tuesday.
That meant ""the Senedd has the opportunity therefore to debate and vote on the matter during the next plenary session"", she said.
Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said he understood the presiding officer's ""balancing act"", but that it was ""a missed opportunity"".
He said: ""We are a parliament. We are parliamentarians. If we are to be taken seriously we should have the opportunity to debate the issue and represent the people who put us here.
""I am grateful for your consideration presiding officer and I think it is the government that has missed the opportunity here and has in this particular instance, in my opinion, shown disrespect to the Welsh Parliament.""
Plaid Cymru MS Sian Gwenllian asked whether more pressure could be put on the government to hold a vote on the principle behind the regulations before they come into force on Friday.
""The changes happening on Friday are significant and we also need to see the evidence that has led to their introduction,"" she said.
Defending the alcohol decision on Tuesday, Mr Drakeford said without the rules ""hundreds and hundreds of people in Wales who otherwise would have been alive will not be alive in 2021"".
Earlier, Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said his chain would close its pubs in Wales from Friday, as staying open but only selling food had been ""ruinously expensive"" when tried in Scotland.
He told BBC Radio Wales the rules had been made by ""people who have never run a business"".
""This new puritanism in Wales and elsewhere is madness, is economic madness,"" he said.
""I don't want to wind the Welsh up by criticising their first minister, but he's talking cobblers.
""There's very good evidence that lockdowns - and this is a type of lockdown, it's a quasi-lockdown - simply don't work...
""This scare tactic saying so many people are going to die is nonsense in my opinion.""
Enzo Nigro, the owner of Potters pub in Newport, said he was concerned by the new rules.
""We had 70 to 80 emails come through 10 minutes after the announcement, and everyone was wondering what was going on,"" he said.
""People don't really understand the rules because they thought we would be able to serve alcohol until 6 o'clock and not no alcohol at all.
""It's frustrating.""
Conservatives say the rules are ""completely disproportionate"" in parts of Wales where the rate of infection is comparatively low.
Plaid Cymru, which has backed most of the Welsh Government's restriction during the pandemic, has said ministers should find a ""sensible compromise"" that allows alcohol to be served until 19:00, with closing time an hour later.
Mandy Jones, of the Independent Alliance for Reform in the Senedd, said a petition started by former MEP Nathan Gill ""shows that the public also agree with us in demanding that the Welsh Government publish the science they've used to justify this claim"".
The petition showed more than 18,000 signatures on Wednesday afternoon.
Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises and they will have to close at 18:00. Only takeaway alcohol will be allowed when the new rules kick in on Friday.
On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford pointed out that up to four people from different households will still be able to meet in bars and cafes, but without alcohol.
""Now I am sorry that is a significant deprivation for many people,"" he said.
""But the evidence is that when people drink then their behaviour changes and their behaviour changes in ways that make them and other people more vulnerable to the virus.""
Without further action, he said modelling suggested between 1,000 and 1,700 more deaths would occur this winter.
Mr Drakeford also said his government was publishing more information than any other administration in the UK.
Incident management teams had ""repeatedly"" highlighted problems with alcohol and hospitality venues in outbreaks, he added.
The boss of Brains, the biggest Welsh-owned brewery, has called the new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth"" and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be closed from Friday.
Brains data shared with BBC Wales shows between July and the end of November it served more than 850,000 customers at the 100 pubs it manages and had five inquiries from the Test, Trace, Protect scheme.
The company said three of its pubs were temporarily closed and deep cleaned after staff tested positive for coronavirus.
A new tougher tier system of coronavirus restrictions for England began on Wednesday, as the country emerged from its lockdown, after the plan was approved by MPs, despite a major rebellion on the Tory benches.
Under the highest, tier three, all hospitality venues must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services."

Connecticut has so many advantages that it might be hard to understand how it became one of America’s worst‐​performing state economies.



As we know, Connecticut is located along an important commercial corridor between New York and Boston. It’s well‐​served by railroads and highways. Major airports are accessible. Connecticut has many charming towns, historic sights, stylish shops and nice beaches. CNN determined that of America’s 25 towns with the highest median family incomes, four are in Connecticut — New Canaan (#1), Darien (#2), Westport (#5) and Greenwich (#14). The most expensive American home ever offered for sale is Copper Beech Farm which, with an asking price of $190 million, has 50 acres of waterfront property in Greenwich.



Although Connecticut lacks a major high tech region, there’s a concentration of executive talent capable of managing large organizations. Many are in financial services.





The most fundamental lesson here is simply that investors, entrepreneurs and other productive people want to go where they’re welcome.



Despite these attractions, during the past two decades some 300,000 more Connecticut residents have moved out of the state than have moved in. This compares with the current population of about 3.5 million.



Why the exodus?



 **Dismal performance**



Perhaps with the complacency of old money, Connecticut policymakers came to believe they didn’t need to compete for investors and entrepreneurs — the key people who make prosperity happen. Keep in mind that government basically doesn’t have any money other than what it extracts from the private sector via taxation.



As a columnist for the _Hartford Courant_ remarked, “businesses here have become vulnerable to appeals from places [like Florida and Texas] that Connecticut leaders once thought they could safely hold in low regard.”



When investors and entrepreneurs consider important decisions like where to establish a residence, where to operate a business and, yes, where to die, they compare their options. From a financial point of view, Connecticut turns out not to be a great option. For instance:



How did Connecticut end up in this mess?



 **Some perspective: early success, great potential**



Like other states, Connecticut started out with agriculture, then expanded with trade and boomed with manufacturing — ships, railroads, saddles, sewing machines, carriages, brass fittings, corsets, guns, on and on. Such enterprise displayed a lot of Yankee ingenuity.



Fast‐​growing industries attracted thousands and thousands of immigrants as well as native‐​born people looking for jobs. Connecticut’s population grew mightily.



During the 1920s, however, Connecticut began to feel competitive pressures as 14 of its 47 textile mills moved to less costly locations in the South.



Democrats gained control of Connecticut during the Great Depression, but neither they nor their “progressive” comrades at the federal level were able to banish depression era high unemployment. It persisted throughout FDR’s New Deal, in part because the New Deal tripled taxes, which meant employers had less money for hiring and consumers had less money for spending. Depression era unemployment didn’t come down until the government began conscripting millions of young men for military service during World War II.



American factories switched from the production of civilian goods to the production of war materials. Living standards, though, weren’t much different than they had been during the depression, since civilian goods were unavailable, and food consumption was limited by rationing.



After the war, many military contracts ended, but the Cold War began almost immediately, and Connecticut’s politically‐​connected Democratic representatives helped win new military contracts for Pratt & Whitney (airplane engines), Hamilton Standard (propellers), Cheney (parachutes), Electric Boat (submarines), Sikorsky (helicopters) and other government contractors.



When the civilian economy revived after the war, often it involved technologies that developed in unexpected places that weren’t on Connecticut’s radar. For example, during the 1940s Stanford University’s dean of engineering Frederick Terman encouraged students and graduates to establish new businesses. That was the humble beginning of Silicon Valley.



 **More business burdens, less business hiring**



During the last century, Connecticut’s state government became bigger, raising taxes and in other ways making it more costly to do business. Connecticut certainly wasn’t the only state to have adopted such policies, but many states avoided them and prospered.



Connecticut economic regulations multiplied, further increasing the cost of doing business. Steven P. Lanza, reporting in _The Connecticut Economy_ , published quarterly by the University of Connecticut, found that “excessive regulation plays a role in hamstringing business owners and entrepreneurs who simply don’t have the resources of larger firms to cope with these constraints.”



Former U.S. Senator and Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern learned all this the hard way. In 1988, he bought, renovated and operated a 150‐​room hotel and conference center in Stratford, Connecticut. The business went bankrupt two years later. McGovern reflected on his experience  in the _Wall Street Journal_: “My business associates and I lived with federal, state and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising tax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never have doubted the worthiness of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: ‘Can we make consumers pay the higher prices for increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements with reams of red tape.’ It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators.”



In addition, state land use restrictions have limited the number of suitable business locations and often made it harder to establish a business. “Land use litigation pervades the dockets of state and federal courts,” noted Cardozo School of Law professor Stewart E. Sterk. “What is remarkable is that so many [land use] controversies — major and minor — are litigated to final judgment, and often reach appellate courts. Whereas the overwhelming majority of cases filed end with settlement rather than judgment, land use cases tend not to settle. Broad standing rules often permit neighbors, community groups and other governmental entities to challenge any settlement. Zoning law also provides a variety of grounds, both procedural and substantive, on which to attack any settlement.”



Significant numbers of low‐​income blacks and Hispanics moved into Connecticut’s major cities. In the name of “urban renewal,” local governments used their power of eminent domain to seize private property, promote the demolition of low‐​income housing and the construction of new housing, but it was a while before anybody noticed that (1) more housing units were being demolished than built, and (2) the housing built was more expensive — not intended for the displaced poor people who were forced to bid against other poor people for a reduced supply of low‐​income housing. That’s why urban renewal became known as “Negro removal” and made urban problems worse.



One of government’s most basic responsibilities is keeping people safe, yet Connecticut’s urban crime rates worsened during the 1960s and 1970s. This increased the cost of doing business in affected areas. At the same time, many customers fled to suburbs for greater personal safety and more affordable living space.



Fortunately for Connecticut, things were even worse for its tri‐​state rivals New York and New Jersey. Moreover, Connecticut had an important advantage — no income tax. Connecticut’s less unfavorable business climate for investors and entrepreneurs helped spur a corporate exodus to Connecticut. Among those moving headquarters to the nutmeg state were American Brands, General Electric and Union Carbide.



But these moves mainly benefited Connecticut cities closest to New York, like Fairfield, Greenwich and Stamford.



Other Connecticut cities declined amidst high taxes, high crime rates and “progressive” policies that made it harder for entrepreneurs to start businesses and hire people. For example:



Waterbury, Connecticut’s fifth largest city (Stamford is #4), appears to be the exception, an old Connecticut manufacturing center whose population is actually near a peak — approximately 110,000 in 2012 vs the peak of 110,366 recorded in 2010. This is mainly because of government and hospital jobs. But few people seem to give Waterbury high marks for the quality of life there.



For instance, in 1992 _Money Magazine_ surveyed 300 U.S. metropolitan areas and considered Waterbury to be the worst.



Waterbury made the _Places Rated Almanac_ list of the “10 Worst Places to Live in America.”



In April 2008, _Forbes_ considered Waterbury one of the “Worst Places for Businesses and Careers in America.”



In 2013, _Atlantic Magazine_ analyzed 10 million tweets by place of origin and concluded that Waterbury was one of the saddest American cities.



Many politicians like to blame Connecticut’s decline on things beyond their control like factory closings, but there’s nothing new about losing employers. Change has been the natural order of things since the beginning of time. Employers go away because better technologies come along, old businesses weren’t managed as effectively as new competitors, businesses have been acquired or merged with operations located elsewhere, labor unions priced themselves out of world markets, consumer preferences changed, other jurisdictions offered better business climates — on and on.



What Connecticut politicians failed to do was focus on making their jurisdictions as attractive as possible to investors and entrepreneurs, so there would be a continuing influx of new jobs. Among other things, this means reducing the cost of doing business for everyone, large and small — prospective newcomers as well as investors and entrepreneurs already in the state.



Instead of doing that, Connecticut politicians have gone on spending sprees in an effort to enhance their re‐​election prospects. The spending sprees necessitated higher taxes that increased the cost of doing business and helped drive away potential investors and entrepreneurs.



Of course, politicians can be counted on to say that they must spend ever larger amounts of money because of all the poor people who need help. But more than anything else, poor people need a real private sector job — a means of sustaining their financial independence and helping to produce goods or services other people are willing to pay for. The more costly it is to do business, the fewer jobs there will be, and the more people will stay poor.



Often government is costly because of corruption. Among the Connecticut officials who became felons: Bridgeport Mayor Joseph P. Ganim (bribery), Danbury Mayor James E. Dyer (tax evasion), Hartford Mayor Eddie Perez (bribery), Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano (sex offenses) and Connecticut State Senator Ernie Newton (fraud).



“For the record,” the _New York Times_ declared, “not everyone in Connecticut is a crook. But this is no longer obvious.”



Politicians have made Connecticut’s state and local governments more costly by promoting unionized construction companies for public projects. Governor Malloy has backed “project labor agreements” to help do that. The Hartford Board of Education has required that bidders agree to “perform all project work with union labor.” A 2007 study by economists Paul Bachman and Jonathan Haughton showed that project labor agreements increased public school construction costs between 9 percent and 15 percent. Remember that the next time you pay a property tax bill.



One of the most important ways Connecticut politicians have accelerated spending and taxes was to expand the number of unionized government employees. According to a Yankee Institute study, between 1970 and 2000 Connecticut’s state payrolls grew 6 times faster than the overall population. Connecticut’s municipal payrolls were reported to have grown 4 times faster.



 **Throwing away an important competitive advantage**



Connecticut’s downhill slide seems to have speeded up after 1990. That year, former Connecticut Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. campaigned for the governorship by vowing to resolve the state’s financial problems without introducing an income tax. After he was elected, he revealed his true colors and signed an income tax into law. Perhaps some Ivy League arrogance (Weicker went to Yale) impaired his ability to understand how incentives like lower taxes stimulate enterprising spirits.



The income tax failed to achieve the wonders Weicker claimed. By siphoning more money out of the private sector, the Connecticut income tax reduced the amount of money available for private sector hiring and reduced the amount of money available for consumer spending. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported, “no other state in the country has had such stagnation of employment.”



Ironically, while Connecticut’s income tax generated more revenue than the state had before, it undermined efforts to control spending. The last Connecticut annual budget before the income tax was about $7.5 billion, and state spending since then has nearly tripled — not counting all of the state’s spending on Medicaid. Connecticut’s runaway spending spree has meant more deficits and debt.



Income tax revenue hasn’t resulted in property tax relief. Connecticut property taxes went up.



Nor has there been gasoline tax relief. Connecticut has the highest gasoline taxes in New England (45 cents per gallon), compared with Rhode Island’s 33 cents per gallon, Maine’s 31.5 cents, Vermont’s 26.7 cents, Massachusetts’ 23.5 cents and New Hampshire’s 19.6 cents.



Introducing an income tax made Weicker unpopular, and he served only one term. His successor, Republican John G. Rowland, vowed he would get rid of the income tax, but somehow he never got around to doing that. He campaigned for a second term, promising to do what he had promised the first time around. His second term came and went, and in December 2003, during Roland’s third term, he admitted receiving improper favors from a lobbyist, and he subsequently served time in the slammer.



Meanwhile, Connecticut income taxes continue to go up, and Connecticut taxes generally are multiplying. According to the Yankee Institute, 2011 was a banner year when Democrats — who now control both the governor’s mansion and the legislature — pushed through 77 tax hikes. For instance:



 **The Exodus Now**



Connecticut’s tax base is eroding as more and more people conclude there’s a better future someplace else.



For decades, Hartford has been known as a major center of the U.S. insurance business and a bulwark of Connecticut’s economy. But many insurance jobs have moved out of Hartford to the suburbs, other insurance jobs have left Connecticut, and some unexpected rivals have emerged as industry leaders.



For example, _Business Wire_ called Des Moines, Iowa “the number one spot for U.S. insurance companies.” Among the insurance companies headquartered in Des Moines: Aviva, EMC Insurance Companies, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Principal Financial Group and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies with a presence in the area include Centurion, Guardian Life, Hartford Life Insurance, MetLife, New York Life, Prudential, Sun Life and TIAA-CREF. In 2010, _Forbes_ rated Des Moines as “Best Place for Business.”



A terrible tragedy, the December 2012 massacre of 20 children and 6 adults in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, led to the adoption of tougher state gun control laws, even though it isn’t clear how those laws would prevent deranged people from killing.



What the laws have done is spur the exodus of companies that account for about one‐​seventh of U.S. firearms production — a Connecticut industry going back more than a century. The National Shooting Sports Foundation estimated that Connecticut gun manufacturers provide some 2,900 jobs and generate $1.7 billion within the state. Perhaps the best‐​known Connecticut gun producer is Colt Manufacturing whose armory, capped with a distinctive blue onion dome, has been a landmark on Hartford’s southern skyline since 1867.



The first gun manufacturer to announce plans for moving out was PTR Industries, a Bristol‐​based manufacturer of military‐​style rifles. It’s going to South Carolina. Stag Arms, in New Britain, Connecticut, is also planning to move out. Sturm Ruger & Company is inclined to retain their headquarters in Connecticut, while expanding production elsewhere. It seems likely other gun manufacturers will leave the state.



The biggest exodus — and the most financially calamitous consequence of Connecticut’s personal income and corporate taxes — could involve hedge fund managers. There are reported to be some 200 hedge funds in Connecticut.



For example, Edward Lampert, Chairman of Sears Holding Corporation and the CEO of ESO Investments (a $10 billion hedge fund), used to do business in Greenwich. But after Connecticut’s most recent tax hike, he decided that he had enough. Lampert, believed to be worth about $3 billion, moved to Miami.



Thalius Hechsher, who heads global development for Apex Fund, also moved his business to Florida. He said, “There’s no need to drag people down here. It’s a zero‐​income‐​tax jurisdiction.”



Since Connecticut no longer has a big tax advantage over New York, and Manhattan real estate prices are much lower than they were before the financial meltdown, many investment managers find it attractive to rent a high‐​end office in Manhattan. It still has the greatest concentration of hedge fund managers.



For a while back in 2010, there was talk that New York might enact a hedge fund tax. Jodi Rell, Connecticut’s governor at the time, was quick to host a Darien reception to show investment managers that they were welcome in Connecticut.



But her successor Malloy threatened a hedge fund tax. He was reportedly shocked when UBS began transferring some of its people back to Manhattan, and other investment managers started to talk about relocating. Malloy was a bit slow to recognize that the bloom was off the rose.



In the dimness of his perception about what it takes to achieve real economic growth — namely, making the business climate attractive for all comers, including the multitude of small businesses without political connections — Malloy has doled out oodles of corporate welfare. Thusfar, his sweetest deal has been a $25 million, “forgivable” 10‐​year loan at 1 percent interest for Bridgewater Associates, reported to be the largest hedge fund, PLUS — Bridgewater is to get $90 million for job training, alternative energy and assorted tax credits. The idea is to help Bridgewater move from one wealthy town (Westport) to new digs in another wealthy town (Stamford).



It will be interesting to see how this deal looks in a few years.



Meanwhile, Malloy is digging himself deeper into the business of picking winners, the business where President Obama embarrassed himself by backing a succession of green energy losers that finagled government‐​subsidized loans before going bankrupt.



Malloy, for instance, got the idea that Maine‐​based Jackson Labs might help launch a Connecticut high tech boom. Listen to this: the state, already loaded with excessive debt, will borrow $291 million more, pay the $120 million of interest costs, then pick up all the construction costs to establish a new lab facility in Farmington and finally subsidize the lab’s operations for the first 10 years. Only after that is Jackson Labs projected to provide funding. Jackson Labs itself is dependent on public funding, so the whole deal might appear to be a house of cards. Yankee Institute researcher Zachary Janowski reported that Connecticut funding amounts to a $42,327 state subsidy per job per year.



 **Don’t die in Connecticut!**



There’s another factor that leads people to think seriously about leaving Connecticut: its probate court system.



Yale Law School professor John H. Langbein said that “When citizens of our state ask me about Connecticut probate, I give this simple advice: Try not to die in Connecticut. If you are a person of means, you should establish your domicile in some place such as Florida or Maine or Arizona that has a responsible probate system.”  See Langbein’s testimony before the Connecticut Legislature Committee on Program Review & Investigation, October 7, 2005.



Connecticut probate corruption has been going on for a long time, because judges and lawyers aggressively resist attempted reforms. More than 60 years ago, New York University law professor Thomas Atkinson reported that “Connecticut is just about at the bottom of the list so far as its probate court system is concerned.”



Today, Connecticut probate judges work part‐​time in one town and often practice law in other towns which can mean obvious conflicts‐​of‐​interest. Probate judge A is reluctant to reject motions enriching lawyer B who comes before him, because lawyer B serves as probate judge B in another town where probate judge A works as lawyer A and makes motions to enrich himself.



To be sure, there is a Connecticut statute — Chapter 801, Section 45a‐​25 — that says a probate judge cannot appear as an attorney in another probate judge’s court when a matter is “contested.” A matter is “contested” if a party objects. In that situation, a Connecticut probate judge might be able to get around the law by having his law firm partner or associate appear in a another probate judge’s court.



If there’s no objection, because a party or his/​her attorney isn’t present — perhaps because there wasn’t proper notice about a hearing — then the law seems to indicate that a probate judge could appear as an attorney in another probate judge’s court.



In 2011, there were some changes in Connecticut law applicable to probate courts, and Judge Paul J. Knierim, Connecticut Probate Court Administrator, claimed that those reforms “addressed all of Langbein’s core concerns.”



Langbein emphatically disagreed: “The worst feature of the probate system, that many of the judges are part‐​timers who have active law practices, remains. No set of be‐​good rules can begin to eradicate structural conflicts‐​of‐​interest this system invites. If you are in law practice, you are looking to build your law practice. That is profoundly inconsistent with the judicial function, where your sole purpose must be to make the right decision under law.”



Connecticut’s probate system has enabled judges to collect fees for essentially looting estates. According to Langbein, “Filing fees and subsequent charges are far higher than elsewhere. Probate courts have extended their fees to non‐​probate transfers such as life insurance and joint tenancy, for which, by definition, no probate services are needed.”



That’s not all. Connecticut has had something called the Duplicate Trial Rule that, as Langbein pointed out, “allows a litigant who is determined to have a contested probate matter heard by a professional judge to do so, but only after making that person pay for two full trials.”



Langbein insisted that “It’s no answer to say [as Knierim did] that the court fees and the judges’ compensation are set by law. The problem is that there are still too many probate courts, too many [part‐​time] judges and too much needless judicial supervision of trusts and estates, driving up costs.”



Langbein warned about the arbitrary power of probate judges to dictate “who owns the property of a decedent, and they can decide whether to strip a citizen of his or her liberty by declaring the citizen incompetent. It is far from clear that Connecticut probate could withstand constitutional scrutiny under the Due Process clause of the U.S. Constitution. When liberty and property are at stake, the state has an obligation to operate under procedures commensurate with the seriousness of the affected interests.”



Consider this case exposed by _Hartford Courant_ investigative reporter Rick Green. The case involved Josephine Smoron, the last of a family of Polish farmers whose 80‐​acre property is in Southington. She willed it to Sam Manzo, her long‐​time caretaker. The property was estimated to be worth about $1.5 million.



According to the _Courant_ , when Smoron’s health worsened, probate judge Brian Meccariello appointed local lawyer John Nugent as conservator supposedly to protect her interests. Nugent, who never met Smoron (“I don’t speak dementia,” he was quoted as saying), reportedly made a deal to help a Southington developer gain control of the property. The developer was identified by the _Courant_ as Carl Verderame. In May 2009, Meccariello arbitrarily changed Smoron’s will, disinheriting Manzo and setting up a legal maneuver that would transfer the property to Verderame. Manzo persisted with efforts to uphold Smoron’s original will, and the case went to Superior Court in Hartford. _Rick Green_ described the judge as struggling to resolve a “circular firing squad of competing interests.” Manzo finally prevailed this year, but the court nearly pulled off a robbery.



These courts have been reformed? “As for the scandals involving abuse of the protective jurisdiction for the elderly,” Yale Law’s Langbein remarked, “I am not aware of any major reforms having been taken to prevent such cases in the future. The power to strip an elderly person of autonomy over his or her property is essential — we cannot leave such persons to harm themselves or be victimized — but that power is inherently dangerous and should not be in the hands of guys who are on the make.”



Despite the 2011 Connecticut probate reforms, there continue to be outrageous cases of guardianship abuse. Connecticut Probate Advocates has gathered cases from multiple sources.



What should be done about Connecticut’s probate scandals? Langbein believes “the reform that is needed is to get rid of the probate court system, fold the jurisdiction into the ordinary courts as in other states, and have it served by real judges chosen more on merit.” Unfortunately, such genuine reform isn’t likely to happen, because as Langbein notes, “The probate gang is a feared interest group in the state legislature, and they largely get what they want.”



Probate issues, though little talked about outside the world of trusts and estates, could spur an acceleration of the exodus from Connecticut as affluent baby boomers retire where they’re less likely to be looted.



 _TopRe​tire​ments​.com_ rated states according to their desirability for retirement. They ranked Connecticut dead last.



The most fundamental lesson here is simply that investors, entrepreneurs and other productive people want to go where they’re welcome. They start to think about leaving when they feel exploited.



If enough of these people leave, how can a declining economy possibly turn around?

"A small community in the rolling uplands of southern Scotland hopes to create a major new nature reserve, straddling more than 10,000 acres of heather moorland home to hen harriers, black grouse and curlew. The 2,300 villagers of Langholm, a small settlement a few miles north of the English border, hope to buy one of the UK’s most famous grouse moors, owned by one of the UK’s most powerful hereditary landowners, the Duke of Buccleuch.  Their goal is to convert Langholm Moor into a model for climate-friendly and sustainable ecological restoration, powered by small-scale wind and solar farms, spurred on by an upsurge in community buyouts across Scotland. But the project faces significant obstacles which, campaigners argue, expose new problems that threaten the Scottish land reform movement’s ambitions. Buccleuch Estates want £6m for Langholm Moor, and the villagers have 16 weeks to find the money. The Scottish Land Fund, a government fund that backs buyouts, has made the Langholm Initiative a time-limited offer of £1m, provided it raises nearly £5m more by 31 October. If it fails to acquire Langholm Moor by that date, the money goes and Buccleuch could put it back on the market. The community is now racing to find other backers. “It’s challenging,” said Kevin Cumming, the project manager, who hopes South of Scotland Enterprise, a new regeneration agency, will contribute to the scheme. There are also other potential bidders in mind. “We’re under huge pressure, and I don’t sleep very often,” said Cumming. “It has massive cultural value to the people of Langholm. We are looking at ecological restoration, to increase biodiversity as much as we can, make it more resistant to climate change and give our children a better future.” Land reform has been a potent issue in Scotland for decades, but buyouts were largely restricted to the Highlands and islands, most notably by the Assynt crofters, who bought their remote coastal estate in 1992, and the islanders of Eigg, who bought their island in 1997.  Devolution of power to the Scottish parliament in 1999 allowed the first Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition government to strengthen buyout legislation and draw in National Lottery money to fund buyouts; under the Scottish National party that has expanded.   The Scottish Land Fund (SLF), administered by the National Lottery Community Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, has been given £10m a year to fund rural and urban buyouts by the Scottish government. The SNP also set up the Scottish Land Commission, an influential advisory body which last year recommended new powers to force landowners to sell up to local communities.   The commission said Scotland’s land ownership was monopolistic: if found that about 1,125 owners, including Highland lairds and bodies such as Forest Enterprise and the National Trust for Scotland, own 70% of Scotland’s rural land, covering more than 4.1m hectares (10m acres). Of that, 87 owners held a total of 1.7m ha (4.2m acres).   By Severin Carrell, Scotland editor The sale of Langholm Moor, famous among conservationists as the site of a 25-year-long research project into the survival of widely persecuted hen harriers on grouse moors, is a significant moment for Scotland’s land reform movement. The Duke of Buccleuch, a hereditary title dating to 1663, was once the UK’s largest private landowner, and the family still holds 217,000 acres of moorland, farms and forestry, and a £250m urban property portfolio. The family’s homes include Drumlanrig castle, an estate dating back to the reign of Robert the Bruce, and the Boughton estate in Northamptonshire. But for the first time in generations, its estate is shrinking at a time when private landowners in Scotland are under intensifying pressure to break up their estates. Last year the Scottish Land Commission, set up by ministers in Edinburgh to accelerate land reform, called for new powers to force landowners to sell to local communities. Buccleuch Estates is supporting three buyouts, at Langholm Moor and of land next to two villages, both built by the Buccleuchs in the 1600s and 1700s. The family is selling 750 acres to villagers in Newcastleton, 16km east of Langholm, and 3,900 acres of moorland around Wanlockhead, a former mining village in the Leadhills said to be Scotland’s highest settlement. They plan to invest heavily in eco-tourism, campsites and bunkhouses; Wanlockhead hopes its low-intensity gold panning business can flourish. Benny Higgins, a former banker appointed last year to chair Buccleuch Estates, and an economics adviser to Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the timing of the commission’s interventions and Buccleuch’s decision to sell up was coincidental. Even so, he indicated, the family and company are sensitive to the political climate. Buccleuch’s new agenda, he said, “is to establish collaborative relationships with the communities that we’re in and to make sure, when there are mutual opportunities for us to raise some capital to reinvest in the business and a community is eager to take advantage of that, this is absolutely hand in glove collaboration”. The Newcastleton buyout is essentially sealed: it was granted £850,000 by the SLF earlier this month, allowing the village to raise all the money it needs. It has quietly pioneered community ownership in the south of Scotland. Barbara Elborn, the secretary of the Newcastleton and District Community Trust, said they first bought ground for a sports facility from Buccleuch in 2000; in 2018 they reopened the village’s derelict petrol station, running it as a community enterprise. Wanlockhead has until August to submit its bid to the SLF. The land it wants is expected to cost about £1.4m; Wanlockhead hopes to win nearly all that from the land fund, but it faces stiff competition. The SLF has £10m a year to spend but is now heavily oversubscribed. It will close to new applicants in August, seven months before the end of its financial year, because of the surge in applications. It has 32 active bids, and expects to run out of money in November. Its current funding ends in March 2021, just before May’s Scottish parliament election. Community Land Scotland, an umbrella group for community-ownership, wants to see the SLF’s annual budget doubled, but there are fears amongst campaigners that the coronavirus pandemic and widely expected recession will make it harder for the next government to afford it. Campaigners argue that land buyouts are a powerful vehicle for social and economic regeneration, so should be prioritised. Hamish Trench, the Scottish Land Commission’s chief executive, said the Buccleuch buyouts had great significance because they showed community ownership was becoming normalised, but the shortage of financial options for communities trying to buy expensive land was a worry. More options were needed, including state-backed and privately funded social investment finance. “It is no longer acceptable for large areas of land to be traded in a way where those people affected [local communities] cannot influence things,” Trench said. “This is a very important cultural shift, both in terms of transparency and communities being able to acquire land.” • This article was amended on 26 June 2020 to add, by way of clarification, that buy-out campaigners (and not Community Land Scotland) raised fears that the expected economic crisis will hit funding post-election."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe global warmists are in a disarray vortex. Their science now insists that it is both cooling and warming – at the same time!
In the complex, convoluted and clashing parallel worlds of the global warming alarmists, everything is possible. Physical laws are bent, twisted, completely redefined, or ignored altogether with every passing day.
More of anything proves warming, as so does less of the same.
New paper from Japan forecasts colder winters
Despite the dozens of predictions of warming winters coming from the global warming alarmists just 5 years ago and earlier, they have recently turned on a dime and are now projecting cold, snowy winters because of global warming. This once again is being reiterated in a new Japanese paper and echoed by number one German alarmist site Klimaretter (Climate Rescuers).
Severe winter probability “will double”!
Klimaretter writes:
Global warming is leading to a contradictory effect: Already today the risk of a colder than average winter is higher than it was a few decades ago.”
Later it writes:

google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




And this trend is expected to continue over the coming decades: The probability of more severe winters in Europe and North Asia will double because of climate change. This is what Japanese scientists are projecting in Nature Geoscience.”
Sound Orwellian? For the propagandist Klimaretter, no science is too absurd to believe – so long as it’s catastrophist. If a Japanese paper claims so or if the climate models of the Alfred Wegener Institute and the Potsdam Institute looking 50 years into the future say so, then it’s good enough for them (never mind these models have already got the first 20 years all wrong).
Green energy has stopped global warming?
Not only is global warming now responsible for the higher risk of cold winters, but also the recent warming pause (which proves warming) is now being attributed to a successful green energy revolution. Having a very hard time explaining the recent warming pause to the public and realizing that attributing it to warming is a tough sell to the public, a spooked UK Energy Minister Baroness Sandip Verma has just come up with a better explanation for the unforeseen pause: the green energy revolution is likely already having a cooling effect on the planet and is already saving it (never mind that CO2 concentrations and fossil fuel burning are rising unabated).
Unfortunately Verma’s explanation is just as absurd as the first one.
Medieval witchcraft and rain dancing
It’s increasingly obvious that government officials are becoming embarrassed by the unexpected global warming pause and are desperate to explain it without losing face. Like rain dancers and witches claiming their acts have produced the desired result, British pols are now asking us to believe that the act of erecting windmills and covering rooftops with solar panels has pleased the climate gods – and so the warming has stopped.
The real problem, however, is that the global warming alarmists are no longer able to get their stories straight and are falling over themselves in their panicked scramble to explain their already failed model predictions. While some claim that cooling is caused by a real global warming, others are admitting that the real warming has really stopped, and done so because of the green energies they’ve wisely introduced! The warmists are in disarray.
So it’s little wonder Weather Channel founder John Coleman calls it all “incredible bad bad science” and that Climate Depot calls it “Medieval witchcraft“.

"BERKELEY, Calif.  —   Fires burned in the cradle of free speech. Furious at a lecture organized on campus, demonstrators wearing   outfits smashed windows, threw rocks at the police and stormed a building. The speech? The university called it off. Protest has been synonymous with the University of California, Berkeley, from the earliest days of the free speech movement, when students fought to expand political expression on campus beginning in 1964. Those protests would set off student activism movements that roiled campuses across the country throughout the 1960s. Since then, countless demonstrators have flocked to Sproul Plaza each day to have their voices heard on issues from civil rights and apartheid to Israel, tuition costs and more. But now the university is under siege for canceling a speech by the incendiary   writer Milo Yiannopoulos and words like intolerance, long used by the left, are being used by critics to condemn the protests on Wednesday night that ultimately prevented Mr. Yiannopoulos from speaking. Naweed Tahmas, a junior who is a member of the Berkeley College Republicans, the group that invited Mr. Yiannopoulos to campus, said the cancellation had made him more determined to fight for freedom of speech on campus. “I’m tired of getting silenced, as many conservative students are,” he said. “If we support freedom of speech, we should support all speech including what they consider hate speech. ” When the event was canceled, the Republican student group reacted by writing on their Facebook page, “the Free Speech Movement is dead. ” More than 100 faculty members signed a letter opposing the visit by Mr. Yiannopoulos in recent weeks. “We support robust debate, but we cannot abide by harassment, slander, defamation, and hate speech,” they wrote. On Thursday, heated arguments broke out at Sproul Plaza between students who said Mr. Yiannopoulos  —   a provocateur editor at Breitbart News who is known for his attacks on political correctness and offensive,   writing  —   was too inflammatory to be invited to campus and those who argued that he should have been allowed to speak. The university made it clear they believed the people who resorted to violence on Wednesday night  —   a group, clad in black clothing and carrying sticks  —   had come from outside the campus. The university estimated on Thursday that the rioting had caused around $100, 000 in damage. Whatever the origins of the violent mob, the university was and remains divided over the meaning of free speech at a time of national political tumult. “I think we need to have a serious conversation about protests. This is going to be a big part of our lives for the next four years,” said Kirsten Pickering, a graduate student at the university. She and others described the violence as a “potential teachable moment. ” “We need to sit down and talk about what is acceptable,” she added. Troy Worden, a   student and a member of the College Republicans, said he would “absolutely” invite Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak on campus again, and Mr. Tahmas added that the Republican student group is a racially diverse group that does not consider Mr. Yiannopoulos to be a white nationalist. Criticism of the decision to cancel the speech came from outside the university as well. On Twitter early on Thursday, President Trump went as far as to threaten withholding federal funds from the university for failing to stop “violence on people with a different point of view. ” Mr. Yiannopoulos has cultivated a sizable following among the     movement with his speaking events, podcast interviews and articles. He travels around California on a tour bus airbrushed with his likeness. Since embarking in September on his speaking tour of American campuses, he has been trailed by protests. But the events have also attracted pockets of   anarchists clad in face masks and spoiling for a fight. Some university organizers withdrew invitations to Mr. Yiannopoulos over security concerns. At the University of California, Davis, on Jan. 13, his speech was canceled as it was set to begin after a tense standoff between protesters and police officers. A week later, on Inauguration Day, a man was shot during protests outside Mr. Yiannopoulos’s speech at the University of Washington in Seattle. He was to cap his tour this week at Berkeley. In the weeks leading up to the event, campus administrators faced tremendous pressure from student groups and faculty members to cancel it. In a video of himself posted on Facebook after the cancellation on Wednesday night, Mr. Yiannopoulos criticized the “hard left, which has become so utterly antithetical to free speech in the last few years. ” “They simply will not allow any speaker on campus, even somebody as silly and harmless and gay as me to have their voice heard,” he added. One group that has been outspoken in favor of allowing Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak is the veterans of the university’s free speech movement. “I’m really a little fatigued with all of this, ‘Oh my goodness, cover my ears, someone will say something that will upset me, I can’t tolerate that,’ ” said Jack Radey, who was a    activist during the original free speech movement at Berkeley. “There are racists, sexists, piggery of various kinds who will say really terrible things. And that is part of the world,” Mr. Radey said by telephone from Oregon, where he is retired. “Learn how to fight back. Don’t say, ‘Oh, no. We can’t allow someone to speak because someone might be offended.’ ” In a letter to The Daily Californian, Berkeley’s student newspaper, Mr. Radey and other members of the Free Speech Movement Archive board of directors, a grouping of some of the movement’s activists, said Mr. Yiannopoulos was “a bigot who comes to campus spouting vitriol so as to attract attention to himself. ” But they said free speech was paramount. “Berkeley’s free speech tradition, won through struggle  —   suspension, arrest, fines, jail time  —   by Free Speech Movement activists is far more important than Yiannopoulos, and it is that tradition’s endurance that concerns us,” they wrote."

Take a few deep breaths and note the question mark. It’s not a statement of fact nor is it an expression of an opinion. It’s merely a question that may or may not be worthy of consideration and maybe even a conversation. 



It’s often argued that drug laws and in particular those relating to Class C drugs like cannabis, are among many simple and arguably insignificant pieces of legislation we have lying around that are just a pain in the neck and more trouble than they’re worth.



Everybody knows that a large number of people have for years been cultivating and using cannabis. The authorities seem to have reached a point where they operate to a finely tuned balance with the existing legislation. They turn a bit of a blind eye to personal use, occasionally sort out and charge some low end but troublesome dealers, and reasonably regularly swoop on the gangs and the larger operators to keep them in check. The checks and balances have evolved without our help and without legislative changes. 



It certainly looks as though anybody who wants to partake of some cannabis can easily get their hands on it and while they are operating outside the law, the law seems only to care enough to do anything about it if it becomes troublesome.



The message from the legislation however remains clear: It’s not legal and you partake at risk of prosecution; a disincentive and boundary between what society deems right and wrong. It also sets boundaries in particular for our youth.



Blurred boundaries inevitably change attitudes and are often the thin end of the wedge. The argument that because many people already choose to use cannabis, therefore it should be legalized or decriminalized, is a very weak one. Follow that to its logical conclusion and it won’t be long before we’d be under pressure to legalize other classes of drugs, running red lights and who knows what else.



Without passing comment on whether it was right or wrong or sensible or otherwise, there are many examples of changes in legislation resetting societal standards. For example, lowering the legal age of maturity from 21 to 18 gave a whole group of individuals rights that assumed a level of knowledge and experience they didn’t have then and still don’t have today. It could be argued that much of the climate change nonsense we’re dealing with today, is driven by society giving too much credence to those who are not mature enough to process the facts – but that’s another subject for another day. 



Change is not necessarily a bad thing. Nor is it necessarily a good thing. Unintended consequences however are usually not so good and it’s those we need to be thinking deeply about.

"Popcorn munching. Soup slurping. Nose sniffling. Or, simply, breathing. Ever wonder why some ordinary sounds drive you crazy? It’s called misophonia, a mysterious affliction in which seemingly harmless sounds unleash anger, anxiety and, in some cases, panic attacks in some people. If you’re one of them, neuroscientists at Newcastle University in Britain say they may have found an explanation for what ails you. In a report on the latest study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology, the neuroscientists say that brain scans of misophonia sufferers show that particular sounds, like eating and drinking, cause the part of their brain that processes emotions, the anterior insular cortex, to go into overdrive. That region in sufferers was also connected differently, compared to normal brains, to the amygdala and the hippocampus, areas that are involved in recalling past experiences, said Dr. Sukhbinder Kumar, the lead researcher from the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University. “We think that misophonia may be heavily connected to recalling past memories, because people with misophonia have had very bad experiences,” he said in a phone interview Friday. The research opens up the possibilities of future therapy for those afflicted with misophonia, a term coined by the American scientists Pawel and Margaret Jastreboff in 2001. A survey of nearly 200 misophonia sufferers showed that the average age at which they first became aware of the condition was 12, Dr. Kumar said. “When they hear these sounds, it’s like their attention is completely absorbed by the sounds, and they can’t do anything else,” he said. “They’re triggering a recall. ” For the study, the team used an M. R. I. to measure the brain activities of 42 people with and without misophonia while they were listening to a range of noises. The sounds were categorized into neutral ones like rain unpleasant sounds like a crying baby and trigger sounds that were mostly linked to eating, chewing, drinking and breathing. When exposed to the noises, those with misophonia showed brain activities different from those without the condition. “The most dominant reaction is anger and anxiety, not disgust,” Dr. Kumar said. But why those sounds, and not others, trigger such averse reactions remains a mystery, he said. The exact number of misophonia sufferers in the world is unknown, he said, because it was only recently diagnosed as a condition. The affliction can be so acute in some people that they can’t stand living with their own families. Olana   29, of Kent, England, was just 8 when family meals became a real chore. “The noise of my family eating forced me to retreat to my own bedroom for meals,” she told the team at Newcastle University. “I can only describe it as a feeling of wanting to punch people in the face when I heard the noise of them eating. ” Dr. Kumar said in a news release,“My hope is to identify the brain signature of the trigger sounds  —   those signatures can be used for treatment such as for   for example, where people can   their reactions by looking at what kind of brain activity is being produced. ” But the study’s findings will come as some relief to misophonia sufferers and reassure some who question the condition’s validity, he added. “This study demonstrates the critical brain changes as further evidence to convince a skeptical medical community that this is a genuine disorder. ”"

In a recent paper, Marcia Wyatt and Judith Curry posited about “Stadium Waves” and climate, suggesting that the ‘stadium-wave’ signal propagates like the cheer known as “the wave” at sporting events whereby sections of sports fans seated in a circular or oval stadium stand and sit as a ‘wave’ propagates through the audience. In a similar way, Wyatt and Curry’s ‘stadium wave’ climate signal propagates around the Northern Hemisphere through a network of ocean, ice, and atmospheric circulation elements that self-organize into a collective tempo. Some might call it a “beat frequency“.
You can read more about it here on WUWT’s coverage of the paper. You can watch a stadium wave in action below.

I came across the Wyatt and Curry article again recently, and it made me think about how stadium waves might be much like traffic waves on congested multi-lane city highways. Plus, I found an excellent interactive visualization that helps tell the story

You know what these events are; the situation where all of the sudden you find yourself braking, coming to a stop or near stop along with the other traffic, and you sit there or crawl along for a minute, resume, only to repeat again n times and then suddenly the pattern evaporates and you keep looking for whatever it was that cause the slowdown, only to find nothing.
Being curious late last night, I found that there was an excellent visualization for traffic waves that may also serve as a suitable  visualization for Wyatt and Curry’s “stadium wave” in the atmosphere. This comes from a KQED blog called “The Lowdown”. Below is a screenshot of their interactive traffic wave model with my annotation. It reminds me of the top down look at the northern hemisphere we often see when looking at the circumpolar vortex.

You can interact with this visualization yourself here: http://blogs.kqed.org/lowdown/2013/11/12/traffic-waves
Matthew Green writes:
The simplest explanation for why traffic waves happen is that drivers have relatively slow reaction times: if the car in front of you suddenly slows down, it’ll likely take you a second or so to hit the brakes. The slower your reaction time, the harder you have to brake to compensate and keep a safe distance. The same goes for the car behind you, which has to brake even harder than you did in order to slow down faster. And so on down the road, in a domino-like effect.
The equation used in the car circle above is relatively complex. Known as the  Intelligent Driver Model, it was first proposed in 2000 by researchers at Germany’s Dresden University of Technology. The creators made this Java applet demonstration. Formal equations to explain these traffic patterns in terms of individual behavior are called car following models. They were first developed by researchers at General Motors in the 1950s. The simplest such formula is: 
where a is the car’s acceleration, Δv is the difference in velocity compared with the car behind it, T is reaction time and ƛ is some constant that researchers estimate from data. The equation says, “At time t, you accelerate at a rate proportional to the difference in speed between your car and the speed of the car you’re following, but with a gap of T seconds.”
So, put really simply, if you’re going faster than the car in front of you, then you slow down. And if you’re going slower, you speed up. This equation produces the graph below. At the 10-second mark, the grey car slows down, and the cars that brake later have to slow down to lower and lower minimum speeds. Each line shows the history of the speed of a different car. Drag the slider to graphically see a traffic wave unfold. Note how the cars at the bottom of the chart get closer together with time, as speed evens out.
In our atmosphere, “braking” could be equivalent to such events like rex block highs and cutoff lows, both of which are detached from the jet stream and impede atmospheric flow. That’s just one example for a short time scale we can observe in weather.
From our WUWT story on the paper, where they use the term “braking” to describe what starts the stadium wave:
Wyatt and Curry identified two key ingredients to the propagation and maintenance of this stadium wave signal: the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and sea ice extent in the Eurasian Arctic shelf seas. The AMO sets the signal’s tempo, while the sea ice bridges communication between ocean and atmosphere. The oscillatory nature of the signal can be thought of in terms of ‘braking,’ in which positive and negative feedbacks interact to support reversals of the circulation regimes. As a result, climate regimes — multiple-decade intervals of warming or cooling — evolve in a spatially and temporally ordered manner. While not strictly periodic in occurrence, their repetition is regular — the order of quasi-oscillatory events remains consistent. Wyatt’s thesis found that the stadium wave signal has existed for at least 300 years.
…
The stadium wave periodically enhances or dampens the trend of long-term rising temperatures, which may explain the recent hiatus in rising global surface temperatures.
“The stadium wave signal predicts that the current pause in global warming could extend into the 2030s,” said Wyatt, an independent scientist after having earned her Ph.D. from the University of Colorado in 2012.
Thank goodness we don’t get stuck in traffic that long.

Dam at Volchaya river (Karelian Isthmus) (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
From the American Chemical Society.
I wonder if they studied how much methane comes from sediment loads dropped by rivers naturally and compared them? The Mississippi Delta alone must be a terrible offender.
Sediment trapped behind dams makes them ‘hot spots’ for greenhouse gas emissions
With the “green” reputation of large hydroelectric dams already in question, scientists are reporting that millions of smaller dams on rivers around the world make an important contribution to the greenhouse gases linked to global climate change. Their study, showing that more methane than previously believed bubbles out of the water behind small dams, appears in ACS’ journal Environmental Science & Technology.

Andreas Maeck and colleagues point out that the large reservoirs of water behind the world’s 50,000 large dams are a known source of methane. Like carbon dioxide, methane is one of the greenhouse gases, which trap heat near Earth’s surface and contribute to global warming. Methane, however, has a warming effect 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. The methane comes from organic matter in the sediments that accumulate behind dams.
That knowledge led to questions about hydroelectric power’s image as a green and nonpolluting energy source. Maeck’s team decided to take a look at methane releases from the water impoundments behind smaller dams that store water less than 50 feet deep.
They describe analysis of methane release from water impounded behind six small dams on a European river. “Our results suggest that sedimentation-driven methane emissions from dammed river hot spot sites can potentially increase global freshwater emissions by up to 7 percent,” said the report. It noted that such emissions are likely to increase due to a boom in dam construction fostered by the quest for new energy sources and water shortages.

OSTM/Jason-2’s predecessor TOPEX/Poseidon caught the largest El Niño in a century seen in this image from Dec. 1, 1997. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
From the University of New South Wales  and the “chicken or the egg” department comes this claim that El Niño events will increase in intensity. Meanwhile the milquetoast La Nada of the present continues.
New method shows how historical ENSO activity is affected by external forcings
New research shows El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena have been more active and intense during the 30-year period between 1979-2009 than at any time during the past 600 years.
At the same time, this result suggests that the intensity and activity of El Niño and La Ninas appears to increase as global average temperatures increase.

The results of this new research, published in Climate of the Past, is a significant step towards understanding where current ENSO activity sits in the context of the past according to researchers from UNSW’s Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, the University of Hawaii International Pacific Research Centre and the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.
“Our research suggests in a warming world we are likely to see more extreme El Niño and La Nina events, which over the past decade in Australia have been related to extreme flooding, persistent droughts and dangerous fire seasons,” said lead author Dr Shayne McGregor from UNSW
“Importantly, this study not only tells us how ENSO activity has behaved in the past in relation to global average temperature, it also opens the window for climate models to be able to estimate more accurately how this activity will change in the future.”
The researchers used a newly defined method they had developed and measurements from lake sediment and old coral cores along with tree rings across a wide variety of locations to determine how ENSO events had changed across the Pacific over hundreds of years. From these proxies, the researchers were able to determine the state of the climate over a wide area at the same time, revealing changes in ENSO activity.
As part of the research, the team brought together the different proxy reconstructions of past climate and, where the time periods of these proxies overlapped with current instrumental data, used these periods to determine how accurately they represented contemporary ENSO activity.
Once the effectiveness of the proxies was confirmed the researchers used this information to extrapolate the climate and activity of ENSO over the past 600 years.
They then further tested the robustness of this approach by comparing their real-world data with that produced by two multi-century-long climate model simulations.
“By applying these observations and finding which climate models reproduce past changes, we will have a better idea of which climate models are more likely to reproduce the ENSO response to climate change in the future,” said co-author Prof Matt England from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science.
While the research shows how external warming factors have impacted ENSO cycles, one important question remains.
“We still don’t know why. Understanding this relationship will be vital to help us get a clear idea of the future changes to global climate,” said Dr McGregor.

Paper: Inferred changes in El Niño–Southern Oscillation variance over the past six centuries
Abstract:
It is vital to understand how the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has responded to past changes in natural and anthropogenic forcings, in order to better understand and predict its response to future greenhouse warming. To date, however, the instrumental record is too brief to fully characterize natural ENSO variability, while large discrepancies exist amongst paleo-proxy reconstructions of ENSO. These paleo-proxy reconstructions have typically attempted to reconstruct ENSO’s temporal evolution, rather than the variance of these temporal changes. Here a new approach is developed that synthesizes the variance changes from various proxy data sets to provide a unified and updated estimate of past ENSO variance. The method is tested using surrogate data from two coupled general circulation model (CGCM) simulations. It is shown that in the presence of dating uncertainties, synthesizing variance information provides a more robust estimate of ENSO variance than synthesizing the raw data and then identifying its running variance. We also examine whether good temporal correspondence between proxy data and instrumental ENSO records implies a good representation of ENSO variance. In the climate modeling framework we show that a significant improvement in reconstructing ENSO variance changes is found when combining information from diverse ENSO-teleconnected source regions, rather than by relying on a single well-correlated location. This suggests that ENSO variance estimates derived from a single site should be viewed with caution. Finally, synthesizing existing ENSO reconstructions to arrive at a better estimate of past ENSO variance changes, we find robust evidence that the ENSO variance for any 30 yr period during the interval 1590–1880 was considerably lower than that observed during 1979–2009.

"The Nicaraguan government has granted a concession to a mysterious Chinese company owned by Jing Wang, a little-known Hong-Kong based businessman, to build an inter-oceanic canal. This would provide an alternative to the Panama Canal that, 99 years after it first opened, is struggling to cope with shipping. Despite being one of the most important decisions in Nicaragua’s history, the legislative bill in question appeared virtually overnight and was approved as law only three days after it was sent to the parliament, with no serious national consultation or opportunity to hear the opposition from some of the country’s leading scientists. The company is the Hong Kong Nicaraguan Development Group (HKND), which has no experience with major construction projects. With an estimated cost of US$40 billion, the canal was slated to start in June 2014, but has been delayed to the end of the year The Nicaraguan government claims the project will pull the country, in which 45% of the population live on less than US$2 day, out of poverty. But so far no feasibility studies have been revealed, and serious economists have expressed their concern that the canal will just be another enclave economy as it was for Panama. Because this private canal will not be a property of Nicaragua for 100 years, and since it will not be linked to the rest of the economy, it will not create wealth nor will it improve Nicaragua’s economy. Around 300km of excavations will be required to connect the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean – three times the length of the Panama Canal. Along the route it will traverse Lake Nicaragua, the largest drinking water reservoir in the region, and cut through rainforests and ecologically valuable swamps. Although the final route has not been announced, it is clear that all possible routes will use Lake Nicaragua (also known by its indigenous name, Cocibolca). It is the lake and adjacent waterways, together with the area’s rich biodiversity, that are the most pressing environmental concerns. No environmental impact assessment was carried out as required by law before the canal concession was granted, and the face of the bill requires environmental assessments after the fact, at the discretion of the firm – an obvious conflict of interest. The project threatens some of the most fragile ecosystems in the country, on land, at sea, and in the lake, causing potentially irreversible damage. As my co-author Axel Meyer and I write in Nature this week, we fear that, should the plans proceed, there may be some devastating impact on the region’s ecology, such as the chemical and biological properties of the watercourses, due to the major excavation, dredging, sedimentation that construction will bring, as well as the inevitable pollution and invasive species that marine shipping brings. This could ultimately lead to the extinction of many fish species important to surrounding fishing communities, and characteristic aquatic fauna such as freshwater bull sharks, sawfish and tarpon could also be affected. In addition to the canal infrastructure itself, other related projects include oil pipelines, airports, and industrial zones, which will negatively affect the migration patterns and biological dynamics of terrestrial animals. Direct and indirect damage to natural reserves such as the Indio-Maiz reserve and others will threaten Nicaragua’s endangered species. Drastic changes in land use and the displacement of indigenous communities will put even greater pressures on natural protected areas as villages are relocated and begin clearing rainforest for food and shelter. Dozens of villages and indigenous communities will have to be moved out of their ancestral homes, a serious concern for indigenous groups with a deep religious connection to their ancestral lands. Communities, facing a loss of land and food insecurity, have filed lawsuits asserting that they were not consulted and that it violates their legitimate territorial rights. The Academy of Sciences of Nicaragua along with other civil organisations has organised a series of forums to promote a better-informed debate on the possible threats posed by the canal, and alternatives. A document of all the scientific and technical forum presentations has been prepared and will be published soon (in Spanish). The academy has called for an independent and external evaluation of the canal, in particular an environmental assessment, and is seeking help from the international community. It is surprising, given the magnitude of the project, how little attention it has been given abroad. As it stands the project is neither environmentally sustainable nor scientifically sound, but will proceed no matter what. International action is needed to provide expert advice to local scientists to prevent the tragic destruction of biodiversity and precious ecosystems in Central America."

Share this...FacebookTwitterPayback for blind climate alarmism: Media interest in the latest IPCC Report is small
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
The climate alarm narrative just isn’t working anymore. People have seen through the blind climate alarmism and have had enough. The profiteers of climate fear are now becoming seriously worried about the future. Climate institutes are fearing research budgets will be cut in the future. Newspapers are all too reluctant to lose their exciting climate alarm stories. And insurance companies are fretting over their extreme weather policies.
The Deutsche Klimakonsortium (DKK) [German Climate Consortium] recently set up a workshop in order to discuss the waning public interest in their own subject matter. In its newsletter, the DKK summarizes the results of the event:
DKK Workshop: ‘How is climate communication (still) doing today?’
On September 16 [2014] the public relations working group of the DKK convened in an internal workshop on today’s possibilities and challenges in climate communication. The background was the observation that the media attention has shifted away from the analysis of climate change and over to solution possibilities and the societal challenges of climate change. This was clearly visible by the weak media interest in the latest IPCC Climate report (AR 5) compared to the AR 4 of 7 years earlier, directors of the press and public relations of various research institutes have determined. Suggestions on the perspective of press and public relations work from Ute Kreis, University of Hamburg, Dr. Annette Kirk, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Dr. Dirk Notz, Research Group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology and a journalist (Christopher Schrader, Süddeutsche Zeitung) provided for a lively discussion.”
So interest in the 5th IPCC Report was scant. For this the IPCC likely only has itself to blame because it is no longer able to come to terms with the new research findings and the fact that CO2 climate sensitivity must be reduced in accordance to newest scientific results. Insteresting is that Christoph Schrader of the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper is apparently well integrated in the IPCC circle. Almost regularly we have to report on his climate-alarmism-tainted reporting at this blog. And also Dirk Notz is a die-hard IPCC-man whose dubious studies we’ve come across (see “Hamburg Max Planck Institute with questionable evidence on Arctic sea ice“).

American Thinker has a piece today, on how a recent preposterous global warming report on the PBS NewsHour hints they’re overplaying their biased coverage of the issue. The addition of it to the tally of NewsHour discussion segments absent of skeptic climate assessments suggests a media malfeasance problem too big to ignore.
Excerpts:  

My tally of the NewsHour mentioning global warming and other ‘climate change’ variations continues to grow. I’m probably short in the count, as the NewsHour has expanded its online-only material significantly in the last year or two, and I’ve probably missed some of their blog content. Of that 350+ count, it can only safely be said that one more skeptic can be included in the overall total, meteorologist Anthony Watts in his September 17, 2012 appearance alongside ‘former skeptic’ Richard Muller, which drew howls of “PBS Channels Fox News“
At what point will the public see such biased reporting as nothing more than a desperate partisan attempt to keep the issue alive? Did we witness it just recently at the NewsHour? Or will they cross that line by reporting how ‘the smell of the ocean is endangered by climate change’?

"**A pantomime due to have been staged in Stoke-on-Trent has been cancelled as the city moves into tier three.**
The Regent Theatre's socially distanced production of Robinson Crusoe was unveiled last month before post-lockdown rules were known.
Tier three rules - the strictest measures available - mean all entertainment venues need to close.
Stoke-on-Trent has the highest Covid-19 rate in the West Midlands, and among the highest in England.
There were 362.4 new cases per 100,000 people in the week up to 27 November, the seventh highest rate in the country.
Star Jonathan Wilkes said it was ""just so sad that we can't give a little bit of Christmas joy"".
He said 7,000-8,000 tickets had been booked. Those people have been contacted with options, producers Qdos Entertainment said.
Robinson Crusoe was one of a number of pantomimes getting support from the National Lottery.
Up to 700 people at a time would have seen the one-act production at the Regent, which usually seats 1,600.
Cinderella, which would have been staged from 11 December, had previously been postponed and rearranged for December 2021.
Mr Wilkes, who was set to make his 14th Regent Theatre pantomime appearance from 19 December, said the theatre had ""worked so hard to get the venue Covid safe for families"".
He added the production ""might come back at some point"".
The actor said: ""It was never about going out there and... making money.
""It was more than anything just getting something done, giving some people a little bit of light relief from what has been a rubbish year really.""

Why did the Royal Society need secret meetings?
Guest essay by Dr. Tim Ball
Recent events underscore problems with understanding climate and how the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) achieved their deception. Comments about my recent article appreciated it was a synopsis. The problems were central in my presentation to the First Heartland Climate Conference in New York relating to climatology as a generalist discipline in a world that glorifies specialization. The dictum in academia and beyond is specialization is the mark of genius, generalization the mark of a fool. In the real world each specialized piece must fit the larger general picture and most people live and function in a generalized world. The phrase “it is purely academic” means it is irrelevant to the real world.
A secret meeting occurred between Lord Lawson of the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) and members of the British Royal Society. Why the secrecy? It is likely because this collective of specialists is scrambling to recover reputations after being misled.

Claiming they were deliberately deceived in the propaganda campaign orchestrated through the British Royal Society is no excuse. The supposed prestige of that Society was used to persuade other national Science Societies that human caused global warming was a serious and proven fact. The only Society that refused to go along was the Russian. It was a deliberately orchestrated campaign that allowed media to use the consensus argument with focus. I was frequently challenged with the interrogative in the form of a consensus argument that you must be wrong because science Societies all agree.
Climate science is the work of specialists working on one small part of climatology. It’s a classic example of not seeing the forest for the trees, amplified when computer modellers are involved. They are specialists trying to be generalists but omit major segments, and often don’t know interrelationships, interactions and feedbacks in the general picture.
Society has deified specialized academics, especially scientists. Consider the phrase “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist” used to indicate intellectual superiority. Substitute a different occupation and prejudices emerge. “You don’t have to be a farmer”. Now consider the range of specialized areas required for success on a modern farm. Then count the specializations included in Figure 1, a very simple systems diagram of weather. (Note that three “boxes” include the word “flux” but the 2007 IPCC Science report says, “Unfortunately, the total surface heat and water fluxes are not well observed.)
Ian Plimer said, studies of the Earth’s atmosphere tell us nothing about future climate.
An understanding of climate requires an amalgamation of astronomy, solar physics, geology, geochronology, geochemistry, sedimentology, tectonics, palaeontology, paleoecology, glaciology, climatology, meteorology, oceanography, ecology, archaeology and history.











Figure 1: Source: After; Climate Stabilization: For Better or for Worse? William W. Kellogg and Stephen H. Schneider, Science, Volume 186, December 27, 1974
It’s an interesting observation that underscores the dilemma. Climatology is listed as a subset, but must include all the disciplines and more. You cannot study or understand the pattern of climate over time or in a region without including them all.
A frequent charge is I have no credibility because I only have “a geography degree”. It’s, ignorant on many levels, and usually used as a sign of superiority by specialists in the “hard sciences”. My PhD was through the Geography department at Queen Mary College because climatology was traditionally part of geography. The actual degree was granted in the Faculty of Science.
Climatology, like geography is a generalist discipline studying patterns and relationships. Geography is the original integrative discipline traditionally called Chorology. In the late 1960s when I looked for a school of climatology there were effectively only two, Hubert Lamb’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at East Anglia and Reid Bryson’s program in Madison Wisconsin. Neither was a viable option, although I was privileged to consult with Professor Lamb about my thesis.
Unlike most students, instead of going through the sausage-maker machine of education I pursued my studies later and with deliberation. Environmentalism was a new paradigm changing the focus from the Darwinian view of humans as a passive to an active agent in the environment. An undergraduate course on Soils taught me the formula for soil-forming factors included parent material (rock), weather, and the letter “O” for Organic. I wondered why this included everything except humans.
Early German geography recognized the impact distinguishing Landschaft, the natural landscape, from Kulturschaft, the human landscape. Others were considering the differences. George Perkins Marsh’s work, Man and Nature (1864) and William L. Thomas’ 1956 publication Man’s Role in Changing the Face of the Earth influenced me and provided a central theme – the impact of climate on the human condition.
All three theses were deliberately designed. An Honours thesis titled, Some Philosophical Considerations of Humans as a Source of Change, considered the historical and philosophical context. The Masters thesis titled, The Significance of Grain Size and Heavy Minerals Volume Percentage as Indicators of Environmental Character, Grand Beach, Manitoba provided scientific method especially related to energy inputs in an environment. The doctorate addressed two problems in climatology. Lack of long-term weather records, which Lamb identified, and the challenge of linking historical records with instrumental records. My doctoral thesis title, Climatic Change in Central Canada: A Preliminary Analysis of Weather Information from Hudson’s Bay Company Forts at York Factory and Churchill Factory, 1714-1850 involved creating a long term record from daily journals of the Hudson Bay Company. It blended daily weather observations with instrumental records through a numerical coding for each weather variable. Once the data was digitized, statistical and scientific analysis was possible.
Lack of a “science” degree was a focus early. Immediately after a presentation to Forestry graduates at the University of Alberta a professor in the front row asked, “Is it true you were denied funding by the major agencies in Canada?” This referred to two government agencies, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Sciences and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. (SSHRC). I was not denied, I just didn’t qualify, my category of historical climatology was considered Social Science by NSERC and Science by SSHRC. Fortunately, the National Science Museum of Canada, particularly Dick Harington head of the Paleobiology division, understood the problem and provided funding.
I knew as a climatologist I needed to consult with specialists. I obeyed Wegman’s warning in his Report on the Hockey Stick fiasco.
As statisticians, we were struck by the isolation of communities such as the paleoclimate community that rely heavily on statistical methods, yet do not seem to be interacting with the mainstream statistical community. The public policy implications of this debate are financially staggering and yet apparently no independent statistical expertise was sought or used.
Consultation is essential. The challenge is to know enough to ask the right questions and understand the answers. As a climatologist I try to place each piece in the puzzle. If it doesn’t fit I consult specialists for answers.
The claim that the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) didn’t exist is a classic example of a piece that didn’t fit. Many knew it existed and Soon and Baliunas provided evidence in their article Proxy climatic and environmental changes of the past 1000 years; it’s why they were so viciously attacked. Statistician Steve McIntyre showed how the infamous “hockey stick” graph was created. The Wegman Report confirmed his findings and exposed a major misuse of statistics and dendroclimatology. The misuse of tree rings was further confirmed by a forestry expert. Few areas of IPCC climate science bear examination by specialists.
The claim that CO2 is greenhouse gas does not fit. I itemized the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) deliberate diversions to demonize CO2 for a political agenda. Years ago at a conference in Calgary I heard a skeptic challenged by a knowledgeable audience member about the claim of CO2 as a greenhouse gas (GHG). The reply was troubling. We (skeptics) would lose all credibility if we suggest CO2 is not a GHG. It is better to say it is, but the effect, especially of the human portion, is minuscule and of no consequence.
I pursued my policy asking physicists about the role of CO2 as a GHG. I thought they would agree. They didn’t. It’s partly reflected in estimates of climate sensitivity. They range from the IPCC high through those who believe it is zero to some who believe it is a negative quantity with CO2 as a cooling agent. The conflict appears to be disagreement in how temperature is modified by the physical processes involved in energy transfer. If the physics was known and agreed presumably weather and climate forecasts would work, but they don’t.
Traditional climatology included a mechanism called continentalism. It measured the modifying influence on temperature range of the distance from the ocean. Here are ranges for three Canadian cities at approximately the same latitude.
Station Maximum Minimum Range
Gander, Nfld 35.6°C -28.8°C 64.2°C
Winnipeg 40.6°C -45°C 85.6°C
Vancouver 33.3°C -17.8°C 51°C
Both Vancouver (west coast) and Gander (east coast) are close to the ocean but they are in the zone of the prevailing Westerlies. Gander experiences continental air more frequently than Vancouver. The different specific heat capacities of land and water explain the difference. Water acts to modify temperature range.
The greatest daily land temperature ranges occur in regions with very low atmospheric moisture (hot and cold deserts). Water vapour acts like the oceans to modify temperature range, as a result desert biomes record the greatest daily temperature ranges. It has nothing to do with CO2. Similarly, lowest daily temperature ranges occur in tropical rain forests where water vapour levels are highest. Total modification of global temperature range is achieved by water in all its phases.
Climatology is a generalist discipline that requires incorporating all specialist disciplines. The modern glorification of specialization allowed climate scientists to dominate by claiming their piece of a vast puzzle was critical. IPCC climate scientists misused specialized areas, especially in climate models, to achieve a predetermined result. It is only exposed when specialists examine what was done or climatologists find a piece of the puzzle that doesn’t fit.
=================================================================
For the record, I don’t agree with Dr. Ball’s opinions on CO2, not being a greenhouse gas, the science is quite clear on that issue long before global warming being an issue. The only valid question is climate sensitivity – Anthony

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman skeptic site “Die kalte Sonne” brings up an article at the online Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) that reports natural catastrophes worldwide have reached a 10-year low.
Anthony Watts also wrote on this earlier at WUWT.
The Süddeutsche Zeitung (South German Newspaper) writes:
Number of natural catastrophes in 2013 drops to a ten-year low
Over the past year the number of natural catastrophes dropped to the lowest level in ten years. This is reported by the “World Catastrophe Report 2014”, which the die International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement published in Geneva. According to the report 337 natural catastrophes were counted over the past year, almost half as many as the peak seen in 2005. The number of deaths was 22,452 and thus well below the mean of the decade of 97,954.
The results fly in the face of alarmist claims of man-made global warming causing more violent, extreme weather events.
In fact there has not been any warming in 18 years, and weather-related damage is increasingly due to cold events, as the world’s leading reinsurer Munich Re reported last July:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Economic losses plummet 56%
The statistics for natural catastrophes for the first half of 2014 have been marked by pleasingly low levels of global claims. Overall economic losses of US$ 42bn and insured losses of US$ 17bn to the end of June were considerably below the average for the past ten years (US$ 95bn and US$ 25bn respectively). “
And the reason for most of the damage:
Record North American winter, blizzards cause losses
The record winter in North America also caused significant losses, with extremely cold temperatures and heavy snowfalls over a longer period in many parts of the USA and Canada. The losses from various blizzards totalled around US$ 3.4bn. The most costly snowstorm was in the first week of January: losses for this storm alone totalled US$ 2.5bn, of which US$ 1.7bn was insured. In many instances the harsh winter also had a heavy impact on business, as companies were forced to stop production. At the end of January, a blizzard brought the Atlanta metropolitan area almost to a standstill, even though only a few centimetres of snow had fallen. Snow and ice made the highways impassable, as there was a lack of snow-clearing equipment for a city unused to such conditions.”
So we can add another one to the list of climate “science” now exposed as being purely bogus.

"People are “constantly cutting down trees”, says Badru Kyewalyanga, as he squelches his bare feet into a thick paste of mud in Mukono, central Uganda. “But they have nowhere else to get firewood. The deforestation rate here is very high.” With only 10% of Uganda’s rural population connected to the electrical grid, there is little option but to burn wood, leading to one of the worst deforestation rates in the world. Every year, 2.6% of the country’s forests are cut down for fuel, agriculture, and to make way for population growth. If things stay as they are, Uganda will lose all  its forest cover in less than 25 years, the country’s National Environment Management Authority says. The mud currently being mixed by Kyewalyanga’s feet is a crucial, if unlikely, ingredient in his fight to tackle Uganda’s climate crisis on a local level. Over the next few hours it will be transformed from an indistinct mess into an energy-saving cooking stove. When finished, it will reduce the amount of wood needed to cook by half. Reminders of the project’s significance are not hard to find; the village overlooks a valley almost completely devoid of trees. Through his work as a scout leader, Kyewalyanga has grown accustomed to similar scenes across Mukono district. It was seeing the consequences first hand that inspired him to act. Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com “Before, we would have two seasons a year that would get a lot of rainfall. But because of cutting down trees, this has changed. Now, sometimes we get one season [of rain], and a lot more droughts. The dry season is now longer than the wet season,” says Kyewalyanga. The knock-on effect of deforestation has been severe across the country, leading to irregular dry seasons, prolonged periods of drought and unpredictable heavy rainfall. In May, deadly floods wrought havoc in Kasese, western Uganda, destroying homes, schools and farms. The region saw similar floods in December, and experts have pointed to excessive tree clearing in highland areas, such as the Rwenzori mountains, which has left the soil loose and unable to retain water.  Crop failures have become increasingly common, not just in Mukono, but all over the country. Frustrated by a lack of government action in Mukono, Kyewalyanga began to build the stoves in 2017, after learning the technique from a group of American volunteers. The key is in their simplicity: using only natural ingredients of mud, water and straw – all of which are accessible to most rural Ugandans – they cost nothing to make. They are also fast and easy to construct. In fact, they are literally thrown together. Fist-sized balls of mud are pelted into the ground to form the body of the stove. This technique forces out unwanted air, making the stoves one solid mass and preventing cracks. As the stove takes shape, it is moulded around the trunk of a matooke tree, a banana-like plant common across Uganda, which has been cut and arranged to form the ventilation chambers, combustion chamber and chimney. Over the two-week period it takes for the mud to harden, the trunk will rot away, clearing the chambers for use. For the final touch, a chimney is fitted to the wall allowing the acrid woodsmoke to escape. Besides reducing the amount of wood used, the stoves provide huge health benefits. The inside walls of Christine’s kitchen are charred black with smoke; cooking for a family of six is starting to take its toll on her health. After seeing Kyewalyanga building a stove for her neighbour, she was keen to get one for herself. “It disturbs me very much. I have health problems because of the smoke. Hopefully, it will help me get rid of my respiratory illness,” she says. According to Kyewalyanga, respiratory health issues are common among women in Mukono. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that 4.3 million global deaths a year are a result of indoor air pollution. Working with his scout troop, and a mixture of local and international volunteers, Kyewalyanga has built around 100 stoves over the past three years, but many more are needed. “These stoves are really important because they slow the rate at which trees are used,” says Brian Batto, a young volunteer from Mukono. “In the long run, we’re trying to combat climate change. It’s important to come up with these solutions [ourselves].” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

"They called him the Beast. David Fajgenbaum was the fittest of his friends at the University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, a    gym addict and former quarterback at Georgetown. His mammoth hands seemed more suited to spiraling footballs than the fine fingerwork a    might need. He had endurance to match, taking multiple hits and returning to the field to play on. “This guy was a physical specimen,” said his former roommate, Grant Mitchell, who used to walk to work with him. When they would arrive at the hospital for his obstetrics rotation, his friend recalled, “he would basically coerce me into doing   on the tree outside. ” In July 2010, that all changed. The    woke up at night drenched in sweat. His lymph nodes were swollen. He felt stabs of abdominal pain, and odd red bumps began sprouting across his chest. Most bizarre of all, he felt very tired  —   so tired that he began slipping into empty exam rooms between patients, stealing   naps to get through the day. “Guys, I think I’m dying,” he recalled telling his friends. A visit to the emergency room confirmed his fears. A doctor told him that his liver, kidneys and bone marrow were not working properly. Even more troubling, the doctor had no idea why his body was failing. “What do you think is going on?” he remembers the doctor asking him. Pursuing the answer to that question, it turned out, would become his life’s work. It would transform Dr. Fajgenbaum from a patient on the brink of death five different times, whose illness stumped specialist after specialist, to one of the leading researchers in his field. He has even used himself as his own test subject, and may have discovered a treatment for his rare disease. His story, which has been circulating inside medicine, is more than one person’s remarkable journey, however. It offers a look into the world of rare diseases, a corner of medicine that continues to frustrate  —   and flummox  —   those who seek cures for obscure conditions. About 95 percent of all rare diseases have no approved drug treatments. Fewer than 8, 000 people in the United States are found to have Dr. Fajgenbaum’s condition in any given year. But taken as a whole, rare diseases are not unusual: An estimated 30 million people in the country  —   or about 10 percent of the population  —   are living with one of the nearly 7, 000 rare diseases that have been identified. Prompted by financial incentives passed by Congress, the drug industry is hotly pursuing treatments for a throng of rare diseases. That has led to breakthroughs in several conditions, including cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. Nevertheless, with a small number of subjects to study and relatively few people to sell new drugs to, many rare diseases are overlooked by doctors and scientists, hampered by a lack of resources and public awareness. Dr. Fajgenbaum’s condition is one of the many that have been given relatively little attention. Initially, doctors thought he had a common form of cancer. A CT scan  —   a series of images that give doctors a clearer picture of what is going on inside the body  —   revealed a body riddled with enlarged lymph nodes, a hallmark of lymphoma. The news struck a particularly cruel blow: Only a few years earlier, while Dr. Fajgenbaum was in college, his mother died of brain cancer. He declined rapidly as his immune system went haywire. A retinal hemorrhage, a type of ministroke, temporarily blinded his left eye. Fluids leaked out of his blood vessels, a sign that his liver was failing. Over the next two weeks, he gained about 70 pounds of extra fluid and his brain fogged over. For those who knew him as the Beast, the transformation was jarring. “Even when he got sicker and sicker and eventually went into the hospital, it was kind of like this, oh, weird, Dave must have some really awful virus  —   that’s one hell of a flu,” his friend Dr. Mitchell said. When Dr. Fajgenbaum’s brain started slowing down, Dr. Mitchell said, the severity of the illness sunk in. “I would ask him a simple question, and he would answer in a couple words, like 30 seconds to a minute later,” he said. Dr. Mitchell and the other medical students scoured textbooks and the internet, searching for clues. The top medical experts at Penn, meanwhile, were not having much more luck. Lymphoma was just one theory. Others thought it might be a severe case of lupus or even mononucleosis. But test after test was inconclusive. Finally, the doctors tried a huge dose of steroids. Slowly, his body began to fight its way back. His kidneys and liver began functioning again, and the extra fluid receded. Seven weeks after he was admitted, Dr. Fajgenbaum walked out of the hospital. It was September 2010. “I remember asking the doctor, saying, ‘What was this? ’” he said. “And I remember the doctor saying, ‘We don’t know what it was, but let’s just hope it doesn’t come back. ’” It took only one month for symptoms to come rushing back, while he was convalescing at his childhood home in Raleigh, N. C. Doctors there shipped a piece of his lymph node to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, where pathologists finally pinpointed his disease. The condition, called Castleman disease, was so rare that doctors at the hospital in Raleigh had no experience with it. Castleman disease had been known since the 1950s but has remained largely a mystery. A hallmark of the condition is enlarged lymph nodes, and most people with the disease  —   about    —   have a form that affects just one part of the body and can usually be cured through surgery. The form ravaging Dr. Fajgenbaum’s body  —   multicentric Castleman disease  —   is even more rare and deadly. Only about 1, 200 to 1, 500 people are discovered to have it every year in the United States. It defied classification, occupying a no man’s land between cancer and immune disease. Doctors weren’t sure of the cause in patients like him: Some believed it was a type of cancer, while others thought it was an inherited genetic disorder, or was triggered by a virus. One thing was clear: The disease was deadly. Only about 65 percent of people with the condition live for five years after it is diagnosed, studies have shown. Over the next few years, Dr. Fajgenbaum alternated between extended periods of relative health and frightening relapses. His condition stumped even leading experts in the disease, people like Dr. Frits van Rhee of Little Rock, Ark. who has treated the largest number of patients  —   about 100  —   with Castleman. The tools that Dr. van Rhee and others had were blunt and harmful in their own right. More than once, Dr. Fajgenbaum underwent a devastating,   course of chemotherapy that annihilated his immune system in an effort to knock his disease into remission. Dr. Fajgenbaum was also granted emergency access to siltuximab, a drug that Johnson  Johnson was developing for people with his form of multicentric Castleman disease, which would  be approved in 2014. That year, in 2011, Dr. van Rhee secured a rare exception to try it on Dr. Fajgenbaum. But the drug, like other previous treatments, did not work. Dr. Fajgenbaum was undaunted. With the zeal he once devoted to   a personal best  —   375 pounds, reached six months before he first fell ill  —   he dove into the scientific research on Castleman disease and began to familiarize himself with the world’s top experts. On Sundays, his roommate tried to coax Dr. Fajgenbaum out of his bedroom, with its white board covered in notes, organizational plans tacked to the wall. He rarely succeeded. “I’m on the couch watching TV, and Dave is just cranking away on Castleman,” Dr. Mitchell recalled. The more Dr. Fajgenbaum learned, he said, the more he realized how much the field that studied Castleman was in disarray. Researchers focusing on the disease used different terminology to describe the condition, making it difficult to compare published work. Leading experts weren’t in regular communication, and studies were being done over again, even though previous ones had failed. “It became just abundantly clear that just because you have smart people thinking about a problem doesn’t mean that it’s coordinated at all,” he said. One of the people he called was Dr. Thomas Uldrick, a clinical researcher at the National Cancer Institute who had studied multicentric Castleman disease. The two struck up a correspondence. “Clearly he was a very bright medical student, and he was scared of dying from this disease,” Dr. Uldrick recalled. He also began collaborating with Dr. van Rhee, who knew that Dr. Fajgenbaum was a different kind of patient after he arrived armed with charts, graphs, timelines and slide presentations. “There are patients who keep meticulous records,” Dr. van Rhee said with a chuckle, “but he was definitely in the top 1 percent. ” In spring 2013 Dr. Fajgenbaum earned his medical degree, and a few months later he entered the Wharton School at Penn, reasoning that, to solve the tangled mystery of Castleman disease, business smarts would serve him well. But in December of that year he got sick again, with his blood platelets dropping so low that he barely avoided a fatal brain bleed. This time, though, he was able to use his relapse to further his search for a cure. For months, Dr. Fajgenbaum had been collecting weekly blood samples that served as snapshots of his immune system, tabulating the results in a spreadsheet and adding them to a detailed slide presentation that he had been preparing since he received the diagnosis. And when it was clear the disease had returned, he persuaded his doctors to remove a piece of a lymph node, test it and save it for future research. After a round of chemotherapy, he improved enough to be discharged and started looking into what secrets the tests might reveal. It turned out that five months before he started noticing symptoms in December, his T cells  —   one of the key weapons in the body’s immune arsenal  —   had starting activating, preparing for a fight even though there was no apparent threat. Then, about three months before his relapse, he noticed that he had started producing more VEGF, a protein that instructs the body to make more blood vessels, and is another sign of an immune system gearing up. These two hints gave him an idea: Maybe the problem was with one of the body’s communication lines, the one that triggered production of VEGF and also told the T cells to begin activating. If Dr. Fajgenbaum could get his body to shut down that communication line  —   known as the mTOR pathway  —   he might be able to stop his immune system from overreacting and prevent a relapse. The discovery was exhilarating. “I felt like I was part of steering the ship,” Dr. Fajgenbaum said. “This time I was part of this team. ” With this major clue in hand, he and his doctors turned to potential treatments, existing drugs that were known to shut down the mTOR pathway. The one that seemed the best option was practically hiding in plain sight. Sirolimus, also known as Rapamune, was commonly given to kidney transplant patients to prevent their bodies from rejecting the organ. The drug had been on the market for years and was known to have few serious side effects. “I wouldn’t think I ever could have prescribed this to another patient, or told a patient to try it, because we just didn’t have very much data,” Dr. Fajgenbaum said. “But at this stage, I’d had four episodes, and I’d failed everything the doctors had ever given me. ” In choosing to become his own test subject, Dr. Fajgenbaum was following a long line of medical researchers who have experimented on themselves. At the turn of the 20th century, government researchers studying yellow fever in Cuba allowed themselves to be bitten by mosquitoes who harbored the disease one researcher caught the fever and died. In 1929, Dr. Werner Forssmann inserted a catheter into the vein of his arm and guided it to his heart to prove that the procedure worked (he shared in a Nobel Prize for his work in 1956). As recently as 2005, Dr. Barry Marshall won the Nobel after drinking a broth infected with bacteria to prove that it caused ulcers. This activist approach, Dr. Uldrick said, did not sit well with everyone. “There was some tension between the various doctors about who was driving the boat,” he said. But the idea that Dr. Fajgenbaum needed to try something new was unanimous: Chemotherapy had worked three times, but the powerful drugs take a heavy toll and can themselves cause cancer if given too often. Dr. Fajgenbaum eventually prevailed. In January 2014, he stopped taking his old cancer drugs and started on sirolimus. Six months passed, then a year. The weekly blood tests showed that his immune system was returning to normal. Dr. Fajgenbaum, his health improving, returned to the other challenges that were hampering progress in the field of Castleman disease. He started the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network, a nonprofit whose mission was to prioritize and coordinate research into the disease, which operates out of the Perelman School of Medicine at Penn. Dr. Fajgenbaum, an assistant professor of medicine at the school, and his collaborators assembled an advisory panel of the world’s experts in the disease and set an agenda for answering the most pressing questions. First on the list is figuring out the cause: Is the disease genetic, a form of cancer or caused by a virus? As always, the work is intensely personal. Last summer, he drove to Allentown, Pa. to collect a blood sample from a patient with Castleman disease. He placed the vials in his vest pocket, explaining that he needed to keep the blood warm so the tests he had planned would work properly. “You remind me of a mother hen,” the patient said with a laugh. That gave him an idea: Dr. Fajgenbaum sat on the vials as he drove two hours back to Philadelphia, the car heater cranked up to ensure they were warm. It was a sweaty ride back, but worth it. “These samples are precious,” he said. In medical research, discoveries come slowly and take twists and turns that no one saw coming. Seasoned researchers have learned to rein in their optimism and to know that true breakthroughs can take years, if not decades, to realize. Not Dr. Fajgenbaum. “I almost wish that every disease had a David to be a part of the charge,” said Dr. Mary Jo Lechowicz, a professor at the Emory University School of Medicine, who has studied Castleman disease and serves on the network’s advisory board. Dr. Fajgenbaum’s   mission to take on his own disease is also typical of the   world, said Max Bronstein, the chief advocacy and science policy officer at the EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases in Novato, Calif. “A lot of    patient organizations emerge to take on these huge challenges in rare diseases,” he said. “I don’t think there’s one correct model for each disease there’s been so many different approaches. ” Last month, Dr. Fajgenbaum marked his   anniversary since starting on sirolimus, a period more than twice as long as any of his other remissions. “I feel 100 percent,” he said. These days, Dr. Fajgenbaum, now 31, walks through the hallways of Penn’s medical center, his frame again projecting the easy confidence of the athlete he once was. But he jokes that he would have to pull out photos of his days as a quarterback to explain to people why his friends still call him the Beast. Now, he said, every time he tries to exercise, his mind wanders back to an email he needs to write or a call he needs to make. “It’s not because I don’t have the energy to do it it’s because all of my energy is going toward this disease,” he said. Not everyone is convinced that sirolimus is what has been keeping him healthy. Dr. van Rhee noted that while the results in Dr. Fajgenbaum are promising, his is just one case and treatments need to be proven in many more people. “I think the finding is very interesting,” he said, “but we need to see whether a similar mechanism is active in other patients. ” But Dr. Fajgenbaum said he grew more confident every day that it is the drug that is helping. He has begun sharing his experience with more doctors and researchers, is conducting laboratory tests to see if the drug is likely to work in other patients and has started writing an article about his experience for a medical journal. Soon, he hopes, doctors will begin prescribing the drug to other patients. Dr. Fajgenbaum is optimistic about the drug’s chances but is aware medical science is unpredictable. “Who knows maybe it will work for only a small percentage,” he said. “So we’ve still got a lot of work ahead of us. ” He now oversees the network’s research from his office in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, five floors above the emergency room where he first learned his body was falling apart. It is also the same building where he spent weeks in the I. C. U. so sick that he said his final goodbyes to friends and family. At first, when he learned his office would be in the same building, he felt anxious, unsure if he wanted the constant reminder of the ordeal he had endured. A few months ago, Dr. Fajgenbaum was called to the I. C. U. to meet a patient who had just found out he had Castleman disease. He spoke to the patient about enrolling him in a new study, and as he looked out the window, realized the view looked familiar. On his way out, he bumped into a nurse who remembered him. She noted that he had stayed in the same room as a patient. Ultimately, he said, he is glad for the proximity. “I didn’t think that I would ever get to leave the hospital, and now here I am, fighting back,” he said. “It’s the ultimate motivator. ”"

In my last post, “Expensive Energy Kills Poor People” , I spoke of the women of Lesotho. In the comments someone asked what I would recommend that they do regarding electricity.
For me, there are two separate questions about the provision of electricity. One is cities and the grid. The other, and for me, more important question regards the folks living in places the grid may not reach for decades. For example, Steven Mosher pointed me to a quote that says of Lesotho (emphasis mine):

The majority of the population (76%) lives in rural areas, but has strong links to urban centres in both Lesotho and neighbouring South Africa. The majority of these villages lack electricity and the probability of connecting them to grid electricity in the foreseeable future is very low. Grid electricity, being a commercial form of energy, requires users to have a regular income. The income levels in rural areas are generally lower than those in urban areas due to higher unemployment and underemployment levels.
Those are the kind of people who I’ve worked among in the developing world, people way off the grid, the type of people who I met when I was in Lesotho. What can we offer them in the way of electricity, the most adaptable and useful form of energy?
I’ve spent hundreds and hundreds of hours running the numbers on the economics of renewable energy of various kinds in the village. I used to teach the subject to starry-eyed Peace Corps Volunteers. Heck, you know how they say “he wrote the manual” on something? Well … I actually did …
Figure 1. Peace Corp Training Manual T-25. The ERIC Metadata says: This document was prepared as a training manual for people interested in developing appropriate technological approaches to using wind power to pump water. The training program is divided into two basic formats, one in which a session focuses on the design process and participants are expected to do some design work in groups, and another which uses a preselected design and does not include the design process. Besides providing sets of training guidelines and objectives, the manual describes training sessions which deal with: (1) the history of wind systems;2) large projects and community analysis; (3) shop safety and tool care; (4) representative drawings for construction; (5) shafts and bearings; (6) strengths and testing; … etc. etc.
I bring this up to highlight that I’m not an armchair theoretician about these matters, and that I’ve worked extensively in the somewhat arcane field of village-level use of renewable energy.  So as you might imagine, I’ve thought long and hard about how to provide inexpensive electricity to the poor.
And curiously, the answer presented itself when I was in Paraguay about thirty years ago. I was there to once again put on the wind-power training that is laid out in my manual above. I was out in the outback with a driver going to look at potential wind-power sites, when I saw someone come out of the selva, the local low forest. He was driving a mule hitched to a cart.
And in the cart were a half-dozen auto batteries. I asked the driver what that was about, and I was surprised by the reply.
He told me that the batteries would be owned by several homes and farms far away from the road. There were no power lines anywhere along the road, of course, we were a long ways from the grid. He said the driver would leave the car batteries there by the side of the road, and a truck going to a nearby sawmill would pick them up. At the sawmill, which also wasn’t on the grid, for a small fee the batteries would be charged from the generator powering the sawmill. Then they underwent the same process in reverse. The truck brought them to the mule track, and the mule man took them back to the farms and ranches. There, they used them for power until they were run down.
Brilliant!, I thought. These jokers aren’t letting a little hardship get in the way of having electricity in their homes.
Later, I was talking to a local schoolteacher in Spanish, she had no English. She said that she’d noticed that the kids from the houses with electricity did better than those from the other homes. I asked what the people used the electricity for. Lighting and television, she said. Television? I asked, mystified, thinking that could only stunt their minds.
Yes, she said, they are the only ones who ever hear about the outside world. They’re the only ones who have a bigger vision, of something beyond the selva.
Dang, I thought. That’s how we can power the hinterlands until the grid arrives.
And over the years, I refined that idea into what I call the PowerHouse School concept. I almost got the agreements and the money to do it in the Solomon Islands, but then the government changed, and the tide went against me. Ah, well, the idea still lives. Here’s the elevator speech:
The PowerHouse School is a ten-foot shipping container that is set up to recharge 12-volt automobile batteries and cell phones, using whatever renewable sources are available locally—solar, small-scale wind, micro-hydro, or some combination of all three. It would be run as a for-profit battery-charging business by a school, with the children being trained in the operation, care, and maintenance of the equipment and the charging and feeding of the batteries. It would also sell (by order only, no stock in hand) a variety of 12- and 24-volt lights, equipment and tools. The older students would also be taught the business side of the operation—keeping the books, maintaining the supplies, figuring the profits and losses. Any excess power would be used by the school itself, for lighting classrooms and powering electronics.
The advantages of the PowerHouse School concept are:
• The education about how to use (and more importantly how to maintain) the technology is provided along with the technology.
• The homeowner is not expected to purchase ($$$) the charging system (solar panels, etc.).
• More importantly, the homeowner is not expected to maintain the charging system.
• Students will be trained to do the business side as well as the technical side , supporting entrepreneurship.
• There is no monthly cost to the homeowner. It’s purely pay-as-you-go. This allows participation by those without regular income.
• It uses existing technology.
• It can be sized appropriately, and increased incrementally (one additional solar panel or storage battery at a time).
Finally, it fulfills my own First Law of Rural Development, which states:
If it doesn’t pay … it doesn’t stay.
In other words, if someone can’t make a profit implementing your whiz-bang idea for improving the lives of the poor, your scheme will go to an early grave.
So that was the plan. Never implemented. The numbers sort of worked in the Solomon Islands, it could have turned a profit … if you were creative about the funding of the capital costs. The problem is that you’re looking at some thousands of US$ to set one up, and that would take a while to pay off. Should be doable, solar panels have a long lifetime, as do schools, and the sun is free. But some combination of a bit of grant funds and perhaps a long-term loan might have to be provided.
Regarding the micro-hydro aspect, there are several designs for hydroelectric systems using heavy-duty truck alternators. These put out about a hundred amps at twelve volts, so that’s about a kilowatt. The only issue is moving that power at 14 volts is a problem because you need a big wire size at low voltage. But in fact, they put out three-phase AC, so all you need is to pop out the rectifier that converts the three-phase AC to DC. Then run the AC into a three-phase transformer, and jack it up as high-voltage as you need, depending on the distance. Run your wires from the transformer to the PowerHouse, where you transform it back down to 14 volts, and then run it through the rectifier you removed from the alternator …
Like I said, I’ve put some thought into the question. That’s the best answer that I’ve come up with about how to provide the benefits of electricity to the hinterlands where the grid won’t arrive for many, many years.
Your comment, suggestions, and criticisms welcome,

"The videotaped sucker punch that staggered the white nationalist Richard Spencer on Inauguration Day quickly inspired mockery on social media. But it echoed loudly in an escalating confrontation between extreme ends of the political spectrum. With   groups edging into the mainstream with the rise of President Trump,     and anarchists are vowing to confront them at every turn, and by any means necessary  —   including violence. In Berkeley, Calif. on Wednesday night, masked protesters set fires, smashed windows and stormed buildings on the campus of the University of California to shut down a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos, an inflammatory Breitbart News editor and a   provocateur already barred from Twitter. Five people were injured, administrators canceled the event, and the university police locked down the campus for hours. That followed a bloody melee in Seattle on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, when   demonstrators  —   their faces concealed to minimize the risk of arrest  —   tried to prevent a speech by Mr. Yiannopoulos at the University of Washington, and a      was shot and seriously wounded by a supporter of Mr. Yiannopoulos. The outbreaks of destruction and violence since Mr. Trump’s inauguration have earned contempt from Republicans  —   including Trump supporters who say it is exactly why they voted for his promises of law and order  —   and condemnation from Democrats like Berkeley’s mayor, Jesse Arreguín. He called Wednesday’s display “contrary to progressive values” and said it “provided the ultranationalist far right exactly the images they want” to try to discredit peaceful protesters of Mr. Trump’s policies. But anarchists and   who often make up a small but disproportionately   portion of protesters, defend the mayhem they create as a necessary response to an emergency. “Yes, what the black bloc did last night was destructive to property,” Eric Laursen, a writer in Massachusetts who has helped publicize anarchist protests, said, using another name for the   demonstrators. “But do you just let someone like Milo go wherever he wants and spread his hate? That kind of argument can devolve into ‘just sit on your hands and wait for it to pass.’ And it doesn’t. ” Anarchists also say their recent efforts have been wildly successful, both by focusing attention on their most urgent argument  —   that Mr. Trump poses a fascist threat  —   and by enticing others to join their movement. “The number of people who have been showing up to meetings, the number of meetings, and the number of   plans for future actions is through the roof,” Legba Carrefour, who helped organize the   Disrupt J20 protests on Inauguration Day in Washington, said in an interview. “Gained 1, 000 followers in the last week,” trumpeted @NYCAntifa, an   Twitter account in New York, on Jan. 24. “Pretty crazy for us as we’ve been active for many years with minimal attention. SMASH FASCISM!” The movement even claims to be finding adherents far afield of major population centers. A participant in CrimethInc, a   anarchist network, pointed to rising attendance at its meetings and activity cropping up in new places like Omaha. “The Left ignores us. The Right demonizes us,” the anarchist website It’s Going Down boasted on Twitter. “Everyday we grow stronger. ” Little known to practitioners of mainstream American politics, militant   make up a secretive culture closely associated with anarchists. Both reject social hierarchies as undemocratic and eschew the political parties as hopelessly corrupt, according to interviews with a dozen anarchists around the country. While some anarchists espouse nonviolence, others view property damage and even physical attacks on the far right as important tactics. While extreme   groups have been enthusiastic supporters of Mr. Trump,   express deep disdain for the Democratic Party. And it is mutual, by and large: They amount to the left’s unwanted revolutionary stepchild, disowned for their tactics and ideology by all but the most radical politicians. Anarchists came to the fore in 1999, when they mounted a huge demonstration in Seattle against the World Trade Organization, which they denounce  —   along with Nafta and other   pacts  —   as a plutocratic   group that exploits the poor. Enthusiasm for the movement dipped after the election of President Barack Obama. But it revived as they played a role in some of the most consequential protests during his two terms, starting Occupy Wall Street and serving as foot soldiers in demonstrations against the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock in North Dakota and in Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, Mo. and elsewhere. “We’ve had an enormous cultural and political impact,” said David Graeber, a professor at the London School of Economics who helped organize the Occupy protests and has been credited with coining its “we are the 99 percent” slogan. He said the movement had elevated income inequality to the top of the Democratic political agenda, despite not electing anyone or enacting any legislation. But he said Mr. Trump’s victory had proved that anarchists’ diagnosis of society’s ills was correct. “We tried to warn you, with Occupy,” Dr. Graeber said. “We understood that people were sick of the political system, which is fundamentally corrupt. People want something radically different. ” Mr. Trump’s tirades against trade deals, globalization and a Washington elite he views as corrupt mirror arguments that anarchists have been making for decades. But his claim that he alone can fix America’s problems flies in the face of anarchists’ conviction that only direct action by ordinary people can produce a fair system. “Fascism fetishizes having a strong leader who is decisive and tells everyone what to do,” Mr. Laursen, the writer, said. “That’s what we are seeing with Trump. ” Fueled in part by Mr. Trump’s political success, violent clashes between the far right and far left erupted several times during the presidential campaign. In Anaheim, Calif. last February, three people were stabbed in a brawl after   disrupted a Ku Klux Klan rally. And in Sacramento in June, at least five people were stabbed and eight wounded when hundreds of counterprotesters, including   clashed with skinheads at a rally. But the confrontations seemed to shift into a new gear on the eve of Mr. Trump’s inauguration. On Jan. 19,   tried to block the entrance to the “DeploraBall,” a party for Trump supporters. The next day, 230 people were arrested after anarchists dressed in black broke the windows of a bank with baseball bats and set a limousine on fire. (Mr. Spencer, the white nationalist, whose assailant was not arrested, was not the only person struck: A videographer was struck in the chest with a flagpole  —   he was unharmed  —   as he tried to interview marching anarchists about what the word “community” meant to them.) One of those arrested, a   anarchist who insisted on anonymity to avoid aiding in his own prosecution, said the goal of the protests  —   to get television stations to cut away from the inauguration, even for a moment  —   had been met. “Certainly, it has brought more attention to people who were against Trump and what he stands for,” the man said by telephone. The question now is whether anarchists’ efforts against Mr. Trump  —   whether merely colorful and spirited, or lawless and potentially lethal  —   will earn their fringe movement a bigger presence in the battle of ideas in years to come. “It’s true that a lot of people who consider themselves liberals or progressives still cling to the idea that you can effect social and economic change in the context of the state, through electoral politics,” Mr. Laursen said. “But more and more, it is going to become necessary for people on the left to think like anarchists if they are going to get anywhere. ” If the Berkeley disturbances have invited widespread denunciations, the   punch of Mr. Spencer inflamed emotions on both the left and the right wing. Mr. Spencer has offered a reward for anyone who can identify his attacker, who wore the telltale clothing and   of the anarchist “black bloc. ” But anarchists in Philadelphia have already begun raising funds for the man’s legal defense should he ever be caught. Under the hashtag #PunchRichardSpencerAgain,   and anarchists across the country are vowing to continue the fight. “May all your punches hit Nazis,” read a headline on It’s Going Down on Sunday. A few days earlier, the website gleefully announced on Twitter that Mr. Spencer was planning a tour of college campuses, adding, “Everyone will get their chance!”"
"What does it mean to “dress like a woman”? Social media users took it upon themselves to answer that very question in response to a report that President Trump wants women who work for him to look a certain way. The sentiment was anonymously cited in the new newsletter Axios from Mike Allen, a former Politico reporter. In response, Twitter erupted with a stream of photos showing women dressed for the jobs they hold and the lives they lead, as firefighters, soldiers, police officers and astronauts, to name a few. But while many of the tweets were aimed at rejecting the idea that women should be restricted to some narrow sartorial category, the “dress like a woman” phrase,   as a hashtag, didn’t come directly from Mr. Trump. In his newsletter, Mr. Allen attributed the phrase this way: In an email on Friday afternoon, Mr. Allen declined to offer any further details. It’s clear that appearances matter to the president. Mr. Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe Organization, has come under harsh criticism for rating women’s appearances on a scale of one to 10 and for hurling insults at female critics. As a candidate, he readily attacked when people commented on the size of his hands or on his hair. Like presidents past, Mr. Trump will most likely have some influence over style in the West Wing. The White House does not have an official dress code, according to its Press Office, but every administration has its own norms. For the past two decades, wardrobes have tended to be more relaxed in Democratic administrations. Under President Clinton, “aides frequently attended meetings in jeans and ” The New York Times reported in 2001. President George W. Bush restored formality to the West Wing, but President Obama was so relaxed that he broke with protocol, foregoing a suit jacket on his first full day in the Oval Office. If the pattern holds, dressing for work in the West Wing could become more formal under the Trump administration. Whether that means women would be required to “dress like women” remains to be seen."
"The Conservative Party apparently plans to introduce a moratorium on future onshore wind farms from 2020, hanging their hat on the growth of offshore wind instead, and following Germany’s lead by expanding solar power. The Royal Academy of Engineering this month completed a study into wind energy which compared estimates for capacity growth for onshore and offshore wind, and estimates of cost. The reported findings are that Britain will have around 13GW of onshore wind by 2020, rising to 22GW by 2030. As onshore wind is expected to cost around £90 per megawatt-hour and offshore wind £140, ending the possibility of further onshore developments could be expected to add at least £1 billion per year to consumer electricity bills by 2030. Whether voters think it will be worth paying perhaps an extra £50 per year per household to avoid onshore wind farms is not a question engineers can answer. This hardly tallies with the prime minister’s claim upon the coalition taking power in 2010, to want to be the “greenest government ever”, something he described as “a very simple ambition and one that I’m absolutely committed to achieving”. There must surely be doubts that he understood the magnitude of the commitment. Nicholas Stern’s review in 2006 identified the costs of ignoring climate change and described it as a case of market failure. Initially British politicians responded to the threat of climate change by adopting very demanding targets for CO2 reduction – but for well into the future, by which time all serving politicians would have retired. When the bill that became the Climate Change Act 2008 was laid before parliament, the target was for a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050. A few weeks before the final reading, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report recommended an 80% reduction, and this was adopted by the Labour government, but with negligible debate over whether it was achievable. Some light was shed on achievability by another report in 2010. The Royal Academy of Engineering study analysed the options for attaining that 2050 target and concluded: “Turning the theoretical emissions reduction targets into reality will require more than political will: it will require nothing short of the biggest peacetime programme of change ever seen in the UK.” In the past four years, it has been difficult to identify either the political will, or the public acceptance of the likely implications – or indeed any great programme of change. The UK has some of the best wind resources in Europe, and besides the decarbonisation benefits that wind energy would offer, onshore wind is a fairly substantial industry, supporting (in 2011) more than 8,600 jobs and contributing more than £500m to the UK economy. With continued growth, by 2020 that could total 11,600 direct and supply chain jobs. The Tories’ mooted policy change would put that growth at risk. The government’s plan to increase the amount of solar power to 20GW by 2023, concentrated on small and medium installations – such as on the roofs of schools, hospitals and government buildings, could be an even greater challenge. These would feed into the distribution system (the consumer end) rather than into the high-voltage grid (the power generation end), as would conventional power stations or “agricultural-scale” solar farms. The load on the electricity system on a bright summer morning can be as low as 25GW, which could be completely provided by solar panels and wind turbines. Maintaining stability of the grid relies on having large power stations which renewables can lock onto. Moving to a situation where, at certain times of the year, the load could be  supplied entirely by renewables would require a complete rethinking of the way the electricity system is controlled. This would be possible, but it would be very different from what we have at present, and it is not something that can be introduced in five years on the basis of a few ministerial statements.  We also have to remember that the peak demand for electricity is early evenings in December, at which point solar panels would provide next to nothing. Nuclear power stations would be needed, but given the economics of nuclear power and the long time required to start up or shut down a power station, how these could be integrated into a national power supply largely driven by solar power and offshore wind is not simple. In fact it is more than “not simple”; it is a system that has yet to be achieved anywhere in the world. It’s easy to be critical of the analysis that has (or may not have) gone into the evolution of present energy policies, but this is part of a long term trend. Over the past 40 years we have seen energy policy switching between leaning heavily towards nuclear power (1970s and 80s), through a “dash for gas” (1990s), a nuclear-free, renewables-only policy (2000s), back to nuclear (under the coalition, leading to Hinkley Point C), and now swinging again between wind and solar. In 1974, Lord Carrington was secretary of state for energy. Since then, responsibility for energy policy has passed through the hands of 20 secretaries of state. During 2013, the largest proportion of electricity (41%) was from coal-fired power stations, all of which were of sufficient vintage to have been operating in  Carrington’s era. Energy infrastructure has an investment horizon of at least 40 years. This, and the decisions that must be made to bring about investment, is incompatible with energy policy that can be reversed every couple of years. Energy policy is simply too important to be left to short-term political expediency. If we are to meet the trilemma of affordability, sustainability and security, we will need carefully considered plans that, with cross-party support, will outlast at least a dozen energy ministers."
"The head of the UK’s largest fund manager has criticised the UK government for creating “confusion” around the country’s climate commitments by prioritising projects such as expanding Heathrow airport and pushing ahead with HS2. Nigel Wilson said government priorities were “not necessarily consistent” with climate crisis objectives and sending mixed messages to investors and the financial services industry.  During a webinar focused on financial climate risks on Monday, Wilson said: “The government has to become a collaborative partner. At the moment the mandates on what they want to do, and what they want to spend their money on, are not always aligned with climate change at all, [and] send all sorts of confusing messages. “The highest-priority projects, these seem to be Heathrow and HS2 [and] those are not necessarily consistent with the climate objectives … and this creates confusion amongst our staff and our customers.” Wilson’s comments targeted two of the most controversial infrastructure projects on the government agenda. They come months after plans for a third runway at Heathrow were deemed illegal by the court of appeal. Judges ruled in February ministers did not take into account government commitments to tackle the climate crisis. The comments also come weeks after anti-HS2 protesters embarked on a 200km (125 mile) protest march to highlight the damage they said the high speed rail project will inflict on wildlife and woodland. But while the Legal & General boss has been a long-time sceptic of mega-projects such as Heathrow, Hinkley Point C and HS2, he has often raised concerns about their practical delivery rather than their environmental impact. A spokesman for Wilson said the money would be better spent on smaller projects, which are easier to fund, can be completed in a shorter timeframe and have clearer economic and climate benefits. They include intra-city transport, electric vehicle infrastructure and housing retrofitting, that would boost jobs and cut emissions. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “We have an ambitious target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and we are developing a transport decarbonisation plan to set out how we will achieve this.”  Wilson’s criticisms were aired during a webinar on Monday that marked the launch of the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) guide, spearheaded by the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority. The project is meant to help banks, insurers and asset managers navigate the looming threats of the climate crisis. Wilson, who chaired the CFRF’s work on innovation, said firms should be thinking of creative ways to tackle global heating. For example, mortgage providers should consider energy costs and a home’s energy performance certificate (EPC) when assessing mortgage affordability, he said."

North Korean officials were set to gather with private American experts for unofficial talks this week in New York, but the Trump administration refused to issue visas for the North’s top representative. So no talks.



What does the administration believe it achieved by blocking the meeting?



Of course, the State Department refused to comment. One can only assume that it acted in response to Pyongyang’s recent missile test and apparent assassination of Kim Jong‐​nam, the older half‐​brother of North Korea’s leader. But cutting off talks hurts America as much as, if not more than, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. After all, the latter is used to being isolated.



The DPRK appears committed to being a nuclear state. Its missile and nuclear programs steadily expanded while the Obama administration largely refused to have contact. Estimates are fraught with uncertainty, but the North may have enough nuclear material for around twenty nuclear weapons today and in just a few years could be able to deploy an arsenal of as many as one hundred weapons.





Get used to it, America. North Korea’s latest missile test was just another day at the office.



At the same time, Pyongyang is proceeding to develop intercontinental missiles. At some point in the not too distant future, the DPRK will be able to miniaturize warheads and place them on missiles capable of hitting targets in America. Refusing to engage won’t make that prospect go away. Instead, it will maximize the fear, antagonism and pugnaciousness which have characterized North Korean policy for years.



As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump posited the possibility of meeting the DPRK’s Kim Jong‐​un, a stance he reiterated last week, but the Trump administration may believe it to be premature to take any initiative toward the North. Indeed, with virtually no one home at the State Department other than Secretary Rex Tillerson and professional staff, it’s not clear who could propose and implement policy toward the North. However, in this case, the administration need do nothing other than issue visas for visiting North Koreans.



The Trump administration, and certainly the United States, gain nothing by preventing private Americans from meeting with North Korean officials. The so‐​called track 1.5 talks (track two talks normally involve nongovernmental participants on both sides) were organized by Donald Zagoria of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy and would have involved Victor Cha, Robert Gallucci and other seasoned Korea hands. Similar talks have occurred in the past, but these would be the first in America since 2011.



The North Korean delegation was to include Choe Son‐​hui, head of the American affairs bureau at the DPRK Foreign Ministry. She has previously met with Americans and remains influential in Pyongyang’s uncertain political climate.



The purpose of the meeting was to unofficially explore possible options for defusing crises, solving problems and improving relations. Policymakers could pick up any ideas which seemed to have promise.



No one was predicting a breakthrough. The North’s latest missile test was routine, just another day in the office, so to speak, in Pyongyang. The mid‐​range missile was nothing new and couldn’t reach America.



However, the decision to use a deadly nerve agent to kill a member of the ruling family in a public area of an airport in the capital of a friendly state was an extraordinary breach of international norms. It showed callous disregard for the lives of the traveling public and a willingness to abandon even the pretense of restraint.



Moreover, add to Kim Jong-nam’s assassination the newly reported execution of state security officials in Pyongyang. This suggests a leadership that is fearful, not secure. It might be as ill‐​prepared as the Trump administration.



Nevertheless, time and effort could yield some progress. Almost certainly, time and effort would be necessary to achieve even modest progress. Thus, the sooner contacts occur, the better. Indeed, with the Trump administration unready to act, this is a particularly good time for private initiatives.



But there will be no talks this time. So the North Korean horror show will continue regardless of bad reviews. In another couple of months, the North may add another nuclear weapon, warns Siegfried Hecker of Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation. And another after that. And after that.



Everyone is concerned about the DPRK. No one has any good ideas for how to dissolve tensions. Military strikes could lead to full‐​scale war. Sanctions have so far been a dead end. China isn’t inclined to destroy its ally and hand Washington, DC a geopolitical victory. The Trump administration’s choices seem to come down to hoping for a change of policy or a miracle—perhaps a North Korean Moses to let loose a modern plague or two on the North.



There is no obvious answer as to what will work. But despite the understandable reluctance to appear to acknowledge the Kim regime by opening communication channels, engagement shouldn’t be seen as a reward. It’s simply what states do with other states, irrespective of their opinions of one another.



Certainly, talking isn’t likely to make the problem worse, and it appears to be the only path that moves forward. Although where it would ultimately lead, no one knows.



In any case, Washington shouldn’t stand in the way of private discussions with Pyongyang. Doing so isn’t going to make the North any more pliant. And tossing aside what might have been used by Kim to open a dialogue could make him less likely to respond in the future.



North Korea is the land of bad‐​policy options. Washington shouldn’t make the problem worse. The United States and DPRK need more communication, not less.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn 2014, Germany and parts of Europe will be seeing their warmest year ever since temperature recording began in earnest late in the 19th century. The media and alarmists are giddy about this, even though most of it is due to a global weather pattern that worked to deliver an almost steady stream of warm southerly air over the continent: especially early this year, over the autumn, and the end of the year. It’s all pattern related.
Moreover, as the warmists like to say when cold strikes, it’s just one year and does not in any way represent a trend.
Not long ago some climate scientists announced winters with snow would be a thing of the past in Europe. Global warming, they said, would be especially noticeable in the wintertime. But then in the late 2000s and early 2010s, a string of harsh winters gripped the old continent and the trend in Germany went downhill: colder and snowier winters.
Veteran journalist Ulli Kulke of Germany’s national daily Die Welt writes at his blog that the tendency over the last two and half decades – since before the first IPCC report was ever issued – has been slight cooling and no warming to speak of. He writes of Germany’s winters:
The winters between 2001 and 2010 were on average 0.1°C colder than the 1991 – 2000 decade. And the winters between 2011 and 2014 were also 0.1°C colder than the 2001-2010 decade. Even if we are talking only about tenths of a degree, the climate discussion is actually all about such magnitudes. So anyone who had the impression of hard winter times was not wrong. The tendency of winter temperatures has been downward over the past two and half decades, and not upwards. […] Snow has not disappeared.”
So with the general winter trend in Germany and Central Europe slightly downward, spooked climate scientists had to scramble to concoct an explanation. Kulke continues:

As the cold winters became undeniable, decisive institutes came up with the original idea of tracing the icy temperatures back to global warming. The reason for this was the disappearing Arctic sea ice around the North Pole. In a press release from the institute, Vladimir Petoukhov of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research is quoted as having stated concerning a study of his: Disturbances in air currents, caused by the disappearance of ice ‘could increase the probability of the occurrence of extremely cold winters in Europe and North Asia by a factor of three’. In summary: ‘Hard winters such as last year’s or 2005/06 do not contradict global warming, rather they more so confirm it.’“
The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research also presented a similar paper. The warming Arctic, Kulke explains, was supposed to alter the pressure difference between the Azores and Iceland, and thus produce more favorable conditions for cold winters to take hold over Europe. Kulke calls the logic behind the theory weak, writing that there’s a lot of controversy swirling around it, especially in view that it was produced after the fact.
Kulke’s piece in general points out that the theories of the global warming scientists are not doing well when compared to real observations. For example he ends his piece with a look at the Arctic and global temperatures:
In addition it is turning out that the Arctic sea ice may increase in size. And as before the time-out taken by the global temperature increase continues on. No one knows how long it’s going to go on, even if this year a high will be reached because of an El Nino.”
Another blow to the models.

English: Modeled post-glacial rebound based on data from the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites. These models are used to remove the post-glacial rebound signal from the GRACE data. They are given in a change in mass over change in time, in millimeters of water-density-equivalent (1000 kg/m^3) per year. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
NOTE: (I had this at the bottom of the post some people missed it so I moved it up to the top) I’m not convinced that this idea has any merit whatsoever, as I see more conventional reasons (like silting) for land recovery such as at Rome’s original harbor and in New York, but thought it was worth posting for the discussion that would ensue. Even bad science deserves to be discussed/disproven. See also a note below.  – Anthony
Isostacy is a major Geological error.
Guest essay by Richard Guy
The Governments of the United States and Canada are concerned about the ebbing water levels in the Great Lakes. For years the water levels in the great lakes and other lakes have been declining without any signs of ever returning to previous levels. The best news is that there is no hope that the water levels will ever return. The bad news is that we have our heads stuck in the sand dunes which have been created on the shores of the great lakes as they recede.
What we have also failed to notice is that the process is speeding up faster than our ability to grasp the reality. The fact is that this process of ebbing lake and water levels has been going on since pre history but we are just becoming aware of it as more and more shoreline inhabitants observe the phenomenon.  
Another major deterrent to our overall realization is that our  thought processes are hampered, among other things, by the media hype of rising sea levels and Post Glacial Rebound. Post Glacial Rebound is a geological error which has been foisted on us for a long time. It is time that we outlaw this false concept of Glacial Rebound and release a new era of exiting discoveries which have remained hidden by this mistaken premise.
Isostatic Rebound was introduced into Geological theology over one hundred years ago and it has lead us astray. This theory of Iostacy was based on an original error in deduction. The error in deduction was that the land rose from the sea. This original error was compounded when the theory of Post Glacial Rebound was built on it. This led us even further away from the truth.
We will never solve the disappearing water problem until we face the reality that we have been mislead by Iostacy.  We have to face this reality because this reality is now facing us: we are losing water all over the planet while we continue to harp on rising seas levels.
Once we abandon Isostatic Rebound we will see the reality of receding seas. This path will also lead us to other interesting discoveries such as why the seas recede.?  Once we accept that seas are receding that acceptance will automatically eliminate Post Glacial Rebound. There is no time to waste because our survival depends on this acceptance.
What is really occurring is that the sea levels have been falling from pre historic times. Rivers have been draining the land and the lakes since pre-historic times. As Sea levels fall lower and lower the draining process moves faster and faster and we lose our wetlands as more and more land is left behind by the receding seas. Sand dunes now line the shores of the great lakes where people used to swim and boats used to be moored. Many marinas have been deserted leaving boats stranded on sand bars.  This is also a cause of the amount of arid land which is increasing worldwide.

Graph from: http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/now/wlevels/dbd/
So it is wise at this stage to give the lie to rising sea levels and accept receding sea levels. This will not stop the water loss but it will make us understand what we have to do in order to preserve what little water we do have left.
New York is learning about receding seas because the marshes in Jamaica Bay are disappearing and drying up. New Jersey is dealing with the receding sea by selling off the new land left by the sea to Donald Trump and Playboy Hotels and Casinos. Donald Trump built his Taj Mahal Casino on these lands left by the receding sea.
Now that The State of New Jersey has discovered the land bonanza they are gaining as the sea recedes they have been looking over old survey maps to find out where the sea was back in 1776. They are proposing to claim retroactive taxes from landowners who have occupied these lands back to those historical times. They estimate that they have accumulated 830000 acres of land from the sea since 1776.  The State of New York can make a similar claim as it includes long Island the Sounds and Brooklyn Shorelines. An exhibition by the New York Library in 2010 showed the mapping of the New York shoreline over three hundred years. The entire New York coastline has gained a quarter mile of land over that period.
So when we see the water levels falling in the Great lakes that is only the tip of the iceberg. Those levels have been falling for a very long time and will continue to do so. If we want to get  a picture of what our earth will eventually look like just look at the face of the Planet Mars.
The first order of business is to get rid of the Isostatic Rebound theory and accept that our seas are receding as our planet expands. The sea is not rising. We will then see why our lakes are going dry. We will also understand that the only thing we can do about it is to keep dredging our waterways harbours and lakes to keep things moving.  That was all three Emperors of Rome could do to keep the Harbour at Ostia open: they were finally defeated. It took Nero, Trajan and Articus one hundred years of dredging before they gave up the fight against the receding sea. Today Ostia is three miles from the sea and twenty feet above sea level.
The Port Authority in New York is having to blast bedrock, for the first time, to keep the harbour channels open. The sea keeps getting shallower and the seagoing vessels keep getting larger. Ships keep demanding deeper depths.
Our Planet Earth is dynamic. It is a masterful creation not unlike other planets in the Cosmos.  The earth does not reveal her secrets readily and her secrets are often presented to us as a mirror image of what is really happening. So when we observe that land is rising it may just be a mirror image: our seas are receding.

UPDATE: for those who never read past the first few paragraphs to see my caveat, I’ve now moved it up top for better visibility.
Some people asked why I should publish “rubbish science” like this. The reason is the same that I often publish some “rubbish science”from climatology; it deserves ridicule for the ridiculous premise of the idea.
At some point, when the next ice age kicks in, we will start to see the seas recede. We are nowhere close to that.




The new land that Mr. Guy sees is from silting deposition. For example the delta of the Mississippi river continues to grow each year for that reason.
Plus, with GPS enabled altimetry systems, we can now actually measure isotasy changes. – Anthony

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is no joke, and tells us how far the German government is prepared to go in order to get its citizens to be nice to the climate.
Germany’s Ministry of Environment headed by socialist Barbara Hendricks has produced a series of video clips aimed at getting citizens to save energy, and thus do the climate good at the same time.
One clip shows a teenage girl coming home late one evening, quietly tip-toeing past the open door of a lit up living room, only to awkwardly catch her parents in the act. Embarrassed, the daughter turns off the lights.

A voice comes on:
The world says thanks. 5% less energy consumption in German households makes one coal power plant redundant. Together it’s climate protection.”
Some readers may ask if it’s customary for Germans to do it fully dressed. According to the video, it seems so. Perhaps the German Ministry of Environment has also decreed sex only in unheated rooms.
German ARD public television reports that the Ministry spent a total of 1.5 million taxpayer euros on producing the 30-second videos.
It really is amazing that bureaucrats are now telling citizens under what conditions to have sex: fully dressed, in a cold room with the lights on.

Another video shows an overweight man filling up his SUV with a jet ski in tow:

The message here, other than men being stupid fat pigs, is:
The climate says thanks. The climate is happy about every single bicycle ride.”
Another video shows a woman closing the window so she does not have to hear the sounds of her power-tool operating husband being eaten by zombies.

After she closes the window, a voice says:
The world says thank you. Stop leaving the windows open in the winter time. Airing out the house all at once for a short time is better for the climate.”
So not only does the room have to be dark and unheated, but the windows also must be closed when having sex (with all your clothes on) in Germany.
This is the nanny state at work. But here the nanny in charge obviously has really gone completely idiotic. Surely Chancellor Angela Merkel is relieved that these videos are not productions made by her CDU party.

"**Reggaeton artist Bad Bunny has stopped his European tour to protest against the governor of Puerto Rico.**
The artist - whose real name is Benito Ocasio - is expected to leave Ibiza to join the ongoing demonstrations against Ricardo RossellÃ³.
The news comes after leaked messages between Mr RossellÃ³ and members of his team revealed sexist and homophobic comments.
Bad Bunny praised the ""bravery"" of people in his native Puerto Rico.
""I want to pay my respects to all the people who have always had the bravery, courage and initiative to go out into the streets and fight for the sake of our country,"" the 25-year-old wrote on Instagram.
People in Puerto Rico, which has been an overseas US territory since 1898, have been protesting since the weekend.
Two officials have already resigned over the more than 800 pages of text chats from the encrypted messaging app Telegram, and Mr RossellÃ³ is facing calls to step down.
In one exchange, Chief Financial Officer Christian Sobrino makes expletive references to singer Ricky Martin.
Ricky tweeted: ""We cannot allow our Puerto Rico to be in the hands of such 'leaders'.""
Mr Sobrino and Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin are the two men who have resigned.
Playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose production of Hamilton on the island is mentioned in the chats, said the messages were ""a very disturbing portrait of how this administration operates"".
Though Mr RossellÃ³ has since apologised for the texts, there have been huge protests in the capital San Juan.
Many protestors have questioned Mr RossellÃ³'s handling of Hurricane Maria and the island's financial crisis as well.
Bad Bunny - who's worked with Cardi B and Drake - is now encouraging Puerto Ricans to join him on the streets on Wednesday to protest the governor.
""Don't stop yourself. We need to hit the streets. We cannot stop. I'm urging everyone to get out and protest,"" he said.
""The system for years, decades, has taught us to keep quiet. It has manipulated our opinions, the press, and it has made us believe anyone who protests is crazy or a criminal.
""I would love to see those who have never joined a protest to come out, without fear.""
Ricardo RossellÃ³ released a statement saying he respected the demonstrators, but he has not addressed the calls for his resignation.

"HOUSTON  —   Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan was named the N. F. L. ’s most valuable player on Saturday, 24 hours before he was to try to cap his superb season with Super Bowl glory. Ryan, 31, got his first M. V. P. Award by collecting 25 of the votes while his opposite number in Sunday’s Super Bowl, the New England Patriots’ Tom Brady, finished with 10. Brady has won the award twice, for the 2007 and 2010 seasons. Ryan’s award came after a dazzling season for Atlanta’s offense in which he finished with 4, 944 passing yards, 38 touchdowns and only seven interceptions. Super Bowl LI on Sunday will be his first appearance in the title game. Brady, who is chasing his fifth Super Bowl victory, finished the season with 3, 554 passing yards, 28 touchdowns and two interceptions but played in four fewer games than Ryan because of his Deflategate suspension. Unsurprisingly, Ryan also picked up the Offensive Player of the Year Award. Ryan had the best season of his career after spending last summer working intensively on his throwing motion at a Los Angeles training camp. He averaged slightly over nine yards per pass, the highest rate ever for a quarterback with more than 400 completions in a season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award went to the Oakland Raiders’ Khalil Mack, whose season included 11 sacks, five forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and an interception returned for a touchdown as the Raiders reached the playoffs. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was a surprise pick, ahead of his teammate Ezekiel Elliott, for offensive rookie of the year. Prescott, who played the entire season for Dallas after Tony Romo injured his back in the preseason, drew 28 of 50 votes, beating out Elliott, who finished as the   with 21 votes.

As we [recently reported on ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/wind-turbines-never-stop-being-rubbish/)_[The BFD](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/wind-turbines-never-stop-being-rubbish/)_ , wind turbines are a “renewable” energy source which creates a whole host of environmental problems of its own. Not only do the eco-crucifixes slaughter birds and bats on an industrial scale, they leave a shocking and enduring waste legacy behind when their short life-span runs out.



The other half of the terrible twosome of renewable energy, solar, isn’t any easier on the environment. Even more than wind, manufacturing solar panels leaves a gargantuan toxic waste legacy in its wake.



 **Disposing of them is just as toxic.**



For decades, the solar industry benefited from generous federal, state, and local subsidies to increase its footprint. Yet these generous subsidies ignore the costs of disposal of solar panel waste.



Things may be changing. In May 2018, Michael Shellenberger, a Time Magazine “Hero of the Environment” and Green Book Award Winner, wrote in Forbes that the problem of solar panel disposal will explode with full force in two or three decades and wreck the environment because it is a huge amount of waste which is not easy to recycle.



Shellenberger was citing comments…from Chinese solar expert Tian Min…Tian called his country’s solar power industry “a ticking time bomb.”



What’s even worse is that, at the behest of the climate lobby, governments have poured billions into enabling a toxic scam.



The Associated Press had reported in 2013 that the heavily subsidized solar industry was creating millions of pounds of polluted sludge and contaminated water that is often shipped landfills often hundreds of miles away.



The now-defunct, bankrupted Solyndra used its $535 million in guaranteed federal dollars to generate about 12.5 million pounds of hazardous waste, much of which was carcinogenic cadmium-contaminated waste, during its four years of operations.



For all the fluff about “clean, green energy from the sun”, the truth is that the solar industry is a toxic sludge of rent-seeking and pollution.



The average lifespan of a solar panel is about 20 years, but high temperatures (as in the Mojave Desert) can accelerate the aging process for solar cells, and snow, dust, and other natural events (tornadoes, earthquakes),can cause material fatigue on the surface and in the internal electric circuits – gradually reducing the panel’s power output.



Solar panels generate 300 times more toxic waste per unit of energy than nuclear power plants. They also contain lead, cadmium, and other toxic (even carcinogenic) chemicals that cannot be removed without breaking apart the entire panel. Worse, rainwater can wash many of these toxics out of the fragments of solar modules over time.



Another real concern is the vast increase in the use of nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) in the construction of solar panels – up 1,057 percent over the past 25 years. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deems NF3 to be 17,200 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas – meaning that even relatively minor quantities can have major impacts.



The cost of disposing of and recycling solar panel pollution is enormous, and growing. Solar panel waste can only be recycled at a loss. Japan already estimates that it will take decades to recycle its current waste. If the Krazy Klimate Kult get their way, and the solar industry expands into an all-encompassing behemoth, how much worse will the pollution problem be?



These loonies are killing the planet to “save” it.

Sen. Marco Rubio might fancy himself as a new type of leader for a new era, but his May 13 speech to the Council on Foreign Relations was trapped in the past.



Invoking John F. Kennedy’s final speech as president, more than 50 years ago, was bad enough. But Rubio’s overarching message—the Rubio Doctrine—amounts to warmed‐​over Cold War dogma, sprinkled with the language of benevolent global hegemony favored by so many Washington elites, but disdained by most Americans beyond the Beltway.



It is difficult to understand the depths of his political and strategic myopia.



Rubio misperceives the American public’s willingness to sustain the current model indefinitely, and therefore fails to appreciate the need for a genuinely new approach to U.S. global affairs. He minimizes the costs and risks of our current foreign policies, and oversells the benefits.





It is difficult to understand the depths of his political and strategic myopia.



He ignores the way in which U.S. security assurances to a host of some‐​of‐​the‐​time allies have discouraged these countries from taking reasonable steps to defend themselves and their interests. And he fails to see any reasonable alternative to a world in which the United States acts—forever, it seems—as the sole guarantor of global security.



Specifically, Rubio pledged: “As president, I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space.” (Any? Whew!)



To be sure, many people around the world may be happy to allow U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines to attempt such an ambitious undertaking, and to have American taxpayers pick up the tab. It is reasonable to guess that most foreign leaders are anxious to preserve the current order—so long as the U.S. government provides for their defense, they are free to spend their money on other things.



But the fact that foreigners like this arrangement doesn’t explain why most Americans would. When Rubio calls for huge increases in the Pentagon’s budget, he is telling Americans that they should be content to accept higher taxes, more debt and less money to spend here at home, so that U.S. allies elsewhere can neglect their defenses and feed their bloated welfare states.



Americans, unsurprisingly, and by a wide margin, favor something else. A poll taken last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, for example, found a mere 38 percent of Americans who considered “defending our allies’ security” to be a “very important” foreign goal, below “combating world hunger” and “limiting climate change.”



Several of Rubio’s other major foreign policy goals, including “promoting human rights abroad,” “protecting weaker nations against foreign aggression” or “helping to bring a democratic form of government to other nations” ranked even lower.



To be sure, Rubio is hardly alone in his embrace of the decades‐​old status quo. A parade of politicians, Republicans and Democrats alike, routinely speak of the United States as the indispensable nation, and celebrate the U.S. military’s role as a global constabulary.



But it seriously undermines Rubio’s claim to represent the hopes and aspirations of a new generation when he invokes the policies of the same‐​ol’ generation, and the one before it. His relative youth and stirring personal narrative will appeal to some, including possibly younger voters turned off by a cast of familiar names and has‐​beens. But Rubio’s fresh face alone is unlikely to compensate for his strangely stale foreign policies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s once formidable Green Party just held its annual convention in Hamburg.
Over the past few years Germans in general have grown fatigued of the planet-rescuing Greens and their dire warnings that man’s technology was destroying the planet. So faced with the prospect of slipping into irrelevance, the Greens are now scrambling to find an issue that will re-energize public enthusiasm.
German flagship daily Die Welt here has just published an online analysis of the Green Party’s convention. The piece is dubbed: “Farewell Apocalypse – the Greens are running out of issues“.
Once a party of devout Luddites, Die Welt writes:
The Party Convention shows that the Greens, now in their fourth decade of existence, are hardly needed anymore. The technology that they used to vilify has since solved more problems than it has created.”
One major problem the German Greens face is that the party is divided between the Fundis (fundamentalist greens) and the so-called Realos (hip progressives in business suits) who have taken over the party and adopted issues that other mainstream parties have long had in their platforms. Die Welt calls the German Greens “the children of Lenin and the Club of Rome“, a party whose leaders were “Maoists, Trotskyites and hardcore communists“; with the primary enemy: capitalism and the evils of a technological society, which they viewed would lead to global, ecological demise.
Though popular in the 1980s, Die Welt writes that narrative no longer finds much public appeal today. It’s totally out.
Today’s Green Party is now seeing its old anti-capitalist leaders going into retirement and its new leaders struggling to chart a meaningful course for the party’s future. The old Green zeitgeist is gone. The issues and philosophies that once resonated and brought the Greens huge success in the 1980s and 90s are today worn out, outdated. The appeal is gone, Die Welt writes.

In their fourth decade of existence, the apocalyptic narrative is approaching an end. Failure from fatigue looms. The mantra-like repeated invocation of the apocalypse hardly has any remaining energizing potential.”

Ironically, the Greens are facing a political extinction due to the very technology they once preached would lead to the global apocalypse. Die Welt:

Fusion could be delivering energy in just 10 years. Architects are designing skyscrapers that produce more energy then they consume. 900-hp sports car will be driven by engines that get 50 miles a gallon. The transition away from CO2 in oil and petrol is just a step away from the assembly line.
Contemporary capitalism has met the innovation challenges posed by ecology. […]
This weekend’s party convention showed that after the end of nuclear energy and mainstream ecology, the Greens have run out of issues.”

The Greens are now calling for an agricultural revolution. But as Die Welt points out: “capitalism has already long since recognized this. Thus there’s hardly any use left for the Greens“.

After 40 years of hearing apocalypse, the zeitgeist no longer desires doom and gloom. Engineers and scientists are basking in a sea of hopes and real breakthroughs. Who still needs the Greens when air, water and food are clean?”

While the Krazy Klimate Kult and their poster girl Greta do a bang-up job of stamping their little feets and shaking their little fists, they’re notably deficient when it comes to explaining just how they’ll implement their ludicrous demands. That’s because the whole “climate emergency” hysteria is little more than a showboating, middle-class religious cult.



But, while the bourgeois cultists are playing dress-ups and blocking ordinary folk from getting to work, over an imaginary emergency, other people are getting down to the job of tackling real environmental problems.



The yawning void between virtue-signalling climate alarmism and reality was exemplified by Australian PM Scott Morrison [when he addressed the UN last month](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/morrison-aims-to-actually-fix-the-environment-instead-of-screeching-about-climate-change/). Refusing to bow to hectoring globalists, Morrison firmly stated that his country had “nothing to apologise for”, and **instead of chasing sky dragons, Australia is pursuing real action on a real problem: ocean plastics**.



When Scott Morrison addressed the UN General Assembly last month he gave a huge boost, in front of a global audience, to a new technology for recycling plastics that came out of the University of Sydney.



The technology, on the verge of being commercialised, will do more than just recycle plastics.



It will help make achievable “a truly circular economy”, in the Prime Minister’s words, in which plastic can be recycled again and again, no longer being discarded in landfill, being burned, or adding to the already massive amount of plastic polluting the world’s oceans.



Current plastic recycling is expensive, labour-intensive and results in relatively low-grade products. The promise of this new technology is truly game-changing.



Mr Morrison cited the catalytic hydrothermal reactor — the fruit of research by Sydney University chemistry professor Thomas Maschmeyer and his colleagues — which can turn any type of plastic back into hydrocarbon feedstock that can then be made into fuel, waxes, lubricants, solvents and new plastics.



The technology — developed by Licella, a company co-founded by Professor Maschmeyer that partners with Sydney University — is commercially viable because it is far more economic than other methods of recycling plastic into oil. It is particularly good for processing mixed plastics that are currently not recycled…



Licella operates a pilot plant on the NSW central coast using the catalytic hydrothermal reactor technology (known as Cat-HTR) and is seeking to build Australia’s first commercial installation with its partner iQReNew.



Furthermore a British company, ReNew ELP, is setting up the first fully commercial plant on the site of an old ICI chemical plant in Wilton in the north of England.



Now that China has refused to take any more plastic waste from other countries unless it is sorted to an exceptional level of purity, Professor Maschmeyer says, interest in his technology is booming. “Money is knocking at our door,” he said from Europe, where he was speaking to potential investors in the technology.



Discussions are well advanced for large plants in Germany and Professor Maschmeyer believes it is realistic for Germany to be processing a half-million tonnes of plastic back into oil each year within three to five years…



He estimated that, for a cost of about $1bn, Australia could be 50 per cent plastic neutral and the investment would generate a strong financial return. He produced back-of-the-envelope figures to support this claim.



So we have an ignorant teenager who rants nonsense at world leaders, but a team of boffins who are quietly engineering a ground-breaking technology that could solve one of our most pressing environmental problems.



Guess which gets feted by the world media and the globalist elite?

"**US Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Brock Long has announced his resignation, the latest senior name to leave the Donald Trump administration.**
In the post since June 2017, he has led the response to several extreme natural disasters, including the heavily criticised operation in Puerto Rico after a devastating hurricane.
Mr Long was also involved in a row over the use of government resources.
In a statement, he said it was ""time for me to go home to my family"".
Mr Long, who has years of experience in emergency management, added that this had been ""the opportunity of the lifetime"" and that during his tenure the agency, known as Fema, had worked in more than 220 declared disasters.
Right after he took over, powerful hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria hit in quick succession, devastating parts of Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, where some 3,000 people were killed and residents remained without electricity for months.
Last year, two strong hurricanes, Florence and Michael, hit the south-eastern US. Meanwhile wildfires caused a number of deaths in California.
""The president and his entire administration provided unprecedented support to the agency as we led the nation through the historic 2017 hurricane and wildfire season,"" he said.
A report by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general said Mr Long would have to reimburse the government $151,000 (Â£117,000) related to costs of vehicles and staff involved in private trips, many of them between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
His deputy, Peter Gaynor, will serve as acting administrator."
"What type of government makes decisions  which will further kill off the country’s ability to equip ourselves with the skills to work out ways of adapting to major changes ahead for both our humanity and the environment? In this most uncertain time, why would we want to stop creating better skilled people in the humanities for the nation’s workforce, or decrease the number of students who strive to accomplish the highly developed human literacy skills and emotional intelligence, empathy and cultural agility, to work for change in the world for the good of all?  After having come through a prolonged drought in our drying continent and crippling inaction on climate change by our governments, accompanied by a string of more frequent unprecedented climate events that were capped off by the December bushfires, we literally fell into 2020 in a state of shock. We were silenced, broken and paralysed by the scale of the catastrophic bushfires that grew more monstrous before our eyes and could not be extinguished for months. Then, before the last fire was doused, and before we could even fathom the massive toll of these fires on our country and what would come next summer, we moved into another emergency. This time we had to save ourselves from a global pandemic of a deadly virus that quickly closed down the world, and which has so far infected over eight million people globally, killed nearly half a million people, and still remains a threat to all. So what do we say to this one hell of a wake-up call? What do we say to witnessing the world helpless with panic, and the frightening scenes of those in our community stricken with the horrific illness of Covid-19, and the coffins of hundreds, and of the thousands consigned to makeshift graves? What do we say to the massive discrimination that continues in many countries, including our own, and that boiled over in intense and determined worldwide Black Lives Matter demonstrations that brought tens of thousands out in the streets in the middle of a deadly pandemic after the killing of another black man, George Floyd, in the United States? I would have thought from all that we have experienced this year that we have to get smarter about global climate change, inequalities and pandemics. We are running out of time, if we haven’t already, with climate change. We will all be working towards a future that is going to look a lot different to what it looks like now. With the likelihood that the planet will get warmer, this means a far hotter, drier Australia. Global warming is exactly that: global. This will mean more inequality, far more health risks, and far more desperate and landless people than we can presently imagine. We do not all come from privileged backgrounds, but it has been both through our ability to be able to study and have our cultural, social and historic works examined in the humanities, that Australia is now recognised for its world class creativity and originality across the arts. We are among the leaders in the humanities. Our art and literature are celebrated in this country and across the world. Many learn from what we do to create and spread our knowledge of diversity, history and culture. This knowledge improves how a nation thinks about itself, and tries to make more room for those who are less fortunate. I wonder how we will be able to survive in an uncertain future if we deliberately set out, in the worst of times, to make studying in the humanities unaffordable for those less able to afford it. Isn’t this an act of censoring access to knowledge, and crippling future capacity? We are going to need the greatest creativity we can find to work on the ever-increasing complex problems facing our combined humanity. We cannot afford a government censoring education and knowledge. The road ahead is hard, and will get harder. If we will ever come anywhere near solving our complex problems as we move into the future, we will require greater emotional intelligence, and a higher level of analytical skills fully versed in the history and cultures of our combined humanity. Knowledge can never be just for the privileged who can afford to pay the government’s increased fee for a university education in the humanities. The world will keep moving towards greater changes that will challenge us like never before. We cannot afford to move into the uncertain world of global warming while leaving possibly millions of people outside the disciplines of university knowledge creation and building greater creativity. We will need people from all backgrounds to be more creative than we have ever known, with the competence to examine the interconnected world in which we live. Governments must have the capacity to explore the widest possible ways of sharing and improving knowledge to address our major problems. Of course we will require a greater workforce in health and technology, but we will also need an even greater workforce with the imagination and passion to improve the health of our combined humanity, and our connectedness with the only planet we can survive on. We have only just begun this journey, and it is long from finished. • Alexis Wright is an author and Boisbouvier chair in Australian literature"

How can two stations less than 1/2 mile apart be so different? How can one set a new record and best it by two degrees while the other doesn’t? 

I was intrigued by this Record Event Report out of Las Vegas today because of the mercury reading, specifically in the “town” of Mercury:

Hmm, smashing. 113°F seemed high to me, since I was monitoring the state of the art NOAA Climate Reference Network Station in Mercury, NV earlier in the day I was surprised to see that value. I looked up the Mercury Desert Rock airport, and sure enough, there was 113°F. But, there was also another value.


Source: http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mesowest/getobext.php?wfo=vef&sid=KDRA&num=72&raw=0
Upon checking the data from the nearby Climate Reference Network station, I discovered that the highest temperature recorded there was only 110°F

Source: http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mesowest/getobext.php?wfo=vef&sid=MRYN2&num=72&raw=0
The CRN monthly report says 111°F, so the high must have been very brief to not be captured in the 5 minute CRN data above.

Source: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/newmonthsummary?station_id=1049&yyyymm=201306&format=web
When I say it is a nearby station, I really mean it. It is only 2164 feet (0.41 mile) away as I demonstrate on this Google Earth image:

I double checked the image by zooming in to be sure both stations are actually there, and they are. The signature of the ASOS aviation weather station is clearly visible as is the signature of the CRN station.
So what do we have here?

Two stations separated by 2164 feet, both are “official” stations operated by NOAA.
One station, the KDRA ASOS is designated for aviation purposes, but used for daily climate records. It has a single sensor, with a known history of problems. It is also near a big chunk of asphalt tarmac with an albedo different from the rest of the desert floor.
The other station, the MRYN2 CRN is a Climate Reference network station, has state of the art sensors, including triple redundant temperature sensors, with automatic quality control, is placed specifically to be away from influences such as asphalt tarmac, and is surrounded by albedo matching the desert floor.
The elevations are nearly identical with the airport ASOS station at 3238 feet and the CRN station at 3295 feet. That difference of 57 feet won’t amount to any appreciable delta in temperature due to the lapse rate.
The temperature difference at the time the ‘record temperature” of 113°F is recorded at KDRA is two degrees. The CRN station is at 111°F.

So which one is the real temperature? I suppose it is a case of which one gets used for the “official” official reading, in which case is the warmer KDRA ASOS station.
The nearby CRN station does call the KDRA station data into question, but the horse has already left the barn now that NWS has released the numbers to the media. I will lodge a request with NWS Las Vegas to have them look at Mercury ASOS system though in case it is on the fritz as so many often do.
Oddly, after spending millions of dollars on the Climate Reference Network, the old COOP and ASOS network still gets used for high and low climate records.

"**The first people in Northern Ireland could receive their Covid-19 vaccines as soon as 9 December, BBC News NI understands.**
The Ulster Hospital is designated as one of seven vaccine points.
It will facilitate mostly South Eastern Trust staff, but people who live in the area and work for another trust can opt to receive their jab there.
The UK is the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for widespread use.
NI Health Minister Robin Swann said it was ""a hugely significant day"".
The first vaccinations had been scheduled from 14 December but Mr Swann said this could ""come forward by a few days"".
UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe for rollout.
It is thought Northern Ireland will receive about 1.5m doses, with 25,000 coming next week in the first stage.
Interim guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccintion and Immunisation (JCVI) states the first people to get the vaccine should be residents in a care hoMe for older adults and their carers.
They would be followed by those aged 80 and over as well as frontline health and social care workers.
The NI Department of Health has confirmed it will be following the JCVI's recommendations.
Four further coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded by the Department of Health, bringing its total to 1,015.
Three deaths occurred within the current reporting period, and one outside it.
A further 416 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number in Northern Ireland to 53,272.
Patricia Donnelly, who is heading up the vaccine rollout programme in Northern Ireland, said: ""We're hoping to vaccinate some time next week and to roll it out thereafter.
""We've been working at this for some time - we knew there would be a vaccine, we didn't know which one.
""We've been working in conjunction with trusts, with general practice and with care homes to identify the best way to do this.""
She said the fact the Pfizer vaccine had to be stored at a very low temperature and came in large packs meant it was more practical to bring those receiving it to larger centres - seven of which have been identified, including leisure centres and hospitals.
""That creates some challenges, but they're challenges we very much welcome,"" she added.
The Ulster Hospital is one of those designated vaccine points, with 18 areas set up for administering the injection.
The facility will cater for mostly South Eastern Trust staff but people who live in the area but work for another trust can opt to receive their jab there.
First Minister Arlene Foster described the news as ""an early Christmas present"".
She paid tribute to the scientists involved and said she was ""proud"" the UK had become the first country to approve the vaccine.
Mrs Foster told BBC's Good Morning Ulster that her focus now was on managing the ""logistical challenge"" of delivering the vaccine.
It will be up to the executive's Covid-19 taskforce, led by new interim head of the civil service Jenny Pyper to manage the vaccination programme with recovery and compliance plans.
She urged everyone in NI to abide by the current public health guidelines but added that Wednesday's news would be a ""relief"" for many people.
Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she believed the executive as a whole is convinced the vaccine is a ""game changer"".
She said phase-one of the rollout in Northern Ireland would begin with priority groups, including the over-80s, care home residents and staff and health and social care workers.
She said she hoped there would be a ""strong uptake"" of it in the coming months.
Ms O'Neill added that she did not think making it mandatory for people to take the vaccine was the right approach.
""It's understandable if something is rushed through at break-neck speed people will have concerns but let's just put all the information out there,"" she said.
The deputy first minister said she looked forward to the day when ministers no longer had to take difficult decisions related to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions.
Dr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association's GPs group in Northern Ireland said the approval of the vaccine was ""really good news"", but that much hard work lay ahead.
""But it is a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel, there's still a huge amount of work to do and we still need to all be so, so careful in terms of following the rules, following the guidelines over the next coming weeks,"" he said.
The vaccine requres two separate injections a number of weeks apart.
This is news that we have been waiting on for months and months.
It marks the start of a very tricky process that will eventually get us back to hopefully some point of normality.
It is an extremely difficult vaccine to store, to deliver and to roll out because it has to be kept at a certain temperature.
There are seven locations in Northern Ireland, including leisure centres and hospitals, where the vaccine programme could be administered.
We have been told behind the scenes these plans have been put in place and it will be a mammoth process, it will be a public health operation like none seen before and hopefully one we don't ever see again.
The UK has already ordered 40m doses - enough to vaccinate 20m people, with two shots each.
The first doses are to arrive in the UK in the coming days.
It is the fastest ever vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same developmental steps that normally span a decade.
The vaccine must be stored at around -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge."
"President Trump’s vow to overhaul the Food and Drug Administration could bring major changes in policy, including steps to accelerate the process of approving new prescription drugs, setting up a clash with critics who say his push for deregulation might put consumers at risk. Mr. Trump has been vetting candidates to run the agency, which regulates the safety of everything from drugs and medical devices to food and cosmetics. Among them is Jim O’Neill, a former official at the Health and Human Services Department who is an associate of the Silicon Valley billionaire and Trump supporter Peter Thiel. Mr. O’Neill has argued that companies should not have to prove that their drugs work in clinical trials before selling them to consumers. Other candidates also have called for reducing regulatory hurdles. If the most significant proposals are adopted  —   and many would require an act of Congress  —   they will reverse decades of policy and consumer protections dating to the 1960s. Congress toughened the drug approval process in the wake of the worldwide crisis over thalidomide, which caused severe birth defects in babies whose mothers had taken the drug in pregnancy. Since then, the F. D. A. has come to be viewed as the world’s leading watchdog for protecting the safety of food and drugs, a gold standard whose lead other countries often follow. Mr. Trump’s most recent statements, made at a White House   discussion last week with leaders of the nation’s top drug companies, have reverberated throughout the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Supporters of deregulation have long wanted to reduce bureaucracy and lessen oversight of drugs and devices, while critics say the market for drugs could be destabilized and the door opened to unproven products based on junk science. “Everyone depends on the agency, from the drugs in our medicine cabinet to the food on our dinner table, to our blood supplies,” said Dr. David Kessler, who was commissioner of the F. D. A. during the presidencies of the elder George Bush and Bill Clinton. “We are the envy of the world because our honey is our honey. Our foods are not laced with pesticides. Our drugs work. ” Mr. Trump said at the meeting that he was close to naming a “fantastic” person to lead the agency. In addition to Mr. O’Neill, candidates whose names have recently surfaced include Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former F. D. A. official with longstanding ties to pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and Dr. Joseph Gulfo, a former biotech and medical device executive. All three have called for streamlining the drug approval process, but Mr. O’Neill’s stance has drawn the most attention. He is a managing director of Mithril Capital Management, an investment firm Mr. Thiel   and previously led the Thiel Foundation, Mr. Thiel’s philanthropic organization. During the George W. Bush administration, Mr. O’Neill held a series of roles in the Health and Human Services Department, including as principal associate deputy secretary, where he worked on policy, including for the F. D. A. according to his LinkedIn profile. Mr. O’Neill is a libertarian who is on the board of the SENS Research Foundation, a charity that funds   research, and until recently served on the board of the Seasteading Institute, an effort to create new societies at sea. At an   conference in 2014, Mr. O’Neill advocated something he called “progressive” approval, in which drugs that were proved safe, but not yet proven effective, could be allowed on the market. “Let people start using them, at their own risk,” Mr. O’Neill said. “Let’s prove efficacy after they’ve been legalized. ” Companies have been required to prove that their drugs work since  1962, when Congress passed legislation requiring that licensing for sale be based not just on safety but also on “substantial evidence” of a drug’s efficacy. That law, and others passed since, forced companies to rigorously test their products, running them through a gantlet of clinical trials whose results are then vetted by the F. D. A. before any sales to consumers. Ninety percent of drugs that enter clinical development fail these trials. (The F. D. A. also regulates medical devices, but they undergo a separate approval process.) As a result, newly discovered drugs can take years to reach the market, a period that Mr. Trump said last week was too lengthy. “When you have a drug, you can actually get it approved if it works, instead of waiting for many, many years,” he told the pharmaceutical executives. “We’re going to be cutting regulations at a level that nobody’s ever seen before, and we’re going to have tremendous protection for the people. ” Some have suggested that a commissioner determined to weaken the efficacy standard need not seek congressional action, but could interpret existing regulations loosely so that requirements for certain clinical trials  —   particularly the costly,   ones that can take years and involve thousands of patients  —   can be rolled back. That could have serious implications for patients. Last month, the F. D. A. released a study of 22 drugs that appeared promising in early studies but failed in final,   trials. Drug safety watchdogs point to examples like the painkiller Vioxx, which was withdrawn from the market in 2004 over safety concerns, as proof of the high stakes involved in drug approval. While Mr. Trump’s call to cut regulations has been warmly received by other industries, some biotech executives have reacted to his remarks with alarm. Those affiliated with some smaller companies have privately described the choice of Mr. O’Neill as a   scenario that could send the drug industry into chaos. The F. D. A. they say, is not perfect, but its standards provide a level playing field on which both big and small companies can compete. “We’re not selling   and Pepsi, where patients can taste the   and decide if they like it,” said John M. Maraganore, the chief executive of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a Massachusetts biotech firm. “Our products are lifesaving medicines. ” Industry executives said big changes to the agency would also be bad for business, making it difficult for companies with breakthrough treatments to distinguish their products from those that are shams. If standards at the F. D. A. are rolled back, “then we might as well be advertising in the middle of the night on how terrifically we can cure all your illnesses,” said Dr. Leonard S. Schleifer, the chief executive of Regeneron, a pharmaceutical company in Tarrytown, N. Y. “That’s not the business that I think most of us want to be in. ” Daniel Carpenter, a professor at Harvard University who studies the F. D. A. said its role is not just to ensure the safety of a drug. “The underpinnings of belief among patients, payers, even investors, is that somebody out there has tested these things and has shown, with some evidence, that they work,” he said. Mr. O’Neill did not respond to emails and a phone call requesting comment, and Dr. Gottlieb declined to comment. Dr. Gulfo, the former biotech executive, said he had spoken with several people on the president’s transition team about the F. D. A. job. He said he was in favor of keeping the efficacy requirement. But he said he believed the agency’s standards were too rigid and burdensome to companies with innovative ideas. He called on the agency to approve more drugs based on what are known as “surrogate endpoints”  —   showing that a diabetes drug lowers blood sugar, for example  —   rather than forcing companies to prove that the product improves   outcomes like survival rates or lowering the chance for heart attacks. “Let’s bring the F. D. A. back to what its mission is, and its mission is to make sure that drugs can be labeled for safe use, and that they’re not snake oil,” said Dr. Gulfo, the former chief executive of MELA Sciences, who wrote a book about his company’s failed efforts to get its skin cancer detection device approved. (The agency eventually approved it for use in 2011.) Several drug company executives said the F. D. A. while not perfect, had sped up the approval process in recent years and had been responsive to requests to approve drugs based on interim measurements, particularly for   diseases that have no other treatments. The agency sets a   goal for approving standard drugs, and a   period for those that have qualified for expedited approval one recent study showed it decides on drugs more quickly than its counterparts in Europe and Canada. A majority of recent new drugs were approved through expedited approvals, another recent study found. In December, Congress passed a law that further speeds approvals for certain drugs and medical devices. Drug industry leaders say that they want the F. D. A. to be more open to allowing new kinds of clinical trials, and that it needs to become more nimble in keeping up with the breathtaking pace of medical advances. They have also been prodding the agency to fill an estimated 1, 000 staff vacancies so that decisions can be made more quickly. But that is apparently delayed because the president ordered an    hiring freeze. “The only way you would make it shorter is you staff up,” said Michael Gilman, an entrepreneur who has founded several biotech companies. “You certainly don’t do it by slashing staff. So the logic of the whole thing doesn’t compute for me. ”"

Last month, the _Los Angeles Times_ ran a story that helped highlight one facet of the muddled thinking afflicting the US government’s campaign against ISIS: While the military wants to sabotage the group’s cyber propaganda and recruitment capabilities, FBI and intelligence officials argue doing so would close a critical window into its operations and ability to detect domestic terrorist plots. Even as it stands on verge of acting, the government is fighting with itself (both in the press and presumably behind closed doors) and implementing contradictory policies. A better course of action would be acknowledging that it has struggled to find ways to weaken the organization, and refocusing the government’s resources and attention on the real problem (ISIS), rather than pursuing counterproductive policies at home.



These kinds of bureaucratic and mission turf wars are nothing new; they figured prominently in the 9/11 Commission’s hearings and in its final report. What the apparent bickering between the FBI and military officials underscores is that the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations — virtually all of which have been implemented, including the creation of a Director of National Intelligence to help mitigate such bureaucratic turf wars — have done nothing to solve this age‐​old problem.



Left unaddressed in the _LAT_ piece is the larger historical parallel between the federal government’s overblown and counterproductive responses to past alleged pan‐​nationalist threats in the 20th century and its response to militant Salafism today. 



For example, during the “Red Scare” that started during the First World War and ran largely unbroken throughout the Cold War, the federal response included efforts to subvert the primary means of communication at the time — through telephone taps, the interception of telegrams, and censoring the mail. In the undeclared war against alleged or potential ISIS adherents in America, federal authorities have returned to that playbook, updated to account for the advances in technology.



In a pattern that has recurred almost weekly for the last two years, a government official has repeated the canard that ISIS’s use of encryption technologies is making it impossible to track:



But there are apparently limits to U.S. cyber capabilities. Speaking to reporters Dec. 9, Rep. Michael McCaul (R‐​Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Islamic State hackers “have developed an encrypted app and can communicate anywhere in the world from an iPhone without any ability for us to pick up those communications. … They have mastered this dark space.”



Like the overwhelming majority of members of Congress, McCaul lacks sufficient technological literacy or even a cursory familiarity with the most current literature on exactly how maladroit ISIS truly is in cyber operations. As one prominent cyber expert recently noted, ISIS appears to lack personnel with even modest cyber skills:



From their dwindling talent pool of low grade hackers, to their limited cyber operations and their poor training regime, it is clear that ISIS do not pose a credible cyber threat to anyone. While this may change in the future (anything’s possible), it seems very unlikely that they will possess the capability to do any damage to anyone. ISIS simply are not a serious cyber threat actor.



Even so, McCaul has proposed an “encryption commission” to study how to cut the digital Gordian knot of protecting user privacy and still giving law enforcement what it allegedly needs to track and thwart terrorist plots. The fact that virtually every reputable crypto expert in the world has dismissed such an idea as dangerous and unworkable has had no effect in curtailing law enforcement’s requests for an impossible solution. Moreover, even a complete private crypto ban would not stop ISIS‐​inspired “lone wolf” attacks like the one in Chattanooga last year. And in a body‐​blow to the FBI’s position on the issue, NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers made it clear during a talk at the Atlantic Council that trying to ban public key encryption is “a waste of time.”





Our self‐​imposed counterterrorism schizophrenia comes at a high cost for all of us, just as our anti‐​communist hysteria led us into the quagmire that was the Vietnam War.



The persistent belief in the possibility of creating “good guys‐​only” crypto “backdoors” evinced by FBI Director James Comey and other federal officials is a form of magical thinking. It’s an intellectual dodge that helps them ignore the government’s own failures to penetrate ISIS in the Middle East and Europe — the single best way to take down the organization’s members.



And questionable anti‐​ISIS legislative proposals are not confined to the technological arena.



Another Texas House delegation member who is usually quite good on First Amendment issues, Rep. Ted Poe, has strayed from the path of wisdom by joining those who believe that Twitter and Facebook can somehow magically banish ISIS and its supporters from social media platforms.



In December 2015, the House passed Poe’s Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act (HR 3654) on a voice vote. The bill would mandate a report from the administration on how it will combat ISIS’s use of social media, including (in the words of the bill summary) the development of a “policy that enhances the exchange of information and dialogue between the federal government and social media companies as it relates to the use of social media platforms by terrorists.”



As the long list of DOJ indictments against ISIS supporters and would‐​be recruits over the last two years shows, the Patriot Act and related statutes have provided the FBI with ample authorities to get the data they need from social media companies to make cases against alleged terrorist plotters. What Poe’s bill has done is provide ammunition for a civil lawsuit against Twitter for allegedly indirectly playing a role in the death of an American killed in a salafist‐​inspired attack in Jordan in November 2015.



By the logic of the plaintiffs in that case, the manufacturers of the guns used in the San Bernardino attack could also be held civilly liable, as could the manufacturers of the pressure cookers used to make the improvised explosive devices employed in the Boston Marathon bombing, and so on. If the suit succeeds, it won’t just be social media companies that are put at financial risk from future terrorism‐​related lawsuits. Any company whose products or services contributed even indirectly to a terrorist act against an American could face civil liability for the misuse of their products or services.



Just as with the government’s misdirected focus on encryption apps and services, the civil liability focus of such suits takes the spotlight off of the real criminals — ISIS — and the federal government’s own role in creating and furthering the expansion of salafist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS by invading Iraq and Libya.



Congressional calls for banning certain forms of speech or censoring publications are nothing new. They began within a decade of the ratification of the Constitution and have, unfortunately, continued into the modern era. After the post‐​WWI Red Scare in 1919–20, a Senate committee called for a ban on foreign language publications that allegedly carried “un‐​American” ideas on their pages. The Overman Committee helped fuel an anti‐​foreigner and anti‐​communist hysteria that would ultimately give rise to the House Unamerican Activities Committee, Senator Joseph McCarthy, and a poisonous domestic political climate that would lead to the surveillance and persecution of hundreds of thousands of Americans in the 20th century. Current federal counterterrorism policies have the nation on the path to repeating the same mistakes in the 21st century.



The government’s current “countering violent extremism” (CVE) policies already have undercurrents that mimic the Red Scare era. These include the creation of a “domestic counter terrorism counsel” within DOJ, the establishment in DHS of the euphemistically named “Office of Community Partnerships” (which is exclusively focused on extremism in Arab‐ and Muslim‐​American communities), the FBI’s development of a school‐​based CVE program that would effectively pit teachers against their Arab‐ and Muslim‐​American students and propagate false and misleading information about Islam, and legislation to make at least some of these programs permanent fixtures of the federal government.



Each of these actions puts the focus — and by extension, the blame — for domestic terrorist acts committed by individual Muslims on Arab‐ and Muslim‐​American communities as a whole. No such federal efforts were initiated among the white, Protestant community as a whole after episodes involving the Covenant, Sword and Arm of the Lord, the siege at Ruby Ridge, the storming of the Branch Davidian compound, the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing, or the recent racially and politically motivated murder of nine African‐​Americans at a Charleston, South Carolina church. The contrast is as stark as it is hypocritical.



Indeed, the government’s CVE programs are echoes of failed efforts to ferret out “disloyal” Americans during both World War II and the Cold War — from the use of dubious “loyalty oaths” to the Smith Act to the internment of Japanese‐​Americans to the McCarran Internal Security Act and the Attorney General’s List of Subversive Organizations. But we continue to forget the lessons we learned from those failed policies and programs.



Indeed, the history of the List of Subversive Organizations should be a reminder and a warning about how easily federal agencies can go down the road of grouping domestic organizations into “loyal” or “subversive” categories. The recent IRS scandal involving the targeting of right‐​of‐​center anti‐​federal government groups only underscores the fact that the threat of such discriminatory treatment is real. It’s rather easy to imagine something similar happening to Arab‐ or Muslim‐​American groups based on their level of cooperation with or resistance to these CVE programs.



The current GOP presidential front‐​runner has called for the creation of federal databases to track not only Arab/​Muslim refugees from the Middle East, but also potentially Arab‐ and Muslim‐​American citizens as well, in addition to an outright ban on Arab/​Muslim immigration to the United States. If he were elected and ordered federal agencies to take such actions, would career civil servants at DHS and DOJ have the courage to defy Mr. Trump and refuse to implement such proposals? If the recent history of America’s political, legal, and moral devolution into the use of torture is any guide, the more likely outcome would be agency compliance with the wishes and direction provided by the President.



And these CVE‐​related actions have something else in common: They shift the blame away from the federal government for its role in helping create and sustain ISIS — first by invading and destabilizing Iraq and Libya, and second by doubling‐​down on a failed security‐​centric approach to counterterrorism in the Arab and Muslim world. That disastrously overly‐​militarized approach to militant salafism, combined with federal support for de facto anti‐​Arab and anti‐​Muslim CVE programs at home, only help groups like ISIS make the case that America is, contrary to all public statements to the contrary, at war with Islam.



Our self‐​imposed counterterrorism schizophrenia comes at a high cost for all of us, just as our anti‐​communist hysteria led us into the quagmire that was the Vietnam War. In his veto message on the original Internal Security Act, President Truman spoke words of wisdom that we would do well to heed today:



Our position in the vanguard of freedom rests largely on our demonstration that the free expression of opinion, coupled with government by popular consent, leads to national strength and human advancement. Let us not, in cowering and foolish fear, throw away the ideals which are the fundamental basis of our free society.



Amen.

"The UK is one of only a handful of countries that has put in place legally binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, relative to 1990 levels. How the country intends to go about meeting these targets is another matter entirely. Until now, the government has seen improving the energy efficiency of millions of British homes as low hanging fruit that can provide easy emissions reductions. And housing is certainly a major contributor, generating 27% of the country’s total emissions. Improving insulation, making homes airtight, and introducing smart energy meters are all part of the government’s plan. Huge sums of money are currently being invested on refurbishing properties, which while preferable to wholesale demolition, needs to be guided by well-rounded policies. The latest approach for funding these changes is through the Green Deal, a loan attached to a house paid back through its energy bills. Unfortunately, a policy focused solely on the reduction of CO2 emissions takes little account of the wider effects that will inevitably have: on the buildings, their inhabitants, and even on the environment. Such tightly focused policies may fail to achieve what they set out to, and may even make things worse. Published as part of the Housing, Energy and Wellbeing project at UCL, our study examined the scope of these knock-on effects, and revealed more than 100 likely unintended consequences. These can be positive or negative, and are often closely linked. By trying to deal with these individually, efforts to solve a negative consequence can counteract a positive one, or reinforce another, or lead to further complications. For example, reducing draughts in houses can make them warmer and more energy efficient, but may also increase the risk of infection from airborne pathogens, or exposure to indoor pollution. One example of such indoor pollution is the potential for a build up in concentration of radon. Radon is an inert, radioactive gas that enters the home by seepage from the ground. Especially in areas where the geology makes it naturally prevalent, radon levels in buildings are largely determined by ventilation. It has been identified as an important risk factor for lung cancer, second only to smoking, with around 1,400 cases a year in the UK. Recent research published in the British Medical Journal has shown that when dwellings are made more air-tight, without providing alternative ventilation, indoor radon levels increase. The obvious solution is to allow greater ventilation to help reduce indoor health risks, but this would increase the energy required to heat the home, and therefore the amount of CO2 emissions produced. Some sort of trade-off between health and the emissions policy needs to be considered. On the other hand, making houses more airtight, using double glazing for example, make them quieter places to sleep and study. This can benefit their occupants’ physical and mental health, as well as make them more productive at work and school. While quietness is a good thing, the absence of sound can lead to a sense of isolation and social disconnection for some. The simplest solution? Open your window – but then up go the CO2 emissions. The way houses are built and arranged in neighbourhoods also influences residents’ well-being in deep and complex ways at individual, family and community levels. Intervening in this complex system can have a wide range of impacts spanning physical and mental health, culture, social cohesion, fairness, financial stability and environmental sustainability. From the simple examples shown, it can be seen that the links between housing, energy use and human well-being are connected in very complex relationships. This makes policy decisions difficult, and demands a more integrative approach. The project gives decision-makers the opportunity to understand the system they are working in, and to try to balance out different and sometimes contradictory objectives.  Taking a broad and long view is essential if we are not to embark on a course that will bring considerable unintended consequences for society. Our research that scopes out the range of consequences and the links between them is the first step."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski, an educated geologist, presents an article today at the online Spiegel explaining how the once highly ballyhooed “97% consensus” claim is in fact deceptive and “a half-truth”: Failed Scientists’ Call To Action at UN Climate Conference: The 97 Percent Trap.
Bojanowski begins by describing how last year even President Obama tweeted the claim, but then adds that the “claimed consensus among scientists is actually something other than what Obama suggests“.
97 scientists “deceiving the public”
And on the latest pre-New York Climate Conference campaign by 97 scientists promoting the idea of consensus, the Spiegel journalist writes that “they are deceiving the public“.
Last year scientists led by John Cook of the University of Queensland published in the journal Environmental Research Letters a study showing that more than 97% of scientists claim global warming is man-made. Bojanowski writes: “They [the scientists] had asked environmental activists at the Internet site ‘Skeptical Science’ to evaluate thousands of climate studies.”
On the results Bojanowski writes that “less than 1% of the studies expressly disputed the impact by man. A good two thirds took no position on the topic – and so were not included.”
No consensus to speak of
Bojanowski blasts the results of the survey, explaining that “the study confirms only a banality: Scientists are for the most part in agreement than man contributes to climate warming. Even hard-nosed critics of climate science do not doubt the physical principle that exhaust from automobiles, factories and power plants warm the air.” He then reminds readers that man’s impact is a side issue, and that the real issue is the extent man has an impact and whether or not the climate warming is a dangerous thing. Here on the real central issues Bojanowski writes there is absolutely no consensus to speak of.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




So why are the 97 scientists trying to produce a different impression? Bojanowski provides an answer:
The public, so the authors justify the idea behind the study, are hesitating to support climate protection because of uncertainty over the consensus among scientists. […] The 97 percent campaign is to ‘strengthen’ the study, the initiators at ‘Skeptical Science’ write.”
Massive criticism from experts worldwide
Critical reaction from other experts came rapidly, Bjoanowski cites Dan Kahan of Yale Law School, who believes the message “promotes the polarization of society“. Also cited is meteorologist Victor Venema of the University of Bonn, who wrote that “‘consensus’ is in itself uncomfortable to many scientists.”
Bojanowski also puts Georgia Tech professor Judith Curry down as a harsh critic of the Cook study asl well. Curry calls the nature of such a survey “senseless”.
Also Richard Tol is cited in the Spiegel article. Bojanowski writes:
Richard Tol of the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin aims methodical criticism at Cook’s study: The evaluated climate studies were haphazardly selected. And whether or not the people evaluating the studies worked reliably was not tested. ‘People who want to argue that climate researchers are secretive and incompetent,’ says Tol polemically, ‘only have to point to the 97% consensus paper’.”
Bojanowski ends the piece with a shot of sarcasm, telling readers that “the Environmental Research Letters, which published the paper, was impressed by the Cook study. They selected it “best article of 2013“.

"Every Sunday in February, we will feature and explore previously unpublished photographs from The New York Times’s archives, with a special focus on the 1960s. Revisit last year’s Unpublished Black History project, sign up for our   newsletter and share your own experiences with black history in the comments. The   bullet tore through a civil rights worker’s shoulder, stopping within an inch of his spine. The shotgun blast shattered the car windows of four voting rights activists and gouged the wall of a nearby home. And a fire destroyed voter registration equipment and materials outside the city’s Voter Registration Headquarters, leaving the street strewn with rubble. It was 1963 in Greenwood, Miss. a major battleground in the fight for civil rights, and white officials were playing down and ignoring a series of attacks intended to discourage thousands of   from registering to vote. Claude Sitton, the renowned New York Times correspondent, shot photos and took meticulous notes, exposing the racial violence with his pen and with his lens. Mr. Sitton is best known for his words. But the typewritten letters that he sent, along with his film, to John Dugan, a Times photo editor, reveal that he was also determined to capture history with his camera. He carried a Leica, according to one of his sons, and wrote about light and shadows and underexposed frames. He lamented the gloom inside a crowded black church and the time constraints he faced as he scrambled to report the news and illustrate it at the same time. “I didn’t have very much time,” Mr. Sitton wrote apologetically, “and will try to give you a better selection the next time I offer something. ” Yet there is power in Mr. Sitton’s   letters and in the    images he captured on   film in March of 1963. Shown together here for the first time  —   as part of a weekly series running throughout the month  —   they offer a firsthand glimpse of life on the front lines of the civil rights movement. In one frame, Robert P. Moses, the field secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, clipboard in hand, pointed to the holes left by the shotgun blast in the wall of a weathered home. In another, the charred detritus of the fire  —   set by a person or persons unknown  —   littered the street outside the old voting headquarters. Medgar Evers, the state field secretary of the N. A. A. C. P. addressed a packed voter registration rally at the local African Methodist Episcopal church in what may well be the only photograph taken of Evers by The Times. In another series of images, black women took their seats in a citizenship training school intended to train volunteers to help register black voters, and another woman stacked cans of food in the Sunday school room of a local church. The food was collected in Chicago for hungry black farm workers in Greenwood, who had been denied federal food assistance by white county officials in retaliation for their voter registration efforts.   accounted for 61 percent of the county’s population. Yet only 1. 9 percent of blacks of voting age were registered, compared with 95. 5 percent of whites. The Justice Department, contending that whites were disenfranchising blacks with discriminatory voting laws, filed suit. Justice Department officials also sought a federal court order to prevent the city and county from denying blacks the right to protest, after the police unleashed a German shepherd dog on peaceful marchers and jailed voting rights activists. It was the first time that federal officials had taken such a step, Mr. Sitton noted in his article about Greenwood, which was published in April of 1963. (Only three of the many photographs that he took during his time in Greenwood were published with this article.) But with every step forward, it seemed, there were several steps back. Two months later, on June 12, 1963, an assassin killed Evers in Jackson, Miss. That afternoon, hundreds of   took to the streets in protest. And Mr. Sitton was there with his pen, his notebook and his camera."

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently got in a rather public spat with the U.S. Department of State over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project. Apart from the irregularity of one Cabinet agency attacking another, the episode was a boondoggle for the EPA, which came out looking both petty and unscientific.



In a letter to the State Department, the EPA contends that the State Department (which has the ultimate say in the whether or not the pipeline gets the green light) did not accurately assess the magnitude of the carbon dioxide emissions that would result from the burning of the 830,000 barrels of oil the pipeline would transport each day.



It’s important to point out that a barrel of oil extracted from Canada’s tar sands produces about 17 percent more carbon dioxide emissions than the average barrel of oil refined in the United States. However, that extra 17 percent does not come from the oil itself, but from the energy‐​intensive manner in which it is mined. This emissions premium will almost certainly shrink over time as new technologies are developed to more efficiently extract the oil.





The recent spat with the State Dept. was a boondoggle for the EPA, which came out looking both petty and unscientific.



The concern is how much of this extra carbon dioxide will find its way into the atmosphere because of the pipeline. The State Department concludes that the tar sands oil will come to market whether or not Keystone XL is ever built, meaning the pipeline would result in a minimal production of carbon dioxide that otherwise would not have occurred.



The EPA, on the other hand, argues that absent the pipeline, the oil will largely remain in the ground. Therefore, building the pipeline will cause the extraction of oil, with the end result being the emission of an extra 18.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.



That sounds like a lot. But herein lies the EPA’s prevarication. Typically, when gauging “climate impacts,” as the EPA claims is its “focus” in the letter, emissions are put into a computer model to determine how they would actually impact the climate. Taking that extra step isn’t hard. The EPA didn’t do it. In fact, climate models are designed precisely to provide information about how emissions affect the climate, and are the primary source of projections of future global warming resulting from the human carbon dioxide emissions.



So why did the EPA omit this critical step in determining the climate impacts of Keystone XL? Because even under the EPA’s highly pessimistic assumption, the extra 18.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually results in less than 0.00001°C of warming per year. In English, that’s one one‐​hundred‐​thousandth of a degree. Needless to say, “18.7 million” sounds bigger.



Put another way, the extra emissions from the Keystone XL pipeline if it delivered oil at its maximum capacity for the next thousand years would be expected to raise the global average temperature by less than one hundredth of a degree. Even if climate modeling could be relied upon for its demonstrated accuracy over such a huge duration — which it most certainly cannot — that figure is obviously too infinitesimal to be included in any rational discussion of the issue.



After all, who would have taken the EPA seriously had it stated in its letter that the primary issue it had with the State Department analysis involved a calculation to the 5th decimal point? We all would have wondered why the EPA was wasting its time and taxpayer dollars on such triviality.



But the fact that the EPA circumvented what should be its normal procedures — running the carbon dioxide figure through climate modeling — is a damning bit of evidence. It is difficult not to conclude the EPA is trying to influence the discussion by confusing the public with large numbers of no real‐​world consequence.



The State Department is to be commended for considering copious amounts of evidence — including reams of environmental impact data — in its deliberations on the Keystone XL pipeline. The product of those deliberations is that the decidedly pro‐​environment Obama Administration is on the verge of approving the pipeline on its merits. For EPA bureaucrats to try to derail the process with underhanded tactics serves no one — not the president they work for, not the environment they are charged to protect, and certainly not the consumer public.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew studies confirm: Glaciers in the Alps already had “fevers” during the Roman and Medieval warm periods
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited, condensed by P Gosselin)

Everywhere activists and climate alarmists are claiming climate change is happening faster than ever and that the earth is dangerously approaching a tipping point. For example Greenpeace likes to say that the glaciers are actually the “fever thermometers” measuring the health of the planet and that their melting tells the story of inevitable total meltdown. For example in the Alps glaciers have receded by almost a half since the year 1850. Greenpeace writes:
Foremost since the 1990s the rate of melt has increased and is expected to rise over the coming years: Today’s melting is being caused by greenhouse gas emissions from 30 years ago.”

But is glacier melt really something new and unexpected?
Greenpeace uses the Alps as a telltale example. It is precisely there that we want to carry out a fact-check. Firstly one has to wonder why the glacier melt in the Alps began already way back in 1850 – when anthropogenic CO2 couldn’t have played any significant role. This was already determined by geologist Albert Schreiner in 1997 in his textbook “Introduction to Quatenary  Geology“ (p. 188, Fig. 91).
One finds even greater factual headaches when going back through the history of the climate for the last several thousand years. Already in earlier articles we wrote that the Alps glacier melted considerably during earlier warm periods.
The melt phases during the Medieval Warm Period 1000 years ago and during the Roman Warm Period 2000 years ago have been well documented (see our blog articles here and here. In April 2014 two more additional papers were published, which impressively confirmed the natural glacier dynamics.
In the Quaternary Science Reviews appeared a paper authored by a team led by Anaëlle Simonneau of the French University Orléans, which reconstructed the glacier movements in the French Alps over the last thousands of years. Here the scientists documented several glacier melt phases, which unsurprisingly included the Roman and Medieval warm periods (Figure1). What follows is an excerpt from the abstract:
Holocene palaeoenvironmental evolution and glacial fluctuations at high-altitude in the western French Alps are reconstructed based on a multiproxy approach within Lake Blanc Huez (2550 m a.s.l.) drainage basin.  […] periods of reduced glacial activities dated from the Early Bronze Age (ca 3870–3770 cal BP), the Iron Age (ca 2220–2150 cal BP), the Roman period (ca AD115–330) and the Medieval Warm Period (ca AD760–1160).”

Figure 1: Reconstruction of glacier activity in the French Alps. The glacier advances are shown in blue and melt periods in red. The scale is in 1000s of years before today. The Medieval Warm Period is at 1 (=1000 years before today), the Roman Warm Period is at 2 (=2000 years before today). Moreover: In the time from 6000 to 9000 years before today there was massive glacier melting. Source: Simonneau et al. 2014.
A second paper comes from Martin Lüthi of the University of Zurich, appearing in The Cryosphere. It contains a reconstruction of the Alps glacier history for the last 1600 years. Interestingly the seven examined glaciers show conditions during the Medieval Warm Period  that were similar in length as today (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Length changes in Alps glaciers over the past 1600 years. The blue negative vertical bars depict advancing glaciers while the red bars represent retreating glaciers. From Lüthi 2014.
Despite these proven natural glacier cycles, Greenpeace Greenpeace predicts an early death and terrible consequences for the Alps:
Glacier scientists anticipate an almost complete melting in this century. There are 5000 glaciers in the Alps. When many of them are permanently melted, there could be a sensitive collapse in the water supply. Glaciers store drinking water.
A scary theory. However the glaciers are ignoring all the catastrophe predictions and even started to grow once again in 2013, see here. And in the Swiss Alps snow amounts since 2000 have unexpectedly been on the rise.
A look back at the climate history reveals that the alarmist stories for the Alps are nothing but a tempest in a teapot. It’s all happened before. Obviously the fear-mongers have failed to look beyond 150 years ago. How much longer can they keep this up without serious science pushing back?

In his fifth State of the Union address, President Barack Obama hit all the main talking points that everyone expected he would. What he did not say, though, should concern many Americans. Numerous polls show that the majority of Americans want U.S. troops to out of Afghanistan “as soon as possible.” Americans also say that their country does not have a responsibility to get involved in Syria and the broader Middle East, and they favor substantial cuts to record high military spending. On all three of these issues, however, Obama did not go far enough and even went in the opposite direction. Certainly, foreign policy should not always fluctuate with the prevailing political winds. But the interests of the American people undoubtedly deserve to be heard.



On Afghanistan, Obama pledged to cut America’s presence in half by bringing 34,000 troops home by this time next year. Of course, he failed to specify how many troops will remain thereafter. Last May, he and President Hamid Karzai signed a long‐​term strategic partnership agreement that committed America to Afghanistan’s military and economic security— _until 2024_. Absent a status of forces agreement, and a resolution to the issue of whether U.S. troops will be immune from the Afghan judicial system, the exact size of America’s residual presence remains murky.



Nevertheless, the commander‐​in‐​chief could have clarified why the United States should dwell in Central Asia for another decade. He should have explained what vital American interests are being served and what aspect of America’s national security would be at stake once we leave. With foreign‐​policy planners continuing to press for an open‐​ended commitment, claiming the war will end in 2014 was flagrantly disingenuous.





It is time for politicians to revisit how America engages with the world, and recognize that there are more peaceful, more effective, and less costly ways to project America’s power and influence abroad and meet our security objectives.



On future U.S. military interventions, the president was correct to state that “We don’t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations.” But his following promise to “help countries like Yemen, Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security” was ill‐​defined and dangerous. The reason: Obama failed to lay out what set of conditions would warrant America’s “help,” at a time when the country should be more selective about where it chooses to intervene.



Put simply, if Yemen, why not Pakistan? If Somalia, why not Haiti? If Libya, why not Zimbabwe, or the dozens of other countries across Africa? What Obama did not articulate was a limiting principle for when and where America would _not_ commit its scarce resources. Americans deserve to know what conditions would merit U.S. assistance, and what the president is prepared to sacrifice to provide it.



Finally, with sequestration just a few weeks away, the president failed to propose a substantive alternative to across the board cuts. Indeed, he largely avoided any criticism of military spending, and claimed that “sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness.” The reality, though, is that even with sequestration, the Pentagon’s base budget will remain well above the post‐​Cold War average, and merely sink to 2007 spending levels. Furthermore, if Obama had his way, we would see either fewer cuts to the Pentagon than called for under sequestration, or added taxation to cover the difference. With the military accounting for nearly 20 percent of total federal spending, Americans are right to demand that such figures be reduced. The United States accounts for about half of global military spending and spends more on its military than all other advanced industrial economies. Last year alone, Americans spent $729 billion on military and international security, and nearly $930 billion including the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security. Spending close to a trillion dollars a year will not help safeguard our country’s financial security, ostensibly a main thrust of Obama’s address.



Unfortunately, politicians on both sides of the aisle seem to believe that spending reflects an accurate measure of military effectiveness, whereas Americans intuitively understand that strength is not a function of how much we spend. It is time for politicians to revisit how America engages with the world, and recognize that there are more peaceful, more effective, and less costly ways to project America’s power and influence abroad and meet our security objectives.



Commentators praised Obama for waxing eloquent on everything from combating climate change and reducing gun violence to creating jobs and raising the minimum wage. What they neglected was the warfare state—the elephant in the room. Americans seek to restrain their leaders’ boundless ambition to resolve every foreign civil conflict and maintain historically high military spending levels. Having endured over a decade of permanent war and near financial collapse, Americans have time and again voiced their opposition to the status quo. They deserve to be heard.

"There’s an Arctic heatwave: it’s 38°C in Siberia. Arctic sea ice coverage is the second lowest on record, and 2020 may be on course to be the hottest year since records began. For many people, such news induces a lurch of fear, or avoidance – closing the webpage because they don’t want to hear yet more bad news. A few might think “It’s just weather,” and roll their eyes.  How can we make sense of such an event? Climate is subtle and shifting, with many drivers and timescales. But we can use this northern heatwave to illuminate the complexity of our planet. We can break this question into parts, from fast to slow. Fast: the immediate effect is to increase wildfires. Siberia has seen “zombie fires” reignited from deep smouldering embers in peatland. This is bad news, releasing particulate air pollution and more carbon in 18 months than in the past 16 years. The immediate cause? Here in the mid-high northern latitudes, we live in unstable weather under the influence of the polar jet stream. This rapid current of air high above our heads drags weather in a conveyor belt from west to east, with alternating patches of cold and warm air, low and high pressure. Sometimes the weather patterns get stuck, creating a stable period of weather, like a heatwave. This is one long, severe example. Does climate change make this “blocking” more likely? Maybe. The jet stream is created by the contrast between cold polar air and the warmer south. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average: that means less north-south contrast, so the jet stream can become more wobbly and meandering. Loops break off like the oxbow lakes of school geography lessons, stranding particular weather patterns in one place. And why is the Arctic warming faster? Because sea ice and snow are so bright. When they melt with global warming, the ocean and land beneath are darker, so they absorb more of the sun’s heat. Their loss amplifies our warming. The current low in Arctic sea ice is itself partly the result of the Siberian heatwave, amplifying the usual year-to-year fluctuations. But the trend is down: the more CO2 we emit, the more the planet’s temperature rises, and the more sea ice we lose. Scientists predict the Arctic will start seeing summers without sea ice by 2050. But it’s not irreversible. It’s not a tipping point. The sea ice would return if we could cool the climate again. Unfortunately we know only three ways to do that: extract vast amounts of CO2 from the air with trees or technology; reflect the sun’s rays at a planetary scale; or wait, for many generations. This Arctic heatwave is a sharp spike on top of the global warming trend. That’s what makes it more intense, more likely and more of a warning: it’s a taste of the future predicted for Russia, if we burn quickly through our fossil fuels. The real fear around the Arctic for the longer term, I find when talking to people, comes from the idea of “runaway” warming from methane release. Warming could release stores of methane – a strong greenhouse gas – from permafrost or frozen sediments at the bottom of the ocean, which would add to the warming from our own activities. There is more than twice the amount of carbon in the permafrost as in the atmosphere, and thawing has already begun. There are big local impacts – damage to roads and buildings, because the ground can no longer bear so much weight, and an appalling story involving what appears to be anthrax release from thawing burial grounds. Permafrost thaw was even blamed by a Russian mining company for the recent collapse of a fuel reservoir, contaminating the river with 20,000 tonnes of diesel, though other factors were probably also involved. So could this Siberian heatwave, or ones like it, trigger catastrophic warming? I see much fear about amplifying methane feedbacks, including the false idea that climate scientists don’t consider them (we do, just separately to the main global climate models). Yet for several years there has been growing evidence that this risk is less than originally thought. Carbon stored in permafrost and wetlands is predicted to contribute around 100bn tonnes of CO2 this century. That’s a lot, but we add around 40bn tonnes ourselves every year. The methane at the bottom of the ocean would take centuries to release, so as long as we limit global warming we should keep those stores mostly locked up. There are uncertainties, of course, but the stores’ impact on warming is likely to be tenths of a degree, not several degrees. Yet every tonne of CO2 released from permafrost means one tonne fewer we can emit if we are to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Every year’s equivalent of our emissions brings our deadline closer. Every tenth of a degree of warming brings us closer to our target of 1.5°C and makes more permafrost thaw, and the impacts of climate change worse for the most vulnerable people and species of the world. The Arctic heatwave shows us that there are few simple stories in climate change. There is always a mix of natural and human influence, bad news and slightly-less-bad news, and occasionally even hopeful news. So, more than ever, we need to avoid over-simplifying or slipping into easy tropes like “We’re all doomed” or “It’s all weather,” but to try to understand the details. Perhaps there is one simple story though: every bit of warming we avoid will help keep our planet a more familiar and an easier place to live on. • Dr Tamsin Edwards is a senior lecturer in physical geography at King’s College London"
"While President Trump’s travel ban threw American airports into chaos last weekend, Bob Ferguson, the attorney general of Washington State, was biding his time on an airplane. On his way home from a conference of Democratic attorneys general in Florida, Mr. Ferguson landed a week ago in the center of a political and legal firestorm.   International Airport was in disarray, with protests massing. Gov. Jay Inslee, a fellow Democrat, had sent word to the attorney general’s staff that he wanted to mount a   attack on the president’s decree. Within two days, Mr. Ferguson had become a leading combatant in a battle with the president of the United States, filing a dramatic challenge to Mr. Trump’s travel ban that yielded a ruling from a federal judge on Friday freezing the order’s implementation. A genial    with an earnest demeanor, Mr. Ferguson cuts an unlikely figure as an antagonist for the most pugilistic president in modern times. He is seen in the state less as a   showman than as a former member of the King County Council with a wonky sensibility and an eager manner. But Mr. Ferguson, by his own account and the description of his associates, was incensed and offended by Mr. Trump’s sweeping immigration restrictions. And having landed in Seattle on the first full day the ban was in effect  —   while demonstrations grew across the country  —   he went home to greet his family and then went to work devising a plan to cripple Mr. Trump’s new policy. In an interview, Mr. Ferguson said he had concluded from the start that Mr. Trump’s order was “unlawful and unconstitutional,” and that any appropriate response would have to aim at neutering it entirely. Eschewing the approach of other   states, which have challenged Mr. Trump’s order by highlighting the claims of individual plaintiffs, Mr. Ferguson and his office opted to draft a complaint arguing that the ban would cause drastic damage to Washington State as a whole. Mr. Ferguson said that the state solicitor general, Noah Purcell, a former Supreme Court clerk for David H. Souter, had suggested last weekend that the state enlist major private companies as allies. And so the attorney general spoke by telephone with a host of executives, including the corporate counsels of Expedia and Amazon, who agreed to supply forceful declarations for the state’s suit, describing the damage that the White House order could inflict. Mr. Ferguson said he had recognized at the time that this was a potentially risky approach, seeking a more sweeping victory with a comparatively untested legal strategy. But Mr. Ferguson, a former state chess champion, explained in precise language that he had decided it was a gamble worth taking. “From my standpoint there is risk in everything, but I am someone who believes in calculated risk,” Mr. Ferguson said in the interview. “One just needs to be comfortable with that. And when it comes to the constitutional rights of my people, the people I represent, I’m prepared to take a calculated risk on their behalf. ” Mr. Inslee, also in an interview, said he strongly backed Mr. Ferguson’s approach, viewing Mr. Trump’s order as a unique threat to their state’s economy, which depends heavily on international trade, and to the state’s diverse population. In his view, the governor said, the state was right to make “any plausible claim” to take down the order. Few other states adopted such a daring strategy. Mr. Ferguson said he had invited other Democratic attorneys general to join in his lawsuit, finding only one taker so far: Lori Swanson of Minnesota. Mr. Ferguson said there were other states still weighing whether to join him. Mr. Inslee described the Friday ruling as a special kind of victory for Washington State, which draws relatively little attention in national politics but tends to race ahead of national trends on social issues. “It’s part of our nature and history,” Mr. Inslee said. “This is the first time this administration has been reined in. ”"

It seems that a simple assumption about where to measure CO2 in the ocean surface has drastic implications. via The Hockey Schtick

New paper finds global carbon cycle datasets may be biased
A paper published today in Global Biogeochemical Cycles finds prior calculations of the global carbon cycle may be erroneous because such calculations are based upon partial pressures of CO2 from several meters below the ocean surface instead of CO2 levels at the ocean surface [“the boundary layer”] where CO2 is actually exchanged between the atmosphere and ocean.
The authors find a “strong” CO2 variability between the global datasets measured from several meters below the surface in comparison to the ocean surface that cannot be explained by Henry’s Law alone, and are primarily due to variations in biological activity between these layers. The paper finds higher levels of CO2 in the boundary layer than in the 5 meter deep global datasets, which would suggest that either the oceans are less of a sink for CO2 or a larger source of CO2 to the atmosphere than previously assumed.

The authors recommend, “Observations of pCO2 just beneath the air-sea boundary layer should be further investigated in order to estimate possible biases in calculating global air-sea CO2 fluxes.”
The paper:
Prevalence of strong vertical CO2 and O2 variability in the top meters of the ocean
Maria Ll. Calleja et al

Abstract:
The gradient in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) across the air-sea boundary layer is the main driving force for the air-sea CO2 flux. Global data-bases for surface seawater pCO2 are actually based on pCO2 measurements from several meters below the sea surface, assuming a homogeneous distribution between the diffusive boundary layer and the upper top meters of the ocean.
Compiling vertical profiles of pCO2, Temperature and dissolved oxygen in the upper 5-8 meters of the ocean from different biogeographical areas, we detected a mean difference between the boundary layer and 5 [meters below the surface] pCO2 of 13 ± 1 µatm. Temperature gradients accounted for only 11 % of this pCO2 gradient in the top meters of the ocean, thus, pointing to a heterogeneous biological activity underneath the air-sea boundary layer as the main factor controlling the top meters pCO2 variability.
Observations of pCO2 just beneath the air-sea boundary layer should be further investigated in order to estimate possible biases in calculating global air-sea CO2 fluxes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Younger Dryas – What Happened?
By Ed Caryl
This article looks at a paper by Steinthorsdottir et al.
Was there a time in the last few thousand years when CO2 was as high or higher than today? Yes, there was, at the end of the last ice age during the Younger Dryas (YD) cold period.
What was the temperature during that time? It was much colder than now, as much as 12°C in Greenland.
Did the temperature go up when the CO2 level went up? No, it went down.
About 13,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, after two thousand years of warming, melting ice, and rising sea levels, there was an abrupt reversal; a cold period that lasted over a thousand years. The Younger Dryas is named for an alpine flower, Dryas Octopetala, the pollen of which is found in northern tundra areas during this time.
It is thought that the Younger Dryas (YD) was caused by the collapse of the northern ice sheets, changing the North Atlantic Overturning Currents. One theory is that the ice sheet collapse was triggered by a comet or meteor strike. The evidence is a layer of nano-diamonds (ND) that are found in North America and Europe at about the beginning of the YD. In that layer there are soot deposits and platinum group metals indicating an extraterrestrial source that caused large forest fires.
A recent paper, Stomatal proxy record of CO2 concentrations from the last termination suggests an important role for CO2 at climate change transitions, covers the YD period, and as the title suggests, claims a role for CO2 in the temperature changes of this period. The southern Sweden Dwarf Birch stomatal proxy record has a higher time resolution than the ice core CO2 records of this period, showing a higher variability with a resolution of around 100 years.
What follows is a plot of that period with their stomata data with two assumptions of the baseline Holocene CO2 value, the Greenland ice core temperature record, and a marker for the ND event.


(GISP2), with the nano-diamond event marked. Time is passing right to left. The orange points assume a 280 ppm Holocene baseline, and the red points assume a 300 ppm Holocene baseline. The red and orange dashes are the standard error bars for the corresponding measured points.The horizontal error bars indicate a ± 150 year uncertainty in the C14 dating for the stomata based on C14 error in Figure 2 here. The purple diamond and vertical line is the nano-diamond event at 12,877 ± 3.4 calendar years Before Present (BP) based on ice core annual layer data from Greenland.
It should be noted that the Greenland ice core dating is very accurate, as the annual layers have been counted. So the temperature dating and the nano-diamond layer in the ice are known to less than ± 5 years accuracy. Figure 1 indicates that the YD cooling began 100 years before the ND event. This paper claims a C14 age error of ± 55 to 60 years, but other calibration sources are far wider. An error of 150 years puts the CO2 spike within the era of the ND source. The CO2 spike is likely the result of large fires resulting from the comet or meteor strike.
The timeline runs like this, from the oldest event on the right, to the newest on the left:
14200 BP is the approximate time of meltwater pulse 1a, at about the time of the peak in the Bølling oscillation. (This date is not on this plot.) For sea level in this era see here.
13,600 Before Present (BP, from the year 2000), is a warm peak of the Bølling oscillation.
13,200 BP, is the coldest point of the Older Dryas cold period.
13,000 BP, is the warmest peak of the Allerød oscillation.

12,970 BP is the beginning of the YD cooling.
12,877 BP is the date of the Nano-Diamond event.
12,750 BP is the approximate date of the CO2 peak at about 400 ppm.
12,700 BP is the coldest point of the YD.
11,850 BP is the date of the lowest CO2 value at about 180 ppm and the approximate end of the YD. In the next 250 years, Greenland temperatures rose 12°C.
11,600 BP is the time of meltwater pulse 1b, at the peak temperature at the left on this plot.
Important points to be noted in this data:
1. The ND event did not trigger the ice sheet collapse. The ice sheet collapse happened 1300 years later. The dating of Meltwater Pulse 1b is 11,600 years BP, well after the ND event, and 1400 years after the beginning of the YD cooling.
2. The ND event DID trigger a massive increase in CO2, to 400 or 425 ppm, depending on the baseline used, that lasted for less than 40 years. Those values have standard errors of ± 1.2 ppm because the additional CO2 caused increased biomass, providing a larger sample.
2a. That increase in CO2 did not cause a warming period in the YD. It continued to cool after the ND event.
2b. That increase in CO2 lasted less than 40 years based on the time resolution of the stomata data. Thus large amounts of CO2 are not persistent in the atmosphere for a thousand years as some in climate science claim.
3. There is no evidence in this data that CO2 drives temperature. On this plot, CO2 and temperature tend to go in opposite directions more than in the same direction.
4. The paper does acknowledge that CO2 stimulates plant growth. Their paper states that organic matter in their core samples rose during the higher CO2 period from around 20% to a peak of 35%.
The Antarctic ice core CO2 data is very poor at resolving rapid CO2 changes. Here is the best resolution CO2 plot from Dome C in Antarctica. The large changes in the stomata data are not reflected in the ice core data. The average value is the same at about 240 ppm.

Figures 2a and 2b are the Dome C CO2 data. The red dot marks 12800 BP. Figure 2b is an enlargement of the YD time circled in 2a.
This paper made the usual assumptions that CO2 drives temperature, but they picked the Antarctic ice core temperature data that agrees with their assumptions instead of the much closer and more detailed Greenland ice core data that does not. They failed to investigate the large CO2 spike in their data that exceeds modern values in an era where humanity played little part in the world. Their assumptions forced them to miss the important facts that the stomata data revealed.

"Emmanuel Macron has promised an extra €15bn (£13.7bn) for measures to combat the climate crisis over the next two years and a referendum on whether to introduce the crime of “ecocide” for harming the environment. The measures were announced just hours after environmental candidates sparked a green wave across France with major gains in local elections in which the president’s governing party failed to make its mark. At a meeting with members of the Citizens’ Commission for the Climate – a committee of 150 randomly chosen French people that reported back after a nine-month deliberation last week – Macron promised extra funding and strong measures. He said he accepted all but three of the 149 recommendations put forward by the commission. Macron said he hoped to implement the measures immediately and a new law would be drawn up before the end of summer. He congratulated the commission for having “made the choice of putting ecology at the heart of our economic model”, but rejected its suggestion for a “dividend tax” on investments and postponed a debate on whether to introduce a 110km/h speed limit on French roads. The Citizens’ Commission for the Climate is part of a democratic experiment in France where a group of citizens, ranging from teenage school pupils to bus drivers and retired railway staff, were asked to define government environmental policy for the remaining two years of Macron’s mandate – and specifically how to cut the country’s carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. It came up with proposals grouped under five main themes: transport, housing, work and production, food, and consumption of natural resources. The results of France’s municipal elections in which the environmental party Europe Écologie Les Verts made significant gains in a vote marked by the coronavirus crisis and historic abstention, made Macron’s response even more crucial for his centrist La République en Marche party (La REM). The vote was a predictable blow to La REM, which has fractured France’s political landscape nationally but made little headway in local elections outside Paris or in “la France profonde”. The ecologists took several major cities including Lyon, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Marseille and Besançon, and many other large towns in Sunday’s vote. In Paris, where the Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, in alliance with EELV, was reelected with a significant majority on a programme that prioritised tackling pollution, the climate crisis and clean energy. The environmentalist and MEP Yannick Jadot said the result was a “redrawing of the political landscape” around ecological issues. “People are trying to make sense of things, our way of life, our housing, the density of cities, food, travel, solidarity, new democratic methods … Part of the population has a wish, a desire, for real change in our societies that is socially and economically realistic,” Jadot told Ouest-France newspaper. “There will obviously be a before and after the 2020 local elections. It’s a real political turn in our country,” he said. Greenpeace accused Macron of watering down the commission’s proposals using “jokers” to get out of important measures. “The message sent by the municipal elections is clear: ecology and the climate crisis are no longer only a distant preoccupation for French people, but a political priority that must result in acts, concrete measures and a general goal in keeping with the Paris climate accord. The Citizen’s Commission has said the same thing and it will need more than a lovely speech from the Elysée to satisfy the deep expectations,” said Jean-François Julliard, the director general of Greenpeace France. Clément Sénéchal, responsible for Greenpeace France’s climate campaign, said the government could make its actions match the president’s words by making state aid for coronavirus-hit businesses, including carmakers and airlines, dependent on their willingness to introduce “social and environmental measures”. “This would force polluting businesses to change their model and get behind the Paris agreement,” Sénéchal said. The president is widely reported to be considering a government reshuffle including the firing of his popular prime minister, Édouard Philippe, who was elected mayor of Le Havre on Sunday."
"Most have heard of the Battle of Waterloo, but who has heard of the volcano called Tambora? No school textbook I’ve seen mentions that only two months before Napoleon’s final defeat in Belgium on June 18, 1815, the faraway Indonesian island of Sumbawa was the site of the most devastating volcanic eruption on Earth in thousands of years. The death toll claimed around 100,000 people, from the thick pyroclastic flows of lava, from the tsunami that struck nearby coasts, and from the thick ash that blanketed South-East Asia’s farmlands, destroyed crops and plunged it into darkness for a week. Both events – Napoleon’s defeat and the eruption – had monumental impacts on human history. But while a library of scholarship has been devoted to Napoleon’s undoing at Waterloo, the scattered writings on Tambora would scarcely fill your in-tray. This extraordinary geological event took place 199 years ago this week, and on the cusp of its bicentenary Tambora is finally getting its due. With the help of modern scientific instruments and old-fashioned archival detective work, the Tambora 1815 eruption can be conclusively placed among the greatest environmental disasters ever to befall mankind. The floods, droughts, starvation, and disease in the three years following the eruption stem from the volcano’s effects on weather systems, so Tambora stands today as a harrowing case study of what the human costs and global reach might be from runaway climate change. Tambora’s greatest claim to infamy lies not in the impact it had on what was then the Dutch East Indies (which were terrible enough), but its indirect effects on the disease ecology of the Bay of Bengal. The enormous cloud of sulfate gases Tambora ejected into the atmosphere slowed the development of the Indian monsoon, the world’s largest weather system, for the following two years. Drought brought on by the eruption devastated crop yields across the Indian sub-continent, but more disastrously gave rise to a new and deadly strain of cholera. Cholera had always been endemic to Bengal, but the bizarre weather of 1816-17 triggered by Tambora’s eruption – first drought, then late, unseasonal flooding – altered the microbial ecology of the Bay of Bengal. The cholera bacterium, which has an unusually adaptive genetic structure highly sensitive to changes in its aquatic environment, mutated into a new strain. This met with no resistance among the local population, and it spread across Asia and eventually the globe. By century’s end, the death toll from Bengal cholera stood in the tens of millions. Just as the biological disaster known as the Black Death defined the 14th century in Europe and the Near East, so cholera shaped the nineteenth century like no other calamity. Much of our medical science, and our modern public health institutions, originate in the Victorian-era battle against cholera. But only now, thanks to renewed scientific interest in the relation between cholera and climate change, can we make the connection between the worldwide cholera epidemic originating in 1817 and Tambora’s eruption thousands of miles away. Tambora’s ripple effects were felt across the globe. In southwest China, the outlying mountainous province of Yunnan suffered terribly from the cold volcanic weather, losing crop after crop of rice to bitter winds and flooding rains. The situation was so extreme that desperate Yunnanese resorted to eating white clay, while parents sold their children in the town markets, or killed them out of mercy. In the aftermath of this three-year famine, Yunnan farmers turned to a more reliable cash crop – opium – to ensure their families’ survival against future disasters. Within a few decades, opium was being grown all across Yunnan, while opium processing technology and expertise drifted south into the remote mountains of modern-day Burma and Laos. The “golden triangle” of international opium production was born. If the Tambora disaster persists in cultural memory at all, it is as the “Year Without a Summer,” 1816, the most notorious and best chronicled extreme weather event of that century. Snowstorms swept the east coast in June, ensuring the shortest growing season on record. Crowds of desperate and hungry rural folk from Maine and Vermont fled snowfalls of up to 18 inches to the western frontier, which had been spared the worst of Tambora’s weather. Here grain harvests were fetching sky-high prices on the famine-struck Atlantic market, but after the boom came a shattering bust – the so-called Panic of 1819 – which triggered the first sustained economic depression in US history. East coast speculators had invested hugely in western agriculture post-1816, only to lose their shirts when the similarly-affected European grain markets returned to normal in 1819, and commodity prices plummeted. “Never were such hard times,” wrote Thomas Jefferson of ordinary Americans who, across the country, found themselves “in a condition of unparalleled distress,” persisting well into the 1820s. As it turns out, however, the indirect ripple effects of Tambora – what climate scientists call “teleconnections” – were even more historically significant. Cholera, opium, and the Panic of 1819 are three examples; another is Arctic exploration. One of the paradoxical effects of a major tropical eruption is that while the planet in general is cooled by the blanket of volcanic dust that drifts from the equator to the poles, the Arctic itself is drastically warmed owing to changes in wind circulation and north Atlantic ocean currents. This anomaly was only discovered after the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the tropical Philippines, the first observed with the benefit of modern climatological instruments. In 1817 and 1818, the British Admiralty began to receive exciting reports from whaling captains of a remarkable loss of sea ice in around Greenland. Huge icebergs from a broken icepack were spotted floating as far south as Ireland and New York. The prospect of a northwest passage for shipping to the East – a holy grail England had sought since Elizabethan times – beckoned once more. With a generation’s naval captains still hungry for glory but now languishing onshore after the defeat of Napoleon, the Admiralty launched an expensive and ultimately disastrous 50-year-long campaign to chart the elusive northwest passage. The British could not have known then, of course, that Tambora had caused the Arctic to melt, and that the climatic impacts of a tropical eruption persist for no longer than three years. The Arctic refroze just in time for the arrival of Britain’s first polar expedition under Captain John Ross in 1818. Years of fruitless, icebound sallies into the polar seas culminated in the tragic Franklin expedition of the 1840s, when all hands were lost, and the heroic age of British Arctic exploration came to an end. It is time to recognise Tambora as the Napoleon of eruptions. The implications – for historians – of a revised, volcanic nineteenth century are immense. As with the global cholera epidemic, and the growth of a Chinese opium empire, Victorian-era polar exploration might not have happened at all, or would have evolved in an entirely different direction, had it not been for Tambora’s climate-wrecking detonation in 1815. For two long centuries, the connections between this major volcanic disaster and human history have been obscured by two factors: the limitations of scientific knowledge, and by our narrow, anthropocentric vision that seeks out only human causes for human events, neglecting the influence of environmental change. Now, in the 21st century, as we begin to appreciate more profoundly the interdependence of human and natural systems, the lesson of a 200-year-old climate emergency may finally be learned: a changing climate changes everything."

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi at the Weatherbell Analytics Saturday Summary site sharply criticizes NOAA’s ongoing claims of all time high global temperatures being reached, the latest this past November.
Early in the video the Weatherbell expert says NOAA has a habit of ignoring the other many (cooler) datasets and jumping on the warmest one they can find:
One thing I want to try to sort of stop here is this whole, you know, record warmth ever type thing; I can’t help what NOAA does. Basically they use a database that, that I don’t what exactly they are up to, except for part of that database has pre-satellite temperatures. It is a much more coarse grid then say their NCEP database. And there are many ways of measuring the global temperature and NOAA has been in the habit of jumping on the one that is the warmest.”
Joe then shows an entire series of NCEP November global temperature charts for most years going back to 1997. Using the results for each year, I slapped together the following chart to show the overall trend for November. So much for the NOAA’s “record warmth”.

Global November temperature anomaly versus the year. From NCEP data. Note that Joe did not show the 2011 result, so a straight line was drawn from 2012 to 2010.
Although cold snaps, blizzards, record sea ice, ice in lakes in July, harsher winters, etc. are mere anecdotes, their increasing frequency globally flies in the face of the claims of record warmth repeated every month by NOAA. When compared to observations on the ground and other datasets, NOAA’s claims are looking more and more like the scientific propaganda one expects of a rogue government institute obsessed in a hypothesis and bent on misleading citizens.
The above chart clearly shows that the November trend is considerably downward – with a trend of more than 2°C cooling per century having occurred since the beginning of the century.
Given that the reality on the ground contradicts the weird claims made by the NOAA, the new Republican controlled Congress should start an investigation into the inner workings of the organization. The American taxpayer deserves much better.

"**Hurricane Maria killed more than 4,600 people in Puerto Rico, 70 times the official toll, according to estimates in a Harvard University study.**
A third of deaths after September's hurricane were due to interruptions in medical care caused by power cuts and broken road links, researchers say.
The Puerto Rico government said it ""always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported"".
The official death toll stands at 64.
But experts say an accurate count was complicated by the widespread devastation wreaked by the storm.
Carlos Mercader from Puerto Rico's Federal Affairs Administration said he welcomed the Harvard survey.
""The magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities,"" he said.
He added that the island's authorities had also commissioned George Washington University to study the number of deaths and these findings would be released soon.
""Both studies will help us better prepare for future natural disasters and prevent lives from being lost,"" he said.
The Harvard researchers said interviews conducted in Puerto Rico suggested a 60% increase in mortality in the three months after the storm.
They contacted more than 3,000 randomly selected households between January and March this year and asked about displacement, infrastructure loss and causes of death.
**Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, Washington**
Many Puerto Ricans we spoke to felt their immense suffering after the hurricane had been trivialised and that the emergency response has been lacklustre.
A relatively small number of people may have been killed by the physical impact of the storm, but six months later we met people who had lost relatives as a result of interrupted medical care and saw others struggling to pay for expensive generators on which they were running vital life support equipment.
There was also reported to have been a spike in the number of suicides. We found many still without homes and thousands who had been living without electricity since the day Hurricane Maria struck.
Whatever the true number of those killed as a result of the storm, it is now certain to be many times the official figure. The question for US authorities about Puerto Rico, an American territory, is how many of those deaths could have been prevented with a better emergency response?
They then compared their results with the official mortality rates for the same period in 2016, more than a year before the hurricane struck the island.
The researchers said that interrupted medical care was the ""primary cause of sustained high mortality rates in the months after the hurricane"".
Disruption to health care was a ""growing contributor to both morbidity and mortality"" in natural disasters, they said, because growing numbers of patients had chronic diseases and used sophisticated equipment that relied on electricity.
On Twitter, several users noted that the death toll exceeds the nearly 3,000 Americans that were killed during the 9/11 attacks.
The mayor of San Juan, the largest city in Puerto Rico, tweeted that ""the negligence that contributed to [the deaths] cannot be forgotten.
Carmen Yulin Cruz added that the death toll is ""a violation of our human rights"".
Hurricane Maria caused the largest blackout in US history, according to research consultancy the Rhodium Group.
There have also been repeated power cuts since then, including an island-wide one in April, nearly seven months after the hurricane.
Overall, Hurricane Maria caused losses of $90bn (Â£68bn), the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said.
The Caribbean island is home to 3.4 million US citizens."
"Contrary to the film of DreamWorks’ imagining, Madagascar is not ruled by King Julien and his colony of lemurs. In fact the status of the lemurs on the island – the only place on earth that they exist – is a very precarious one. To try to reverse the frightening fact that 94% of lemur species are under threat, myself and lemur experts around the world have issued a renewed action plan for their conservation. We highlight three key ways to save lemurs: community-based conservation management, the long-term presence of researchers at field sites, and ecotourism. While the action plan separately identifies these three areas, they do not exist independently of each other. In particular, community-based conservation management and ecotourism have the potential to work very well together. Madagascar’s political problems have helped make lemur species the most endangered group of mammals on the planet. A coup d’état in early 2009 left the island nation with a ruling regime that was not recognised internationally and a regime leader too young under Madagascar’s constitution to assume the presidency. Western nations warned their nationals against all but essential travel to Madagascar and tourism to the world’s fourth largest island plummeted overnight.  There are currently 106 species of lemurs in Madagascar (new species continue to be discovered) and their natural forest habitats especially suffered from this political turmoil. Increased banditry, illegal logging in national parks and nature reserves, and a sharp increase in the hunting of lemurs as “bush meat” has left them facing extinction.   Ecotourism can allow rural communities in Madagascar to earn revenue for protecting lemur habitats; create economic incentives and benefits for local residents; and facilitate locally supported conservation efforts. Also, ecotourists can be educated and gain insight into the special biological and cultural qualities of the region. Organised from the bottom up, ecotourism can be sensitive to local concerns and be a sustainable form of development. Ecotourism is not always the answer to conservation problems. But if implemented with careful planning, and as a part of a broader conservation strategy, it can be one tool among many to address conservation issues. Much research shows that ecotourism can be effective when part of a community-based conservation approach.  It is this broad approach that is proposed in the new conservation plan. While Madagascar is one of the world’s top biodiversity hotspots, lemurs easily represent the country’s “brand” for drawing ecotourists. The success of Rwanda’s and Uganda’s mountain gorilla ecotourism ventures shows that ecotourists are certainly willing to pay a premium to observe rare species in their natural habitat – Madagascar can provide that in spades. One success story that can serve as a model for promoting lemur and forest conservation at other sites across Madagascar is centred on Maromizaha Forest in the eastern part of the island. This vast forest is rich in biodiversity, including no fewer than 13 lemur species. With good transport links to the capital and the east coast, Maromizaha is readily accessible to ecotourists who want to do a bit of hiking. Outreach to the local community has included building a multi-purpose interpretive centre, training several villagers as guides and making English and French courses available to them.   Researchers from universities around the world have worked with local schools to develop a heightened appreciation of the unique biodiversity there. They have also suggested new agricultural techniques and methods of crop production to the community.  These new developments have been welcomed by the local people, as they have seen their quality of life improve. While just eight visitors came to visit Maromizaha Forest in 2008, by 2,011 that number had increased to 208. The project has developed into an important source of income for the local community. If Madagascar’s political landscape can remain stable in the future, there will be opportunities for many stories like this one. To be successful, ecotourism ventures must include a significant degree of participation from local communities. This means working with individuals in the community, with local groups and existing NGOs and helping authorities enforce the boundaries of forest reserves and protected areas.  Maintaining a long-term presence of field researchers can help build relationships with local communities, as well as providing feedback on how projects are going. By training up locals, researchers could at some point step back and let the communities themselves sustainably run ecotourist operations. The new plan represents a coordinated conservation strategy. The plan requires engagement with local communities, ecotourism and the long term participation of field researchers. It is actually a combination of 30 action plans, each targeting different sites of importance for lemur conservation. Notably, a huge amount of land could be conserved for a relatively small amount of international aid (US$7.6 million). Ecotourism driven by lemurs, along with research inspired by them, would contribute significantly to that cost."
"A vast tarpaulin unravels, gathering speed as it bounces down the glacier over glinting snow. Summer is here and the alpine ice is being protected from global warming. In northern Italy, the Presena glacier has lost more than one third of its volume since 1993.  Once the ski season is over and cable cars are berthed, conservationists race to try and stop it melting by using white tarps that block the sun’s rays. “This area is continuously shrinking, so we cover as much of it as possible,” explains Davide Panizza, 34, who heads the Carosello-Tonale company that does the work. From covering around 30,000 sq metres in 2008 when the project began, his team now places 100,000 sq metres under wraps. The coverings are “geotextile tarpaulins that reflect sunlight, maintaining a temperature lower than the external one, and thus preserving as much snow as possible,” he told AFP. On the border between the Lombardy and Trentino Alto Adige regions, workers unroll the sheets in long strips, covering an area at an altitude of 2700-3000m. They move methodically down the mountain under clear blue skies to pull the coverings taut, and sew them together to ensure warm drafts do not slip underneath. Bags of sand then act as anchors against the wind. Once in place, the sheets, which measure 70m by 5m, are hardly distinguishable from the packed white snow beneath. “There are glacier cover systems similar to ours on a few Austrian glaciers, but the surface covered by the tarpaulins is much smaller,” Panizza said. The Austrian-made tarps cost up to €400 ($450) each and it takes the team six weeks to install them – and another six weeks to remove them before winter sets in again. Franco Del Pero, 48, leads the operation and says technological improvements mean contemporary tarps protect better than earlier versions. “When we remove them in September and we see that they did their job, we feel proud,” he says."

Classical liberal doctrine is often conflated with the “laissez‐​faire” perspective that advocates for a larger market sphere and a smaller government sphere. That conflation, however, neglects the work of classical liberal scholars such as Friedrich A. Hayek and James M. Buchanan, who both spent a great deal of their careers investigating the economic _and political_ institutional arrangements — and the social‐​choice processes governing those institutions — that engender a prosperous and free society. In fact, Hayek and Buchanan both posited that governments had institutional superiority over the market for some collective‐​choice issues. Furthermore, classical liberal scholars did not simply complete their analysis with a market‐​or‐​state dichotomy. They recognized that, in the real world, the lines between markets are “fuzzy” and often overlap. Moreover, the market‐​or‐​state dichotomy neglects the “third sector,” civil society, which also needs to be analyzed and compared.



The writings of Hayek, Buchanan, and other classical liberals are often missed or misinterpreted, leaving the classical liberal position on public governance unknown, unarticulated, and understudied. In their book _Public Governance and the Classical‐​Liberal Perspective: Political Economy Foundations_ , Paul Dragos Aligica, Peter J. Boettke, and Vlad Tarko seek to fill this gap in the literature by synthesizing the work of the aforementioned scholars and others in order to articulate a theory of public governance in the classical liberal perspective. The authors do so in three parts.



Part I aims to present the basic “building blocks” of public governance that are exegetical with classical liberalism: governance theory, applied governance theory, and institutional design principles. These building blocks serve as a foundation for the latter two parts, so a summary of them is warranted.



The first building block consists of governance theory elements: normative individualism, skepticism of social aggregate functions, and comparative institutional analysis. The authors explain how each of these three components reinforces each other, once analyzed. Normative individualism places a normative emphasis on the individual being the correct unit of analysis and is skeptical of social aggregate functions, a skepticism most famously posited by a scholar who didn’t identify as a classical liberal, economist Kenneth Arrow. Arrow’s “Impossibility Theorem” stated that individual preferences could not be collectively aggregated through democratic procedures. Therefore, since individual preferences cannot be aggregated, individual preferences ought to be the focus, which is what normative individualism holds. Moreover, using public choice’s emphasis on “behavioral symmetry,” the authors use normative individualism to introduce the concept of comparative institutional analysis. Comparative institutional analysis examines which institutional arrangement — markets, governments, or civil society — fails the least in securing the diverse aims of all individuals.



Using those theoretical building blocks, the authors move to applied theory to examine how individuals interact at the public‐​private interface. Focusing on that interface helps break down the market‐​or‐​state dichotomy and sheds light on institutions that are a combination of markets and governments, or neither, such as civil society. Civil society institutional arrangements can be dictated by various things, such as the nature of the good, efficiency, or technology. But the authors describe a more important and interesting factor: how individuals react to these changes. If a critical mass of citizens has values, beliefs, or ideas about how something should be provided, the nature of the good, technology, or efficiency may not matter. The insights of Vincent Ostrom help demonstrate this. Ostrom emphasized values, beliefs, and ideas, which he recognized were subjective and often divergent per person. Those differences are not necessarily a problem, however, as pluralism is a paramount tenet of classical liberalism.



In the last chapter of Part I, the authors use the theories of the previous chapters to investigate the institutional arrangements and devices that “encourage and help individuals to self‐​organize and associate at different levels, in ways that they see as most effective for realizing their individual and collective goals,” in particular dynamism, adaptiveness, and flexibility. To observe the dynamics of institutions, the focus ought to be on processes rather than on end‐​states. They cite Vincent and Elinor Ostrom’s work on “polycentric” institutions — overlapping, competing, and cooperating centers of power, which often duplicate services and take place in both the private and public sphere. The Ostroms argued that polycentric institutions are more dynamic than “monocentric” or centralized ones because polycentricity elicits competition. Competition then engenders experimentation, trial and error, and self‐​correction, or dynamism, adaptability, and flexibility. Polycentric institutions are also better at self‐​correction. The authors cite Vincent Ostrom’s and F. A. Hayek’s emphasis on the epistemic features of institutions. By allowing for overlapping systems that self‐​correct, each individual’s diverse and disparate knowledge can be spread better throughout and made use of in society. Here we see a return to normative individualism through epistemology.



Part II diverts from the theoretical discussion to examine the confluence of public choice and public administration during the 1960s and the transformation of both traditions. Public choice was the intellectual bearer of the classical liberal ethos during the time this confluence took place in the 1960s, thus the authors thought it important to review the connection.



Chapter four begins with a brief history of public administration, starting with the monocentric bureaucratic view of Woodrow Wilson. Wilson’s thesis, broadly conceived, was to centralize power. Having more power meant more responsibility and accountability, and, by giving one person power, Wilson argued that power would not be abused but rather the leader would be “elevated by it.” Wilson deemed separating power, as our Founders intended, “irresponsible.” Wilson’s position is antithetical to classical liberalism.



The authors then continue the history of scholarship in the field up until its main challenger, Vincent Ostrom. Ostrom repudiated the mainstream work of public administration at the time, which included Wilson’s monocentric view, by bringing public choice — the intellectual apparatus of classical ethos at the time — into the analysis. Using public choice, Ostrom theorized a democratic, as opposed to bureaucratic, administration that promoted self‐​governance, competition, pluralism, and polycentricity. Ostrom’s work helped shift the field of public administration by “revitalizing Madisonian federalism and Tocquevillian democracy,” both of which have classical liberal roots.



The last chapter in Part II discusses the work of both Elinor and Vincent Ostrom and what separates them both — but mainly Vincent — from other public‐​choice scholars: their epistemology and ontology and their focus on diverse values, beliefs, and ideas. The Ostroms used a production theory termed “co‐​production” — which posits that consumers are an important input for production — to deal with the difficulties that can arise from the heterogeneity of values, beliefs, and ideas. Co‐​production can be extended to citizens’ values, as they are an important input to determine what governance arrangements are needed to meet them. However, the shapes of co‐​production curves are unknown, meaning that co‐​production produces a “market failure.” The Ostroms proposed that polycentric institutions can overcome this market failure. As previously discussed, polycentricity allows for duplication, trial and error, competition, and coordination among governance levels. These aspects of polycentricity elicit diverse, overlapping institutions that allow heterogeneous values to be met. Hence, polycentricity produces institutions that dovetail with classical liberal goals.



Essentially, the authors use Part II to posit that the Ostroms’ scholarship, despite their not explicitly identifying as classical liberals, fits within the classical liberal tradition. The authors then use the Ostroms’ work as a major foundation in Part III, which applies the first two parts of the book to articulate the classical liberal perspective on real‐​world governance issues.



The first study is on community policing, one of the metropolitan governance research projects done by the Ostroms. Their project empirically demonstrated that polycentric police systems are more efficient and responsive to their communities than are monocentric, centralized ones. While the Ostroms didn’t say so explicitly, they invoked the concept of co‐​production by arguing that polycentric police systems make better use of aggregate knowledge and goals determined by citizens’ responsiveness.



Next, the authors use comparative institutional analysis and public choice to examine independent regulatory agencies (IRAs). IRAs typically form because they are one solution to “common‐​pool resource” issues, which are both controversial and difficult to decentralize. The common criticism of IRAs is that they are “undemocratic” and therefore their functions ought to be returned to Congress. However, the authors believe this might worsen the rampant inefficiency, corruption, and rent seeking currently in IRAs. Rather, the authors present two solutions from the classical liberal perspective. One is to use the Internet to increase the pool of experts and knowledge‐​aggregation mechanisms in IRAs. The second is to turn IRAs into private certification firms, a polycentric solution and therefore more efficient and resilient. A certification firm called the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), whose accreditation system came about as a private industry solution when different states had disparate and conflicting regulations, is cited as an example. ASME’s safety code system is more robust than state and federal codes, and almost all global buyers of industrial equipment require ASME’s accreditation. Hence, this presents a feasible polycentric alternative to accreditation‐​type IRAs, such as the FDA or OSHA.



With this recommendation, however, the authors may have a problem. They write that “private certification companies cannot be easily corrupted because if an unsafe product is certified, they risk losing their reputation.” Yet later in the chapter they describe how ASME faced an antitrust lawsuit for enforcing a code that disadvantaged non‐​US producers. While some private accreditation agencies may not be easily corrupted, it seems that sometimes private certification companies give special favors to companies based on personal connections, bribery, or other means. While the authors describe what happens when a private certification company approves unsafe products, they don’t discuss the possibility of not certifying _safe_ products because of favoritism. As the authors mention, discrimination (or favoritism) is more relevant in a monopoly situation in which there is only one accreditation company. Therefore, this might be more of a monopoly problem than a problem with private certification companies. However, since corruption is, in fact, possible in monopolies and nonmonopolies, rather than saying that these companies “cannot be easily corrupted,” the argument could be made stronger by stating that the private certification companies cannot be as easily corrupted as the current system of IRAs.



Chapter 9 presents what the authors describe as a classical liberal theory for corporate social responsibility (CSR): polycentric stakeholder analysis (PSA). PSA differs from other CSR theories because it considers both heterogeneity of values of individuals, not groups, and the complex emergence of systems. PSA challenges Milton Friedman’s claim that a business’s only responsibility is to maximize profits for shareholders. The authors argue that businesses can voluntarily deal with social issues; in fact, they can sometimes deal with them better than governments. The polycentric framework of PSA, with its multiple centers of decisionmaking that elicit innovation and dynamism, allows for businesses to pursue CSR when there’s a heterogeneity of values by an efficient proportion of stakeholders.



In the conclusion, the authors describe how contemporary public administration literature has started to converge closer to the classical liberal ethos. That isn’t surprising given the evolution in the field led by the public‐​choice revolution, but it is a promising discovery for both classical liberalism and public governance. Further, this should give classical liberals in academia some hope. Although we are the minority — and the academic climate is not particularly affable to classical liberalism — our ideas can be taken seriously and engrained into the mainstream.



On the point of the academic climate, one might wonder why the authors wrote a book that presented an ideological perspective rather than just a book that formulated a governance theory. In fact, the authors say in the introduction that they received this question as feedback, but they felt that classical liberalism’s tenets have a strong intellectual history in governance. Therefore, classical liberal influence ought not be cloaked but be championed.



This argument is the most valuable part of the book. In the introduction the authors not only explain that they wrote the book to articulate a classical liberal perspective on public governance, but also defend incorporating classical liberalism in their theory by stating, “The programmatic normative individualism and the associated intellectual and institutional apparatus meant to reflect and _protect_ it are not something new” (emphasis added). The authors’ mention of “protect” in reference to the intellectual apparatus of normative individualism — among which includes classical liberalism — brings to mind a quote by James M. Buchanan. In a lecture titled _Notes_ _on_ _Hayek_ , Buchanan argued for the importance of spreading ideas of a “free society” in academia:



That’s what Aligica, Boettke, and Tarko accomplish in this book. They incorporate scholars from all the schools Buchanan mentioned: Armen Alchian for property rights; Ronald Coase for property rights and law and economics; Buchanan, the Ostroms, and Gordon Tullock for public choice; and F. A. Hayek for the Austrian subjectivist approach. By heeding Buchanan’s advice, intentionally or unintentionally, the authors carried on the mantle of Hayek, Buchanan, and classical liberals before and after them in protecting and spreading the classical liberal intellectual framework and creed. This gives current and aspiring academics some valuable inspiration to continue to also carry this mantle during our polarized academic climate.



More important, the book is valuable in that it helps not just academics but also interested citizens better understand the classical liberal perspective on public governance. A better understanding of classical liberalism is paramount for citizens in a political climate that is increasingly approaching “Orwellian newspeak” with political propaganda misrepresenting political ideologies. Thus, this book helps correct the notion that classical liberalism is simply “laissez‐​faire,” and shows that it is a perspective that touts and supports the institutions of democratic self‐​governance that allow individuals to live peacefully and freely among each other.

The CoL has quietly kicked to the kerb the idea of **making all government vehicles (where practicable)** **electric by 2025**. 



“Although it was repeated as recently as June, that goal has been very quietly revised to a commitment that, **after mid-2025, all _new_ vehicles entering the fleet will be emissions-free.”**



Marc Daalder, writing for Newsroom, says:



“Making the government fleet fully emissions-free would have been a daunting task, even with the “where practicable” caveat. The Government’s progress so far has been abysmal. 



Out of around 15,000 vehicles, **less than half of a percent of the Government’s fleet is electric.** This has been the case for at least the past nine months, according to data from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.”



Given our PTPM’s insistence on there being a climate emergency as recently as last week – when she took the UN podium following Thunderpants’ address – why the down grade? 



Is it par for the course, ie the usual CoL downhill trend, from KiwiFail to EVFail? 



Did they finally ask themselves why more people aren’t investing in EVs? 



Or could it be that they eventually did their sums and added up the lost fuel taxes which, according to David Seymour add up to around $20,000 per fossil fuelled vehicle.



“Motorists already pay an ETS charge of approximately 6c per litre when buying petrol. They then pay a further 64c of other taxes and, in Auckland, a further 10c regional fuel tax. GST is charged on top of those costs, taking the total tax per litre to around 81c per litre (and 92c in Auckland). Purchasers of electric vehicles are already absolved of at least 80c per litre in tax on their fuel. 



The Green Party has long (incorrectly) argued that tax treatment of oil and gas exploration amounts to a subsidy to the industry **. They cannot deny, then, that avoiding petrol taxes is already a major subsidy to electric vehicles.**



Over the lifetime of a vehicle, the subsidy to electric vehicles is already very large. The driver of a Toyota Corolla that travels 300,000km at 8L/100km will pay approximately **$20,000 of fuel tax over its life time** (80c/L x 8L/100km x 300,000km). For less efficient vehicles, the lifetime subsidy is much larger.”



Naturally, the greens are purple in the face about the government back down.



“Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Amanda Larsson criticised the decision. “The Government’s quiet back down on electrifying its vehicle fleet is surprising and incredibly disappointing,” she said. 



This is a **climate emergency** and the Government should be leading by example to cut our dependence on the dirty fuels driving this crisis.”



The wheels have fallen off the CoL’s foray into EVs.



“The Government might consider that electric vehicles are a very expensive way of reducing emissions already, and avoid putting further money into such an ineffective approach. 



“The ‘social justice’ wing of the Green Party might ask why the party is prepared to put even more cost onto those who drive cheap, reliable cars such as petrol powered Toyota Corollas, just so the ‘environmental’ wing can try out a Tesla.”



David Seymour was three months ahead of the CoL in arriving at his conclusion.

The IPCC AR5 falls flat  
Dr. Judith Curry has been making some heavy hitting commentary, we’ll lead with some of those:
IPCC’s pause ‘logic’
Well here it is, the pause discussion is buried in Box 9.2 of the IPCC Working Group I Report.
The Final Draft SPM summed it up correctly as:
“Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10 –15 years.”
Which of course disappeared in the Final version of the SPM.  Before your head starts spinning trying to make sense of the WGI Report text, here is the main summary point IMO:
==============================================================
IPCC diagnosis – permanent paradigm paralysis
Diagnosis: paradigm paralysis, caused by motivated reasoning, oversimplification, and consensus seeking; worsened and made permanent by a vicious positive feedback effect at the climate science-policy interface.  
==============================================================
How the IPCC forgot to mention the pause
[Marotzke] attributed the oversight to a tendency of each group working on each of the 14 chapters to rely on some other chapter to deal with the issue. And anyone who was thinking about it at all thought some other chapter should handle the issue. – CS Monitor
==============================================================
“some delegates wanted to remove all references to a slowdown…[perhaps] felt it would be seized on by climate-change deniers”
Has the U.N. Climate Panel Now Outlived Its Usefulness? by Fred Pearce: Yale Environment 360
…It is not called an “intergovernmental panel” for nothing, and every last nation had to agree to the text before it was published.
So is this science or politics?
…
Another contentious topic was how the report should deal with the recent warming hiatus. The draft acknowledged the scientists’ concerns and noted that climate models “do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10-15 years.” This was reportedly met with opposition from some delegates who wanted to remove all references to a slowdown. Some argued that the hiatus had not lasted long enough to be considered a temperature trend. Perhaps they also felt it would be seized on by climate-change deniers.
…
David Keith, a Harvard University professor who recently resigned as an author of the IPCC report, says “The IPCC is showing typical signs of middle age, including weight gain, a growing rigidity of viewpoint, and overconfidence in its methods. It did a great job in the early days, but it’s become ritualized and bureaucratic, issuing big bulk reports that do little to answer the hard questions facing policymakers.” It needs, he says, “a reinvention.”
==============================================================
Eisenhower was right.
Judith Curry: Gov’t grants have caused IPCC science to be ‘torqued in unfortunate direction’
Judith Curry, chair of the School of Earth And Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech, says the IPCC is taking a huge credibility hit over the hiatus – and its pronouncement that it is 95 percent certain that human activity is responsible for most global warming.
“I’m not happy with the IPCC,” she told Fox News. “I think it has torqued the science in an unfortunate direction.”
That torquing, she suggests, is because the money in climate science (the funding, that is) is tied to embellishing the IPCC narrative, especially the impacts of global warming.

The Political Science of Global Warming
The U.N.’s latest climate-change report should be its last

The U.N.’s climate-change body is unreformable and its latest report should be its last.

By Rupert Darwall, WSJ

“Human influence extremely likely to be the dominant cause of observed warming since the middle of the last century,” was the headline from Friday’s release of the first instalment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fifth assessment report. “Extremely likely”—indicating a 95%-100% likelihood—was ratcheted up one notch from the 2007 fourth assessment report’s “very likely.” Yet compared to 2007, the IPCC widened its estimate of the responsiveness of the climate system to carbon dioxide by reducing the lower band to a 1.5°C increase from 2°C, qualifying the new estimate as only “likely.”
This is a glaring discrepancy. How can the IPCC be more confident that more than half the temperature rise since the mid-20th century is caused by greenhouse-gas emissions when it is less sure of the climatic impact of carbon dioxide? The explanation is that IPCC reports, especially the summaries for policymakers, are primarily designed for political consumption. And as if on cue, British Prime Minister David Cameron commented on the IPCC report, “If someone said there is a 95% chance that your house might burn down, even if you are in the 5% that doesn’t agree with it, you still take out the insurance.

Main AR5 WG1 Report published | The IPCC Report
Unfortunately, the Changes document linked above doesn’t make much sense at all, and seems to contain a lot of mistakes.

I suppose this shows that the stories of IPCC delegates being over-tired and not getting enough sleep were all true.
==============================================================
IPCC in denial. “Just-so” excuses use ocean heat to hide their failure. « JoNova
Now that the plateau in temperatures has lasted for 15 years, everyone, even IPCC lead authors, can see the “90% certain” models were 98% wrong. So the IPCC now claims the heat went into the deep abyss, which they didn’t predict, can’t measure accurately, and, even by the best estimates we have, has not been anywhere near enough warming to explain the missing energy.
==============================================================
Die Klimazwiebel: My problems with the IPCC report
Generally, it would have been a good idea to compare the major messages from the 2007 report with those of the 2013 report and say where changes in assessment were made and why. The IPCC shuns such an exercise, and at its peril. The reason why it doesn’t want to do this arguably (here I am offering a speculation) has to do with the desire to be perceived as sober, consistent, even infallible. Giving hints at a lack of confidence, the IPCC seems to assume, could provoke critical questions from the audience (and the heavy use of the word ‘confidence’ in the Summary for Policy Makers indicates that the IPCC wants to hammer home this exact point, that it has confidence…). But such a move gives rise to suspicion in the first place, as most of the interested audience can check for themselves what was said and how it was said last time, and if there are discrepancies between the two. So in reality this strategy is bound to backfire.

Climate Activists Need to Dial Back on the Panic
Instead of enacting phenomenally expensive policies, we need to come up with low-cost solutions to global warming that all nations can embrace
By Bjørn Lomborg
On Friday, the U.N. climate panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), produced its first overview in six years. It wasn’t about panic and catastrophe, which unfortunately has dominated our climate debate, leading to expensive but ineffective policies.The IPCC is now extremely certain that more than half of the past six decades’ temperature rise was caused by man. But it does not support the scary scenarios of temperature rises of 9°F or more bandied about by activists — the likely rise over the 21st century is about 1.8°F to 6.7°F. Similarly it makes short shrift of alarmist claims that sea levels will rise 3 ft. to 6 ft. In reality, the IPCC estimates the rise by the end of the century at 1.5 ft. to 2 ft.

IPCC is more about Politics than Science
The science debate is over. They lost.
Decades ago they proposed a theory that Earth’s temperature is controlled by the 0.004% trace of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
This theory was used to make predictions by at least 73 computer models. Thirty years of observations has proven every prediction wrong. Therefore their theory is wrong. That is how science works.
Now, faced with collapse of their theory and de-funding of their activities, the alarmist crew have switched to politics.
The IPCC Summary document released last week with all the hoopla of a political convention is a political document produced by consensus. It was negotiated by a faceless committee of international bureaucrats for their government masters, most of whom have a vested interest in proving there is a continuing problem needing international taxes and controls.
Consensus is the tool of politics. Public opinion is where the next climate battle will be fought.
They will lose again.

SUPREME COURT:
Justices to consider review of EPA greenhouse gas rules
http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059987993
In what could become a marquee environmental case of the Supreme Court’s next term, the justices on Monday are expected to consider reviewing a lower court ruling that upheld U.S. EPA’s regulations to reduce heat-trapping gases.
Nine petitions are asking the court to reverse aspects of an appellate court’s June 2012 ruling that backed EPA’s first rules following the Supreme Court’s landmark Massachusetts v. EPA decision, which instructed the agency to regulate greenhouse gases as harmful pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
Some prominent environmental lawyers believe the court will grant certiorari to — or agree to review — some part of the petitions. The decision could come as early as Tuesday, less than two weeks after the Obama administration proposed regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions at new power plants.
Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard Law School, wrote recently that “the odds of a cert. grant remain significant, mostly because of … superficial trappings of cert.-worthiness.”
Writing in the nonpartisan Environmental Law Institute’s Environmental Forum, Lazarus said the number of petitions is unusually high and more than 80 interested parties are asking the high court to take the case.
He also pointed out that 17 states have signed onto the effort, a significant number considering that the dozen states that supported greenhouse gas regulation in 2007 played an important role in persuading the high court to review Massachusetts v. EPA.

‘Modern Warming Trend Cannot Be Found’ In New Climate Study
There’s interesting news on the climate beat this week, especially given the background of the just-released IPCC AR5 report – which blames humanity for warming the planet. A new, comprehensive study examining temperatures in the Eastern Mediterranean region over the last 900 years indicates that global warming and associated climate changes actually haven’t happened there at all.
…
According to a Helmholtz Centre announcement highlighting Dr Heinrich’s latest research:
For the first time a long temperature reconstruction on the basis of stable carbon isotopes in tree rings has been achieved for the eastern Mediterranean. An exactly dated time series of almost 900 year length was established, exhibiting the medieval warm period, the little ice age between the 16th and 19th century as well as the transition into the modern warm phase … [however] the modern warming trend cannot be found in the new chronology.
Heinrich and his colleagues write:
The twentieth century warming trend found elsewhere could not be identified in our proxy record, nor was it found in the corresponding meteorological data used for our study.

It is fitting this is published near Halloween time in Nature, because the IPCC is full of scare stories.
IPCC: Climate panel is ripe for examination
Mike Hulme & Martin Mahony Nature 502, 624  (31 October 2013) doi:10.1038/502624c

Published online  30 October 2013

Sociologists of science wish to study the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the same reason that they want to examine other loci at which scientific knowledge is made — whether in a laboratory, the field, a museum or at a conference. We too approached the IPCC in autumn 2010 with a request to study it from the inside; we too were told ‘no’ (see Nature 502, 281; 2013).

We therefore had to rely on self-reported accounts. Using document analysis and interviews with lead authors, we analysed how authors navigate the distinction between scientific description and value judgements, for example when offering information pertaining to the definition of ‘dangerous climate change’.
The IPCC has become a dominant institution in climate science — in the assessment of knowledge for policy-making, and in how assessment practices alter empirical and computer-simulated climate science. Global knowledge assessments such as those undertaken by the IPCC call for carefully documented systematic studies by trained ethnographers.
Let us hope that the IPCC will recognize itself as a legitimate object for scholarly investigation this time around.

Pope Francis has arrived in America after visiting Cuba. His message goes well beyond the Catholic faithful. As he declared in the recent encyclical _Laudato Si’_ , he was addressing “every person living on this planet.”



The Pontiff’s predominant appeal is spiritual, not political. His commitment to the poor and our shared world is obvious. Most people yearn for meaning in their lives which no government can provide. More than his recent predecessors, he speaks into the lives of common people.



However, the papal visit has generated controversy because Pope Francis appears to be a man of the Left. Of course, religious imperatives may have political implications. For instance, Christian Scripture and church tradition require concern for the poor and environment. But God mandated no specific solutions. There is no “Christian” answer to the many social ills. Instead, in addressing human challenges the Apostle James tells us to use the wisdom which God provides.



Unfortunately, the Holy Father sometimes blurs the line between the spiritual and the political. Indeed, at times _Laudato Si’_ sounds like a policy paper published by the Democratic National Committee. The Pope overestimates the wisdom and efficacy of politics while minimizing the power and virtue of markets.



Consider environmental issues, of great concern to Pope Francis, who spoke of an “ecological spirituality” in _Laudato Si’_. Stewardship is an important Christian responsibility. However, the relationship between humans and the world around them always has been complex. Contrary to common myth, people in early societies, like those living in developing nations today, often treated “the environment” with greater carelessness, even hostility, than do residents of advanced industrial societies.





The Pope overestimates the wisdom and efficacy of politics while minimizing the power and virtue of markets.



The pontiff also assumes the worst regarding the environment. He earlier warned: “The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.” Yet this is not the world in which most Americans live. Much of the environmental news actually is quite good. For instance, air and water generally are cleaner than they were even a few years ago. An issue of great interest to the Catholic Church is the slowdown in population growth, which essentially destroyed any case for coercive population controls.



Important environmental problems remain, of course. However, capitalism helps answer even the toughest questions. For instance, greater economic development and innovation provide the means to solve often complex problems. Rich countries use energy more efficiently and deploy more sophisticated environmental technologies. Enforceable property rights hold landowners accountable for their actions, encouraging improved stewardship.



Markets also promote efficient trade‐​offs, highlighting the benefits and costs of alternative policies. In _Laudato Si’_ the Pontiff appeared to suggest the common good yields only one correct environmental standard. He doubted the legitimacy of opposing views, complaining of “obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, [which] can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions.” However, facts are not a matter of faith. Elsewhere in the encyclical the Pope acknowledged “that honest debate must be encouraged among experts, while respecting divergent views.” The consensus that the climate is warming does not extend to how much and how fast temperatures are likely to rise, as well as how great the likely social impact and how best to cope with those effects. Even when the objective is clear, such as addressing climate change, there typically are multiple means of achieving any particular end.



If, for instance, one believes temperatures are rising and the consequences will be serious, there still are many possible solutions. One is mitigation, a highly costly attempt to lower temperature by cutting energy use. Another is counteracting the impact indirectly, such as planting trees and promoting technological transformations. A third strategy is adaptation, a much less expensive policy of adjusting to specific problems. Which is best is a matter of man’s wisdom rather than God’s commandment. Markets typically are better than governments even in protecting “future generations,” in which politicians have little interest since the former do not vote.



When markets do not operate and property rights do not exist, some government action is necessary to ensure environmental protection. Nevertheless, policymakers must recognize the inherent infirmities of politics. There is no guarantee that increasing the power of parliaments, bureaucracies, and courts will solve environmental or other social problems. Yet the Pope in _Laudato Si’_ largely ignored the government’s own woeful environmental record. In fact, politics inevitably reflects government’s and humanity’s imitations. Not everyone who claims to represent the common good does so; politicians and environmentalists are no more virtuous than businessmen and conservatives. Moreover, as Public Choice economists observed long ago, organized special interest groups which receive concentrated benefits from government policies tend to organize and defeat the disinterested, distracted public.



Yet the Holy Father used the encyclical to advocate not just more government, but more _global government_. The farther regulatory bureaucracies are from the people, the less accountable the former will be, especially to the poor and dispossessed. The more power invested in those who are unaccountable, the greater and more malign the ultimate impact of human sin.



Perhaps the most important trade‐​off ignored by the Pope is the importance of the free economy in providing wealth and opportunity—which improves the chance of living a fulfilling life—for the poor and disadvantaged. Pope Francis has spoken of the dignity of work and its importance for all. Yet the best jobs, those with good working conditions and higher pay delivering greater satisfaction are most likely to proliferate in competitive and innovative economies. These systems are threatened by politicians who meddle and manipulate. The more expensive and extensive the controls, the fewer and less remunerative the jobs.



Thus, while the pontiff’s moral judgments deserve respect, his economic opinions warrant less consideration. His formative economic experience came in Argentina, a statist kleptocracy which enshrined injustice. Very different is the U.S., which, though highly imperfect, possesses generally open and competitive markets. The principal lesson from Argentina and similar systems is the importance of avoiding political restrictions on the economy.



Economic liberty, that is, freedom to work, invest, trade, and create is an outgrowth of the wondrous creativity with which God has infused mankind. How to practice that creativity, however, requires guidance from the Pontiff as well as other moral and spiritual leaders rather than the dictates of politicians and bureaucrats in Washington.



Indeed, America’s economic system must not be exempt from moral judgment. Government privileges are unjust, yielding unfair income distributions. The opportunity to consume does not mean that one should consume. Although resource depletion is largely a myth, things can become yet another idol.



The Holy Father helpfully reminds us that God calls his children to far more than economic growth. In _Laudato Si’_ the Pope observed that “the emptier a person’s heart is, the more he or she needs things to buy, own and consume.” Neither politicians nor businessmen can fill that void.



Pope Francis deserves a warm welcome in the U.S. He is an important moral and spiritual leader who speaks to people’s deepest human needs. However, Americans should respond more skeptically when he moves from spiritual to political matters. His status as the Vicar of Christ gives him no special qualification as a political pundit.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi’s latest Weatherbell Saturday Summary is out. This week the high-profile, veteran meteorologist has some interesting comments on sea surface temperatures and this year’s once highly ballyhooed “super El Niño“.
Remember how earlier this year a number a climatology experts were all giddy because somehow they had managed to convince themselves that a “super El Niño” was supposedly in the pipeline and, after having waited 18 long years, warming would finally resume and shut the skeptics up once and for all. Well, their prediction losing streak refuses to end and it just got extended again.
At the 6:45 mark Joe remarks:
You can see the water near Australia is beginning to warm up and the water in the eastern Pacific is starting to cool. That is the kiss of death for El Niño, so this El Niño, just like we were saying back in April: No super El Niño. It comes on for the winter, and then it goes. There’s no 2 or 3-year El Niño coming up, or what these guys that want the globe to warm up so that whatever is going with the climate fight and that type of thing. It’s not happening. We took them apart with the super El Niño, and I’ll take them apart again for these guys who think this thing is going to run on for 2 years.”

NCEP sea surface temperature anomaly shows “Kiss of Death” for this season’s El Niño. Source: cropped from Weatherbell Saturday Summary.
Joe then elaborates some on why global temperatures are currently at a high level, saying that it’s due to the warm northeast Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly. Joe thinks these anomalies will flip and be cold over the next 2 or 3 years – pointing out that this is nothing new and that it has all happened before.
Snow in North Africa
The Weatherbell meteorologist shows how extreme cold is set to spread across much of the US over the coming days and weeks and that it’s also going to be cold in Europe, with even “snow in the mountains of North Africa”.

"Given that the IPCC now considers that climate change is “unequivocal”, that human influence is “95-100%” likely to be the dominant cause, and that its effects are already being felt around world, it is still surprisingly difficult to bring those responsible to justice. In terms of its ability to regulate the causes and mitigate the effects of climate change, politics alone is not working. Litigation through the courts is a powerful device that can be used to increase public awareness, pressure governments to implement and improve regulation, and ultimately to drive polluting industries and individuals to change. There have been occasions when international bodies have considered cases regarding the effects of climate change. In 2005 an organisation representing the Inuit population in Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Russia petitioned the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. They called for an end to violations of the Inuit human rights resulting from global warming caused by unabated US greenhouse gas emissions. While this wasn’t a claim for compensation, it was an attempt to force the US to adopt emissions reduction targets, and to raise awareness of the situation. Other examples include legal applications, by Peru and Nepal (among others), to have World Heritage Sites placed on the UNESCO “in danger” list as a result of deterioration due to climate change. These seek to impose emissions reduction targets on all parties to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. However, the cases’ merits were never considered; an expert group was instead set up to assess the risks these sites face. More recently, in 2011 the island state of Palau expressed their intention to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice. This would form an opinion on whether the well-established principle of international law, which requires that countries do not carry out activities within their territory that cause harm to other states, and Article 194(2) of the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea, which requires states to “take all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other states and their environment”, apply to the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.  If, or more likely when, such an opinion is sought it will not be legally binding. But it would undoubtedly raise the awareness of the predicament faced by small, low-lying island states in the face of climate change and rising sea levels. In doing so it would increase political pressure for more urgent action. These cases have undoubtedly provided a lever to exert political and moral pressure on governments to take climate justice seriously. But so far international law has not delivered tangible protection to those already hugely affected by climate change. And in any case, such legal actions are likely to focus on the damage caused by historic emissions – perhaps not the most effective way to help vulnerable states protect their futures. The picture with respect to litigation based on national laws is not much better. These generally fall into two categories: common law tort cases (for example nuisance) and judicial reviews. Actions brought in nuisance face the difficulty of establishing a causal link between the action and the harm. Currently it is difficult to link specific greenhouse gas emissions with specific climate change impacts. On the other hand, similar issues have been overcome in the past in cases involving asbestos and tobacco. With time, strong cases, and a sympathetic judiciary, the courts may find a way to overcome this hurdle. But this can only happen if these cases continue to come before the courts. The claimants brought their claim for compensation under the federal common law of nuisance, but the court found that as the US Clean Air Act applies to carbon emissions, the existence of that Act prevented there being any right to claim compensation under federal common law. The court concluded that, at the federal level, the “solution to Kivalina’s dire circumstances must rest in the hands of the legislative and executive branches”. The court has however left open the possibility of a claim under state law. Judicial review cases have largely focused on challenging awards of licences for fossil fuel exploitation. These have proved more successful but, for example, Australian cases involving open cast coal mines have failed, since the courts have been reluctant to accept that an individual coal mine is “significant” in terms of global climate change. A US case won an important victory when the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA’s refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions presented an “actual” and “imminent” risk of harm to public health and the environment. Unfortunately there has been limited progress since. ClientEarth has also used judicial review to successfully challenge the permitting of new coal-fired power plants in Poland. So while legal systems are not currently well aligned to deal with the injustices of climate change, it’s likely that legal rulings will ultimately turn against greenhouse gas emitters. An improving scientific understanding of cause and effect should eventually provide the evidential basis required to establish liability for damage. Running parallel, ever-stronger regulations of greenhouse gas emissions and increased legal, political and financial risk looks set to render a significant quantity of existing fossil fuel reserves “unburnable”. This triggers requirements in company law that govern risk disclosure and reporting, corporate decision making, and the valuation of company assets. In this way, company law and financial regulation should ultimately force a wide range of corporations to realign their actions with the scientific realities, and the global public interest. Indeed, legal challenges based on established company regulations may prove far greater levers on global carbon emissions than claims through the international courts – and in the long run may do more to improve the situation of those worst affected by climate change. The recent resolution by the shareholders of Exxon Mobil, requiring Exxon to improve their disclosures in relation to climate risk, suggests that this tide is already starting to turn."

WUWT reader “Carl” Submits this story:
New research suggests people tend to hold negative views of political and social activists
Why don’t people behave in more environmentally friendly ways? New research presents one uncomfortable answer: They don’t want to be associated with environmentalists.

That’s the conclusion of troubling new research from Canada, which similarly finds support for feminist goals is hampered by a dislike of feminists.
Participants held strongly negative stereotypes about such activists, and those feelings reduced their willingness “to adopt the behaviors that these activities promoted,” reports a research team led by University of Toronto psychologist Nadia Bashir. This surprisingly cruel caricaturing, the researchers conclude, plays “a key role in creating resistance to social change.”

"**Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo RossellÃ³ has said he won't stand for re-election next year, after more than a week of protests calling for his resignation.**
A trove of sexist, homophobic and other profane messages between Mr RossellÃ³ and his team were published on 13 July.
The chats also included derogatory references to singer Ricky Martin's sexuality, and offensive comments about the survivors of Hurricane Maria.
Mr RossellÃ³ apologised but has refused to step down before his term ends.
The governor, whose term will end in January 2021, said he would also stand down as head of his New Progressive Party.
""I have made mistakes and I have apologised,"" he said in a video posted on Facebook. ""I admit that apologising is not enough. In this case, I announce that I will not seek reelection as governor next year.""
Since the messages were published huge crowds have been gathering in Puerto Rico's capital San Juan, and solidarity demonstrations have been held in other cities such as New York.
Protesters also say they have had enough of corruption in the US island territory and have criticised the recovery efforts following Hurricane Maria in 2017.
Two former top government officials from Mr RossellÃ³'s administration were among a group arrested a week before the messages were published, and charged with conspiracy and fraud involving millions of dollars in federal funding.
The messages, obtained by Puerto Rico's Centre for Investigative Journalism, fill almost 900 pages. They were from a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Telegram that included the governor and 11 of his aides and cabinet members.
The messages included jokes about Hurricane Maria victims, along with sexist and homophobic comments.
The official death toll stands at nearly 3,000, but a Harvard estimate puts the toll at more than 4,600.
In one conversation, Christian Sobrino, then chief fiscal officer of Puerto Rico says he is ""salivating to shoot"" San Juan Mayor Carmen YulÃ­n Cruz. Ms Cruz has criticised the governor in the past.
Mr RossellÃ³ replies: ""You'd be doing me a grand favour.""
Another message from Mr Sobrino described singer Ricky Martin as a ""male chauvinist"" before referencing his sexuality in vulgar terms.
Mr Sobrino and Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin resigned following the leak.
A statement from White House spokesman Judd Deere said that the events ""prove the president's concerns about mismanagement, politicisation and corruption have been valid"".
Major figures have come out in support of the protesters. Ricky Martin led a protest to the governor's house last Wednesday.
The singer said in a video on Twitter: ""They mocked our dead, they mocked women, they mocked the LGBT community, they made fun of people with physical and mental disabilities, they made fun of obesity. It's enough. This cannot be.""
Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda shared images of the protests in Puerto Rico online, and attended a solidarity demonstration in New York.
Reggaeton artist Bad Bunny stopped his European tour last week to return to Puerto Rico and protest. He praised the ""bravery"" of people on the island."
"**Puerto Rican star Ozuna has confirmed he was the victim of a blackmail scheme involving an explicit video filmed when he was 16 years old.**
""Ozuna was extorted through an intimate video filmed when he was a minor,"" said a statement from the singer's label and management firm, Dimelo Vi.
""This video was edited with the objective of causing even more damage.""
The reggaeton singer is believed to have paid $50,000 (Â£38,000) to his extorter before approaching the FBI.
His label said ""all the legal measures"" were being pursued ""as sending and publishing videos of minors is a state and federal offence"".
They added: ""We hope that this will serve as an example and message to all teenagers and adults to protect their privacy and avoid these things so as to [avoid] such regrettable situations.""
Reports published by Puerto Rican media claimed the person extorting Ozuna was the gay rap artist Kevin Fret - who was shot dead in San Juan on 10 January.
Ozuna's lawyer confirmed the claims in an interview with Spanish-language news station Univision, but stressed that ""the police have said Ozuna is not a suspect"".
""Fret, may he rest in peace, alleged he had a video that could damage Ozuna and he wanted money,"" Antonio SagardÃ­a said. ""It was a typical extortion.""
SagardÃ­a said he ""did not know"" how Fret had obtained the video, but a ""large outlay"" was made to see whether he would ""cease and desist"".
Ozuna and his lawyer then reported the the extortion plot to both the FBI and Miami Police Department in 2017, he added.
""There is no link with the murder investigation, except that Kevin Fret extorted [Ozuna] and the police know it,"" SagardÃ­a said in a separate interview with El Nuevo Dia.
""I assume they're going to interview him about that. Ozuna is not a suspect.""
Ozuna, born Juan Carlos Ozuna Rosado, had the two biggest-selling Latin albums in America last year, and is currently in the UK Top 20 with Taki Taki - a collaboration with Cardi B, Selena Gomez and DJ Snake.
In addition to the statement issued by his label, the singer issued a public apology.
""Like many young people, I made a mistake, fuelled by ignorance,"" he wrote.
""Today, I'm not only sorry for what happened, but I condemn it. That's why I looked for help and I am certain everything will be cleared.
""Likewise, I'm following the process and am always willing to collaborate with authorities to prevent the evil that resulted from this big mistake.
""More importantly, I ask my family for forgiveness. They are my life's priority and I will continue to fight for them always.""

"Everest climbing season is underway. For a few weeks each spring, the weather improves just enough to give climbers a chance of scaling the world’s tallest mountain. As increasing numbers flock to Everest, the Nepalese government has passed new laws to regulate the hundreds who come to take on the challenge. But the new policies show that officials in Kathmandu don’t really grasp what’s going on up in the Himalayan peaks and more must be done to make the mountainside sustainable. The first new rule – that climbers must bring at least 8kgs of rubbish back with them when descending Everest – is puzzling. And is contradicted by the second policy, which is reducing mountaineering permit fees this year to attract even more climbers.  This reveals how the Nepalese government only knows how to pass policies, but not implement them. No concrete efforts have been made to ensure that they are enforced or monitored.  Most of the government representatives who travel to the Everest region as appointed liaison officers never even make it to the Base Camp. Ill-equipped and unable to adapt to the harsh environment, they have very little clue whether or not their policies are practised. This raises the question: how will the government know that the 8kgs of rubbish that each climber must bring back from Everest were indeed collected? Mountaineering in Nepal is now a commercialised operation that primarily consists of two main goals: profit for the government and an ego-boost for the participants. The true spirit of mountaineering adventure has long disappeared. This is why the government has lowered the climbing permit fee, to encourage more climbers who can buy into the Everest franchise. Climbing is now done in a very crowded setting. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of climbers in recent years – nearly 2,000 people have climbed the mountain since 2009. Last year we saw a long line of climbers (just above the Everest base camp) waiting for their turn to go up the mountain and this creates a hazardous situation for all parties involved. This surge in numbers is a result of the now well-established routes up the mountain, lined with fixed ropes, accuracy in weather forecasting, better climbing gear and an increase in the number of guides.  Rubbish management needs to be thought out carefully if we want to ensure climber’s safety and a high quality environment. We can’t treat the mountains as dumping grounds. It is estimated that some 50 tonnes of mountaineering rubbish has accumulated beyond the Everest Base Camp.  This rubbish mostly consists of spent oxygen cylinders, food cans, torn tents and ropes, human waste and even dead bodies. The amount of rubbish is not going to reduce anytime soon, even with periodic clean ups, mostly because more people are climbing Everest than ever before.  Everest base camp looks like a tent city. It has been reported that the majority of climbers today do not have the same level of mountaineering skills than those who went up the mountains a decade ago. Record crowds, year after year, on the summit makes it seem like anyone with money and time can scale the mountain. But, increasing the permit fee for climbers is one way to limit numbers. Also, the environment liaison officer needs to be someone appointed from the local community. They need to be familiar with the high mountain environment and motivated to bring the community together for periodic environmental clean ups both higher up and below the base camp. A portion of the permit fees needs to be exclusively dedicated for that periodic clean up, which would boost seasonal local employment too.  The Sherpa people need to be involved too in protecting the environment. One environmental NGO, the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee is based in Namche Bazaar, the gateway to the high Himalayas, and has been active in environmental management practices related to trekking and mountaineering tourism. But they are limited by a lack of resources. A stronger team is needed to monitor environmental practices high up the mountain. It should include trained western and local guides and can be supported by the profits from local tourism. The Nepalese government earns US$3.3 million annually in Everest-related climbing royalty. Even if less than 5% of that money is dedicated exclusively for the purpose of removing garbage from the camps, and in combination with the  new regulation requiring every climber to bring back 8 kgs of rubbish (not including oxygen cylinders), that could make a big difference in the long run.  It might sound morbid, but if a climber dies, the guide or expedition team must be made legally responsible to bring back their body. In case the expedition team decides to forfeit the deposit made against such incidents, there should be a financial incentive for professionally trained, local search and rescue teams that could complete the job. The Nepalese government must immediately stop the practice of sending liaison officer from Kathmandu and instead recruit local Sherpas (former guides, for example) to do this job. There is not a single solution to the complex problem of making tourism to Everest sustainable. Increases in permit fees, fewer climbers on each team, establishing a local search and rescue team, recruiting local (Sherpa) environmental liaison officers, investing more in environmental clean ups that include international and local expedition teams are suggested. Those who do not follow established rules and adopt higher environmental standards could also be denied permits for a few years.  One thing is certain: the government is not truly committed to making sure that its mountaineering peaks are not polluted. Government officials sitting in Kathmandu (the majority of whom have no clue what goes on in these remote places) are far removed from the actions on the ground. I am not very optimistic about their actions on these issues."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite plunging energy prices on world markets, electricity prices in Germany refuse to drop anywhere near in proportion.
The reason for this is in large part due to the fixed, guaranteed high prices that renewable energy producers get for the wildly fluctuating power they feed in  – no matter what the market does. The result: Power companies must continue paying an exorbitant price and are thereforE unable to pass much of price decrease to the consumers.
On the other hand at the gas and diesel pumps, for example, the price decrease has been considerable – much to the delight of German motorists. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about German electricity, where power companies will decrease the price (for the first time in over a decade after years of steep increases) by only 2.4% on average!
The English language The Local here writes (emphasis added):
Power price drop isn’t all good news
A total of 205 companies – almost a quarter of the 850 power suppliers – have announced an average 2.4 percent drop in prices for 2015 so far according to price comparison websites Verivox and Check 24.
With current prices just over €0.29 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), that could mean between €30 and €35 savings over a year for a four-person average household.
“We’ve never seen such a large number of price cuts,” a Check 24 spokeswoman said.
‘But they’re too late and too small – the suppliers’ savings aren’t being passed on to the consumer.'”

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
\---   
  
Atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH4)—a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide (at least over shorter time scales)—have begun rising after a hiatus from 1999-2006 that defied all expectations. No one knows for sure why—why they stood still, or why they started up again.   
  
There is a lot of research underway looking into the causes of the observed methane behavior and at least three new studies have reported results in the scientific literature in the past couple of months.   
  
The findings are somewhat at odds with each other.   
  
In February, a study led by Alex Turner, from Harvard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, was published that examined methane emissions from the US over the past 10 years or so. The researchers compared observations taken from orbiting satellites to observations made from several sites on the earth’s surface. They reported over the past decade “an increase of more than 30% in US methane emissions.” And this increase was so large as to “suggest that increasing US anthropogenic methane emissions could account for up to 30-60% of [the] global increase.”   
  
However, the methodologies employed by Turner et al. were insufficient for determining the _source_ of the enhanced emissions. While the authors wrote that “[t]he US has seen a 20% increase in oil and gas production and a 9-fold increase in shale gas production from 2002 to 2014” they were quick to point out that “the spatial pattern of the methane increase seen by [satellite] does not clearly point to these sources” and added that “[m]ore work is needed to attribute the observed increase to specific sources.”   
  
Perhaps most interestingly, Turner and colleagues note that “national inventory estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicate no significant trend in US anthropogenic methane emissions from 2002 to present”—a stark contrast to their findings, and a potential embarrassing problem for the EPA. But, never fear, the EPA is on it. The EPA is now actively re-examining its methane inventory and seems to be in the process of revising it upwards, perhaps even so much as to change its previous reported decline in methane emissions to an increase. Such a change would have large implications for the US’s ability to keep the pledge made at the U.S. 2015 Climate Conference in Paris.   
  
However, the Turner et al. results have been called into question by a prominently-placed study in _Science_ magazine just a couple of weeks later. The _Science_ study was produced by a large team led by Hinrich Schaefer of New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.   
  
Schaefer and colleagues analyzed the changes in the isotopic ratios of carbon in the methane contained in samples of air within ice cores, archived air samples, and more recent measurement systems. Different sources of methane contain different mixtures of methane isotopes, related to how long ago the methane was formed. Using this information, the authors developed a model for trying to back out the methane sources from the well-mixed atmospheric samples. Although such a procedure is somewhat tunable (i.e., you can get pretty much any answer you want (kind of like climate models!)), the authors are pretty confident in their final results.   




What they determined was that prior to the 1999-2006 hiatus, methane emissions largely bore a chemical signature of fossil fuels. This signal diminished during the hiatus, and has not shown much of an increase since, despite the post-2006 renewed growth in global methane emissions. Instead, Schaefer’s team found a strong chemical signal pointing to biogenic sources of methane being behind the current rise—most pointedly, emissions from agriculture (including both rice paddies and animal husbandry).   
  
Despite the rather surprising nature of this conclusion, the authors are resolute:   




The finding of a predominantly biogenic post-2006 increase is robust. Further, it seems likely that fossil-fuel emissions stagnated or diminished in the 1990s. Importantly, they are a minor contributor to the renewed [CH4]-rise. This contradicts emission inventories reporting increases of all source types between 2005 and 2010 with a major (~60%) thermogenic [fossil fuels] contribution… The finding is unexpected, given the recent boom in unconventional gas production and reported resurgence in coal mining and the Asian economy. Our isotope-based analysis suggests that the [CH4]-plateau marks not a temporary suppression of a particular source but a reconfiguration of the CH4-budget. Either food production or climate-sensitive natural emissions are the most probable causes of the current [CH4]-increase. These scenarios may require different mitigation measures in the future.



It is very hard to reconcile the results of Schaefer et al. with those of Turner et al.   
  
Also disturbing is the glib statement on “climate-sensitive natural emissions.” Attention, Schaefer et al.: Your study covers from 2007 through 2014. The figure below shows annual global surface temperature departures from an arbitrary mean. _There is no climate change to be “sensitive” to during this period_. Further, the statement is at odds with much of the text of the article, which largely points to an anthropogenic biogenic source for the change. One can’t help but wonder if some crusading reviewer insisted on the climate statement as the price for publication. Such a thing happened to one of us (Michaels) as a condition for publication in the prestigious “EOS—Transactions of the American Geophysical Union” many moons ago, despite the fact that the paper in question specifically determined such a link was not the case.    






And, to keep things interesting, a paper was published just days after the Schaefer et al. _Science_ piece, by a team of researchers led by Petra Hausmann of Germany’s Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. These researchers investigated the growth in atmospheric methane concentrations alongside the growth in atmospheric ethane concentrations –a tracer for methane emission from fossil fuels. By analyzing the increase in ethane, Hausmann et al. concluded that about half of the growth in methane emissions between 2007 and 2014 came from fossil fuel sources correlated to the oil and natural gas fracking boom in the U.S. In their press release, they note that their result fits with the Turner et al. results of a significant increase in US methane emissions and contrasts with the US EPA estimates. The authors also note the discrepancy with the Schaefer et al. findings.   
  
Pretty clearly, no one knows quite what is going on.   
  
And into this confusion, the EPA has decided (no doubt from the President’s urging) to issue regulations pertaining to the allowable amount of methane emissions from US oil and gas recovery and delivery operations—in the name of mitigating future climate change.   
  
As we pointed out when the regulations were first announced, the impact on future climate change is so tiny as to be immaterial. And now, with the great uncertainty as to what exactly is behind the recent rise in atmospheric methane concentrations, the EPA’s regulations may not only be insignificant, but wrong-headed as well.   
  
What is certain, is that if you don’t understand the cause of a situation, taking steps to “fix” it is probably a bad idea. The Obama Administration’s “While under debate, regulate!” mantra is a poor operating protocol destined to fail. Or worse.

"With towns in the south and southwest flooded out, the government has offered £5,000 payments to help homeowners add flood protection to their homes, while small firms will enjoy a cut of a £10m fund to help them back into business. Farms are small businesses, but this – as farmers have said at the NFU conference – is a drop in the ocean. There is no “standard” business model for a farm and, as with other businesses, the impact of flooding will vary depending on damage to for example stock (in this case, crops) and premises (in this case, land). Damage to stored crops, fodder stocks, buildings, and equipment will be among the other variables. The characteristics of the flooding itself are also important: how long is land flooded for? How long before it stops being waterlogged after flooding? Many farm businesses are specialised and unique. The Somerset Levels, for example, is for the most part low-intensity grazing land for beef cattle rearing, dairy farming, and to some extent sheep farming. But there are also unique businesses supplying willow for such esoteric items as balloon baskets and coffins for green burials, or teasels for the treatment of the green baize on billiard tables. These niche businesses can be the only firms offering certain products, supply chain links so vital that they are often tied in strongly to contracts. This means that if they can’t supply what’s needed, on time, they have to go to great lengths and cost to find substitute supplies, or breach their contracts. The summer floods in 2007 cost between £30,000-£90,000 per farm, losses that partly arose from just this failure to fulfil contracts. The spring 2012 floods in Somerset affected more than 5,000 hectares, with water standing to a depth of 2.5m in places. The pumping stations were unable to remove all this water fast enough into the tidal River Tone, and early indications from the floods that began in late 2013 suggest a similar picture of around 700 farmers affected over an area of up to 12,000 hectares, with water standing up to 2.4m deep in places. But eventually the waters recede, and once they have the farmers will count the cost of flooding. These costs include the emergency evacuation of livestock, the loss of spring grazing lands, and loss of later pasture land which will mean less or no silage or hay fodder for the following winter, the extra cost of buying in feedstuffs to replace flood-damaged stores or flooded grazing lands, and damage to field drains, fences, gates, and other equipment. Health problems for livestock, especially liver fluke in sheep, are also a concern. The costs of cleaning up open land can easily be £15/hectare, but this is dwarfed by the overall loss to farmers of up to £1,400/hectare once the loss of cattle sales, contracting income, the costs of reseeding damaged pasture and so on are all taken into account. Few if any of these costs will have been covered by insurance in most cases, nor are there any other public funds on which farmers can draw. The farming community has however rallied round, with relief supplies of fodder being dispatched to the west country from other parts of the country. Some of the “costs” are not so obvious. For example, an increase of mastitis in dairy cows or lameness in livestock due to the wet conditions all cost the farmer more. And, anecdotally, these figures may understate the long-term impact, especially in those areas where soil has been contaminated or requires substantial remediation. Some farmers for example had to apply large quantities of lime to rebalance the pH level of soils after the 2012 floods. These last months of flooding this year suggest that, even with increased dredging, flooding will be a continually recurring phenomenon in the Somerset Levels and Moors. The land around the River Parrett lies barely 4.6m above mean sea level, those around the nearby River Tone are at their lowest 7.4m, and yet peak tides hit a high of 8m above sea level – there is nowhere else for the water to go at high tide but onto the land. So it is inevitable that flooding will occur from time to time. Work on the Somerset Levels Water Level Management Plan goes back to 2003, and this reflects one of the problems. Water Level Management Plans look to timescales of 100 years or more. They allow for farmland to be flooded in order to protect more valuable interests and property. But while others benefit because farmland is sacrificed in this way, there is little or no balancing provision for the costs which farmers must therefore inevitably bear.   A proper strategic view is needed, supported by properly focused, long-term measures which recognise the hydrological reality of areas like the Levels, and truly reflect all the costs and benefits associated with sacrificing farmland to the waters. Who will pay, and how, for the floodwaters and all that comes with them that are imposed on farmers and farms such as those in Somerset?"
"The global food system contributes to climate change through industrial farming practices, the increasing use of fertiliser to fight dropping yields and the transport of food around the world. But the fact that climate change has a significant impact on the livelihood of small farmers in the tropics often goes unnoticed. Climate change has been compounding the economic problems coffee farmers have been experiencing the world over. For these farmers, climate change has meant losses to their crops from either too much rain or due to droughts. Over the past decade, there has been a long-term impact on coffee yields. The livelihoods of small coffee farmers have been especially affected. Arabica beans, which have an ideal growth temperature of between 18°C and 22°C, currently account for 73% of the coffee grown in Brazil. Studies indicate that a 1°C rise in temperature would result in a loss of 25% of Brazil’s Arabica coffee production. It would also limit coffee production to only 28 municipalities – all in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil’s principal coffee producing state – down from the current production in 702 municipalities. Another impact of climate change on the coffee industry is the Hemileia Vastatrix fungus known as “La Roya” (Spanish for rust), which thrives in warmer temperatures. This rust disease is a fungus that attacks the leaves of the coffee bush, causing the coffee beans to fall off before they reach full maturity, if not leading to poorer bean quality and making coffee plants more susceptible to other diseases. The rust outbreak in Central America is the worst in about thirty years and losses during the 2013-14 season are expected to be worse than the 20% of the high quality Arabica crop lost during the 2012-13 season.  In the case of Guatemala the outbreak of the fungus has already affected 200,000 producers during the 2013-14 season, double the number of producers affected in 2012-13. In Nicaragua, the rust has meant a reduction of coffee yields by 60%. The most significant impact of the rust has been in Colombia where the 2011-12 coffee harvest, was its worst in three decades, falling from more than 11 million sacks to under eight million (each sack is 60kg of green beans). This hit the half a million small producer families to a greater extent with coffee prices falling by over 30%. Colombia is not alone in the reduction in yield per hectare and is joined by India, Indonesia and Mexico in having a fall in coffee yield during this period. The rust crisis is also affecting global coffee prices, probably influencing the decision of the ICE New York futures exchange to add Brazilian origin Arabica to the mix of coffee from 19 countries used to determine the price of Arabica coffee. The harvest in Brazil affects the international coffee price, especially since the drop in prices in 2013 was seen to be based on the back of bumper harvests in Brazil. To mitigate the losses from warmer temperatures, large coffee producers are moving to higher altitudes and expanding coffee to new growing areas in Brazil. They are also trying to increase the use of irrigation which is a challenge due to the lack of water.  There are ways to mitigate against the rust disease too. In areas that are severely hit, farmers must start from scratch by planting new coffee trees. Fungicide can contain the spread of the rust and rust resistant trees have been developed in Colombia. The Colombian Coffee Federation has invested in replanting extensively using these rust resistant trees and plans to have about 80-90% of its coffee replanted by 2016. Unfortunately the choices available to the large producer are not available to small family farmers who are more vulnerable and lack the finances or know-how to move or adapt themselves. But one attempt to help small farmers respond to the threat of climate change is the Coffee and Climate initiative, which brings together examples of best practice as well as information on scientific discoveries. As well as making global efforts to stem emission-causing global warming, research indicates that agroforestry can be used to mitigate against climate change and help diversify the incomes of the small coffee producers. This is something we have also seen first-hand. These kinds of measures must be replicated around the world to urgently aid farmers in the tropics suffering from the effects of climate change."
"MPs have joined growing calls from business leaders and environmentalists for the government to use its post-coronavirus economic recovery plan to accelerate investments aimed at tackling the climate crisis. The chairs of two influential cross-party select committees have warned the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that time is running out to “avert an even greater future global crisis caused by climate change”. In a joint letter, the chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee, and the chair of the environmental audit (EAC) committee, said the government must align plans to boost the economy with its climate ambitions. Darren Jones, the chair of the BEIS committee, said the post-pandemic world offers an “opportunity for the UK to step up our efforts to tackle climate change, to foster a green recovery and accelerate the transition to net zero”. Jones is due to lead an inquiry into the government’s climate progress at a hearing on Thursday following a report from the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s official climate advisers, which warned last week that the UK is falling behind on its climate targets. “I hope the chancellor will be bold in his investment in infrastructure and people, demonstrating the government’s commitment to tackling climate change, boosting the prospects of a green recovery, creating net-zero related jobs, and bolstering the UK’s credibility as a net zero leader in the run up to COP26 [climate talks],” he said. The EAC has also opened a new investigation into how the government can use the opportunities created by the post-Covid recovery plans to further the UK’s green agenda. Philip Dunne, the chair of the EAC committee, said that “if there is anything positive to come out of the pandemic, it is that we wake up to the warnings that we are hearing from scientists about the urgency of acting on climate change”. Dunne added: “Many of the actions we need to make our net-zero ambition a reality can be used to revive our economy, creating green jobs and generating long term cost savings. It would be a historic mistake to miss this opportunity.” The combined calls for a green economic recovery from within the government echoes rising calls from green groups, industry leaders and the Prince of Wales to support firms that can help to spur the UK’s low-carbon ambitions and help create jobs in the “green economy”. More than 200 business leaders – including chief executives and chairs from nearly half of FTSE 100 companies – are due on Monday to attend a virtual meeting with the business secretary, Alok Sharma, and the environment secretary, George Eustice, to plot a route towards the UN climate talks, which have been delayed by a year to November 2021. Ahead of the meeting, Liv Garfield, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 water firm Severn Trent, said the UK had a “once in a lifetime opportunity to recover and grow in the right way – a cleaner and greener way” and that “every business in the UK has a role to play in delivering this”. The event, organised by the Council for Sustainable Business (CSB) in tandem with the government, will focus on the climate action that the UK can take within the next 10 years."

When the Treasury Department scored the president’s ill‐​fated 2013 budget last February, it estimated that raising the top two personal‐​income‐​tax rates — to 36 from 33 percent and to 39.6 from 35 percent on incomes above $250,000 and $377,000, respectively — would raise just $23.1 billion in 2013, barely enough to finance federal spending for two days. In the fiscal‐​cliff negotiations, House speaker John Boehner capitulated on the higher 39.6 percent tax rate but hoped to confine it to incomes above $1 million. That idea — his Plan B — failed to get the votes of a majority of the House Republican caucus; but what will replace it?



The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates that Boehner’s proposal to raise the bar from $250,000 to $1 million would result in about a billion less in revenue each year than would Obama’s plan, which would still raise $22 billion.



The threshold matters, but the revenue clearly does not. Estimates of $22 to $23 billion of added revenue from raising the highest tax rates are obviously dwarfed by $536 billion of looming tax increases from the “fiscal cliff,” and by budget deficits that routinely top $1 trillion. In fact, $24 billion of the fiscal cliff consists of Obamacare’s 3.8 percent surtax — on interest, dividends, capital gains, and rent — for couples earning more than $250,000.



Mr. Boehner has been curiously eager to embrace “closing loopholes” on these same high‐​income taxpayers, a leftist dream that dates back to the 1972 McGovern campaign. Yet phasing out and capping deductions and exemptions was always the form of the largest of Obama’s tax increases on higher‐​income households, amounting to $33 billion next year. For Republicans to accept these backdoor tax increases would preclude any future tax reform that involved trading a cap on deductions for lower marginal rates.





Trade a millionaires’ surtax for a 28 percent corporate tax and watch business investment grow.



Suppose the Obama‐​Boehner scheme to couple fewer deductions with a higher tax rate might actually raise about $55 billion next year, without (as the Treasury estimates assume) being undone by a consequent reduction in economic growth. The most that could possibly accomplish would be to briefly postpone the next in a series of fiscal cliffs as we repeatedly bump up against the debt ceiling. This is why Obama insists on putting off the debt ceiling for at least two years. He knows perfectly well that budget deficits will never drop below $1 trillion under his plan.



Obama and Senate Democrats pretend they could hand out hundreds of billions in middle‐​class tax breaks and refundable tax credits forever if only the House would raise tax rates on the top 2 percent. In reality, the July Senate bill extends some of these tax cuts for only one year while properly ending the untenable payroll‐​tax holiday — which accounts for $115 billion of the fiscal cliff.



What about economic growth? The economy normally grows by 3 percent a year, even when recessions are included, but has now grown by 0 percent for five years. We need quite a few years of economic growth in the range of 5 to 6 percent to merely get back to the 3 percent trendline. Decent economic growth would slash spending on unemployment benefits, food stamps, Medicaid, SSI, and dubious disability claims, while boosting revenues from greater payrolls and profits. Democrats and Republicans may disagree on how much economic damage their tax‐​increase proposals would cause, but nobody could argue that they would cause faster economic growth.



Before the election, by contrast, both Romney and Obama proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25–28 percent. This would give a lot of bang for no bucks. Nearly every other advanced country has a corporate tax rate no higher than 28 percent, and most of them raise more revenue than we do because they have greater domestic profits to tax (and less corporate debt to deduct). In “The Dynamic Effects of Personal and Corporate Income Tax Changes in the United States,” an ambitious historical survey, Karel Mertens of Cornell University and Morten O. Ravn of University College in London found that “cuts in corporate taxes have no significant impact on revenues because of a very elastic response of the tax base.”



Republicans’ favorite argument against high individual tax rates is that they hurt small businesses that choose to file under the individual tax code as pass‐​through entities, such as partnerships or Subchapter S corporations. Such businesses grow by reinvesting their earnings, so taxing away 39.6 percent of the income generated by the business shrinks both the incentive and the funding needed to expand. A corporate tax rate of 25 to 28 percent, however, could be a vital safety valve. The wider gap between a presumably higher individual tax rate and a lower corporate tax rate would quickly induce thousands of pass‐​through firms to set up Subchapter C corporations to shelter retained earnings from the possibly increased individual tax rate. The retained earnings would then be available for expanding the business. Business earnings would be double‐​taxed at the individual level only if and when owners paid themselves higher salaries or dividends, or taxed as capital gains if the expanded business is later sold. 



House Republicans have been capitulating to most of Obama’s tax plans without getting anything tangible in return except the president’s blatantly impossible promise to make middle‐​class tax breaks “permanent.” It is time for the GOP to ask the president to make good on his half‐​hearted campaign rhetoric about cutting the corporate tax rate. This would greatly invigorate the tax climate for all businesses, big and small. The positive impact on business investment, and on multinational decisions to locate new businesses in the U.S. rather than abroad, would be swift and powerful. There is nothing to lose from cutting the corporate tax rate, not even revenue, and the economic gains are likely to be quite astonishing.

"**An energy firm is halting work restoring power in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico in a dispute over pay.**
Whitefish Energy says payments have been delayed from Puerto Rico's bankrupt power authority.
The power authority, known as Prepa, says it is reviewing invoices and has stopped payments after receiving a complaint from a subcontractor.
Whitefish Energy has been at the centre of a contracting controversy that reached the Trump administration.
The company said in a statement it had been ""promptly"" turning over payments to subcontractors but ""outstanding invoices for work performed in October made it impossible to continue in this manner"".
Speaking on the condition of anonymity a Whitefish official told the BBC that $83m (Â£67m) was owed by Prepa.
In a statement, Prepa spokesman Carlos Monroig, said Whitefish had ""paralysed"" restoration efforts, and that the power authority was ""in the process of reviewing and auditing invoices submitted by Whitefish"".
The power restoration deal struck with Whitefish quickly after the storms came under scrutiny last month after revelations in the media.
Among other peculiarities, it was revealed that the two-year-old company had little experience with work on this scale and was headquartered in the tiny Montana hometown of US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.
Mr Zinke denied any involvement in the deal and denied any wrongdoing, while the White House distanced itself from it.
Prepa and the Puerto Rican government are saddled with massive debts. The power authority declared bankruptcy in July.
The Caribbean island, home to more than three million US citizens, was struck by two massive hurricanes in September. Hurricane Maria, the second storm, all but wiped out the island's power grid."

By Ed Caryl

“N’en déplaise à ces fous nommés sages de Grèce,
 En ce monde il n’est point de parfaite sagesse;
 Tous les hommes sont fous, et malgré tous leurs soîns
 Ne diffèrent entre eux que du plus ou du moins.”
“No offense to those crazy appointed sages of Greece,
 In this world there is no perfect wisdom;
 All men are fools, and despite all their care
 is differentiated as the more or less.”
BOILEAU
From: The title page, Charles MacKay (portrait above). Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds (Kindle Location 1046). Published in London, 1852. Available free in your chosen format here. Image from Wikipedia Commons, here.
My wife asked me the other day if there were other examples in history of the Climate Delusion presently infecting the world. I immediately thought of the above famous work from the Nineteenth Century, though I had not read it in its entirety until now. I downloaded the Kindle edition and will be quoting it extensively. MacKay devoted two volumes to the history of this phenomenon, though he said he could have devoted 50.
The present may be considered more of a miscellany of delusions than a history— a chapter only in the great and awful book of human folly which yet remains to be written, and which Porson once jestingly said he would write in five hundred volumes!” (Kindle Locations 1152-1153)
Every age has its peculiar folly; some scheme, project, or phantasy into which it plunges, spurred on either by the love of gain, the necessity of excitement, or the mere force of imitation. Failing in these, it has some madness, to which it is goaded by political or religious causes, or both combined.” (Kindle Locations 6961-6963).
Most of the delusions MacKay describes somehow involve money. Many describe financial “bubbles” like Tulipomania, the South Sea Bubble, and the Mississippi stock scheme. Mesmerism/Magnetisers and Alchemy made money for the direct practitioners. Pilgrimages to the Holy Land profited the Islamists for hundreds of years until the crusading knights attempted to retrieve the treasure. Whole forests of oaks were reduced to fragments of the True Cross and imported to Europe at huge expense.
In many of these delusions, the practitioners, as well as those practiced upon, were themselves deluded. This was especially true for those delusions associated with the practice of medicine such as the Magnetisers. These practices probably held back the advancement of medicine for many years. Alchemy both advanced and retarded the study of chemistry, leading practitioners into blind alleys and dead ends in search of the “Philosopher’s Stone,” but developing equipment and techniques that would be later used to advance the science.
Men go mad in herds
The parallels with Climate Science are clear: the delusions of the “97%” climate scientists leads to cherry-picking of data and confirmation bias that poison all the work. The bias is driven constantly by the knowledge that only “correct” answers will keep the paycheck coming. In an ancient example from MacKay, Kepler:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




In sending a copy of his Ephemerides to Professor Gerlach, he wrote, that they were nothing but worthless conjectures; but he was obliged to devote himself to them, or he would have starved.” (Kindle Locations 5632-5633).
Why don’t the climate scientists see the error of their ways? They sometimes do; usually after retirement, when the press of money no longer holds, or when they are in a position of safety.
Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.” (Kindle Locations 1143-1144).
So it is not surprising that we see some older and wiser heads in Climate Science, one by one, leaving the clique. So, why the constant projections of calamity from Climate Science? Here too, MacKay has an answer:
Omens. Among the other means of self-annoyance upon which men have stumbled, in their vain hope of discovering the future, signs and omens hold a conspicuous place. There is scarcely an occurrence in nature which, happening at a certain time, is not looked upon by some persons as a prognosticator either of good or evil. The latter are in the greatest number, so much more ingenious are we in tormenting ourselves than in discovering reasons for enjoyment in the things that surround us. We go out of our course to make ourselves uncomfortable; the cup of life is not bitter enough to our palate, and we distil [sic] superfluous poison to put into it, or conjure up hideous things to frighten ourselves at, which would never exist if we did not make them.” (Kindle Locations 5742-5746).
The mountaineer makes the natural phenomena which he most frequently witnesses prognosticative of the future. The dweller in the plains, in a similar manner, seeks to know his fate among the signs of the things that surround him, and tints his superstition with the hues of his own clime. The same spirit animates them all— the same desire to know that which Infinite Mercy has concealed. There is but little probability that the curiosity of mankind in this respect will ever be wholly eradicated. Death and ill fortune are continual bugbears to the weak-minded, the irreligious, and the ignorant; and while such exist in the world, divines will preach upon its impiety and philosophers discourse upon its absurdity in vain.” (Kindle Locations 5849-5852).
Is there no hope? Are we doomed to live in fear of the future? Will the doomsayers win? The above quote continues:
Still it is evident that these follies have greatly diminished. Soothsayers and prophets have lost the credit they formerly enjoyed, and skulk in secret now where they once shewed their faces in the blaze of day. So far there is manifest improvement.” (Kindle Locations 5852-5854).
As the predictions of the modern climate soothsayers fall into repeated failure, so will climate science slowly improve. One by one, the workers in this field will correct their errors. Some will fall from a great height and be destroyed. Some will suffer large and small epiphanies and ease into the light.
Like Churchill said, “Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”

I figured today would be a good day to post this, with David Rose’s article in the “Sunday Mail” Met Office proof that global warming is still ‘on pause’ as climate summit confirms global temperature has stopped rising. This post is available just in case someone wants to back David by linking this post once or twice in comments on that thread. It’s really tough to miss the pause in the time-series graphs, and the trend graphs sock the message home.
# # #
Initial Notes: This post contains graphs of running trends in global surface temperature anomalies for periods of 12+ and 16+ years using the NCDC Global (Land and Ocean) Surface Temperature data. They indicate that we have not seen a warming hiatus this long since the 1970s.
Much of the following text is boilerplate. It is intended for those new to the presentation of global surface temperature anomaly data.

GISS LAND OCEAN TEMPERATURE INDEX (LOTI)
Introduction: The GISS Land Ocean Temperature Index (LOTI) data is a product of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Starting with their January 2013 update, it uses NCDC ERSST.v3b sea surface temperature data. The impact of the recent change in sea surface temperature datasets is discussed here. GISS adjusts GHCN and other land surface temperature data via a number of methods and infills missing data using 1200km smoothing. Refer to the GISS description here. Unlike the UK Met Office and NCDC products, GISS masks sea surface temperature data at the poles where seasonal sea ice exists, and they extend land surface temperature data out over the oceans in those locations. Refer to the discussions here and here. GISS uses the base years of 1951-1980 as the reference period for anomalies. The data source is here.
Update: The August 2013 GISS global temperature anomaly is +0.62 deg C. It warmed (an increase of about 0.09 deg C) since July 2013.

GISS LOTI
 
NCDC GLOBAL SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES
Introduction: The NOAA Global (Land and Ocean) Surface Temperature Anomaly dataset is a product of the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). NCDC merges their Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature version 3b (ERSST.v3b) with the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M) version 3.2.0 for land surface air temperatures. NOAA infills missing data for both land and sea surface temperature datasets using methods presented in Smith et al (2008). Keep in mind, when reading Smith et al (2008), that the NCDC removed the satellite-based sea surface temperature data because it changed the annual global temperature rankings. Since most of Smith et al (2008) was about the satellite-based data and the benefits of incorporating it into the reconstruction, one might consider that the NCDC temperature product is no longer supported by a peer-reviewed paper.
The NCDC data source is usually here. NCDC uses 1901 to 2000 for the base years for anomalies.
Update: The August 2013 NCDC global land plus sea surface temperature anomaly is also +0.62 deg C. It increased 0.02 deg C since July 2013.

NCDC Global (Land and Ocean) Surface Temperature Anomalies
UK MET OFFICE HADCRUT4 (LAGS ONE MONTH)
Introduction: The UK Met Office HADCRUT4 dataset merges CRUTEM4 land-surface air temperature dataset and the HadSST3 sea-surface temperature (SST) dataset. CRUTEM4 is the product of the combined efforts of the Met Office Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. And HadSST3 is a product of the Hadley Centre. Unlike the GISS and NCDC products, missing data is not infilled in the HADCRUT4 product. That is, if a 5-deg latitude by 5-deg longitude grid does not have a temperature anomaly value in a given month, it is not included in the global average value of HADCRUT4. The HADCRUT4 dataset is described in the Morice et al (2012) paper here. The CRUTEM4 data is described in Jones et al (2012) here. And the HadSST3 data is presented in the 2-part Kennedy et al (2012) paper here and here. The UKMO uses the base years of 1961-1990 for anomalies. The data source is here.
Update (Lags One Month): The July 2013 HADCRUT4 global temperature anomaly is +0.51 deg C. It increased (about 0.06 deg C) since June 2013.

HADCRUT4
152-MONTH RUNNING TRENDS 
As noted in my post Open Letter to the Royal Meteorological Society Regarding Dr. Trenberth’s Article “Has Global Warming Stalled?”, Kevin Trenberth of NCAR presented 10-year period-averaged temperatures in his article for the Royal Meteorological Society. He was attempting to show that the recent hiatus in global warming since 2001 was not unusual. Kevin Trenberth conveniently overlooked the fact that, based on his selected start year of 2001, the hiatus has lasted 12+ years, not 10.
The period from January 2001 to August 2013 is now 152-months long. Refer to the following graph of running 152-month trends from January 1880 to May 2013, using the GISS LOTI global temperature anomaly product. The last data point in the graph is the linear trend (in deg C per decade) from January 2001 to the current month. It is basically zero. That, of course, indicates global surface temperatures have not warmed during the most recent 152-month period. Working back in time, the data point immediately before the last one represents the linear trend for the 152-month period of December 2000 to July 2013, and the data point before it shows the trend in deg C per decade for November 2000 to June 2013, and so on.

152-Month Linear Trends
The highest recent rate of warming based on its linear trend occurred during the 152-month period that ended in late 2003, but warming trends have dropped drastically since then. Also note that about the early 1970s was the last time there had been a 152-month period without global warming—before recently.
195-MONTH RUNNING TRENDS
In his RMS article, Kevin Trenberth also conveniently overlooked the fact that the discussions about the warming hiatus are now for a time period of about 16 years, not 10 years—ever since David Rose’s DailyMail article titled “Global warming stopped 16 years ago, reveals Met Office report quietly released… and here is the chart to prove it”. In my response to Trenberth’s article, I updated David Rose’s graph, noting that surface temperatures in April 2013 were basically the same as they were in June 1997. We’ll use June 1997 as the start month for the running 16-year trends. The period is now 195-months long. The following graph is similar to the one above, except that it’s presenting running trends for 195-month periods.

195-Month Linear Trends
The last time global surface temperatures warmed at the minimal rate of 0.03 deg C per decade for a 195-month period was the late 1970s.
The most widely used metric of global warming — global surface temperatures — the metric most often used in predictions of future gloom and doom, indicates that the rate of global warming has slowed drastically and that the duration of the hiatus in global warming is unusual during a period when global surface temperatures are allegedly being warmed from the hypothetical impacts of manmade greenhouse gases. 
A NOTE ABOUT THE RUNNING-TREND GRAPHS
There is very little difference in the end point trends of 12+year and 16+year running trends if HADCRUT4 or NCDC products are used in place of GISS data. The major difference in the graphs is with the HADCRUT4 data and it can be seen in a graph of the 12+year trends. I suspect this is caused by the updates to the HADSST3 data that have not been applied to the ERSST.v3b sea surface temperature data used by GISS and NCDC.
COMPARISON 
The GISS, HADCRUT4 and NCDC global surface temperature anomalies are compared in the next three time-series graphs. The first graph compares the three global surface temperature anomaly products starting in 1979. Again, due to the timing of this post, the HADCRUT4 data lags the GISS and NCDC products by a month. The graph also includes the linear trends. Because the three datasets share common source data, (GISS and NCDC also use the same sea surface temperature data) it should come as no surprise that they are so similar. For those wanting a closer look at the more recent wiggles and trends, the second graph starts in 1998, which was the start year used by von Storch et al (2013) Can climate models explain the recent stagnation in global warming? They, of course found that the CMIP3 (IPCC AR4) and CMIP5 (IPCC AR5) models could NOT explain the recent hiatus.
The third comparison graph starts with Kevin Trenberth’s chosen year of 2001. All three of those comparison graphs present the anomalies using the base years of 1981 to 2010. Referring to their discussion under FAQ 9 here, according to NOAA:
This period is used in order to comply with a recommended World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Policy, which suggests using the latest decade for the 30-year average.

Comparison Starting in 1979
###########

Comparison Starting in 1998
###########

Comparison Starting in 2001
AVERAGE
The last graph presents the average of the GISS, HADCRUT and NCDC land plus sea surface temperature anomaly products. Again because the HADCRUT4 data lags one month in this update, the most current average only includes the GISS and NCDC products. The flatness of the data since 2001 is very obvious, as is the fact that surface temperatures have rarely risen above those created by the 1997/98 El Niño.

Average of Global Land+Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly Products
SUPPLEMENTS TO CLIMATE MODELS FAIL
I published the post Models Fail: Land versus Sea Surface Warming Rates a few days after I published my ebook Climate Models Fail. Though the graphs in the post were from the book, the Table and text were not. That method of showing and discussing the models’ failings occurred to me after I published Climate Models Fail.
I’ve decided to make available the additional posts about climate model failings, as they’re posted, as supplements to Climate Models Fail, in .pdf format. So if you’d like a copy of the post Models Fail: Land versus Sea Surface Warming Rates in .pdf format, click here. I’ll also include them as links on the post that introduced Climate Models Fail.

"The Shale UK Summit conference is underway in London, bringing together geological, petroleum, engineering and energy economics experts. Despite all this expertise, and although much of the fracking technology used to extract the gas from shale rock is well established, there are still a large number of unknowns surrounding fracking, including the potential effects on health. Fracking is still at a very early stage in the UK, with only one exploratory well drilled so far. This provides an important opportunity for scientists to gather information and study the health and environmental effects before any large-scale developments take place. Despite the unconventional oil and gas industry growing rapidly in the US, and gathering momentum elsewhere across the world, scientific study of the health effects of fracking is in its infancy. Yet early findings suggest this form of extraction might increase health risks compared to conventional oil and gas wells. The fracking drilling sites have larger surface footprints, and may be (certainly in the UK) much closer to where people live. The need to transport and store large volumes of toxic chemicals and contaminated water are likely to pose negative consequences for health. Research in the US, where 65,000 shale gas wells have been drilled, suggests  the risk of environmental contamination is present at all stages of extraction. These include surface spills and leakages, emissions from gas-processing equipment, and pollution from the large numbers of heavy transport vehicles involved. There is therefore ample opportunity for pollutants to contaminate the air, and ground and surface water. What about those working on the wells? While the toxicological data for the chemicals injected into wells (the fracking fluid) indicate that many of them have known adverse effects on health, there are some for which no toxicological data exists. Making a full assessment of potential risks to health has been difficult in the US because drilling operators are not required to disclose which chemicals are used. Thankfully, the UK Government has accepted the recommendations of the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering Working Group on shale gas extraction by requiring companies to disclosure the chemicals they use. But detailed studies are needed along the entire shale gas supply chain in order to understand potential health issues. The socioeconomic implications of shale gas development on local communities before, during, and after extraction, and how risks should be communicated and minimised, are especially important tasks that need to be tackled. In addition to local threats to health and environment, another key consideration is the contribution of shale gas to climate change. There is conflicting evidence about whether fracking produces more or less greenhouse gas emissions than coal. In any case, the evidence from the US is that shale gas has developed alongside the use of coal, rather than replacing it, leading to an overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions.  When considering the viability of fracking, it will be important for health impact assessments to include the long term implications of waste disposal, fugitive methane emissions escaping from the ground or the well, and other implications for human health – not just analyses of the environmental and public health risks during active development. With a technically challenging and global industry it’s vitally important that data and expertise is readily shared. In coming decades, climate policies and declining fuel reserves will probably drive substantial changes in energy policy. As the development of shale gas plays into questions of alternative sources of energy it can provide a good case study into the challenges ahead. What is important is that all the potential risks – immediate and for the long term – are established quickly so that policy and regulation can be made fit for purpose."
"**The island of Puerto Rico was devastated by the worst hurricane in its history** **over three** **weeks ago.**
Parts of the Caribbean island - home to 3.4 million US citizens - remain isolated, and phone networks have been catastrophically ruined, making it difficult to confirm the picture on the ground.
US President Donald Trump, who visited the island two weeks after Hurricane Maria hit, has pledged a quick recovery but experts say it could take months to complete.
Meanwhile - three weeks after the disaster - only about 10% of Puerto Ricans have electricity and many are fleeing for the mainland United States.

**What does Puerto Rico's recovery look like t** **hree** **weeks after Maria?**
Part of the reason Puerto Rico's recovery has been slowed is the island's reliance on air and sea ports to bring fuel, water and food. Runways needed to be cleared of debris and supplies were stuck in the island's ports because of a US law that limits shipping between parts of the US to US-flagged vessels.
Puerto Rico pressed the US to lift the act, and President Trump waived the act for 10 days to help with the recovery.
Mr Trump has also blamed local truck drivers for not getting back to work delivering supplies more quickly.
Among the most lingering dangers of the hurricane is the lack of clean water on the island, which has forced residents to gather from natural springs and ponds wherever possible.
Public health experts worry that this problem will make the recovery even more deadly as sanitary conditions worsen.
The USNS Comfort hospital ship, which arrived on 3 October, came bearing 500 medical personnel and 250 hospital beds onboard.
While agriculture is no longer a primary driver of Puerto Rico's economy, the destruction of the vast majority of crops on the island means growers in the coffee, plantains and other popular agricultural industries have lost their entire livelihoods in a single storm.
Loss of crops also means Puerto Ricans will need to import more of their food, an effort made more complicated by the nearby exporting countries in the Caribbean who have also been hit by hurricanes.
The storm knocked much of Puerto's Rico communications infrastructure, splitting a crucial link between family members that live in the continental US and on the island, as well as mobile phone networks that could be used to organise the recovery response.
Rebuilding the mobile phone network is expected to take many months.
Residents of Puerto Rico are American citizens, although they have no voting representative in Congress and cannot send electors to vote in US presidential races.
Only about half of mainland Americans in a recent poll know Puerto Ricans are fellow Americans. In a survey, knowledge of their citizenship meant respondents were slightly more likely to support relief aid."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAbout three weeks ago Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski wrote a highly critical piece of the IPCC’s recently released 5th Synthesis Report, claiming that the report IPCC misled the public and needlessly sounded the alarms, background here.
Also at Twitter Bojanowski pointed to “gross problems” that “need to be discussed”. The Spiegel journalist in the article wrote that the IPCC final report “suppressed central scientific findings”. 
Bojenowski’s harsh criticism immediately drew heavy fire from some of Germany’s leading political climate alarmists, such as the climate alarmist website Klimaretter and leading green politicians such as Hermann Ott at Twitter, and the IPCC itself.
So who is right? At the German Science Skeptical site, Dr. Peter Heller closely examined the claims made by Bojanowski point-by-point and the counter claims launched by the climate activists surrounding Klimaretter and the IPCC itself.
Heller lists the accusations that the Klimaretter activists fired at Bojanowski in attempt to discredit him and to exert pressure on Spiegel editors:

Careful selection of formulations by the IPCC were imprecisely translated.
By shortening the IPCC quotes, he leaves out such details that could damage the central thrust of his article.
He uses passages from the technical chapters that the Synthesis Report does not at all contradict – when examined closely. The passages in the technical chapters that do support the Synthesis report do not get quoted.
Sources to the (supposed) evidence are not given, so that all the accusations cannot be verified, or done so only with great difficulty.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Peter Heller investigated to see if the climate activists surrounding Klimaretter had any merit. Here’s what he found.

Bojanowski does not “translate” at all. He concisely summarized passages from the Reports for the regular online speed-readers. The problem here are by far more the requirements by his chief editors with respect to article length and the complexity of the formulations, to which he must yield.
The main thrust of his article is not that there is not risk of a climate-change dependent species die-off. The main thrust is that the IPCC fails to mention the known uncertainties in its summary of the long reports. And he provides proof of this with passages from the reports. It#s not about contradictions, but it gets down to incompletenesses.
In the meantime the sources have been provided. But also without the page numbers one quickly finds the corresponding passages when one looks closely enough. A look at the table of contents suffices. As I have shown above, everything can be verified.

In summary, the accusations by the Klimaretter activists fired at Bojanowski have no merit. Heller also adds, at the very end of his article (for those who are too lazy to search a little):
One may object that the criticism of the IPCC is excessive because a summary is precisely just that, and thus it cannot give the full content of the main reports. However: people should at least be aware of this. And their position on climate policy should not be derived from summaries, but rather from the complete, comprehensive literature. Bojanowski’s text here fulfills an important function in that he exposes for the first time, to many people, the one-sided selection of content the summaries have. When people at Klimaretter, when the signatories of the petition against Bojanowski, and when someone like Herrmann Ott recognize reprehensible “climate skepticism ”, then as activists they expose themselves as something more than fanatics. For fundamentalists not only is the message sacrosanct, but so is also its proclaimer.”
What can we take home from all this?
Any journalist who actually investigates and researches, instead of blindly believing everything told by the one being investigated, risks getting smeared and discredited. Luckily we have diligent and open-minded people like Peter Heller to make sure this does not go unchallenged.

"Australia has been in the climate wars since late 2009 when Tony Abbott rolled Malcolm Turnbull and made the pursuit of no climate policy a hallmark of Australian conservative politics. It has been an all-out battle at many points, simmering conflict at others. Investor confidence has been one of the casualties. Now it appears that the Labor party is offering a truce. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, offered the PM to “agree on an energy investment framework that will deliver the modernisation of our energy system”. Labor wants a “flexible and enduring” policy model that can adapt to different emissions targets and says it is agnostic about which policy instrument would deliver this.  The focus on investment in clean energy is absolutely right. Australia’s energy and industrial system is crying out for modernisation. The zero emissions options are right there, and they are affordable. In fact, renewable energy is becoming cheap enough for the tantalising prospect of exporting zero-emissions fuels and metals. The government’s discussion paper towards its Technology Roadmap acknowledges much of this. But will government actually support the large-scale deployment of clean technologies? Will it pump much more money into its clean energy agencies ARENA and CEFC, and properly fund the universities for research? Crucially, will it set proper incentives and regulations for industry to invest? The Coalition government seems a long way from putting any policy in place to actually accelerate clean investment, and thereby push out coal plants and other fossil-fuel-using equipment. Its new mantra is “technology not taxes”, and plans announced so far are only to drip-feed some subsidies to industry. The zero-carbon transition means investment of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, and for this to happen we need a clear and lasting direction in national policy. For Labor to get the Coalition to lift its offerings, the offer for a truce would need to come from a position of strength. A majority of the population wants action on climate change, but only just over half say they think Australia is not doing enough. The bushfires put the spotlight on climate change, but the big issue now is of course Covid and its aftermath. Australian voters are easily scared of the presumed costs of acting on climate change at the best of times. The recession will make it a lot harder to win any argument on environmental policy. And yet climate change remains the true national challenge. Not just in terms of dealing with the increasingly dire impacts, but also for creating an economy that is competitive in a world that will shift to a lower carbon model. Australia’s long-term economic prosperity will not lie in coal and gas. It could in part lie in renewable power, zero-emissions fuels and metals, and clean and green agriculture. Albanese called for “respect for science”. That respect is what made the successful Covid response possible, and it would be the perfect foundation for bipartisanship on climate change. In a political system like Australia’s, basic agreement between the two major parties is needed to make lasting progress on the big issues. The opening of the economy in the 1980s is one example, immigration another. Countries that have made big progress on climate policy typically have that broad political consensus. In the UK and Germany, it is accepted across the political mainstream that the goal is net zero emissions, and that governments should and will push in that direction. The contest is about how quickly to go not in which direction, the “how” not the “what”. Bipartisanship like that is what Australia needs on climate policy. The economic stakes and industry interests are huge and so there cannot be lasting progress when climate change is fodder for party politics. If we had agreement on cornerstones of goals and policy, federal governments could finally help position our economy for the technologies and export industries of the future. It would lessen the risk that we will get stuck at an economic dead end. And it would allow us to play a constructive role in global efforts on climate change. A gloomier interpretation is that Labor simply wants to shut down the issue and fight the next election on the question of the economy and the social fallout from Covid alone. It would fit in with the global shift towards isolationism and economic nationalism. There are those in the Labor party who see support from blue collar constituents shrinking away and who see better electoral prospects singing the praises of fossil fuels. If the truce offered is their doing then it is really a surrender. A bipartisanship of inaction on climate would be a nightmare for the prosperity of the country, and for our contribution to solving the climate crisis. Taken at face value though, Albanese’s intervention throws a positive challenge to the government. Here’s hoping. Frank Jotzo is a professor at ANU Crawford School of Public Policy. He runs the Centre for Climate and Energy Policy"

The United States confronts increasingly urgent challenges around the globe. Washington’s policies are widely seen as failing   
  
The Obama administration has been doing a little better, but not good enough, with China. There is no open conflict between the two, but tensions are high.   
  
Territorial disputes throughout the South China Sea and Sea of Japan could flare into violence. North Korea is more disruptive than ever. Other important issues lurk in the background.   
  
While there should be no surprise when important powers like the U.S. and People’s Republic of China (PRC) disagree, the two must work through such issues. Unfortunately, the U.S. is far better at making demands than negotiating solutions. In particular, Washington seems to ignore the interdependence of issues, the fact that positions taken in one area may affect responses in others.   
  
For instance, the U.S. famously initiated a “pivot” to Asia, or “rebalancing” of U.S. resources to the region. The U.S. implausibly claimed that the shift had nothing to do with China.   
  
But the residents of Zhongnanhai are not stupid. For what other reason would America reaffirm _military_ alliances and augment _military_ forces in Beijing’s backyard?   
  
Yet at the same time the Obama administration was pressing the PRC to apply greater pressure on North Korea to end the latter’s nuclear program and constant provocations. Step on Pyongyang’s windpipe and force North Korea to yield, said Washington.   
  
The U.S. acted as if it was asking for a small favor. In fact, no one knows how the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would react. Worst geopolitically for China would be eventual Korean reunification, which would leave an expanded U.S. ally hosting American troops on the Yalu.   




The latter would be unpleasant for Beijing even without the “pivot.” A unified Korea could play a significant role in any campaign to contain the PRC.   
  
The Obama administration’s attempt to moderate territorial disputes in the region runs into the same problem. America is committed to one side, maintaining defense relationships, deployments, and treaties with several interested parties including Japan. Washington’s endorsement of the status quo favors America’s friends and allies.   
  
The PRC likely would be skeptical even if it saw the U.S.-led bloc as benign. However, America’s senior ally is Japan, still remembered for its World War II depredations in China.   
  
The U.S. has sought Beijing’s aid in overthrowing the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and forcing Iran to abandon any nuclear weapons ambitions. The PRC’s acquiescence would expand American influence and even perhaps create a new U.S. client state. That is not obviously in the PRC’s interest, especially when America is seen as attempting to maintain its dominance in East Asia.   
  
Other issues also cannot be considered in isolation. While human rights are not a security question, American pressure on Beijing to respect political activities hostile to the Communist Party’s monopoly of power may be seen to be no less threatening than Washington’s military moves.   
  
Moreover, U.S. attempts to convince Beijing to combat climate change by limiting energy use—which would inevitably slow China’s economic growth—look more sinister when Washington is working to constrain the PRC’s influence.   
  
There inevitably will be disagreements and misunderstandings between America and China. The two nations must manage such controversies. As I point out in a new article on China-U.S. Focus, “the world’s superpower and incipient superpower must strive to develop a sustained cooperative relationship, as did imperial Great Britain and rising America.”   
  
Doing so will require recognizing that issues are interrelated. In particular, the U.S. cannot be seen as leading a coalition against Beijing if it hopes to convince the PRC to adopt policies seemingly against its own geopolitical interests. Washington will have to relearn the art of diplomacy as it better sets priorities.

Nicole and I have spent the last few hours with the lawyers going over the final version of our submission on the Arms Legislation Amendment Bill — the Government’s second tranche of firearms law changes.



You can read the [full submission here](http://www.fairandreasonable.co.nz/colfo_submission?e=fc4d8ed9a839d493bcf80e4732907a3d&utm_source=fairandreasonable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=191012_select_committee_sub&n=2) (I’ve also copied a summary of the submission to the end of this email).



The Bill introduces an **onerous firearms register** , halves the period of a licence, will hike fees, and introduces new rules and restrictions on arms and ammo. It also hands enormous and discretionary regulatory power to the Police and in our view will undermine the mutual trust and confidence between the Police and responsible firearms owners, which New Zealand has historically enjoyed. 



As you will see, the lawyers have spent many long days over the last two weeks to ensure that our arguments are presented persuasively and the full effects of the proposed law changes are laid bare. After reading the full submission it leaves you with an impression that the Bill is a result of Government determined to ostracise, rather than work constructively with, responsible firearms owners.



Some extracts:



 _This Bill is far more reprehensible after close study than was feared from the Government announcements. But among the disappointments is that it has not taken the opportunity to fix obvious problems from the rushed Arm (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019 [the Amendment Act]. That Act was made in a climate of political excitement. **It did not follow good legislative processes. It did not benefit from proper consultation.** This Bill gives the Committee the opportunity to fix these issues now._



 _This Bill contains significant increases to penalties for existing and new offences. … We are not aware of any evidence that should have persuaded the government that these increases will do anything to deter unsafe firearm use. **It is likely to have the opposite effect** – it will make criminals out of those people who in all other aspects have been law abiding citizens, generally ready and willing to support the Police and to play their part in reporting and deterring crime in their communities._



On the compensation and buyback:



 _We think the current approach is catapulting prohibited weapons into the unlawful sector. …_ _No evidence has been put forward by the government to explain why the rates of compensation seem deliberately set to punish firearm owners. … The Government cannot complain if owners generally see as a denunciation, an approach that they are inherently wrongdoers. Such hostility does not build “trust and confidence.”_



Our lawyers tell us that the best way to ensure the submission is well-considered, is to ensure a very large number of people are willing to endorse or support the submission, and (ideally) make their own submission putting similar points into their own words.



Those groups who want to see even more restrictions and prohibitions are organising to get people outside the firearms community to submit in support of the Bill’s provisions.



That’s why we are asking you to visit our website and [add your name to the submission](https://www.fairandreasonable.co.nz/arms_legislation_bill?e=fc4d8ed9a839d493bcf80e4732907a3d&utm_source=fairandreasonable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=191012_select_committee_sub&n=3) before we submit it to the Select Committee on 23 October.



Personal submissions are the most powerful tool you can use to convince MPs to dump the onerous provisions in this Bill – or at the very least defer the close of submissions until after the Christchurch Royal Commission has reported back.



Our lawyers have created [a series of guidance papers](https://www.fairandreasonable.co.nz/submission_guidence?e=fc4d8ed9a839d493bcf80e4732907a3d&utm_source=fairandreasonable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=191012_select_committee_sub&n=5) on the various aspects of the Bill. If you agree that standing up for the rights of lawful firearms owners is important, please take a few minutes to **put the points into your own words** and file your own submissions. [You can read the guidance on how to make a submission here.](https://www.fairandreasonable.co.nz/submission_guidence?e=fc4d8ed9a839d493bcf80e4732907a3d&utm_source=fairandreasonable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=191012_select_committee_sub&n=6)

"Corpses of psychiatric patients were found with head injuries and unexplained bruises. Relatives were not informed of the deaths of their loved ones. The transfers of mentally ill patients were seen as business opportunities. Those were some of the findings of a South African government investigation published on Wednesday that determined that 94 psychiatric patients died of negligence last year after being moved by the authorities in Gauteng Province to facilities that were likened in some cases to concentration camps. The report prompted calls for criminal prosecutions. More than 1, 300 patients under state care were transferred last year from a unit of Life Healthcare Group, a private hospital group in South Africa, to 27 charitable organizations in an effort by the health department in the province to save money. Pretoria, the country’s administrative capital, and Johannesburg are in Gauteng. The investigation was opened last September after 36 patients were found dead after being moved to some of the facilities operated by the charitable organizations. The report, by Professor Malegapuru W. Makgoba, the South African health ombudsman, found that the death toll was nearly 100, however. Investigators found facilities that were overcrowded and “full of hungry patients,” adding that some were wearing pants held together with shoelaces. Other patients complained of rotten food and said they went weeks without medication. The decision to move the patients “was unwise and flawed,” the report said, “with inadequate planning and a chaotic and rushed or hurried implementation process. ” All 27 of the organizations operated under invalid licenses, it said, so patients who were transferred there had died in “unlawful circumstances. ” The authorities in Gauteng Province, along with some of the care centers, could not be reached for comment. “It’s remarkable that only one person has died from a mental   illness,” Professor Makgoba told local new outlets on Wednesday. The others died from “things like dehydration, diarrhea, epilepsy, heart attacks, all other things except mental illness. ” None of the care centers had professional doctors, nurses, psychiatrists or other therapists that normally cared for the patients, Professor Makgoba said in a separate interview on Thursday. “You have state patients in licensed institutions and you put them into unlicensed institutions,” he said. “I was shocked. ” The families of patients, as well as activists and psychiatrists, had vigorously opposed the plan to move the patients, arguing that it was dangerous to send them to facilities that were not equipped to handle them. Christopher Archer, of the South African Society of Psychiatrists, one of the groups that opposed the transfers, said that it was clear that “precipitous action had been taken without proper planning and these patients were moved prematurely before the facilities were property vetted. ” Public health services in South Africa are under enormous strain and severe budgetary constraints, Mr. Archer said in an interview. “There are more patients than there is money and this was considered a move to try to restrain public spending,” he said. “But it turns out it was completely inappropriate. ” The head of the provincial government’s health department, Qedani Mahlangu, resigned on Tuesday, just before the report was published, and there were mounting calls for David Makhura, the premier of Gauteng Province, to do the same. President Jacob Zuma thanked Professor Makgoba for his report, noting that it would help the government “ensure that such a tragedy does not recur in the health sector,” according to The Associated Press, but many South Africans said they were unconvinced. If 94 mental patients had died from official negligence in a “normal democracy,” the entire national government would have been forced to resign, Barney Mthombothi, a former editor of Financial Mail, a South African business publication, wrote on Twitter."

IPCC has never waited for 30-year trends, and they were right.
Guest essay by Barry Brill
Under pressure at a media conference following release of its Summary for Policymakers, AR5 WG1 Co-Chair Thomas Stocker is reported to have said that “climate trends should not be considered for periods less than 30 years”.
Some have seen this as the beginning of an IPCC ploy to continue ignoring the 16-year-old temperature standstill for many years into the future. But even the IPCC must know that any such red herring is dead in the water:
1. When James Hansen launched the global warming scare in 1988, there had been no statistically significant warming over the previous 30 years and the warming trend during 1977-87 was 0.0°C. The IPCC was also established that year.

Source: Woodfortrees plot

2. At the time of the first IPCC report in 1991 (FAR), the warming trend was barely 11 years old.

Source: Woodfortrees plot
3. Most significantly, the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 adopted the UNFCCC treaty on the basis of a 30-year cooling trend followed by only 12 years of warming. That treaty dogmatically redefined “climate change” as being anthropogenic and eventually committed over 190 countries to combat “dangerous” warming.
4. The latest WG1 report bases its assessment of sea level rise and ocean heat content on the trend in satellite readings which have been available for only 19 years, coupled with ARGO reports for a period less than a decade. There is no apology for the short periods.
5. In 2007, the AR4 made much of the fact that the warming trend over the previous 15 years exceeded 0.2°C/decade. In 2013, the AR5 plays down the fact that there is no significant warming at all during the previous 15 years. (But AR5 cites 0.05°C/decade without mentioning that this figure is ±0.14°C).
6. If the IPCC wants to focus on 30-year trends, why did it make no comment on the fact that the current 30-year trend has fallen to 0.174°C/decade from the 0.182°C/decade trend that was the (1992-2006) backdrop to the AR4? Particularly, as the intervening 6-year period has been characterised by record increases in CO2 emissions.
7. Dr Stocker’s criticism of short-term trends as being influenced by start and end dates, ignores that long-term trends are similar. He picked a 60-year period (1951-2010) to produce a 0.12°C/decade trend, when a 70-year or 80-year period would have shown a much-reduced trend of 0.07°C.
8. WG1 scientists found it appropriate to include a statement in the AR5 SPM that
“Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10 –15 years.”
3 months later, this crucial sentence was disappeared by a secret conclave of politicians/bureaucrats – not by scientists.
9. Dr Jarraud, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), told journalist David Rose that his question about the standstill was “ill-posed”. The WMO issues manuals on best practice for climatology and regards itself as the premier authority on measuring temperature trends. Here is what its manual WMO GUIDE TO CLIMATOLOGICAL PRACTICES (3RD EDTN) has to say about 30-year periods:
Chapter 4.8.1 Period of calculation“A number of studies have found that 30 years is not generally the optimal averaging period for normals used for prediction. The optimal period for temperatures is often substantially shorter than 30 years, but the optimal period for precipitation is often subtantially greater than 30 years.”And (at page 102):“The optimal length of record for predictive use of normals varies with element, geography, and secular trend. In general, the most recent 5‑ to 10‑year period of record has as much predictive value as a 30‑year record.”
Prior to release of the SPM, Bloomberg reported that some countries (notably Germany) wanted to wholly ignore the temperature standstill and pretend that the 20-year-old paradigm was still intact.
Few expected that would happen, predicting a sharply-reduced best estimate of sensitivity and rueful acknowledgment that natural factors had been under-estimated. The fact that days of debate culminated in this absurd canard about 30-year trends is a powerful indicator of just how desperate the climate establishment has now become.

"The International Panel on Climate Change’s Working Group 3 report is a welcome outline of how to stem the tide of climate change. It illustrates a significant change in strategy, from a complete switch away from fossil fuels to other mitigation measures. Until recently IPCC strongly advocated switching away from fossil fuels as the main route to carbon neutrality. Any mention of other mitigation measures tended to be dismissed as defeatist and diverting attention from the real problem of switching away from fossil fuels.  But recent developments seem to have forced the IPCC to change its tack. The innovations and reforms laid out to reduce emissions include short-term measures such as switching from coal to gas, as well as the loftier goal of turning to renewable energy. Preventing global warming requires a concerted effort of the whole world – it therefore requires agreement of all the governments. This has proved to be impossible to achieve, despite numerous world summits. Perhaps this kind of global cooperation was rather naïve to hope for. The lack of consensus, however, has meant that global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. This makes keeping temperatures to a 2°C increase more and more difficult. The world financial crisis of 2008 and the recession it caused has highlighted the cost of switching away from fossil fuels. The expense of a switch would jeopardise global economic recovery and increase “fuel poverty”, or indeed lack of access to electricity, by making electricity more expensive.  It is noted that “about 1.3 billion people worldwide do not have access to electricity and about 3 billion are dependent on traditional solid fuels for cooking and heating with severe adverse effects on health, ecosystems and development”. Responding to financial pressures, subsidies for renewables have been reduced in many countries over the last few years making investment in them less profitable. The perceived depletion of fossil fuels globally was one of the additional  reasons for the IPCC previously advocating a switch away from fossil fuels. But the shale gas revolution in the US and the growth of unconventional hydrocarbons has shown that oil and gas reservoirs are far from extinct. Indeed, the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook report for 2011 spoke of the “Golden Age of Gas”. An abundance of cheap gas not only puts severe competitive pressure on renewables and nuclear, it also offers a short-term bridge to a low carbon future, as producing electricity from gas gives of about half the CO2 emissions of coal. As coal is still a dominant fuel source in many countries in the world – notably in China and India – switching to gas would reduce their CO2 emissions considerably and at much lower costs than switching to renewables, as it did in USA. Despite the US government failing to act convincingly on climate change, America has achieved some of the highest reductions of CO2 emissions in recent years thanks to the switch from coal to gas.  Environmentalists have previously dismissed the argument for investing in gas, for fear it would lock us into a high-carbon future (when compared to switching to renewables). But the latest IPCC report seems to accept the gas argument by saying:  Greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current world average coal‐fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas combined‐cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated (robust evidence, high agreement). This is a welcome departure from a principled but very expensive and therefore unrealistic position of dismissing gas to a more realistic one of accepting it as a cheaper “lesser evil”. In fact, gas power stations, due to their ability to change generation relatively quickly, play an important role in providing a flexible back-up for  intermittent wind and solar generation in many countries (such as Ireland). Nuclear was previously seen as an important low-carbon technology. But the Fukushima disaster has caused many countries in the world, most notably Germany and Japan, to abandon nuclear energy. As a result Germany, despite very significant advances in deploying wind and solar energy, has increased its CO2 emissions due to replacing nuclear partially by coal and lignite – the two worst carbon polluters. The latest report therefore recommends that nuclear power can make an “increasing contribution to low-carbon energy supply”, though this is not without its ill-effects on the environment. It also goes to show why there is more emphasis on gas as a short-term bridge in the latest report. There is increased appreciation that it is more important to take action now rather than later to prevent further accumulation of greenhouse gases in atmosphere. This is why the short-term and effective – albeit imperfect – mitigation measures, such as switching from coal to gas, are better than long-term perfect ones, such as switching to renewables. By the time the latter are established to be more cost-effective, it might be too late to prevent climate change. The IPCC report shows there are a variety of different ways to mitigate against climate change. Apart from the usual call to increase the uptake of renewables, they advocate replacing coal with gas, deploying carbon capture and storage, technical and behavioural changes for all modes of transport, reducing fuels that are carbon intense and the building sector’s use of energy, as well as generally improving energy efficiency across sectors. Continued efforts must be made across the world to implement these more realistic measures."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor decades the science told us that humans needed to cut back on fatty foods like red meat, eggs, chicken, cheese, butter and that we should switch to high carb diets, with lots of exercises. High carb, low fat was The Consensus. Backed by all the US medical associations and 99% of all doctors. Dissenters were dismissed, marginalized and labeled as kooks.
Decades later, America (and much of western society) now finds itself on the brink of a public health catastrophe with tens of millions having suffered heart attacks and tens of millions becoming obese and diabetic. Even the most optimistic of statistics show an even gloomier future.
What’s even worse, these nutrition-related diseases, once known to almost only afflict adults, are now spreading rapidly to children. The scientific consensus on nutrition has turned out to be disastrously wrong and it will go down as the greatest scientific folly in the history of mankind.

"Governments cannot address heat as a cause of bushfires so must focus on managing fuel loads instead, the Liberal candidate for Eden-Monaro, Fiona Kotvojs, has argued in a submission to the bushfire royal commission. Kotvojs, who has a history of downplaying the human contribution to global heating, also argued that bushfire management should be the sole responsibility of state governments, despite Scott Morrison accepting during the  summer bushfires the public expects the federal government to play a greater role. Kotvojs and her husband, Alan Burdon, made the submission in April, just nine days before the resignation of former Labor MP Mike Kelly set up the Eden Monaro byelection. Kotvojs is contesting the poll on Saturday against Labor’s candidate, Bega mayor Kristy McBain, and the Nationals’ Trevor Hicks, as the Coalition aims for a once-in-a-century win for a government in a byelection. In the submission, Kotvojs and Burdon state that fire “is caused by three factors, fuel, oxygen, and heat”. “In working to minimise the likelihood of bushfires occurring and increasing the likelihood of being able to manage and defeat those that do occur, there is only one of these three factors that can be addressed; fuel load,” they said. The pair said fuel load was the “only one issue” for them and that “unless this is addressed, everything else is meaningless”. The terms of reference of the royal commission state that the “changing global climate carries risks for the Australian environment and Australia’s ability to prevent, mitigate and respond to bushfires and other natural disasters”. Kotvojs has previously said that “solar activity” is the primary driver of climate change, that it’s a “myth” it increases cyclones and that the risk to Pacific nations is overstated. Earlier in June, Kotvojs told Guardian Australia she stood by those statements but accepted that “humans contribute to [the] changing climate” and “we need to have a reduction in emissions”. The submission does not explain why – given the human-induced nature of global heating – a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would not help reduce the heat which is a key factor in the severity of bushfires. Morrison has said there is no direct link between Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and particular fire events. The natural disasters minister, David Littleproud, said in September he did not know if climate change was man-made, before reversing his position. Kotvojs and Burdon argued there is “a lack of public clarity as to the different roles and responsibilities of federal and state governments” in the management of natural disasters. “This creates confusion among the public and led to a lack of confidence in the government’s ability to effectively lead and manage the emergency.” Kotvojs and Burdon said it should be up to state and territory fire services to decide “whether a single federal body/agency is required” to handle bushfires. But in order to minimise the possibility of a “blame game”, the pair recommended that “responsibility for preparation and response to bushfires should be with the same level of government”. “Hitherto, even the worst fires have tended to be contained to one or two states, with the peak occurring during one or two significant days. “In these situations, from our perspective, it makes most sense for management of bushfires to be as close to the fires as possible.” “Therefore we believe that the preparation for and response to bushfires should remain the sole responsibility of state authorities.” The pair said they saw “no value” in moving the responsibility for running and financing fire services to the federal government, although it could provide “emergency funding in special circumstances” to be administered at the state level. Expanding federal power over natural disaster management is a key focus of the royal commission due to what Morrison called a “community expectation now that there be a more direct ability for the commonwealth, particularly through the Australian defence forces, to be able to take action”. Kotvojs and Burdon also complained that many of the businesses involved in the clean up in Bega Valley and Eurobodalla “are from Sydney and do not employ people locally”, hampering local economic recovery."
"SOFIA, Bulgaria  —   With one foot in the West and the other in the East, Bulgaria has long engaged in a delicate balancing act. But now the country, and its new president, Rumen Radev, will have to learn how to balance Donald J. Trump and an increasingly energized Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Radev contemplated his new role as balancer in chief two days before he was sworn in on Jan. 19, sitting across the street from the presidential palace in the labyrinthine former headquarters of the Bulgarian Communist Party. “We have a clear road map to follow,” Mr. Radev said. “Staying in the E. U. and staying in NATO. But at the same time, we have a deep historical relationship with Russia. ” Countries like Bulgaria have spent decades balancing East and West, and playing one off the other. But the prospect of President Trump’s moving closer to Mr. Putin has scrambled that strategy, as have the conflicting messages coming out of the new American administration. Mr. Trump has seemed eager for closer Kremlin ties, even echoing Moscow’s disdain for NATO and the European Union. But last week, his new ambassador echoed the Obama administration’s harder line, saying the United States would not withdraw sanctions against Russia until the country pulled its troops out of Crimea. At the same time, Mr. Putin has been showing new signs of swagger in his dealings with Russia’s neighbors on Thursday he arrived in Hungary for his first foray into Europe in the Trump era. Bulgaria is an eager member of the European Union, but as rising nationalism caused support for the union to wane, here and elsewhere, Russian influence has crept in. On the surface, this suggests that Mr. Trump’s outreach to Moscow, if genuine, would be good for Bulgaria  —   and, indeed, nationalists are thrilled. But Bulgaria has also known so many betrayals and occupations that this sudden lurch has inspired as much worry as elation, including fears that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will forge a bargain between themselves that serves their two nations but carves up the region into spheres of influence, just as the major powers did at the end of World War II. For many reasons, including economic necessity, a common culture and deep historical ties, Bulgarian politicians, including the president, want closer relations with Russia, but not so close that their nation loses its cherished ties to the West and falls firmly into Russia’s orbit. It is unclear whether Bulgaria’s old balancing act will work in the emerging international order. Indeed, similar calculations are being made throughout Central and Eastern Europe as leaders wait to see what Mr. Trump has in mind. It was the subtext of the meeting in Budapest last week between Mr. Putin and Hungary’s autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orban, at which the two expressed the desire for friendly relations but did not mention sticky issues like the Crimean sanctions. For Bulgaria, the poorest member of the European Union and the one with the deepest ties to Russia, the ride has been a particularly turbulent one. After the initial euphoria over the collapse of Communism and membership in the European Union in 2007 and NATO in 2004, disappointments followed. The slow pace of economic growth, persistent corruption, domineering oligarchs and a dependence on Russian oil and gas caused many politicians in Bulgaria and elsewhere to pivot eastward. A growing number of populists and nationalists found much to admire in Mr. Putin’s autocratic approach. When Bulgaria was accepted into the European Union, the country turned westward with great zeal. Money poured in from Brussels. Hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians seized the chance to move to Britain, Germany and elsewhere. But the growing ambivalence about the union was apparent as recently as last month when the 10th anniversary of Bulgaria’s entrance into the union passed with barely any public celebration or notice. Now   voices are on the defensive in Bulgaria, and the tenor of national politics has shifted in a more   way. How confusion over Mr. Trump’s actual intentions toward Moscow will affect that dynamic remains to be seen. Mr. Trump’s manner of talking has already emboldened nationalists and populists throughout Central and Eastern Europe  —   including Mr. Orban and Milos Zeman, the Czech Republic’s president  —   to sharpen their own talk and offer the Kremlin an even friendlier hand, even as many analysts warn against creeping influence from Russia. “The more you go to the East, the more you see more authoritarian systems and more corrupt practices,” said Ognyan Minchev, executive director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies and a professor of political science at the University of Sofia. “If it is not guarded, it will erode, and this process will move to the West. It is a battle, and it is a battle for a region that is historically defined as no man’s land. ” A big question hanging over the European Union this year is how much Mr. Putin will try to influence critical elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands  —   as well as in less prominent contests like November’s vote to replace a Czech Parliament that has remained firmly   despite its president’s friendliness toward Mr. Putin. “The   are in retreat. In the coming year, Merkel may fall,” said Ruslan Stefanov, director of the economic program at the Center for the Study of Democracy in Sofia, referring to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. “The Netherlands may leave the union. Italy. France. It’s a brave new world. ” Historical and cultural ties between Russia and Bulgaria are deeply emotional, one reason that   sentiment is gathering political momentum. “Improving relations with Russia is good for Bulgaria, the United States and the world,” said Nikolai Malinov, the chairman of the National Movement of Russophiles, founded in 2003. “When you are banging weapons, or imposing sanctions, it is not good. We have to heal those wounds. ” Mr. Malinov’s group, which claims 35, 000 members, describes itself as a cultural organization, staging concerts, maintaining monuments to Bulgaria’s past with Russia, erecting monuments and pushing for more   training. In Bulgaria, the president acts as head of state and commander in chief of the military, but most political power resides with the prime minister. Boyko Borissov, who took a slightly more   tilt but also strongly favored close ties with Moscow, stepped down as prime minister after Mr. Radev’s victory. Mr. Radev had 20 opponents in his race for president, said Ivo Indzhev, a   journalist. Just one, he said, explicitly echoed the   alliance’s language toward sanctions against Russia over its seizure of Crimea. Yet the paradox of this eastward shift is the growing anxiety that Bulgaria could become a geopolitical bargaining chip. “This is nothing new for Eastern Europe, to be part of a game plan that is reminiscent of Yalta,” said Ilian Vassilev, Bulgarian ambassador to Russia from 2000 to 2006. “President Trump can do whatever he wants to do within the bounds of the U. S. Constitution, but he cannot replace the feeling Eastern Europeans have that they are being betrayed. A deal is going on over their heads. ” Bulgaria has a stubborn culture of corruption and oligarchic control, which the Kremlin has been adept at exploiting in service of expanding its influence. The   Center for Strategic and International Studies and the   Center for the Study of Democracy released a study in October. Called “The Kremlin Playbook,” it characterized Bulgaria as the most deeply penetrated by Russia financially. Investment with Russian roots, direct and indirect, accounts for more than 22 percent of Bulgaria’s gross domestic product, marking the country as a “captured state,” said the study, of which Mr. Stefanov was an author. Increasing Russian penetration was also found in Slovakia, Latvia, Serbia and Hungary. “In one way or another, all of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have become captured states of the oligarchic network which emerged from the old security services of the Communist regimes,” Dr. Minchev said in an interview. “They went underground and   as this new,   business elite. ” Peter Kreko, a Hungarian political analyst and visiting professor in the central Eurasian studies department at Indiana University, thinks the talk of friendlier relations between Washington and Moscow is already having an impact on European nationalists. “Definitely, it’s seen as a green light for populist and nationalist leaders across Europe to accelerate their moves toward Russia,” Dr. Kreko said. But he thinks those leaders  —   who see the   alliance and its emphasis on democracy and human rights as threats to their power  —   are fooling themselves if they believe that a grand bargain between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will benefit them. “If there is a big deal, if there is a big bargain, will they play any role in that?” Dr. Kreko said. “I don’t think so. ” The larger worry, he and other analysts said, is that such a grand bargain would propel Mr. Putin’s goal of again declaring spheres of influence between East and West  —   resulting in a reduced American presence in the region and a greater Russian one. “For those of us who have always believed the U. S. is a beacon of hope, it is a shock,” Mr. Vassilev said. “The most   guys in Bulgaria are turning against America because they cannot tell the difference between Putin and Trump. ”"
"WASHINGTON  —   The document carried the title “A Roadmap to Repeal,” a concise list of Obama administration environmental regulations that a Koch   group was pressing President Trump and Congress to quickly reverse after Inauguration Day. It was a tally of rules that energy industry executives and lobbyists had waged a futile fight against for eight years, donating millions of dollars to lawmakers who vowed to help block them, filing lawsuits to try to overturn them and hiring experts to generate reports that questioned the need for them. But in a flurry of activity this past week, Congress did what Charles G. and David H. Koch  —   who own a conglomerate that sells hundreds of products, including gasoline, jet fuel and coal  —   and other industry leaders had been asking for. Using a rarely invoked law, the   Congress nullified a measure intended to curb the venting of gas wells on federal lands, and began the process of rolling back other regulations, including one enacted to limit damage that coal mines cause to streams  —   each items on the “Roadmap to Repeal. ” On Friday, with his own executive orders, Mr. Trump took up two more items on the list, including a call to rewrite major provisions of the   Act, legislation crafted by the Obama administration and passed by Congress in response to the 2008 financial meltdown. Not since the Reagan administration has Washington moved so quickly to roll back or nullify so many federal regulations, one of the clearest signs of an abrupt shift of power in a government now under   control that has flipped the script of winners and losers. “It is a big, fat victory, after all this time,” said Luke Popovich, a vice president at the National Mining Association, an industry trade group. A   alliance has now been formed among Congress, the Trump administration and industries that struggled to reverse what they saw as an    rush to regulate by the Obama administration. This new alignment of power is causing alarm among not only environmental groups but also other  —   mostly liberal  —   advocates who have spent much of the past eight years pushing for new rules to cover Wall Street banks, broadband providers, teacher preparation requirements, prepaid credit cards and even companies that sell   foods in vending machines. All of these measures, and many others, now stand a chance of being reversed, watered down or blocked. “For the last several years, whenever Congress would concoct some way to roll back a rule protecting clean air or clean water or undermine the fight against climate change, we always felt confident as we had an adult in charge at the White House,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, an environmental group. “Now, what used to be a wish list of the oil and coal and gas industry has become the   list for Congress and the White House. ” For Republicans, these first moves are the easy part, made possible by a law that gives Congress the power to reverse regulations within 60 legislative days with a simple majority vote in the House and Senate. Other Republican efforts to exploit this    law  —   which until this week had been used only once to nullify a new rule  —   were thwarted five times with vetoes by President Obama since 2015. Once the   window expires, Republicans will have a harder time reversing Mr. Obama’s regulations, but will still have tools at their disposal, including cutting financing for the enforcement of rules, issuing new rules that are weaker, or negotiating with Democrats to pass new legislation. They have bold ambitions, including rescinding a rule enacted by the Obama administration that could close dozens of coal burning power plants, and another that would extend overtime pay eligibility to an estimated four million Americans. At a private meeting on Thursday hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, a senior White House adviser provided a plan on how the administration would handle efforts to curtail environmental regulations beyond the initial rush now underway to nullify recently adopted rules, said an energy industry executive who participated in the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity because details were confidential. Industry advocates and their allies in Congress said the   moves toward deregulation was good for consumers and the economy, as they simply wanted to eliminate measures that they believed cost jobs and drove up prices. Among the regulations being targeted: the methane rule, an Interior Department measure meant to reduce   flaring, when gas leaking from wells is burned off like a giant blow torch. “Even on the way out the door, the former administration’s regulatory onslaught continued as they pushed through more midnight regulations,” the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said on Wednesday, as he urged his colleagues to reverse the coal mining regulation, known as the Stream Buffer Rule. “Fortunately, with a new president, we now have the opportunity to give the American people relief and our economy a boost. ” Lobbyists for the   extraction industry  —   oil, gas, coal and other mining operations  —   said they were as surprised as anyone else by the outcome of the November election, which gave them new clout in Washington. “A lot of us folks just did not anticipate we were going to be doing this,” said Stephen Brown, a lobbyist at Tesoro, an oil refining and marketing company based in San Antonio. “It was like the dog that caught up with the UPS truck. ” Within days of the election, conference calls and meetings between industry lobbyists, members of Mr. Trump’s transition teams and key Republican staff members on Capitol Hill were taking place. Those who took part began to plot out which regulations they wanted to go after first, participants in the process said. Energy rules quickly ended up at the top of the list. Mr. Obama was unusually aggressive in using his regulatory powers to expand the reach of the federal government over the energy industry, after failing to win the support he needed in Congress to pass legislation to take similar steps. But the energy industry spends about $300 million a year lobbying Congress, deploying an army of three lobbyists for each member. It also contributed more than $160 million during the most recent election cycle to federal candidates, with 80 percent of that going to Republicans, according to a tally by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group. And the industry now wanted congressional leaders like Mr. McConnell, who is from one of the country’s top   states, to nullify the Obama administration’s new rules. “This has been a   press to block these rules, from a legal standpoint, a policy standpoint and a political standpoint,” said Bret Sumner, an oil and gas industry lawyer, who serves on the board of the Western Energy Alliance, a trade group that has aggressively lobbied Congress to block Obama administration regulations governing drilling on federal lands. Mr. Sumner’s group, along with the American Petroleum Institute and other major industry trade associations and individual companies and the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, all pressed congressional leaders to immediately repeal the methane rule, which the Interior Department finalized in November. The measure, according to the department, would force companies to prevent the release of gas via flaring or leaks, eliminating an estimated 180, 000 tons a year of methane gas, a contributing factor in climate change, while also increasing federal revenue by as much as $10 million a year, as the energy companies pay royalties only on fuel they contain and then sell. For its part, the coal industry pushed Congress to reverse the Stream Buffer Rule, also drafted by the Interior Department, that prevented mining companies from cutting off mountaintops in search of coal and other commodities, then dumping the remaining debris into nearby valleys. The department predicted the rule would protect 6, 000 miles of streams and an estimated 52, 000 acres of forests over the coming two decades. “It did not take a big pitch,” said Hal Quinn, president of the National Mining Association, of his group’s lobbying effort targeting congressional leaders to get its measure on the repeal list. “We clearly reinforced the fact this is ripe and due for Congress to reassert its power. ” A third rule targeted for quick repeal was one adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that required oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments for development rights  —   a provision intended to prevent corruption in places like Africa and Latin America. Billions of dollars from such payments have disappeared over the past several decades, at times siphoned by government officials for their personal use, instead of being used to improve the standard of living in these often impoverished nations. Exxon Mobil, whose former chief executive, Rex Tillerson, just became secretary of state, was one of the provision’s primary opponents. He argued that the rule would force the company to disclose “commercially sensitive information” and make it harder to compete against certain foreign oil companies that do not need to comply. By Friday, both the House and Senate had approved the first two of these repeals  —   on the stream rule and the foreign government payments  —   and final action by the Senate approving the repeal of the methane gas rule is expected soon. Mr. Trump has already put out a memo welcoming the rule reversals by Congress. “The administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations imposed on America’s businesses,” said a statement issued by the White House on Wednesday. The push to repeal these rules has created moments of obvious frustration for Democrats on the floor of the House and Senate chambers. As the blitz began this past week, Democratic lawmakers used various props  —   like   photographs of fish harmed by mining industry practices  —   to try to make their points. Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, arrived on the chamber floor with a mock “Wheel of Fortune” board, with slivers marked “coal,” “mining” and “even more oil” indicating the available prizes that Congress was offering. “Let’s consult our wheel to see who is the big winner of the G. O. P. giveaway this week,” Mr. Markey said, essentially conceding that Senate Democrats were all but certain to lose many of these fights. But for Freedom Partners  —   the secretive club of hugely wealthy political donors led and organized by the Koch brothers  —   it was a week to celebrate, as there had been a great deal of progress on their “Roadmap to Repeal” list. James Davis, an executive vice president at the group, sent a message late on Friday declaring “these repeal bills will soon be on their way to President Trump for his signature. ”"
"At the gala dinner in March this year to celebrate the centenary of the Nationals, federal president Larry Anthony boasted that the party played a key role in twice removing Malcolm Turnbull because of his climate change policy. The Coalition had won the 2019 election against the odds, but not the seat of Richmond on the north coast of New South Wales, which had voted three generations of the Anthony family into parliament, including Larry. The demography of this once predominantly agricultural area has shifted, with sea-changers and alternatives moving into the coastal towns, and the seat has been held by Labor since 2004 with substantial support from the Greens. To survive, the Nationals needed new supporters and they were finding them in the coalminers of central Queensland. Whatever the contribution Bill Shorten’s unpopularity, franking credits or negative gearing may have made to the Coalition winning in 2019, the brutal truth is that Labor lost the election in Queensland and it lost it in large part because of the Queensland Liberal National party’s successful weaponising of coal.  When he was forced to stand aside in mid-2017 because of doubts about his mother’s citizenship, Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan posted an extraordinary statement on Facebook: “It has been such an honour to represent the Australian mining sector over the past year. It is an industry full of fine, hard-working and innovative people. Mining and resources are a uniquely Australian success story. From the small, gambling explorers and prospectors to the large, world-beating multinationals, the industry provides rich and diverse experiences that can take you to the smallest towns of outback Australia to the biggest cities in the world.” Nowhere did he mention the farmers his party was formed to serve, nor that many farmers are challenging mining’s social licence, fighting tooth and nail to protect their agricultural land from mining. The National party’s leadership has close links to the resources industry. Past leaders Mark Vaile and John Anderson made fortunes out of resources after leaving politics; Matt Canavan’s brother John is an enthusiastic investor in Queensland coal assets; Larry Anthony has lobbied for the Chinese mining giant Shenhua’s Watermark coalmine on the edge of the Liverpool Plains in NSWs, which is opposed by the local farming communities. In March 2019, on Channel Ten’s The Project, Waleed Aly asked Nationals leader Michael McCormack: “Could you name a single, big policy area where the Nats have sided with the interests of farmers over the interests of miners when they come into conflict?” Off the top of his head, McCormack could not name one. The National party has become the party of coal. Turnbull tells in his memoir A Bigger Picture of a meeting that included the Nationals’ George Christensen, Keith Pitt, Barnaby Joyce and Andrew Gee, who were arguing that a new coal-fired power station would deliver cheaper power. “OK, I asked, what coal price are you assuming? They didn’t know. How much coal will the new coal plant use for each megawatt hour? Again they didn’t know. How much do you think the new plant will cost? No idea. I was patient and polite as I explained the economics of a new coal-fired power station and how it was no longer competitive with renewables plus storage to deliver dispatchable power. They weren’t convinced.”  No doubt they were infuriated by Turnbull’s somewhat condescending interrogation, but, as Bridget McKenzie told him on the way out, “You can’t reason with them, PM. It’s religion. They don’t care about the numbers.” But they do care about electoral numbers. The National party’s political power depends on the geographical concentration of its vote. At the 2019 election, it won a little less than 7% of first-preference votes, if we attribute to it a quarter of the vote of the Queensland Liberal National party (LNP), which was formed in 2008 from a merger of the Queensland branches of the two parties. With this vote, the Nationals won 15 seats. By contrast, the Greens’ nation-wide first-preference vote of more than 10% is diffused across electorates, and they have only one lonely representative in the House of Representatives. As another geographically concentrated activity, mining offers the Nationals a tantalising way to supplement their declining agricultural electoral base. In the weeks before the 2019 election, Bob Brown led a convoy to #StopAdani through central Queensland that was met with jeering hostility, enabling the LNP to mobilise regional loyalties. Shorten equivocated on whether or not Labor would review the coalmine’s environmental approval if it won government, sowing distrust among both supporters and opponents of the mine. Making Adani a key electoral issue was the last thing Labor needed as it tried to reconcile environmentally concerned city voters with regional voters who believed their economic futures depended on coalmining. It couldn’t be done, so the best thing for Labor was to keep voters’ minds focused on issues like health and education. Instead, Shorten kept being asked where he stood on Adani and was never able to give a clear answer. Clive Palmer, who has substantial coal interests in the Galilee Basin, spent $60m on advertising his United Australia party. Although the party won no seats, Palmer was well satisfied with the result. His Shifty Shorten ads, he said, had succeeded in preventing a Labor victory. In all states and territories except for Queensland and Western Australia, Labor plus left independents won the majority of seats. In Western Australia, Labor won only five to the Coalition’s 11, the same as in 2016, but in Queensland it lost two seats, leaving it with only six of the state’s 30 seats. As well, sitting LNP members enjoyed massive swings. “I never expected numbers like these,” Michelle Landry told the ABC on election night. “Thank you, Bob Brown, is all I can say. He came up here trying to tell Queenslanders what we should and shouldn’t be doing, and it actually drew together the agricultural and mining sectors.” Landry is the member for Capricornia, which stretches along the coast from Rockhampton in the south to the southern suburbs of Mackay. In the north and west it includes major mining centres such as the coalmining town of Collinsville, where the LNP wants a new coal-fired power station built. For most of its history, Capricornia has been Labor. Landry won the seat in 2016 with a margin of just 0.6%. In 2019, the margin was 12.4%. The miners had deserted Labor, and not just in Queensland, but also in the NSW coalmining electorate of Hunter, where the primary vote of the sitting Labor member, Joel Fitzgibbon, dropped by almost 15%. In Queensland, said Canavan, there had been “a hi-vis workers’ revolution”, with the extreme demands of climate change activists “pushing what have otherwise been strong Labor-voting areas towards the conservative side of politics”. When the Country party was established to represent farmers and people living in country towns, it was informed by what the political scientist Don Aitkin called “country-mindedness,” the belief that country folk were more independent, hard-working and morally authentic than people living easy, pleasure-seeking lives in the cities. The self-indulgent Greens-voting inner city versus the hard-working regions is the most recent iteration of the opposition between city and country that has shaped Australian politics for at least 100 years.  Here is Canavan in February this year, a few days after he resigned from cabinet to support Joyce’s leadership challenge to McCormack: “Our wealth-producing industries, like farming, mining and manufacturing, have never been under greater attack. Farmers have had their land rights stripped off them, dams are stopped because of some snail or frog and mines get sabotaged by rich, city-based whingers who threaten and bully law-abiding businesses.” Get it? Australia’s wealth is produced outside the cities and the cities are full of whingeing green bullies. This rhetoric is designed to pull regional voters back to the Nationals. Canavan is fairly restrained. Fellow Queensland National George Christensen is the party specialist in anti-green invective. In 2014, he described environmentalists opposed to the expansion of Adani’s port at Abbot Point as “gutless green grubs”; in 2018, he posted a photo on Facebook of himself aiming a handgun with the caption, “You gotta ask yourself, do you feel lucky greenie punks.” Christensen draws on the anti-green invective in circulation since the battles in Tasmania over the forests. As well as maintaining their political relevance, the Nationals’ specialisation in coal advocacy helps the Liberals, who can’t afford to be as openly hostile to environmentally concerned voters as the Nationals are. Like Labor, they are threatened by Greens and independents in city electorates. Independent Zali Steggall stood against Tony Abbott in Warringah on a platform of climate action and won. The Queensland Nationals successfully weaponised coal in the 2019 election. Even though this was as much a strategy for the party’s political survival as it was a matter of conviction, it is further evidence of the fossil-fuel lobby’s success. Without Abbott, the Liberal party could not be relied on, but with the junior partner turning itself into the party of coal, fossil fuels could be sure of a seat at the cabinet table of a Coalition government. This is an edited extract from Judith Brett’s Quarterly Essay 78, The Coal Curse: Resources, Climate and Australia’s Future, published this week"
"Kevin Anderson, one of the world’s leading climate scientists, had a familiar reaction to the latest report from the government’s climate advisers, which was published this week. The 196-page document by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) delivered a stinging rebuke of the government’s record and said ministers must urgently up their game if the UK is to avoid a significant rebound in carbon emissions after the coronavirus crisis and meet its 2050 net zero carbon target.  Anderson is a professor of energy and climate change, working across the universities of Manchester, Uppsala in Sweden and Bergen in Norway. He said: “The constructive, meticulous criticism of the government, which is failing abysmally by any measure, is fine. The problem is the framing the CCC has for net zero is already far removed from what is needed to meet our Paris commitments.” Anderson’s latest research argues the UK’s planned reductions in emissions, even if it hits net zero by 2050, would be two or three times greater than its fair share of emissions under the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, where countries agreed to hold global increases in temperature to “well below 2C  and to pursue 1.5C”. “Academics have done an excellent job in understanding and communicating climate science, but the same cannot be said in relation to reducing emissions,” said Anderson. “Here we have collectively denied the necessary scale of mitigation, running scared of calling for fundamental changes to both our energy system and the lifestyles of high-energy users. Our paper brings this failure into sharp focus.” Shortly after the study was published, Anderson posted a warning on Twitter about what he described as a cosy consensus between senior academics, journalists and government scientists, who were unwilling to publicly acknowledge the urgent system-level transformation required to tackle the climate crisis. He said: “Many senior academics, senior policymakers, basically the great and good of the climate world have decided that it is unhelpful to rock the status quo boat and therefore choose to work within that political paradigm – they’ll push it as hard as they think it can go, but they repeatedly step back from questioning the paradigm itself.” Anderson, who travels between his three universities by “long, slow train” and last took an airline flight in 2004, says that such “mitigation denial” stems from the “fundamental failure” of the academic community to be honest about the implications of its research. This had potentially devastating consequences for the future, he said. “Our job as academics is to be disinterested in whether policymakers like or dislike our conclusions. We should only be concerned [with] whether they agree or disagree with our findings – and why,” he said. “On mitigation, the academic community and the CCC have collectively failed the political realm and civil society by tailoring our conclusions to fit with what we judge to be politically palatable – all at the expense of scientific integrity.” Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC, defended the logic behind its 2050 target, which he said was based on “detailed considerations of the climate science, based on the IPCC’s work, the international context, including the Paris agreement and ‘equity’ considerations, and the feasible speed and cost at which UK emissions can be reduced”. Stark added: “Our recommendations reflect a consideration of all of these issues and are designed to best support the required increase in global effort. It continues to be the CCC’s view that this is the right target for the UK, but we welcome new evidence and we will review new studies as we develop our advice on the sixth carbon budget for the end of this year.” However, Anderson said too many models for tackling climate change relied on “unproven technologies far in the future”, such as carbon capture and storage. “Perhaps we’ll be lucky and they will work at huge planetary scale – but it’s one hell of a gamble.” He said the models also ignored the fact that it was the lifestyles of a relatively wealthy few that gave rise to the lion’s share of emissions. “Globally the wealthiest 10% are responsible for half of all emissions, the wealthiest 20% for 70% of emissions. If regulations forced the top 10% to cut their emissions to the level of the average EU citizen, and the other 90% made no change in their lifestyles, that would still cut total emissions by a third. “If we were serious about this crisis we could do this in a year – if we were really serious we could do it in a month, but we are not and our emissions just keep rising.” In his latest report, published in the journal Climate Policy last month, Anderson and his colleagues argued that after “30 years of failure” to control growing emissions, a fundamental reframing was required. But he insisted that this did not mean a complete upheaval in how most people lived their lives, even in the UK. “Yes, some changes will be needed, but for the majority of people the solutions to this crisis will also improve their lives: long-term job prospects for them and their children, better house quality, better access and more affordable public transport.” However, for wealthy high emitters it would mean fundamental change. “The very wealthy amongst us, senior academics and professors included, will have to make profound changes to our high-emitting lifestyles. We recycle and often live in relatively efficient homes, but they’re typically big homes and sometimes we have two or more of them. “Many of us are frequent flyers, we drive long distances in big cars, buy a lot equipment, have fridge-freezers the size of a small terrace house – every facet of our lives, although normalised by us, is central to our nation’s high emissions. But the models are unwilling to accept this – preferring to pass the buck on to our children in the form of future technical silver bullets.” Anderson said that the UK’s use of energy should be zero-carbon by 2035 rather than net zero by 2050 – a move that would “require a fundamental re-evaluation of economic assumptions around growth value and progress”. He said the scale and timeframe of transformation required would be bigger than that of Roosevelt’s New Deal or the Marshall plan to reconstruct Europe after the second world war. “Many say that such rapid and deep change is unrealistic – but it’s much more realistic than believing a fair and progressive society can survive with 3, 4 or even 5C of warming,” he said. • This article was amended on 26 June 2020 to clarify a sentence referring to research arguing that planned reductions in emissions would still be two or three times “greater than [the UK’s] fair share” under the Paris agreement. That is now spelled out as an overshoot on emissions (as distinct from an excess of reductions). An incorrect Fahrenheit conversion was also eliminated."
"The idea of using satellites to monitor wildlife and biological diversity probably conjures up images of radio-collared deer or tagged turtles. And while these have been key to increasing our understanding of animal distribution worldwide, we can track a lot more from space than you’d imagine – and it’s not necessary to capture and fit a tracking device first. For example, hyperspectral sensors – which capture information across the electromagnetic spectrum in very narrow bands able to detect recognisable “fingerprints” of objects – have been used to determine genetic differences in Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen), one of the most widespread and genetically diverse species in North America. Satellite information on climatic conditions and on vegetation type and dynamics can help predict animal movement and condition. These are just two examples taken from a special edition I co-edited on satellites and conservation in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B journal. Who is interested in satellite remote sensing? Basically anyone who seeks to understand large scale patterns in biodiversity distribution, or that has to deal with the management of big, remote, or inaccessible areas. The level of information that can be derived from satellite data is pretty phenomenal, and too-often undervalued by ecologists and conservationists. For example, emperor penguin colonies can be found and the colony size estimated using very high resolution images. Changes to the extent or density of ecosystems can be tracked, and active sensors such as radar and lidar can report the 3D structure and density of vegetation. Just how “green” our world is can be extensively mapped on a fortnightly basis. So satellites help monitor both wildlife and vegetation in the natural world, able to provide information about the most remote and inaccessible places on Earth. They also capture information that helps us understand why, and predict where, biodiversity is declining. For example, measurements taken on the ground can be integrated with satellite data to track the current distributions of certain invasive species, and to predict their projected advance. High resolution images can be used to map problems associated with oil exploration and exploitation. The response of animals to shifts in temperatures or availability in food and resources can be analysed and predicted from satellite-based information. And deforestation, land degradation and the fragmentation of ecosystems as well as the expansion of urban areas have all been successfully monitored using satellites’ unique viewpoint. Satellites’ benefits extend beyond land to the oceans too, as there are some great examples of how satellites can support marine conservation. Spotting and monitoring oil spills is a classic example, using radar or infrared sensors. And using satellite data together with that from vessels’ monitoring systems make it easier to detect illegal, undeclared or unreported fishing. Remote sensing is becoming central to our ability to understand and manage the natural world. From camera traps and microphone arrays, to guided drones and Doppler radar, ecologists, conservationists and environmental or wildlife managers have been drawn towards new technological developments that provide the possibility of non-invasive monitoring.  Satellite sensors are part of this incredibly powerful toolkit, and their scope to inform research and support resource management is continuously growing. For example, satellite data is now used to inform protected area management or species reintroduction programs. Perhaps obviously, the best uses for this technology and major breakthroughs are most likely to occur when remote sensing and conservation experts collaborate; yet this happens all too rarely. Conservationists and wildlife managers need better links to technical expertise and access to equipment, and working together would be greatly enhanced by common information-sharing platforms and the development of a more coordinated research agenda. Google Earth is one thing, but making government-funded satellite data and the software tools to use it freely accessible would be a key step to increase the number of new purposes the research community can put it to."

Sorry this is so late.  The NCDC and GISS updates were delayed by the government shutdown.  Because it is so late, it includes the September 2013 HADCRUT4 data from the UKMO.  It’s so late I’ve already published the Preliminary October 2013 sea surface temperature update here.
Initial Notes:  This post contains graphs of running trends in global surface temperature anomalies for periods of 12+ and 16 years using UKMO global historical surface temperature anomalies (HADCRUT4) data.  They indicate that we have not seen a warming hiatus this long since the 1970s for the 12-year trends, or about 1980 for the 16-year trends.
Much of the following text is boilerplate. It is intended for those new to the presentation of global surface temperature anomaly data.
GISS LAND OCEAN TEMPERATURE INDEX (LOTI)
Introduction: The GISS Land Ocean Temperature Index (LOTI) data is a product of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies.  Starting with their January 2013 update, it uses NCDC ERSST.v3b sea surface temperature data.  The impact of the recent change in sea surface temperature datasets is discussed here.  GISS adjusts GHCN and other land surface temperature data via a number of methods and infills missing data using 1200km smoothing. Refer to the GISS description here.   Unlike the UK Met Office and NCDC products, GISS masks sea surface temperature data at the poles where seasonal sea ice exists, and they extend land surface temperature data out over the oceans in those locations.  Refer to the discussions here and here. GISS uses the base years of 1961-1980 as the reference period for anomalies.  The data source is here.
Update:  The September 2013 GISS global temperature anomaly is +0.74 deg C.  It warmed (an increase of about 0.13 deg C) since August 2013.

GISS LOTI

NCDC GLOBAL SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES
Introduction: The NOAA Global (Land and Ocean) Surface Temperature Anomaly dataset is a product of the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).  NCDC merges their Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature version 3b (ERSST.v3b) with the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M) version 3.2.0 for land surface air temperatures. NOAA infills missing data for both land and sea surface temperature datasets using methods presented in Smith et al (2008). Keep in mind, when reading Smith et al (2008), that the NCDC removed the satellite-based sea surface temperature data because it changed the annual global temperature rankings.  Since most of Smith et al (2008) was about the satellite-based data and the benefits of incorporating it into the reconstruction, one might consider that the NCDC temperature product is no longer supported by a peer-reviewed paper.
The NCDC data source is usually here.  NCDC uses 1901 to 2000 for the base years for anomalies.
Update:  The September 2013 NCDC global land plus sea surface temperature anomaly is +0.64 deg C.  It increased 0.03 deg C since August 2013.

NCDC Global (Land and Ocean) Surface Temperature Anomalies
UK MET OFFICE HADCRUT4 
Introduction: The UK Met Office HADCRUT4 dataset merges CRUTEM4 land-surface air temperature dataset and the HadSST3 sea-surface temperature (SST) dataset.  CRUTEM4 is the product of the combined efforts of the Met Office Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. And HadSST3 is a product of the Hadley Centre.  Unlike the GISS and NCDC products, missing data is not infilled in the HADCRUT4 product.  That is, if a 5-deg latitude by 5-deg longitude grid does not have a temperature anomaly value in a given month, it is not included in the global average value of HADCRUT4. The HADCRUT4 dataset is described in the Morice et al (2012) paper here.  The CRUTEM4 data is described in Jones et al (2012) here. And the HadSST3 data is presented in the 2-part Kennedy et al (2012) paper here and here.  The UKMO uses the base years of 1961-1990 for anomalies.  The data source is here.
Update:  The September 2013 HADCRUT4 global temperature anomaly is +0.53 deg C.  It increased (about 0.01 deg C) since August 2013.

HADCRUT4
153-MONTH RUNNING TRENDS 
As noted in my post Open Letter to the Royal Meteorological Society Regarding Dr. Trenberth’s Article “Has Global Warming Stalled?”, Kevin Trenberth of NCAR presented 10-year period-averaged temperatures in his article for the Royal Meteorological Society. He was attempting to show that the recent hiatus in global warming since 2001 was not unusual.  Kevin Trenberth conveniently overlooked the fact that, based on his selected start year of 2001, the hiatus has lasted 12+ years, not 10.
The period from January 2001 to September 2013 is now 153-months long. Refer to the following graph of running 153-month trends from January 1880 to September 2013, using the HADCRUT4 global temperature anomaly product. The last data point in the graph is the linear trend (in deg C per decade) from January 2001 to the current month. It is basically zero. That, of course, indicates global surface temperatures have not warmed during the most recent 153-month period. Working back in time, the data point immediately before the last one represents the linear trend for the 153-month period of December 2000 to August 2013, and the data point before it shows the trend in deg C per decade for November 2000 to July 2013, and so on.

153-Month Linear Trends
The highest recent rate of warming based on its linear trend occurred during the 153-month period that ended in late 2003, but warming trends have dropped drastically since then. Also note that about the early 1970s was the last time there had been a 153-month period without global warming—before recently.
196-MONTH RUNNING TRENDS
In his RMS article, Kevin Trenberth also conveniently overlooked the fact that the discussions about the warming hiatus are now for a time period of about 16 years, not 10 years—ever since David Rose’s DailyMail article titled “Global warming stopped 16 years ago, reveals Met Office report quietly released… and here is the chart to prove it”.  In my response to Trenberth’s article, I updated David Rose’s graph, noting that surface temperatures in April 2013 were basically the same as they were in June 1997.  We’ll use June 1997 as the start month for the running 16-year trends.  The period is now 196-months long. The following graph is similar to the one above, except that it’s presenting running trends for 196-month periods.

196-Month Linear Trends
The last time global surface temperatures warmed at the minimal rate of 0.03 deg C per decade for a 196-month period was about 1980.
The most widely used metric of global warming—global surface temperatures—indicates that the rate of global warming has slowed drastically and that the duration of the hiatus in global warming is unusual during a period when global surface temperatures are allegedly being warmed from the hypothetical impacts of manmade greenhouse gases. 
A NOTE ABOUT THE RUNNING-TREND GRAPHS
There is very little difference in the end point trends of 12+year and 16+year running trends if GISS or NCDC products are used in place of HADCRUT4 data. The major difference in the graphs is with the HADCRUT4 data and it can be seen in a graph of the 12+year trends.  I suspect this is caused by the updates to the HADSST3 data that have not been applied to the ERSST.v3b sea surface temperature data used by GISS and NCDC.
COMPARISON 
The GISS, HADCRUT4 and NCDC global surface temperature anomalies are compared in the next three time-series graphs. The first graph compares the three global surface temperature anomaly products starting in 1979. The graph also includes the linear trends.  Because the three datasets share common source data, (GISS and NCDC also use the same sea surface temperature data) it should come as no surprise that they are so similar.    For those wanting a closer look at the more recent wiggles and trends, the second graph starts in 1998, which was the start year used by von Storch et al (2013) Can climate models explain the recent stagnation in global warming?  They, of course, found that the CMIP3 (IPCC AR4) and CMIP5 (IPCC AR5) models could NOT explain the recent hiatus.
The third comparison graph starts with Kevin Trenberth’s chosen year of 2001. All three of those comparison graphs present the anomalies using the base years of 1981 to 2010.  Referring to their discussion under FAQ 9 here, according to NOAA:
This period is used in order to comply with a recommended World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Policy, which suggests using the latest decade for the 30-year average.
You’ll note that the GISS LOTI data has larger monthly variations than the other two datasets.  This is likely caused, in part, by GISS masking sea surface temperature data in the polar oceans and replacing it with land surface air temperature data, which is naturally more volatile.  Again, please refer to the discussions here and here.

AVERAGE
The last graph presents the average of the GISS, HADCRUT and NCDC land plus sea surface temperature anomaly products.  The flatness of the data since 2001 is very obvious, as is the fact that surface temperatures have rarely risen above those created by the 1997/98 El Niño.

"**Officials in Puerto Rico now say 2,975 people died following Hurricane Maria - a devastating storm that struck the US island territory in September 2017.**
The revised death toll is nearly 50 times the previous estimate of 64.
Governor Ricardo Rossello ""accepted"" the findings in a long-awaited independent investigation.
The mayor of the capital, San Juan, accused the US government of deliberately downplaying the impact of the storm.
Puerto Rico has struggled to repair its infrastructure and power grid since the storm, and is asking US Congress for $139bn (Â£108bn) in recovery funds.
""I'm giving an order to update the official number of deaths to 2,975,"" Governor Ricardo Rossello told reporters on Tuesday. ""Although this is an estimate, it has a scientific basis.""
In a statement, the White House said the federal government supported the governor's efforts to ""ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities"" in the hurricane.
President Donald Trump was criticised for praising the federal response to the hurricane-ravaged island in the weeks following the storm. Critics accused him of showing more concern for residents in Texas and Florida after they were hit by hurricanes.
The authorities have faced criticism for underreporting the toll of Maria - the most powerful storm to hit the region in nearly 90 years.
Until now, the official figure was 64 - even though the island had previously acknowledged the death toll was probably much higher. In the wake of the disaster, some experts estimated as many as 4,600 deaths.
The latest findings - accepted by the island's authorities - were made in a report by experts from George Washington University, which the governor commissioned.
The government's initial number was for those killed directly by the hurricane, crushed by collapsing buildings, drowned or hit by flying debris.
But the new report also counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis.
""This shows the magnitude of the catastrophe,"" Governor Rossello told El Nuevo Dia newspaper.
When asked why his government was unable to recognise a higher death toll until now, he replied: ""I am not perfect. I make mistakes. Now, hindsight tends to be 20-20.""
He echoed one finding in the report - that doctors ""lacked awareness"" on how to appropriately certify deaths attributed to natural disasters.
""The responsibility for adjudicating the cause of deaths rested with the doctors,"" Mr Rossello said. ""But unfortunately there was no formal process to prepare them for this kind of devastation.
""At that moment, that was the number [of deceased] that we had and today we have the evidence which indicates the number was definitely higher.""
San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told the BBC that there had been ""neglect"" by the Trump administration and some local officials hadn't wanted to confront the president about the need for more aid.
""It seemed like it was better to dance to President Trump's tune than to tell the truth that we were all seeing."" she said.
""I did was I thought ought to be done as I screamed, literally, out of the top of my lungs to say 'We're dying here' and the bureaucracy and the inefficiency of the federal government was killing us.""
**Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent**
For close to a year, Puerto Rico's government has clung to the idea that 64 people died as a result of Maria.
That figure was always risible - particularly when you consider that the 150 mph (241 km/h) winds caused around $90bn worth of damage and left households for, on average, 84 days without electricity; 64 days without water and 41 days without cellular telephone coverage.
In truth, the new official number is still an estimate - based on mortality data and taking into account historical data on migration patterns.
But the official recognition will allow the island to move on and focus fully on rebuilding its infrastructure and extracting the tens of billions of dollars needed from Congress to give the three million inhabitants of this already bankrupt territory something of a future.
Researchers tracked the number of deaths using death certificates and other mortality data between mid-September 2017 to mid-February of this year.
The Caribbean island is home to 3.3 million people, some 8% of which have since left the island, the study said.
It also said that those from poorer backgrounds in Puerto Rico were 45% more likely to have been killed in the aftermath of the hurricane.
The governor said he would sign an executive order to create a committee to examine and put into practice the report's recommendations.
Puerto Rico has been reeling ever since the storm struck - with residents still suffering blackouts, broken infrastructure and a lack of services.
Hurricane Maria caused the largest blackout in US history, according to research consultancy the Rhodium Group.
It is ranked as the third most financially costly cyclone in US history since 1900, yet its death toll is a third higher than the costliest - Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with an estimated 1,833.
The new study raises questions about President Trump's response to the disaster.
During a visit in October, Mr Trump had suggested officials should be ""proud"" the death toll - at the time only 16 - was not as high as ""a real catastrophe"" like Katrina."

 ** _Policymakers should_**



Over the past 10 years, there has been much discussion in academic and policy circles concerning “mass incarceration” in the United States. Many have observed that there is something incongruous about America, the land of the free, finding itself with one of the highest incarceration rates in the world. The United States has about 2 million inmates and another 7 million persons under the “supervision” of the criminal justice system. Something is amiss, but the root of the problem is not sentencing policy; rather, it is the burgeoning criminal codes at the “front end” of the criminal system. Policymakers at all levels of government have criminalized so many activities that it should come as no surprise that our courthouses are clogged with cases and our prisons are overflowing with inmates. Politicians have recklessly sought short‐​term political advantage by taking “credit” for new laws while ignoring the long‐​term consequences of their policy decisions. It is no overstatement to say that the politics of criminalization threaten the very foundation of our free society.



Every year American lawmakers add new crimes to the law books. Under the Constitution, crime fighting is supposed to be reserved to state and local government. But over the past 40 years, Congress has federalized many of the crimes that have always been investigated by local police. Politicians have also found ways to recriminalize criminal conduct. “Hate crimes,” for example, duplicate crimes such as murder and assault and add stiffer penalties when prosecutors can prove that bigotry was a motivating factor behind the violence.



The criminal law has also followed the rise of the regulatory state. In addition to the thousands of criminal laws, there are now tens of thousands of regulations that carry criminal penalties, including prison time. The web of rules has become so vast that it seems as if most Americans are now criminals whether they realize it or not.



The overcriminalization phenomenon extends beyond the realm of violence, fraud, vice, and commercial regulations. Consider these cases:  
• A river guide saw a teenager in distress and so left his boat and swam to save her. He was charged with “obstructing government operations” for not waiting for the search and rescue team.  
• Federal prosecutors indicted computer prodigy Aaron Swartz for improperly downloading articles from the digital library JSTOR. The Justice Department maintains that when a website owner’s terms‐​of‐​service policy is violated, a crime is also committed — even though owners retain the right to change the terms at any time and without prior notice. Frightened by the prospect of bankruptcy, a long prison sentence, or both, Swartz took his own life.  
• Retired race car driver Bobby Unser was prosecuted by federal authorities for driving his snowmobile on protected federal land. Unser and his friend got lost during a snowstorm and were desperately seeking shelter or assistance.  
• Nevada rancher Dudley Hiibel was jailed for declining to give his name to a policeman.  
• Members of a Christian outreach group were arrested and prosecuted for feeding the homeless in a Ft. Lauderdale park. Local rules restricted food sharing.



There was a telling moment before the Supreme Court in 2009 when a government lawyer was explaining the scope of the federal “honest services” law. The lawyer from the Department of Justice said that law criminalized any ethical lapse in the workplace. In response, Justice Stephen Breyer exclaimed, “There are 150 million workers in the United States. I think possibly 140 million of them flunk your test.” The government lawyer did not deny Justice Breyer’s observation. As unbelievable as it may sound, the federal government considers more than a hundred million Americans to be criminals. And that is only under its interpretation of a single federal statute. As noted, there are thousands and thousands more. The overcriminalization phenomenon is thus quite real.



There are several reasons to be alarmed by the exponential growth of criminal rules and regulations. First and foremost, America has always prided itself on its freedom; but a society in which the criminal rules are so pervasive that no one is safe from arrest and prosecution cannot be described as free. The traditional common law crimes — murder, rape, theft, assault — do not restrict the freedom of the citizenry to live their own lives peaceably. However, as soon as the government goes beyond the basic crimes to prohibit other human activities, the adverse impact on liberty becomes evident. As the criminal law expands, there is a concomitant diminution of liberty.



Second, when criminal code violations become virtually unavoidable, the safeguards in the Bill of Rights become ineffectual. As the Harvard legal scholar Henry Hart observed, “What sense does it make to insist upon procedural safeguards in criminal prosecutions if anything whatever can be made a crime in the first place?” Hart’s point was that if some rule can be shown to have been violated, a speedy trial cannot help the person facing a prison sentence. And an able defense attorney can only help his client by making a plea for leniency.



Third, law enforcement resources are limited. The police and courts are busy enough with violent crimes, theft, and extortion. Those cases will be neglected if the police are burdened with additional responsibilities. Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor, reminds us that there is no getting around the tradeoff: time and money “spent investigating conduct that is not inherently criminal are time and money lost to the thwarting of much more serious crime.”



Fourth, policymakers should always pause to remember that every rule brings about the possibility that the police will have to employ violence to enforce that rule. Eric Garner was killed by New York City police as they were trying to enforce a rule against selling individual cigarettes (“loosies”) on the street. Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter has noted that if policymakers want to seriously reduce the opportunities for dangerous interactions between police and civilians, they should stop talking about “better police training” and scale back the criminal codes.



Fifth, another inevitable consequence of overcriminalization has been more governmental errors. Innocent people are sometimes arrested, prosecuted, and imprisoned. Wrongful convictions are not only unjust to the prisoner, but to his or her family — children, spouse, parents, and siblings. One effective way to limit those miscarriages of justice is to keep the criminal system as small as possible. If America has two million people imprisoned and the government has done its job properly in 95 percent of the cases, that means 100,000 people are unjustly imprisoned. By scaling back the criminal codes, so that the total number of people prosecuted and imprisoned is reduced, policymakers could also reduce the number of innocent persons mistakenly imprisoned.



Of course, overcriminalization can be addressed in many ways. The following are three possible routes to correcting the system.



 _Override the Old Maxim That “Ignorance of the Law Is No Excuse”_



It is absurd and unjust for the government to impose a legal duty on every citizen to “know” all of the mind‐​boggling rules and regulations that have been promulgated over the years. The old maxim that “ignorance of the law is no excuse” only makes sense when the criminal law covers conduct that is plainly and inherently wrongful, such as murder and theft.



To illustrate the rank injustice that can occur, take the case of Carlton Wilson, who was prosecuted because he possessed a firearm. Wilson’s purchase of the firearm was perfectly legal. Years later, a judge issued a restraining order against Wilson during his divorce proceedings. He didn’t know that meant he had to give up the firearm. When Wilson protested that the judge never informed him of that obligation and that the restraining order itself said nothing about firearms, prosecutors shrugged, “ignorance of the law is no excuse.” Although the courts upheld Wilson’s conviction, Judge Richard Posner filed a dissent: “We want people to familiarize themselves with the laws bearing on their activities. But a reasonable opportunity doesn’t mean being able to go to the local law library and read Title 18. It would be preposterous to suppose that someone from Wilson’s milieu is able to take advantage of such an opportunity.” Judge Posner noted that Wilson would serve more than three years in a federal penitentiary for an omission that he “could not have suspected was a crime or even a civil wrong.”



Policymakers should override the “ignorance‐​is‐​no‐​excuse” maxim by enacting a law that requires prosecutors to prove that regulatory violations are “willful” or, in the alternative, that permits defendants to plead a good‐​faith belief in the legality of one’s conduct. The former rule is already in place for our complicated tax laws. It should also shield unwary Americans from all laws and regulations as well.



 _Strengthen the Rule of Lenity_



Even if there were only a few crimes on the books, the terms of our criminal laws ought to be drafted with precision. After all, there is little difference between a secret law and a published regulation that cannot be understood. The American Revolutionaries believed in the Latin maxim _nullum crimen sine lege_ , which means there can be no crime without a law. In other words, people can be punished only for conduct previously prohibited by law. That principle is clearly enunciated in the ex post facto clause of the Constitution (Article I, Section 9). But the purpose of that clause can be subverted if the legislature can enact a criminal law with vague terms that can be interpreted broadly by prosecutors or judges. Such a law would not give citizens fair warning of the prohibited conduct.



One way to address the problem of vague laws that were previously enacted would be for legislators to direct the courts to follow the “rule of lenity.” That doctrine resolves legal uncertainties in favor of the accused, not the government. Unfortunately, the courts have not invoked that doctrine consistently.



 _Prohibit Administrative Agencies from Creating New Crimes_



Beyond the thousands of criminal statutes enacted by legislatures, there are also thousands of regulations that carry criminal penalties. It is the responsibility of elected officials to carefully consider what infractions can result in a criminal conviction and prison time.



The case law that has thus far allowed the delegation of lawmaking has drawn criticism. U.S. district judge Roger Vinson, for example, has observed:



A jurisprudence which allows Congress to impliedly delegate its criminal lawmaking authority to a regulatory agency such as the Army Corps — so long as Congress provides an “intelligible principle” to guide that agency — is enough to make any judge pause and question what has happened. Deferent and minimal judicial review of Congress’ transfer of its criminal lawmaking function to other bodies, in other branches, calls into question the vitality of the tripartite system established by our Constitution. It also calls into question the nexus that must exist between the law so applied and simple logic and common sense.



Making conduct criminal is a serious matter. It is a decision that ought to be made by the people’s elected representatives, whether in Congress, the state legislatures, or city councils.



Political observers have noted that criminal justice reform is one of the few policy areas that is now finding support from across the political spectrum. On the left, law professor Michelle Alexander, author of _The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness_ , tells her students that even though she has earned fancy degrees, she is a criminal. She challenges others to come clean as well. After all, just because a person has not been caught does not mean she is not a criminal in the eyes of the law. Alexander believes reform will happen when more people come to terms with their own “criminality.” On the right, U.S. circuit judge Alex Kozinski makes a similar point in his article, “You’re (Probably) a Federal Criminal.” Most Americans are criminals, but don’t know it, he writes.



There are some indications that the policy climate is becoming more receptive to fundamental reform. A recent cover story in _Harper’s_ was titled, “Legalize It All: How to Win the War on Drugs.” A few weeks later, a cover story in _The New York Times Magazine_ posed the question, “Should Prostitution Be a Crime?” While these questions are still being debated, it seems clear that more and more people are coming to recognize that vices are not crimes that warrant the intervention of police powers. Over the past few years, policymakers in Vermont, Maine, Colorado, and New Hampshire have voted to repeal criminal laws regarding adultery. These developments are welcome, but policymakers should move more aggressively toward criminal code reform and prune the law books of unnecessary and unjust criminal provisions. An expansive criminal code is inimical to a free society.

"**""Lockdown fatigue"" and the lure of Christmas tempted people back into shops on Wednesday as non-essential stores in England re-opened.**
Footfall across shops in England, many which have been closed for a month, rose by 85.2% compared with last Wednesday, said analyst Springboard.
The uplift is bigger than the rise in footfall seen after the first, longer lockdown ended in June.
But Springboard said shoppers were eager to get out and enjoy Christmas.
""People need and want to buy presents and they want to get out and experience Christmas,"" said Diane Wehrle, marketing & insights director at Springboard.
""Also we do have this lockdown fatigue. We've been confined to our houses and not been able to go out and I think we're getting more used to living with Covid.""
The day on which lockdown ended in June saw footfall increase by 37%, below the bounce back recorded after the most recent restrictions in England.
But Ms Wehrle said: ""In June, [Covid] was still very, very new. It really shocked people and they were absolutely terrified.
People understand it a little bit better now and know what their own personal parameters are.""
However, footfall is still far below that of 2019, down almost a quarter compared with the same day last year.
It comes as another retailer, BonmarchÃ©, collapsed, following Debenhams and Topshop owner Arcadia.
Shops across England reopened their doors on Wednesday, with the majority of regions under tier 2 Covid-19 restrictions. They limit social contact between households, but allow non-essential stores to reopen.
Primark reopened its stores early, at 07:00 on Wednesday. At the Trafford Centre in Manchester, it attracted about 100 shoppers at the start of trading.
Zoe Inman, centre director at the Trafford Centre in Manchester, she was not disappointed with the numbers: ""It is what we expected.""
But she said she was hopeful that the UK's approval of the Pfizer/BioBTech vaccine could help restore some normality.
The UK became the first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination.
Ms Inman hailed the vaccine as a ""holy grail"".
""We've been waiting for this news for so long,"" she said. ""I think once we get that vaccine, we can be more like life as normal, so we do welcome that.""
Some people braved the cold to queue from the early hours of Wednesday morning to beat an anticipated rush of shoppers.
Emily Harrison in Birmingham, who had come to buy baby clothes, said she'd been ""dreading it"", but added: ""I'm glad it's not busy because I hate when it's busy, so hopefully it'll stay quiet.""
Karen Marsh, a mental health nurse in Manchester, said she wanted to come to the shops for Christmas presents: ""So it's that bit extra special thought rather than ordering online.""
""I thought, 'I'm going to come out for a day, boost my mental health, do a bit of shopping, get everything I need, just to boost how I feel,'"" she said.
""Its so important,"" said Sam Watson, general manager of Selfridges in Birmingham. ""Whilst online trading has been brilliant, nothing beats that experience of having customers in the store shopping for their Christmas gifts.""
Debenhams saw queues outside some of its stores after announcing its collapse earlier this week, Online, long queues also formed for Debenhams' website and by mid-morning the site had crashed altogether.
Earlier this week, the department store chain said it would close its doors after failing to secure a buyer. It is likely its 12,000 staff will lose their jobs.
On Wednesday, BonmarchÃ© announced it will file for administration, putting 1,500 jobs at risk, following Arcadia which employs 13,000 people."

The turnout for local body elections continues to diminish election after election, and it seems we’re powerless to stop the downward spiral, which has been gathering momentum for more than thirty years.



Nowhere is it more important or significant than in the country’s largest city. The centre of New Zealand’s universe in population, industry, commerce and pretty much everything else. The city most affected on a daily basis by a long history of local body ineptitude, and lack of planning and anticipation of future infrastructure needs. A city buried deep in never-ending bureaucracy, rising rates, a fuel tax, wasteful and useless projects that will not resolve any of the issues – like the city train loop, the proposed light rail to the airport. A city where the council has taken the liberty of deciding its employees and contractors are to be paid “the living wage” at a time when they can’t even begin to balance their books. A city where local body politics appears to be driven by and held to ransom by Auckland Transport, a council controlled organization that seems to run its own agenda and often looks to be completely out of control and accountable to nobody. A city which has been appallingly let down by its council year after year after year.



Against that background of inaction, ineptitude and constant waste of ratepayers’ money, the council considered it more important to vote unanimously to declare a climate emergency: 



“By unanimously voting to declare a climate emergency we are signalling the council’s intention to put climate change at the front and centre of our decision making,” says Mayor Phil Goff 



(11 June, 2019).



 **Yet of 1,065,383 eligible voters, only 370,368 took the time and trouble to cast a vote. 695,015 chose not to participate. A voter turnout of 34.76%.**



It’s way too glib to say: “If you didn’t vote – you have no right to complain” or “you got what you deserve”.



I’m sure most of us get, at least in broad terms, what the mayor and councilors are supposed to do. But for the rest of it, in Auckland at least, voting has become an overwhelming and complex task with too many choices to make, for a whole raft of jobs most of us know little if anything about. I mean really, what exactly are we voting for these people on Licensing Trusts to do? What about Community Boards? And the District Health Board, what’s that all about? Huge lists of people who we don’t know from a bar of soap and we’re supposed to choose those we want without knowing what they’re supposed to do. No wonder people throw their hands in the air in despair and don’t bother.



The next three years will hurt many in Auckland. Its been an expensive place to live for many years but some of the actions taken in the last two years will start to bite about now and bite harder as the months go by. Council rates rises, the fuel levy, the relentless interference of the current government with landlords. Prices are already spiraling upwards. The impact is only just starting to be felt. Will it mean a bigger turnout at the next local body election? I somehow doubt it. People feel disenfranchised and disinterested. There’s no magic bullet or simple answer. It will largely depend on how many people are hurting and how much after the next three years.

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report tells us that CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions are continuing to rise and that, unchecked, climate change will likely have severe effects. This provides opportunity, as well as risk, for industry – but they need to act now to to reduce GHG emissions.   The recent summary report outlines the options for mitigating climate change. In a world where the global population is growing rapidly and quality of life depends on material goods, the task of mitigation is urgent. This will require action to reduce emissions across all sectors, including power generation, buildings, transport, agriculture and industry.   The industrial sector is a major contributor to climate change. According to the latest IPCC report, in 2010 approximately 31% of total emissions came from industrial sources. The International Energy Agency indicates that CO2 emissions from industry could increase by between 45-65% by 2050.  The problem with reducing emissions from the manufacturing sector is that there are very few common technologies and approaches. So where should we be focusing our attention? There are a number of items that should be at the top of our list. Businesses have the power to influence CO2 emissions up and down the supply chain in many ways. Distributors can pressure manufacturers to be less CO2-intensive, driving reductions in emissions from production. It also helps level the playing field for manufacturers as low-carbon becomes an additional criteria together with price and quality. Businesses can influence change in the transport sector through management of their vehicle fleets and shipping, as well as driving change in buildings through adoption of new and efficient practises. Businesses also have the power to increase demand for low carbon products, using advertising.  Businesses are waking up to this reality – at the recent Grantham Annual lecture, Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, said, “Left unchecked, climate change has the potential to become a significant barrier to our growth strategy, and that of just about every other company.”   “It is only by tackling climate change in a systemic way that we can deliver growth for the global economy in the 21st century,” he said. But to tackle climate climate change we need more CEOs to take action. Improving the efficiency of processes in manufacturing could greatly reduce carbon emissions across all business sectors. This could include process-specific  changes such as upgrading to more efficient kilns in the cement sector as well as technologies which can be applied across a wide range of processes such as improvements to steam and motor systems. There is no doubt that these technologies should be adopted wherever possible. But adoption of energy efficient technologies in practise is not straightforward. A range of economic and logistical factors can effect the decision to invest in energy efficiency improvements. Importantly, government needs business to talk openly and honestly about these challenges. In return, the UK government needs to make its support for retaining a manufacturing sector clear.  This is certainly an area where interest is gaining, as a recent review  on Decarbonisation of heat in industry indicates – but more work needs to be done.  The application of carbon capture and storage, or CCS, to the industrial sector should be actively and urgently pursued, perhaps even as a precursor to CCS in the power sector. For many energy-intensive industries, the task of reducing their emissions by 80% is virtually impossible. But CCS is one of the few technologies which could achieve this goal as, in many cases, it is easier and cheaper than in the power sector.  If we delay action on CCS for too long, with the carbon price expected to rise, energy-intensive industries could face crippling costs with no way to reduce their emissions. Awareness of the key role of CCS in the industrial sector is growing, as indicated by projects such as the Teesside Low Carbon Programme. The need for clarity and certainty in climate policy cannot be stressed enough. Businesses will not make the necessary investments in efficient and low-carbon technologies on the back of tentative policies. Businesses need the certainty that new policies will remain in place - independent of government changes and economic climate - long enough to see returns on their investment. The IPCC report has made it clear that the cost of delaying action will be greater than acting now. Politicians and businesses need to respond."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust a reminder of what NASA said three years ago: Polar vortices and blocking events were even more common in the 1950s when CO2 was below 350 ppm.
See second chart below!
The following is NASA’s 2011 explanation why (my emphasis).
===============================
Stalled Weather Systems More Frequent in Decades of Warmer Atlantic
 11.03.11
Slow-moving winter weather systems that can lead to massive snowfalls are more frequent during the decades when the North Atlantic Ocean is warmer than usual, a new NASA study finds. The study demonstrates that the impacts of such systems, which are often fueled by an atmospheric phenomenon known as atmospheric blocking, go far beyond the atmosphere and can trigger changes in ocean circulation.
Blocking events occur when one of the jet streams —fast-flowing air currents traveling around the Earth in the upper part of the troposphere—pinches off large masses of air from the normal wind flow for an extended period. These kinks in the jet stream typically last at least five days but can persist for weeks. They can cause weather patterns to stall over one area and fuel floods, droughts, and other extreme weather events.
In the North Atlantic, atmospheric blocking centers generally form over Greenland and Western Europe. A blocking event that took place over Greenland in the winter of 2009-10 ultimately led to intense blizzards in the East Coast of the United States, in an episode popularly known as Snowmageddon.

A blocking event over Greenland led to intense blizzards in the East Coast of the United States in February 2010. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite captured this true-color image on February 11, 2010, after a second snow storm had hit the East Coast in less than a week. CREDIT: NASA MODIS Rapid Response Team/Jeff Schmaltz
Now, a team of researchers lead by Sirpa Häkkinen, an oceanographer at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., has reanalyzed atmospheric data from the 20th century and concluded that blocking events occurred up to 30 percent more often from the 1930s to the 1960s and during a period that started in the late 1990s and continues to the present.
At first, the researchers thought the increase in blocking events during these periods might be explained by a climatic phenomenon called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO fluctuates between periods of high and low atmospheric pressure, without a predictable pattern, and strongly influences weather in Europe and the United States.
“The NAO is the usual suspect for all atmospheric changes in the northern hemisphere,” Häkkinen said.
But since 1996, the NAO has been in an almost a neutral state, while blocking events have continued to be abnormally frequent, especially after 2000.

Häkkinen’s team then looked at how a cyclical series of natural changes in sea surface temperatures, known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Ocean Variability (AMV), was behaving in the decades when there were more clusters of blocking events. The AMV switches phases every few decades.
The researchers observed the frequency of blocked weather events in the North Atlantic –from the equator to Greenland– over the entire twentieth century and compared it to the evolution of ocean surface temperatures for the same area. They then removed the effect that global warming has on water temperatures, and found that decades with more frequent, recurring blocking events in the North Atlantic corresponded to those decades when the North Atlantic Ocean was warmer than usual, as it is now.

The number of winter blocking events (black and blue lines) correlates strongly with fluctuations in the temperature of surface waters in the North Atlantic Ocean (red line). For their analysis, the researchers removed the effect global warming has on water temperatures. CREDIT: Sirpa Häkkinen (NASA GSFC), Peter Rhines (University of Washington) and Denise L. Worthen (Wyle Information Systems/NASA GSFC)
The team also found that these short-term weather blocking events impacts beyond the atmosphere and may ultimately alter ocean currents.
A series of connected changes begin because clusters of blocking events can divert the normal track of the storms crossing the Atlantic, which in turn can alter the twisting motion that the wind has on ocean waters, or wind curl. Depending on how wind curl works, it can speed up or slow down the large, circulating currents in the ocean known as gyres. When a blocking event reverses the rotation of the wind curl, the winds push against the direction of the whirlpool-like North Atlantic subpolar gyre, slowing its rotation. A slower, weaker gyre allows subtropical waters that would normally be trapped in the whirlpool-like flow to escape and move northward.
“These warmer and more saline waters then invade the subpolar ocean and cause a series of impacts,” said Peter Rhines, an oceanographer at the University of Washington, Seattle, and co-author of the new study. “They erode the base of glaciers, contributing to the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. And the change in temperature and freshness of the waters can alter subpolar ecosystems, too.”
A better understanding of the linkage between the Atlantic Multidecadal Ocean Variability and blocking events could lead to better weather forecasts and improved seasonal predictions.
“For example, knowing that there’s going to be a potential for more blocking events causing more snowfall would not only help people prepare better for the winter; it would be useful with water resources management,” said Häkkinen.
Denise Worthen, a researcher with Wyle Information Systems/NASA Goddard Space Flight Center contributed to this study, which NASA funded.
==============================
Note how the second chart shows that blocking events were more common in the 1940s, 50s and 60s.
The recent warm-Arctic/polar-vortex claims obviously are nothing but a load of bull-manure designed to keep the AGW theory out of the fairy tale books.

"Greta Thunberg has said the Black Lives Matter protests show society has reached a tipping point where injustice can no longer be ignored, but that she believes a “green recovery plan” from the coronavirus pandemic will not be enough to solve the climate crisis. Reflecting on the protests that have swept the globe in recent weeks, the Swedish climate activist told the BBC: “It feels like we have passed some kind of social tipping point where people are starting to realise that we cannot keep looking away from these things. We cannot keep sweeping these things under the carpet, these injustices. “People are starting to find their voice, to sort of understand that they can actually have an impact.” The coronavirus pandemic had given her hope by showing those in power are able to act when faced with an emergency, but the climate crisis needed to be treated with the same urgency, she said. “It shows that in a crisis, you act, and you act with necessary force,” she said. “Suddenly people in power are saying they will do whatever it takes since you cannot put a price on human life. “The main message that underlines everything we [as climate activists] do is, ‘Listen to the science, listen to the experts’, and all of a sudden you hear everyone everywhere is saying that. It feels like the corona crisis has changed the role of science in our society.” The 17-year-old has been using her time in lockdown to study, despite taking a sabbatical year from school to travel and campaign on the climate crisis. She sailed across the Atlantic last year to attend UN climate summits, eventually ending up in Madrid to address talks originally to have been hosted in Chile. “I thought I’m just home anyway, so I might as well just jump in the class … in my free time, as a bonus. It doesn’t really count, but I love studying so much,” she said. “I’m really the last one to complain because I haven’t been that affected by this.” She has also used her time to produce a radio programme, Humanity has not yet failed, reflecting on some of her experiences and meetings over the last year and looking at some of the challenges the world faces in tackling the environmental crisis. “The climate and ecological crisis cannot be solved within today’s political and economic systems,” she said. “That isn’t an opinion. That’s a fact.”"

In November 2017, just after being elected Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern attended an APEC meeting in Vietnam, where she asked world leaders to join New Zealand in reducing the impact of climate change. “It is my responsibility to take a lead role on climate change. My challenge to you all is to join us on that journey and leave a legacy we can all be proud of – we owe it to ourselves, our children and future generations.”



She said, “No matter how small we are we have a role to play”, as she outlined her plans to move New Zealand to a low carbon economy to uphold the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.



Unlike most countries, New Zealand’s _carbon_ emissions are very low because most of our electricity is produced from renewable sources. So cows and sheep and the methane they produce became the Prime Minister’s main focus instead. This is in spite of Article 2 of the Paris Agreement which specifically prohibits countries from enacting policies that would restrict the supply of food: “This Agreement… aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change… _in a manner that does not threaten food production_ ”.



The PM says the methane targets in her Zero Carbon Bill, which require farmers to lower their emissions by 10 percent within 10 years and by up to 47 percent by 2050, came from modelling carried out by the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change.



In spite of a great deal of uncertainty over the accuracy of the UN’s modelling – and huge controversy over the science of methane and whether it has any warming effect at all – the PM’s Bill will impose the harshest restrictions in the world on an industry that’s an international leader in primary production – with livestock farmers that produce almost twice the milk and meat per kilogram of emissions than the global average.



While an alternative pricing mechanism to the Emissions Trading Scheme (which was designed for heavy industry) has just been announced for agriculture, farmers were unsuccessful in persuading the Select Committee to lower the punitive methane targets in the Bill. As they stand, these targets will eventually decimate most farming operations and crush New Zealand’s major export industry.



Now, two years after the APEC meeting in Vietnam, Jacinda Ardern is planning to announce to APEC leaders in Chile next month, that New Zealand continues to lead the world by passing the first [zero-carbon](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/time-for-national-to-stand-against-economic-sabotage/) legislation that targets agriculture.



With New Zealand’s contribution to global man-made greenhouse gas emissions a miniscule 0.17 percent, the Prime Minister’s obsession with looking good on the world stage, comes at a serious cost to the country.



The Australian broadcaster Andrew Bolt summed it up well when he [said](https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6089615507001), “instead of the truth, what now matters are people ‘wanting to seem more passionate, idealistic and holier than though” [sic] on the issue of climate change. Global warming is ‘a movement that attracts the haters and the mini totalitarians’. Ultimately, what green activists want are ‘laws to control you, laws to control the economy. Some will say, we want you to stop eating meat, and we want you to stop flying so much, and we want you to turn off the street lights’.”



To be ready for the Prime Minister’s APEC announcement the Zero Carbon Bill is having to be rushed through its final stages in Parliament. 



The Environment Select Committee that is dealing with the Bill was forced to take the unusual step of meeting on Monday in order to finalise its [report](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2019/0136/latest/whole.html) to Parliament. The Committee stages of the House will need to be truncated by Government MPs, so the Bill can be passed into law in time for the Prime Minister’s visit to Chile on November 14.



But while the Prime Minister’s leadership on climate change has elevated her to international stardom, she is part of an elite cabal spreading climate alarmism.



Her claims that climate change is her generation’s ‘nuclear free moment’ and that ‘the world’s in a climate emergency’, are exacerbating a deadly problem that began when the UN’s IPCC started exaggerating the danger of man-made greenhouse gas emissions, to gain more media profile and scare politicians and the public into action.



Back in 1989, the late climatologist and lead IPCC author Dr Steven Schneider, [explained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Schneider) their problem:



“On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but — which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts.



“On the other hand, we are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we’d like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climatic change.



“To do that we need to get some broadbased support, to capture the public’s imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. This ‘double ethical bind’ we frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any formula. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest. I hope that means being both.”



Even Michael Mann, the Penn State climatologist whose discredited ‘hockey stick’ graph was responsible for generating much of the modern-day climate alarmism, is [opposed](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5w374/climate-despair-is-making-people-give-up-on-life) to doomsday predictions: “Unfortunately there’s some bad science behind much of the ‘doomism’. There is no need to exaggerate or misstate what the science has to say.”



Former Vice President Al Gore has [admitted](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/10/24/gore-admits-the-the-ipcc-climate-report-was-torqued-up-to-get-attention) that the language used by the IPCC in their reports was “torqued up” in order to “get the attention of policy-makers around the world.”



But Al Gore himself is one of the worst offenders, particularly with his 2006 error-laden movie, “An Inconvenient Truth”, which warned melting ice caps and rising seas would drown cities around the world, turning millions of people into climate refugees.



The exaggerated facts in Al Gore’s movie were debunked by British television producer Martin Durkin, who produced the film “The Great Global Warming Swindle” – view [HERE](https://breakingviewsnz.blogspot.com/2019/09/martin-durkin-great-global-warming_7.html). It labelled man-made global warming as “the biggest scam in modern times”.



But in spite of the best efforts of scientists and others to inform the public that changes to our climate are within the bounds of natural climate variability and that the forces that influence the climate such as the sun, wind, clouds, and oceans are beyond the control of mankind, extremists continue to scare people into thinking the world is going to end and there is no hope.



David Buckel, a successful 60-year-old retired gay rights lawyer from New York, was a victim.



One Saturday morning in April last year, he walked from his comfortable home in Brooklyn, to a nearby park, where he emailed a prepared statement to media decrying the lack of progress in tackling man-made global warming. He then doused himself in petrol and set fire to himself.



His suicide note [said](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/15/david-buckel-lawyer-climate-change-protest), “I am David Buckel and I just killed myself by fire as a protest suicide. I apologize to you for the mess.” No-one had been aware of the depth of his anguish over climate change.



Such despair is an issue of great concern to this week’s NZCPR Guest Commentator, Seattle based New Zealand consultant Nicholas Kerr, who explains that doctors are now seeing more and more children who are deeply troubled by the exaggerated doomsday predictions being made by global warming alarmists:



“An old childhood friend, Dr Joshua Betts, practices medicine in Australia and this year posted on Facebook about his experiences: _Recently I have had a number of teenage patients break down in my consulting rooms, overcome with despair at the thought that the world will end in their lifetime. My daughter and her friends tell me how the planet is being destroyed and we are all doomed. These thoughts and beliefs feed into a vortex of anxiety and uncertainty that is crippling many young people._



“ _We need to protect our children, give them hope and strength for the future rather than hatred for their fellow man and contempt for science and industry. This doesn’t mean wearing rose colored glasses and putting our heads in the sand, but instead framing the issues in a rational way where the most likely outcomes are highlighted, rather than the worst case scenario of environmental Armageddon._ ”



Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist, who has been anointed as the new messiah of the global climate change movement, is a victim of this herself.



She began suffering from depression over climate scare stories at age eight. She was diagnosed with autism and obsessive compulsive disorder. As Greta became increasingly despondent, her fixation with climate alarmism led her, by age 11, to stop talking and stop eating. She refused to go to school.



These troubles plagued her for years, and there is now a real fear, that since she has been elevated to celebrity status, other children may attempt to emulate her poor choices and actions.



Around the time when Greta started starving herself, reports emerged that a Brazilian couple, terrified by the prospect of global warming, had entered into a suicide pact, taking not only their own lives, but shooting their two year old son and 7 month old daughter as well. Miraculously, the baby survived.



Last month there were [reports](https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/furey-parents-need-to-keep-a-close-eye-on-what-the-climate-strike-tells-their-kids) on social media that climate change anxiety had played a big part in the death of a 14-year-old boy from Manchester in England.



With a media ban on the reporting of suicide, it is impossible to know how many others have sunk into such depths of despair that they too have taken their own lives.



And it’s no wonder that children despair when they listen to the alarmist rhetoric that’s being regurgitated.



At January’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Greta Thunberg said, “I don’t want your hope. I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if the house was on fire because it is.”



Then last month, at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, she raged, “You all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, and yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction…”



History may well show that a turning point was reached, when that 16-year-old stood on the United Nations stage and snarled at the leaders of the free world. Reasonable people are now beginning to realise that climate change has become a cult led by indoctrinated children. Many are now saying enough is enough.



But while there’s a mood for people to speak out, many media outlets refuse to publish anything that challenges their Armageddon narrative.



An Italian [petition](https://notrickszone.com/2019/07/04/90-leading-italian-scientists-sign-petition-co2-impact-on-climate-unjustifiably-exaggerated-catastrophic-predictions-not-realistic/), signed by 90 leading scientists and presented to their President in July is a case in point – it received almost no media coverage. The scientists explained that human-induced global warming “is an unproven hypothesis” based on inaccurate UN computer models that underestimate natural climatic variability. They say the alleged _consensus_ of scientists who believe that humans cause global warming does _not_ exist. And they want their President to reject any policies that pretend that humans can control the climate.



Another 500 prominent climate scientists and professionals from around the world submitted a _European Climate Declaration_ to the Secretary-General of the United Nations last month, [stating](https://clintel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ecd-letter-to-un.pdf) that there is no “climate emergency”. Organised by Professor Guus Berkhout of The Netherlands, their message explains “the models of climate on which international policy is founded are unfit for their purpose” and they say, “it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions of dollars on the basis of results from such immature models”.



The Zero Carbon Bill Jacinda Ardern’s Government is about to pass into New Zealand law is not based on science; it’s based on ideology – and the UN’s grossly inaccurate models.

"SEOUL, South Korea  —   The chief of North Korea’s powerful secret police, long considered the   man for the top leader, Kim   has been dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse of power, the South Korean government said on Friday. The firing of the chief, Gen. Kim   as minister of state security highlights the turmoil that has engulfed the upper reaches of Mr. Kim’s government. The general is the latest in a series of   party and military officials Mr. Kim has fired, demoted or executed as he tried to consolidate his totalitarian power through what South Korean officials and North Korean defectors have called a “reign of terror. ” General Kim was fired in   after he was demoted to a   general from a   one, said Jeong   a spokesman for the South’s Unification Ministry. The general’s surprise downfall was the latest indication that even top lieutenants are at risk as Mr. Kim has rival agencies monitor one another to detect and punish any sign of disrespect or disloyalty. Until his dismissal, General Kim had been Mr. Kim’s chief henchman in purging potential enemies. “Kim   has been a key aide to Kim   and has buttressed his reign of terror,” Mr. Jeong said. “His dismissal could further deepen unrest among officials and add to the instability of the regime by weakening its control on the people. ” Mr. Jeong said General Kim was accused of corruption and held responsible for various human rights violations, including torture, committed at his agency. But other political machinations could be at play behind the dismissal, Mr. Jeong said, citing speculation about a rivalry among different power centers. Mr. Jeong noted that the dismissal resulted from an investigation by another powerful agency, the Organization and Guidance Department of the governing Workers’ Party of North Korea. The department supervises all state agencies and is reportedly directly overseen by Mr. Kim. “The Organization and Guidance Department is conducting an intensive investigation of Kim   and the Ministry of State Security, so the level of punishment and the number of people affected could be expanded,” Mr. Jeong said, without disclosing how the South Korean government learned of the reported purge transpiring inside a secretive regime. The Ministry of State Security, which serves as the secret police and intelligence agency in the North, is one of the most feared tools of government there, responsible for arresting dissidents and running a network of prison gulags. When Mr. Kim executed his own uncle and No. 2 official, Jang   on charges of factionalism, corruption and plotting to overthrow his government in 2013, it was General Kim’s ministry that arrested and   Mr. Jang. Since taking power after the death of his father in 2011, Mr. Kim has frequently reshuffled the party and military elites as he has moved swiftly to establish his monolithic authority in North Korea, which his family has ruled for seven decades. Mr. Kim has executed at least 140 senior officials, usually killing them with machine guns and even flamethrowers, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank affiliated with the South’s National Intelligence Service. Thae   who was the North’s No. 2 diplomat in London until his defection to South Korea last summer, said he fled partly because of Mr. Kim’s reign of terror. General Kim, 71, served in various top military positions under Mr. Kim, said Cheong   a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a South Korea research organization. He had been the top political officer of the North’s People’s Army and chief of its general staff, as well as its minister of armed forces. Purges and executions remain an important feature of political life in the North. In 2015, South Korean officials said that Gen. Hyon   the defense minister, was executed with an antiaircraft gun in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, after he dozed off during military events and   Mr. Kim’s orders. In August, they said Mr. Kim had found fault with a deputy premier’s “disrespectful posture” during a meeting and had him executed by a firing squad."
"If fracking is to be a viable option for energy production, the industry must find a way to deal with the naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) that are released as a byproduct of the process. These radioactive materials and their environmental consequences must be accounted for. Radioactive substances occur naturally within the shale rocks that contain gas resources. These include uranium and thorium, and their decay products such as radium and radon. While the uranium and thorium are immobile, over millennia the radium has dissolved into the water trapped in the pores of the rocks when they were formed, along with high concentrations of dissolved minerals.  The process of fracking involves pumping water and chemicals deep under ground to break apart the shale rocks and release the gas they contain. Much of this water returns to the surface as flowback, bringing with it pore fluid released from the shale. The initial flowback mainly consists of the clean water that was injected, but once most of this has returned to the surface the fluid will contain a higher proportion of pore water. This means increasing levels of radioactive radium and dissolved radon gas. Radon will be present in the gas stream, just as with conventional gas resources, but generally at very low concentrations. It is minimal enough to fall under the radar of radioactive substances regulation. But the concentration of naturally occuring radioactive material that is found in the waste water, principally radium, is high enough to be of regulatory concern. Concentrations of NORM in the flowback must be monitored, along with the deposits of scale and sludge that get left on the inside of pipes and other equipment. These issues are similar to those that arise during conventional oil and gas production, which also generate large volumes of water as a by-product of extraction. But the amount of NORM in water found in conventional oil and gas reservoirs tends to be lower than in shale gas flowback.  In offshore fields such as those in the North Sea, the majority of water that is produced is discharged directly to the sea. For onshore fracking sites this will not be possible of course, and neither will it be possible to dispose of the waste water by injecting it back underground. This is because once fracking has taken place, the permeability of the shale remains low, making re-injecting the waste water difficult. Regardless, the addition of fracking chemicals means this would not be allowed even where it might be possible. Fracking produces very large volumes of waste water and, due to the concentration of NORM it contains, a permit is required to manage it. As yet, there is no economic way to clean up the waste water for drinking or irrigation purposes, but other dissolved minerals and rock debris can be removed to allow its reuse to frack additional wells. Reusing flowback like this minimises the volume of water used in fracking, but does not avoid the problem of having large volumes of radioactively contaminated waste water that needs to be managed. Some estimates suggest widespread exploitation of the UK’s shale gas reserves would increase the national waste water treatment requirement by as much as 3%. And conventional waste water treatment methods are generally not able to remove the radioactive materials effectively.  Though the technology to remove radioactive contaminants from waste water exists, it is both expensive and difficult, depending on the concentrations of other contaminants that are present. It’s also not readily available for treatment of the volumes of waste water likely to be produced as a result of the full commercial exploitation of UK shale gas.  The management and disposal of the scales and sludges left on exploration and production equipment will also be an issue for the shale gas industry – though treatment technologies and disposal routes for  are more readily available. The UK’s nascent shale gas industry must have a plan in place to deal with the byproducts of fracking. It will require careful management to ensure that any radiological material does not become a health or environmental hazard."

Guest essay by Neil Catto
The other day I conducted a presentation using the UK CET, like I have on several occasions. Along with explaining it as the longest recognised instrumental record of historical temperature anywhere on Earth, it is the best record we have to understand long the past.

Fig 1 Central England Mean Monthly Temperatures 1659-2012

As part of this presentation I point out that the temperature from 1659 to 2012 has only increased 0.87 Deg C in 353 years, or equivalent to 0.025 Deg C/decade. Considering this is a recovery period from the Little Ice Age it is hardly surprising and just part of natural variation. At this stage I normally get a few “really?” questions.
“The UK MetOffice’s own figures”, I reply.
The other day however was a bit different, someone in the audience asked “so how long will it take to get to the dangerous 2 Degrees C?”
Pause, why hadn’t I worked that one out before? Quick calculation done, 800 years I replied.
“Say again?”
I recalculate, and say “800 years given the current trend”. Gobsmacked audience!

"HOUSTON  —   Commissioner Roger Goodell of the N. F. L. declined to take a public stance last week on President Trump’s executive order temporarily banning visits by citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries, even as leaders in the N. B. A. spoke out against the order. But the owner Shahid Khan of the Jacksonville Jaguars made it clear Saturday that he was opposed to the ban and said he had been heartened on Friday when a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked  the president’s immigration order. “The bedrock of this country are immigration and really a great separation between church and state,” Mr. Khan, 66, said in Houston, the site of Sunday’s Super Bowl. “Even for the country, it’s not good,” he added, explaining that he thought the order could deny entry to some of “the tens of thousands of people who can contribute to the making of America. ” The only Muslim among the principal owners of N. F. L. teams, Mr. Khan came to the United States from Pakistan in 1967, earned a degree in engineering and went on to own    a   car parts business. He became a United States citizen decades ago. Mr. Khan said it was “kind of a sobering time for somebody like me,” in part because he had expected Mr. Trump to moderate his views on immigrants and Muslims once in office. But Mr. Khan said he hoped the courts would provide a bulwark against the president’s actions against immigrants. He said he understood Mr. Goodell’s decision not to make a public statement, to avoid the appearance of “grandstanding” on the president’s action. Instead, Mr. Khan said, the league should see how the issue plays out in court. “We have to look at it based on what can we do to make a difference,” he said. “And right now, there are enough forces in power and play that we have to see how this thing ends up. ” Mr. Khan has been a vocal supporter of a bill in Jacksonville, Fla. that would expand the city’s human rights ordinance to offer more protection for people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Similar laws have passed in other cities in nearly two dozen states. Mr. Khan said that he knew endorsing the bill might alienate some Jaguars fans but that he was willing to risk   cancellations. “I have no remorse over supporting it,” he said of the nondiscrimination bill. Despite his opposition to the president’s immigration policies, Mr. Khan, a registered Republican who said he had voted for Mr. Trump, supports his economic plans, specifically the emphasis on creating manufacturing jobs. Mr. Khan said his company opened or announced plans to build new factories in seven states last year, as well as in China, Mexico and Spain. He has some reservations about Mr. Trump’s approach to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the United States signed with Canada and Mexico and which took effect in 1994. Consumers over all have benefited from Nafta, Mr. Khan said, and his business could be hurt if the president changes the agreement. But Mr. Khan said he would support changes if they helped create manufacturing jobs in the United States like the ones he had when he arrived a   ago. “In a way, Nafta is like a scrambled egg,” Mr. Khan said. “How do you unscramble an egg? The value chains are so interwoven that it would be very difficult to do that. But government policies force us to look for ways to unscramble it. ”"
"Need to book a hotel on the go, or a friendly dinner recommendation while exploring a new city? There’s a bot for that. In fact, there are now chatbots for all kinds of things, from weather updates to health advice, as the popularity of smartphone messaging apps driven by artificial intelligence grows. Mobile messaging apps were used by 1. 6 billion people in 2016, and will reach two billion in 2018, or 80 percent of all smartphone users, according to the digital data researcher eMarketer. Another sign of their growing influence was evident last April, when Facebook announced it was opening its Messenger app to any outside company that wants to integrate its own bots into the chat program. Now, the booking services Expedia, Kayak, Skyscanner and many others are allowing potential customers to seek recommendations on hotel rooms and flights and book them via Facebook Messenger. Several other   bots have sprung up in recent months, providing services like bookings and tips for activities, with a robotic touch. The technology is young, and while most of these chatbots have yet to become viable alternatives to existing travel planning options like Trip Advisor and traditional guides, it could be only a matter of time before our   culture embraces booking by text. Here is what three of the more interesting options have to offer so far: SnapTravel aims to find you a hotel based on your budget and preferences via SMS, Facebook Messenger or Slack. It uses a combination of artificial and human intelligence to search Expedia, Priceline and more than 100 other sites for the best deal, and claims to have “secret deals” of its own. The bot first asks for your travel city and dates, whether you have a specific hotel brand in mind and if you have any neighborhood preferences in the city. I texted SnapTravel while I was looking to book a few nights in my hometown, Binghamton, N. Y. during Thanksgiving week. Based on my initial responses, SnapTravel gave me a cost estimate for   and   hotels in the area. After another series of questions regarding my budget, brand preference and more, I was told to hang tight and it would get back to me with hotel options within an hour. Seven minutes later, I was sent what it deemed my four best options, with photos and links to more details and booking options for each hotel, a link to a map with more options, and I was asked if I wanted to be put in touch with one of its travel agents (who can offer some human insight). The entire process from start to finish took 16 minutes. But it felt more like an automated phone call with a cable company than a typical text conversation. I thanked the bot, and was pleased that it did not bug me later on, something I had expected. The hotel recommendations were a mixed bag. I told the bot that I prefer Marriott hotels, and it included a Courtyard Marriott within my budget. The other three included a    a local resort and a Homewood Suites by Hilton. Points for variety, but another Marriott choice would have been nice. Meanwhile the map with more options had only two additional hotels. As far as the deals themselves, they seemed legitimate when compared with the prices seen on discount booking websites like Hotwire. com. When you click on the hotel’s link on SnapTravel, you get its rates, are told whether there is a cancellation fee and are given the opportunity to compare its rate for that hotel with other booking sites. While you won’t get a comprehensive list to shop from, SnapTravel mostly did what it claims it can do, and in a timely manner. A spinoff from the Hipmunk booking website and smartphone app, Hello Hipmunk offers up a cute chipmunk to help you book travel from Facebook Messenger, Slack or Skype. Just be careful what you ask for. You will need to be specific if you want to get relevant results. I used Messenger to converse with Hipmunk, and before I had a chance to say hello, the critter asked me what airport I usually fly from. I said La Guardia, assuming it would understand that I meant La Guardia Airport in New York City. But it came back with: “Looks like you’re planning a getaway from Laguardia, Spain. ” I tried again, asking for some flight deals from New York to Chicago for the next week. He came back with: “You’re looking for the best time to go from New York City, NY, to Chicago, IL. Hold on, I’m digging through the data now. :)” Not really there, but we’re getting closer, and I appreciate the service with a smile. Next I tried: “I need a flight from New York to Chicago, leaving tomorrow and coming back on October 9. ” That seemed to do it. “Ready to jet? I’m finding you flights from New York City, NY, to Chicago, IL, on October 05, coming back on October 09,” the Hipmunk bot said. “I searched 736 itineraries. The least agonizing itinerary flies from LGA to ORD. ” Below were nine itineraries, rated one to nine in order of “least agonizing” with times and prices. This bot is fun to play with if you have the time, but it has a ways to go in the accuracy department. For the business traveler, there is Pana, which, like SnapTravel, combines artificial and human intelligence to plan your trip. The human factor seems to play a more significant role than it did with the other bots I tried. You don’t need to be a business traveler to benefit, but you do need to be a   traveler to justify the cost: $49 per month ($499 annually) for its “concierge” plan. But there is a   free trial to start. The involvement of humans may have explained the short delay in Pana’s response to my initial text (three minutes felt like an eternity compared with the other bots) but it also ultimately led to better results. After signing up and giving some basic information, including your email and phone number, Pana asks you for a quick phone call to get to know you a little better. But in keeping with the spirit of avoiding as much human interaction as possible, I passed on that and sought out its A. I. guidance. Pana gives you three ways to start: through email, SMS or its app. I chose SMS and received an introductory hello. I then texted that I wanted to fly from New York to Chicago, leaving next Monday and returning Friday. I got a response from “Jo” and learned that she is “a Canadian transplant in Hong Kong, avoiding the snow and loving the urban island life. ” Jo promised to look into my flight options and send them to me shortly. About an hour later, I received four flight itinerary options, sorted by price from lowest to highest. This was as far as I took it, but Pana is designed to be a   relationship. Your virtual travel agent can check you into flights and suggest hotels, and then can pivot to   to recommend restaurants and activities in your destination city."
"**It is not yet known when all care home residents in Wales will be able to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.**
The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.
But Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton could not say when care home residents would receive it due to storage temperature requirements.
Care home residents and staff are among those identified as a top priority.
Other priority groups include health and social care workers and over-80s.
The jab offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness and the Welsh Government hopes the first vaccines will be given within seven to 14 days.
But Dr Atherton said getting the vaccines to care homes was a ""work in progress"" and ""very difficult"" to do because it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C.
Initially it will have to be provided to a limited number of sites, he said.
""We're trying to find ways, even with this vaccine, to provide a more disseminated approach to distribution.
""There are of course other vaccines in the pipeline - the Oxford vaccine for example which doesn't have such stringent requirements around temperature management and control.
""As that comes online, as we hope, that will that will give us a further ability to work our way through those priority lists.""
Dr Atherton added: ""I can't give you an exact date or a time frame, but we're working through that process as quickly as we can.
""Because those elderly residents, usually elderly in care homes, are one of our highest priorities.""
Everyone over 50 will be offered the vaccine in the coming months.
The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19.
It will be ""well into next year"" before the entire Welsh population has been vaccinated against Covid-19, Dr Atherton said, adding it would be ""a massive undertaking"".
Vaccines for younger people will be available after the over-50s have had their jabs, according to Gill Richardson, who chairs the Welsh Government's Covid-19 vaccine programme board.
Dr Richardson said the Welsh Government was taking steps to ensure the vaccination programme did not affect other NHS services.
""People will be invited to come and have the vaccine through the NHS - we'll be holding special vaccine clinics to make sure people can receive the jab, while keeping normal NHS services free to see people,"" she said at the Welsh Government press briefing.
""The vaccine is the best way to protect people, but no-one will be forced to have it if they don't want it,"" Dr Richardson said.
Dr Atherton added that a Public Health Wales survey had shown that 70% of people would be willing to have the vaccine, and 60% would want their children to have it.
There are plans for people who have had a jab to be given a record card but it is not anticipated that hospitality businesses in Wales will turn away people who cannot prove they have been vaccinated, according to Dr Richardson.
""We hope that people will come and have this extremely precious and significant commodity for free of their own volition, but there's no compulsion,"" she said.
The Welsh Government said two areas had been identified as appropriate delivery sites for the vaccine and local health boards would collect the vaccines directly from these sites.
Dr Richardson declined to say where the sites were, but added: ""We have looked very carefully at all the storage parameters and also ease of distribution so we can get this vaccine out as swiftly as possible to the immunisers who will need it in each of the health boards and trusts.""
People will be sent appointments with details of the location where they will receive the vaccination, dependent on where they are in the schedule and risk, it added.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""Today's news is a small glimmer of light at the end of what has been a long and dark tunnel...
""We must all continue to do our bit to prevent the spread of coronavirus - regular hand washing, social distancing, and wearing a face covering where required to protect yourself and others.""
Dr Richardson said serious side effects from the new vaccine were ""extremely rare"".
She said people might get a sore arm or occasionally a raised temperature, but ""it's a very safe vaccine"".
She added that the ""safety profiles"" were ""really good"" for the elderly and those that have clinical conditions.
""We are extremely pleased to be offering what we feel is a very safe vaccine to the Welsh population,"" she added.
Dr Atherton said it was not yet known whether the vaccine will stop transmission of the virus.
He said it is known from data submitted by the company ""it's pretty good"" at stopping people getting infected and having serious infections.
""We just don't know yet whether it will stop transmission,"" he told the press briefing.
""That will only be known to us in the fullness of time when vaccines are rolled out.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""This is fantastic news and is what we have all been waiting forâ¦ it is vaccines like this one that will give us the protection needed to reclaim our lives.""
Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader in Westminster and MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said the news was ""fantastic"" and there was ""a cloud beginning to lift"", especially for those in care homes and people who have been isolated.
""There's this prospect of being reunited with loved ones,"" she said. ""We really need some hope. It's such good news.""
Conservative MS for Aberconwy Janet Finch-Saunders said she had no concerns about the plans for the mass vaccination.
""The concern was always about whether a vaccine could be found and whether it would be approved, so today is a good day,"" she said.
As the NHS prepares for a challenging winter, with the additional pressures of delivering the vaccine, staff welcomed the news.
Dai Samuel, a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital who had coronavirus earlier this year, said: ""Excellent news and reflects the immense efforts and superb work undertaken by the medical research community.""
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, as two shots are needed.
It is the fastest ever vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same developmental steps that normally span a decade."

“Modern educayshun” really is doing a disservice to young Australians. Not only is it making them dumber – Australia’s international education rankings have steadily slid further and further behind, despite spending billions more – but it’s making them frightened and confused, too.



Creepy indoctrination programs like “Safe Schools” and [“Mates and Dates” ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/information-packs-to-empower-parents-against-gender-indoctrination/)fill kids’ heads with dodgy Queer Theory nonsense. Green ideologue teachers terrify their students with unscientific nonsense about a looming “climate apocalypse”.



 **Now they’re teaching girls to be afraid of boys.**



Last week’s demise of the White Ribbon charity is good news for schoolboys across Australia. For years now, White Ribbon has been out in our schools forcing little boys to renounce their violence. White Ribbon days talked not only about physical violence but males were also called out for emotional abuse. What a joke. Girls are renowned for ganging up on other girls, defriending and bullying each other in the most vicious way. Yet they watched on bewildered by White Ribbon’s public shaming of the boys.



The bias against boys is so blatant that even the ultra-PC ABC has taken notice.



“We mustn’t make boys feel bad about being boys,” wrote ABC journalist Elizabeth Jackson on The Drum website way back in 2014, commenting on her children’s reaction to White Ribbon day in their school. It shows the widespread concern about **White Ribbon propaganda** if ABC journalists were prepared to give voice.



But even without White Ribbon, the boy-bashing is destined to continue.



The entire education system is hopelessly biased against boys. Teaching is dominated almost to the exclusion of men by women. Even though girls’ academic performance long ago outpaced boys’, girls are still targeted with a plethora of special initiatives and extra funding. Meanwhile, boys’ normal play is demonised, classed as “violence”, and increasingly excluded and medicated.



But now we have documented proof of this **anti-male bias,** in the form of a Master’s thesis from a South Australian teacher, Christopher Vogel, who has just finished his Masters thesis showing his state’s school curriculum is systematically teaching children that males are the abusers with females as their innocent victims.



Christopher analyzed Keeping Safe, the mandatory child protection curriculum taught in all public schools in SA from kindergarten to year 12 […] His research reveals **systemic bias against boys.**



The curriculum provides 84 examples of males being aggressive to females (including child rape and abuse) and only one instance of a female aggressing against a male (looking in his room without permission) […]



While boys are at least as likely as girls to be victims of abuse, the narrative focuses almost entirely on girls. This bias pervades the media as well: despite boys and men making up by far the majority of suicides, media stories on the subject almost always lead with a fetchingly dramatic picture of a girl.



It wasn’t so long ago that our society realised, to our shame, that we’d failed victims of sexual abuse by choosing not to hear their stories. But now we have an entire school curriculum which deliberately ignores male victims of abuse, denying their experiences and making them reluctant to seek help […] It’s just one example of the dangerous grip of feminist ideology on our institutions, including school curriculums.

Have you heard all the banter about a U.S. manufacturing renaissance? Numerous media reports in recent months have breathlessly described a return of manufacturing investment from foreign shores, mostly attributing the trend to rising wages in China and the natural gas boom in the United States, both of which have rendered manufacturing state-side more competitive. Today’s _Washington Post_ includes a whole feature section titled “U.S. Manufacturing: A Special Report,” devoted entirely to the proposition that the manufacturing sector is back!   
  
The myth of manufacturing decline begets the myth of manufacturing renaissance. This new mantra raises a question: How can there be a manufacturing renaissance if there was never a manufacturing “Dark Ages”?   
  
Contrary to countless tales of its demise, U.S. manufacturing has always been strong relative to its own past and relative to other countries’ manufacturing sectors. With the exception of a handful of post-WWII recession years, U.S. manufacturing has achieved new records, year after year, with respect to output, value-added, revenues, return on investment, exports, imports, profits (usually), and numerous other metrics appropriate for evaluating the performance of the sector. The notion of U.S. manufacturing decline is simply one of the most pervasive economic myths of our time, sold to you by those who might benefit from manufacturing-friendly industrial policies with the abiding assistance of a media that sometimes struggles to distill fact from K Street speak.   






The myth of U.S. manufacturing decline has long been advanced by policymakers and interested parties as a predicate for industrial policy or trade barriers. “Because U.S. manufacturing has fallen behind,” the argument goes, “we need to match the efforts of other governments in supporting our factories,” or “because U.S. manufacturing has been hobbled by predatory foreigners we need to erect tariffs to level the playing field,” or “because our industrial base is in ruins, U.S. national security is threatened without subsidies to rebuild manufacturing.”   
  
The assertion that “U.S. manufacturing is in decline” is usually presented as holy writ, without allowance for examination or dissent, before those dubious policy solutions are pitched as our only salvation. Fortunately, the more open-minded and genuinely inquisitive insist upon closely evaluating premises before considering the “therefore-we-musts.”   
  
As the nearby chart confirms, U.S. manufacturing value-added (the metric most comparable to GDP, which equals the value of manufactured output minus the cost of intermediate goods), in both nominal and real terms, has been trending upward since the end of the World War II. Nominal manufacturing value-added declined on a year-to-year basis only eight times in the past 64 years. Manufacturing value-added took a hit during the Great Recession, as did the rest of the economy, but it plainly defies the data to suggest that U.S. manufacturing is – or has been at anytime – in decline.   
  
As a share of the U.S. economy (the green bars on the chart), manufacturing has declined from a 1953 peak of 28 percent to 11.5 percent in 2011. But that is testament to the growth of U.S. services sectors, not to a decline in manufacturing, which (as you see) has been growing nearly continuously in absolute terms.   
  
Yet some insist that these particular figures don’t tell the real story, which can be found in the manufacturing employment figures. Ah, well. Manufacturing employment has certainly been on a downward trajectory for three decades, after peaking at 19.4 million workers in 1979. Despite increases of about 500,000 workers over the past couple of years, manufacturing employment stands at about 11.8 million today. But manufacturing employment is not a barometer of the health of the sector. If the objective of economics is to make the best use of scarce resources, U.S. manufacturing – with its historic productivity gains in recent decades – has done an excellent job. It is not a reflection of manufacturing weakness that those scarce resources (apparently not so scarce) have not been redeployed elsewhere in the economy. Nevertheless, most of the “manufacturing-in-decline” narrative is the result of conflating the meanings of manufacturing value-added and manufacturing employment.   
  
What the media are today characterizing as a manufacturing renaissance is better understood as a surge. Things aren’t being turned around; they are accelerating in the same direction.   
  
Plenty of manufacturing and manufacturing-related activities have been occurring and growing in the United States for several years. Rising wages in China and the domestic gas boom change the mix of relatively viable manufacturing activities, but they are just two of dozens of considerations that factor into thousands upon thousands of decisions about where to develop, test, manufacture, assemble, package, sell, and perform every other function in a products supply chain from its conception to its consumption. A confluence of considerations from worker skills, total labor costs, degree of risk aversion, desire to produce within a tariff wall, interest in influencing political decisions, infrastructure quality, proximity to lucrative markets, proximity to supply chain locations, the stability of the political and business climates, corruption, the rule of law, access to capital, taxes, regulations, and dozens more all factor into the ultimate decision about where to perform a specific manufacturing activity.   
  
The implication that the shrinking disparity in U.S. and Chinese wages or the growing disparity between U.S. and world natural gas prices recently have surpassed magic benchmarks that will open the flood gates to foreign and returning domestic investment is an oversimplification that erroneously homogenizes manufacturing. In fact, the sector is diverse in its requirements, and thus in the weighting of factors that affect its location decisions. Every business – even in the same industry – considers different factors and weights them differently.   
  
What matters, though, is that direct investment in the U.S. economy – whether from foreign or domestic companies – is something to celebrate. Attracting investment in manufacturing and in other sectors is essential for economic growth. Unlike previous decades when the United States was easily the destination of choice for direct investment, nowadays there is much greater competition, particularly from emerging economies. In fact, the U.S. share of the world’s foreign direct investment stock has dropped significantly from 41 percent in 1999 to 17 percent in 2011.   
  
So rather than observe the migration of some activities back to the United States and assume that a trend is in the making, a better use of the media’s resources would be to take inventory of the factors that encourage direct investment in the United States and spotlight for the public how U.S. policies can encourage, and not deter, an investment renaissance in United States.

"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   A federal appeals court early Sunday rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore President Trump’s targeted travel ban, deepening a legal showdown over his authority to tighten the nation’s borders in the name of protecting Americans from terrorism. In the legal back and forth over the travel ban, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco said a reply from the Trump administration was now due on Monday. The ruling meant that travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   as well as vetted refugees from all nations could, for now, continue to enter the country. Those foreigners had been barred by an executive order signed by the president on Jan. 27. After a Federal District Court in Seattle blocked Mr. Trump’s order nationwide on Friday, the Justice Department appealed the ruling late Saturday, saying that  the president had the constitutional authority to order the ban and that the court ruling “  the president’s national security judgment. ” On Saturday night, as Mr. Trump arrived at a Red Cross gala at    his waterfront Florida resort, where he was spending the first getaway weekend of his presidency, reporters asked him if he was confident he would prevail in the government’s appeal. “We’ll win,” he replied. “For the safety of the country, we’ll win. ” The legal maneuvering led Mr. Trump to lash out at Judge James Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle throughout the day, prompting criticism that the president had failed to respect the judicial branch and its power to check on his authority. In a Twitter post on Saturday, Mr. Trump wrote, “The opinion of this   judge, which essentially takes   away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!” The Justice Department’s filing sought to have the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit block the Seattle judge’s decision and asked that the lower court’s ruling be stayed pending the appeal. In its argument for an appeal, the Justice Department had said the president had an “unreviewable authority” to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners. It said the ruling by Judge Robart was too broad, “untethered” to the claims of the State of Washington, and in conflict with a ruling by another federal district judge, in Boston, who had upheld the order. The Ninth Circuit court moved quickly to reject the administration’s appeal, a measure of the urgency and intense interest in the case. The Justice Department argued that the president acted well within his constitutional authority. Blocking the order, it concluded, “immediately harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the President, based on his national security judgment. ” Judge Robart, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, declared in his ruling on Friday that “there’s no support” for the administration’s argument that “we have to protect the U. S. from individuals” from the affected countries. His ruling also barred the administration from enforcing its limits on accepting refugees. The State Department said Saturday that refugees, including Syrians, could begin arriving as early as Monday. Syrians had faced an indefinite ban under the executive order. Despite Mr. Trump’s vehement criticism of the ruling and the certainty that it would be appealed, the government agencies at the center of the issue, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, moved quickly to comply. Lawrence Bartlett, the State Department’s director of refugee resettlement, wrote in a departmental email that officials were working to rebook travel for refugees who had previously been scheduled to leave for the United States over a   period that will end Feb. 17. A State Department official said the extended time frame accounted for the fact that some refugees will have to make difficult journeys back to airports from refugee camps. A United Nations spokesman, Leonard Doyle, said about 2, 000 refugees were ready to travel. Airlines, citing American customs officials, were telling passengers from the seven countries that their visas were once again valid. Those carriers, however, have yet to report an uptick in travel, and there appeared to be no rush to airports by visa holders in Europe and the Middle East intent on making their way to the United States. Etihad Airways, the United Arab Emirates’ national carrier, said in a statement: “Following advice received today from the U. S. Customs and Border Protection unit at Abu Dhabi Airport, the airline will again be accepting nationals from the seven countries named last week. ” Other Arab carriers, including Qatar Airways, issued similar statements. A group of advocacy organizations that had worked to overturn the executive order and help immigrants and refugees stranded at airports issued a statement on Saturday afternoon encouraging travelers “to rebook travel to the United States immediately. ” “We have been in contact with hundreds of people impacted by the ban, and we are urging them to get on planes as quickly as possible,” Clare Kane, a law student intern at the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, one of the groups involved, said in a statement. But some officials were being more cautious, advising travelers to wait for further clarity. The American Embassy in Baghdad said it was waiting for additional guidance from Washington. “We don’t know what the effect will be, but we’re working to get more information,” the embassy told The Associated Press in a statement. The Department of Homeland Security said it had suspended implementation of the order, including procedures to flag travelers from the countries designated in Mr. Trump’s order. It said it would resume standard inspection procedures. But in a statement, the department defended the order as “lawful and appropriate. ” In his first statement on the matter on Friday evening, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, described the Seattle judge’s action as “outrageous. ” Minutes later, the White House issued a new statement deleting the word outrageous. Mr. Trump’s Twitter post showed no such restraint. It recalled the attacks he made during the presidential campaign on a federal district judge in California who was presiding over a   lawsuit involving Trump University. Democrats said the president’s criticism of Judge Robart was a dangerous development. Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Trump seemed “intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis. ” Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, whose state filed the suit that led to the injunction, said the attack was “beneath the dignity” of the presidency and could “lead America to calamity. ” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement that Mr. Trump’s outburst could weigh on the confirmation process for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the president’s nominee for the Supreme Court. Until now, Mr. Trump had been comparatively restrained about the multiple federal judges who have ruled against parts of his immigration order, even as he staunchly defended its legality. Some analysts had speculated that he did not want a repeat of the storm during the campaign when he accused Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel of having a conflict of interest in the Trump University case because the judge’s family was of Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump, who had painted Mexicans as rapists and criminals, settled that case after the election. But on Saturday morning, Mr. Trump let loose, and in the afternoon he unleashed another volley of attacks on the ruling. In one Twitter message, he questioned why a judge could “halt a Homeland Security travel ban,” which would allow “anyone, even with bad intentions,” to enter the country. An hour later, he complained about the “terrible decision,” saying it would let “many very bad and dangerous people” pour into the country. Earlier, Mr. Trump had asserted, without evidence, that some Middle Eastern countries supported the immigration order. “Interesting that certain   countries agree with the ban,” he wrote. “They know that if certain people are allowed in it’s death  destruction!” The Washington State case was filed on Monday, and it was assigned to Judge Robart that day. He asked for briefs on whether the state had standing to sue, with the last one due on Thursday. On Wednesday, Minnesota joined the suit. On Friday evening, Judge Robart issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the government to revert to its previous immigration policies as the case moved forward. He found that the states and their citizens had been injured by Mr. Trump’s order. “The executive order adversely affects the states’ residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel,” Judge Robart wrote. He said the states had been hurt because the order affected their public universities and their tax bases. Still, Judge Robart’s order left many questions, said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. “Does the executive order violate the equal protection of the laws, amount to an establishment of religion, violate rights of free exercise, or deprive aliens of due process of law?” Professor Blackman asked. “Who knows? The analysis is bare bones, and leaves the court of appeals, as well as the Supreme Court, with no basis to determine whether the nationwide injunction was proper. ” While large crowds had yet to materialize at airports, there were individual stories of people trying to enter the country. Nael Zaino, 32, a Syrian who had tried unsuccessfully for nearly a week to fly to the United States to join his wife and   son, was allowed to board a flight from Istanbul and then Frankfurt late Friday. He landed in Boston around 1 p. m. Saturday and emerged from immigration two hours later, said his    Katty Alhayek. Mr. Zaino was believed to be among the first revoked visa holders to enter the United States since the executive order went into effect. His advocates had sought a waiver for him from the State Department, citing family reunification. “Mine must be a very special case,” Mr. Zaino said by phone from Istanbul. Iranians, many of them students on their way to American universities, also rushed to book flights to transfer destinations in other Persian Gulf countries, Turkey and Europe. Pedram Paragomi, a    Iranian medical student bound for the University of Pittsburgh, who had been caught up in the initial chaos over the travel ban, flew to Frankfurt on Saturday, where he was to transfer to a flight to Boston. “I’m anxious,” he said from Frankfurt. “The rules keep on changing, but I think I will make it this time. ”"

The Vatican has released a new papal encyclical on the environment. Based on the version of _Laudato Sii_ leaked ahead of time, the document is a highly political discussion of the theology of the environment.   
  
Pope Francis mixes heartfelt concern for ecology with an often limited or confused understanding of the problem of pollution and meaning of markets. Humanity’s obligation for the environment is complex and the Pope discusses ecological values in the context of economic development and care for the poor.   
  
Unfortunately, the document’s policy prescriptions sound like they were written by an advocate. The resulting factual and philosophical shortcomings undercut the larger and more profound theological discussion.   
  
For instance, the encyclical complains much of capitalism as well as property rights, which, in the Pope’s view, allow selfish individuals to act against the public interest. Yet capitalism provides the resources and technology to improve environmental protection. Indeed, he acknowledges that “science and technology are a wonderful product of human creativity that is a gift from God.”   
  
Market prices operate as signals. _Laudato Sii_ complains that disproportionate consumption steals from “future generations.” Yet rising resource prices encourage people to use less, producers to find more, manufacturers to operate more efficiently, and entrepreneurs to create substitutes. Claims that humanity was running out of resources and destroying the ecology go back centuries and so far have been proved wrong.   
  
Markets also compare the costs and benefits of different means to achieve a common end. In fact, markets and property rights are the most important means to provide people with what the Pontiff calls “a dignified life through work.” However, jobs are not created, like the earth, _ex nihilio_. The more regulatory dictates and higher energy prices, the fewer the jobs and lower the salaries.   
  
The Pontiff asserts the “social function of any form of private property.” Property rights may not be absolute, but the legal right to land is most important for those who lack wealth and influence. Property rights also create incentives for environmental stewardship. Ownership vests both costs and benefits with a sole decision-maker who can be held responsible.   
  
Most environmental problems occur because of what economists call externalities—costs and benefits that fall on others. Without an appropriate legal regime, industry can spew emissions far and wide. Drawing the line requires balancing complex interests: prosperity, liberty, ecology.   
  
The encyclical lacks much sense of the flawed nature of government. The Pope is disappointed that environmental efforts “are often frustrated not only by the refusal of the powerful, but also by the lack of interest of the other.” However, public choice economists diagnosed this problem decades ago: concentrated benefits, diffuse costs.   
  
_Laudato Sii_ also argues for redefining progress. The Pontiff should encourage people to ask, “How much is enough?” But it is important that those living in comfort in the industrialized West not try to answer for those living in the impoverished Third World.   
  




As I point out in _American Spectator_ : “The Vatican’s comparative advantage is not legislation. At one point the encyclical asserts the importance of education on turning off ‘unnecessary lights.’ The discussion of climate change is partisan, even though the encyclical notes the Church’s obligation to ‘listen and promote honest debate among scientists, respecting the diversity of opinion’.”   
  
In contrast, the Pontiff truly is acting as spiritual leader when he advocates a personal, social, and spiritual transformation in how people relate to the environment. His proposed “ecological conversion” should spark much discussion.   
  
Moreover, Pope Francis wants to change behavior. He contends: “if we feel intimately united with all that exists, sobriety and care will arise spontaneously.” It is committed individuals who form the “innumerable variety of associations” advocating on behalf of the environment, cited by _Laudato Sii_ , and whose reformed buying behavior can “change the behavior of firms.”   
  
The Vatican is ill-equipped to assess environmental problems and develop policy solutions. The Pontiff’s duty is much more fundamental. Hopefully _Laudato Sii_ , despite its practical shortcomings, will advance the larger and more important theological debate.

 **ACT Party**



 **The Podcast**



Last[ ](https://business.facebook.com/davidseymourACT/videos/457511111550784/)night, host Max Whitehead interviewed former EMA boss Kim Campbell, along with ACT’s Deputy Leader Beth Houlbrooke. ‘What’s Eating Business Confidence?’ was the theme and Kim gives a highly knowledgeable account of what the policy landscape looks like from the point of view of business. 



**Big Wednesday**



On Wednesday night, Parliament agreed to add a referendum to David Seymour’s End of Life Choice Bill. Seymour needed two big changes to secure support from the Greens (make the Bill only for those with a terminal prognosis) and New Zealand First (a referendum). Winning both does not mean the Bill will easily pass its third reading on November 13, but its chances are better than ever.



 **Stuff and Nonsense**



One proof of capitalism’s overwhelming success is that profoundly stupid people can live very comfortable lives. Some even get elected to Parliament and others write newspaper editorials. As one recent example, people claim that having a referendum means Parliament has abdicated its responsibility. To be clear, Parliament has carried out its full process. In fact, the End of Life Choice Bill has had the most comprehensive examination of any bill in recent history. The effect of the referendum is that the public could effectively veto a bill that Parliament’s passed. If only this option applied more often.



 **Why You Should Oppose the Zero Carbon Bill**



ACT has voted alone against the Zero Carbon Bill. It has nothing to do with how big a problem you think climate change is. It has everything to do with the centralisation of power the bill would bring. Everybody should read sections 5ZD – 5ZF of the Bill. It allows the Minister to put together ‘carbon budgets’ with plans for each sector. It gives the ‘Duty Minister’ enormous power over the ability of an industry to grow, or even survive.



 **We’ve Been Here Before**



Last time we had a law like the Zero Carbon Bill was the Economic Stabilisation Act. The Act was passed in 1948, to formalise a number of ad hoc wartime powers the government no longer needed into statute law. (There is nothing as permanent as a temporary government program). The Act gave the government of the day dictatorial powers over private business, politicising commercial decisions. Muldoon was able to wield the power he did because of the Economic Stabilisation Act.



 **It’s The Skylines, Silly**



For thirty years the Wellington skyline has stagnated while the Auckland skyline has erupted. Why? Since ACT’s founders fixed our economic policy, business hasn’t had to go cap in hand to government to get anything done. The Zero Carbon Bill would change all that. When a Minister can decide the fate of an industry, it’s a great day for lobbyists. The Greens are the main party that complain about lobbying in politics, but they will have done more to promote it than any party since 1948.



 **Another Reason to Oppose the Zero Carbon Bill**



The Bill requires carbon credits to be bought in New Zealand ‘as far as possible.’ Who knows how that will be interpreted. We suspect it will mean, ‘if there is a way to save carbon emissions in New Zealand, it must be done.’ The Bill says nothing about price. If there are foreigners who can generate carbon credits for $10 a tonne but they cost $25 a tonne in New Zealand, guess what? New Zealanders will pay 2.5 times as much to achieve the same result. It’s nuts.



 **Putting It All Together**



The Bill may or may not reduce carbon emissions and save the planet, but it will certainly centralise control of the economy. As the New Zealand Initiative have published, Greta Thunberg was right. The politicians are letting her down, but in a way she’d be unlikely to understand.



 **Never Forget**



The National Party is voting for this bill. They have never raised a concern about the centralisation of power despite supposedly collaborating with the Greens to create the bill.



 **Holding the Government To Account**



This week David Seymour got Jenny Salesa to [admit](https://business.facebook.com/watch/?v=406644930264085) her goal is a ‘vape-free New Zealand,’ hence her irrational war on this harm-reducing product. He also got Police Association representative Chris Cahill to [back down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye0VW_iGniM) on his inflammatory rhetoric towards the firearms community. Not a bad week for one MP. We need more ACT MPs.

"PARIS  —   Michel Onfray, a   French pop philosopher, was sounding pretty upbeat on the phone, even though the title of his latest book is “Decadence: The Life and Death of the   Tradition. ” His book had just come out, with an impressive press run of 120, 000 copies, and was selling briskly in spite of  —   or perhaps because of  —   its gloomy prognostication. “If you think today about terrorism, the rise of populism, it was important to put that in perspective,” Mr. Onfray said recently. His research, he added, “shows a civilization that had been strong, that had ceased to be so and that’s heading toward its end. ” Mr. Onfray is one of the latest popular authors to join France’s booming decline industry, a spate of books and articles (with a handful of TV shows) that explore the country’s (and the West’s) failings and France’s obsession with those failings. (Last year, the word “déclinisme,” or “declinism,” entered France’s Larousse dictionary.) It’s a phenomenon that cuts across the political spectrum and has picked up velocity in recent years by tapping into an anxious national mood. And its loudest voices are intellectuals with platforms in the national news media. Beyond Mr. Onfray’s, other books with decline on their minds have appeared in the past few weeks. “The Returned,” a best seller by the journalist David Thomson, is an investigative report about French jihadists who’ve returned home from Syria. “A Submissive France: Voices of Defiance” compiles interviews on France’s troubled banlieues, or suburbs, overseen by the historian Georges Bensoussan. “Chronicles of French Denial,” by the   economist and historian Nicolas Baverez, is about how France continued its economic decline under President François Hollande. There’s also “An Imaginary Racism” by the   philosopher Pascal Bruckner, who was recently cleared of charges of inciting hate speech and argues that fear of being labeled Islamophobic is leading people to   their speech, while in November, the Sciences Po professor Gilles Kepel published “The Fracture,” which explores how the radicalization of some young Muslims is tearing apart French society. “The thing that’s very striking now is how pervasive those ideas are,” said Sudhir Hazareesingh, a professor at Oxford University and the author of “How the French Think. ” “One of the things characteristic of the present moment is this idea that decline and decadence are not just the preserve of the extreme right. ” France’s preoccupation with decline has been dated by some scholars to the   of the early 19th century, and to the late 1970s and the end of three decades of postwar economic growth by others. Today, different “declinist” strains have merged, from Catholic reactionaries to nonreligious thinkers preoccupied by questions of national identity and political corruption. With France’s presidential elections looming in April, these often abstract ideas are taking more concrete form as the   National Front and the   Republican Party capitalize on sentiments of decline exacerbated by economic malaise and terrorist attacks. Mr. Onfray’s “Decadence” begins with early Christian history, traverses the French Revolution, then sweeps in the Holocaust, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which Mr. Onfray says prefigured the 2015 attacks at the French satirical journal Charlie Hebdo. Though he looks beyond France in his diagnosis, his homeland is central for much of its nearly 600 pages. Mr. Baverez, a lawyer and economist whose “Chronicles of French Decline” came out this week and whose “France in Free Fall” was a hit in 2003, said he didn’t believe in the idea of declinism. “It’s a false concept because it gives the impression that decline is something fated,” said Mr. Baverez, who has consulted with François Fillon, the   presidential candidate now caught up in a worsening corruption scandal. “We have to diagnose denial we have to accept reality to find solutions. ” Even in a country like France, where pleasure is held sacred, decline does seem to be better business than optimism. “To put it in Manichaean terms: Anything positive doesn’t sell, and anything negative sells, as if there were a sort of masochism on the part of some readers,” said the historian Robert Frank, the author of the 2014 book “The Fear of Decline: France from 1914 to 2014. ” “The French Suicide,” by the conservative journalist Éric Zemmour, has sold 510, 000 copies since it appeared in 2014 it argues that immigration and feminism have contributed to French decline. The philosopher Alain Finkielkraut’s “The Unhappy Identity,” about French multiculturalism and its discontents, started a national conversation in 2013, while “The Time Has Come to Tell What I Have Seen,” a 2015 political memoir by the politician and writer Philippe de Villiers that’s heavy on concern about decay, has been a best seller. The   magazine Valeurs Actuelles, which publishes frequent warnings about the decline of France and the threat of Islamic terrorism, saw its combined print and digital circulation rise to 119, 000 copies last year from 86, 000 in 2011, according to figures provided by the magazine. The decline boom seems to manifest itself in books and intellectual debate more than in popular culture, although some French television shows have waded into the murky waters. Recent seasons of “Engrenages,” or “Spiral,” a dark police drama, paint a bleak picture. Not everyone is so pessimistic. “Yes, the French speak about ‘déclinisme’ and are fascinated by decadence, but the most popular political figure in France today is the only one that speaks of hope,” said the political scientist Dominique Moïsi, author of “The Geopolitics of Emotion: How Cultures of Fear, Humiliation, and Hope Are Reshaping the World. ” He was referring to Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister in the current Socialist government who founded his own insurgent party and has been gaining momentum. Even if declinism is going strong, France’s birthrate is still among the highest in Europe, and studies have consistently shown the French to be more pessimistic about their country than about their own lives. Some hope the decline industry has peaked. “I think Trump and Brexit were a kind of electric shock, and something changed,” said Cécile Daumas, the editor of the Ideas section of the French   daily Libération. She pointed to “A World History of France,” by the medieval historian Patrick Boucheron, which seeks to put French history in a broader context and argues that the country has absorbed immigrants for centuries. The challenge is that “the partisans of decline have formed a vocabulary, a way of speaking that’s accessible to the broader public,” Ms. Daumas said. “The progressive intellectuals of the left lost their public and are trying to get it back,” she added. “It’s a real battle. ”"
"Just days before his inauguration,   Donald J. Trump stood beside his tax lawyer at a Midtown Manhattan news conference as she announced that he planned to place his vast business holdings in a trust, a move she said would allay fears that he might exploit the Oval Office for personal gain. However, a number of questions were left unanswered  —   including who would ultimately benefit from the trust  —   raising concerns about just how meaningful the move was. Now, records have emerged that show just how closely tied Mr. Trump remains to the empire he built. While the president says he has walked away from the    operations of his business, two people close to him are the named trustees and have broad legal authority over his assets: his eldest son, Donald Jr. and Allen H. Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer. Mr. Trump, who will receive reports on any profit, or loss, on his company as a whole, can revoke their authority at any time. What’s more, the purpose of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust is to hold assets for the “exclusive benefit” of the president. This trust remains under Mr. Trump’s Social Security number, at least as far as federal taxes are concerned. Since his election, there have been widespread calls for Mr. Trump to sell his assets and put the proceeds in a blind trust. He has resisted those calls, stressing that the president has no legal obligation to do so. While the trust structure, outlined in documents made public through a Freedom of Information Act request by ProPublica, may give the president the appearance of distance from his business, it drew sharp criticism from experts in government ethics. “I don’t see how this in the slightest bit avoids a conflict of interest,” said Frederick J. Tansill, a trust and estates lawyer from Virginia who examined the documents at the request of The New York Times. “First it is revocable at any time, and it is his son and his chief financial officer who are running it. ” It is not uncommon for people to place assets in a trust with themselves as beneficiaries for   purposes. But Mr. Trump’s situation is unprecedented because it involves a wealthy president acting to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest. The Trump Organization declined to comment for this article. The most immediate test of Mr. Trump’s legal moves to separate himself from his company, the Trump Organization, pertains to the ownership of the new Trump International Hotel in the Old Post Office Building in Washington. The trust documents, which were prepared last month, argue that “all beneficial ownership in the licensee previously held by Donald J. Trump, personally, now is held derivatively and beneficially by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust,” which is legal language intended to suggest that Mr. Trump no longer has a personal tie to the hotel lease. A provision in the 2013 lease for the building, held by Mr. Trump and his three oldest children, appears to prohibit a federally elected official, including the president, from benefiting from it. But lawyers who specialize in federal contracts say the trust arrangement simply creates an additional legal step between Mr. Trump and the hotel  —   meaning he will still profit from it. Robert H. Sitkoff, a professor at Harvard Law School, said the new details in the trust documents were unlikely to resolve the apparent legal problems with the Old Post Office site. “Formally he is no longer the owner, but functionally he still is,” he said. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform who has called for a congressional investigation into the lease, said he remained unsatisfied that Mr. Trump had addressed his conflicts. “This is smoke and mirrors,” he said of the new documents. While Mr. Trump may have to take additional legal steps to avoid violating the terms of the Old Post Office lease, he is exempt from laws that prohibit federal employees from participating in government matters that will directly affect their own financial interests. At the Jan. 11 news conference in which she outlined the plans for Mr. Trump’s assets, Sheri A. Dillon, his tax lawyer, called the steps he had already taken significant, adding there was an agreement governing the president’s trust that “sharply” limited the amount of information about his company that he could access. “The   will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal,” she said, “and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. ” Ms. Dillon added that an asset sale by Mr. Trump would also be fraught with issues. “Whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny,” she said. “Was it too high? Is there pay for play? Was it too much pay to curry favor with the  ?” The Trump Organization, which is privately held, has also released a list of 488 Trump companies that Mr. Trump has held positions at, saying he resigned from all of them. Public records show that he has severed ties from some of these entities. The Trump Organization has pledged not to pursue new business deals overseas, though it plans to expand within the United States. Last month the company named Bobby Burchfield, a longtime Republican Party lawyer and corporate litigator, as an “independent ethics adviser. ” The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust has existed since at least 2014, records show. By 2016 it was the only shareholder in DJT Holdings, one of Mr. Trump’s main limited liability companies, according to documents filed by Mr. Trump as part of his bid for president and released by the Federal Election Commission. That company holds some of Mr. Trump’s largest assets, including his Old Post Office lease, golf courses and residential properties including a house in Beverly Hills, Calif. New York City property records show that in recent weeks Mr. Trump has transferred several residential condominiums he owns into the trust."
"Currents of cautious optimism were flowing at the Wave and Tidal Energy conference in Belfast. Enthusiastic entrepreneurs and academics presented progress reports on the dazzling assortment of devices under development to harness the abundant energy resources from the seas around the British Isles, and elsewhere.  Attention has moved away from tidal barrages like the huge 5,000MW Severn Estuary project, which has so far failed to gain government support. Surprisingly there was no discussion in Belfast of the more modest tidal lagoon project recently proposed for Swansea Bay. The focus is now on arrays of smaller devices for harnessing the strong tidal currents present around certain coastlines. To date the leading device has been the 1.2 MW SeaGen turbine installed at Queen’s University Belfast’s test site in Strangford Lough by Marine Current Turbines (MCT). The SeaGen resembles two, twin-bladed wind turbines mounted on a horizontal beam and driven by underwater currents. Since 2007 it has generated 9GWh of electricity for the grid.  The company was recently taken over by the electrical giant Siemens and now plans to install an array of second generation turbines off North Wales in 2015. Still at the research stage is the Swedish company Minesto’s “Deep Green” technology. This is essentially a tethered, underwater flying kite – a hydrofoil wing incorporating a turbine and electrical generator, coupled to a control system that makes it perform a continuous figure-of-eight pattern underwater.  Because this creates a greatly increased water velocity into the turbine/generator, Minesto claims it can operate in areas with slower currents than required by conventional large turbines such as SeaGen, opening up a much wider coastal area around the world that could provide energy from tidal power. The company is testing a quarter-scale prototype at Strangford, not far from the SeaGen project, with the aim of progressing towards a 800KW Deep Green machine. Among those researching wave energy, there are also many competing technologies. Aquamarine Power’s “Oyster” device is essentially a hinged flap that moves back and forth as waves pass over it. The motion of the flaps pumps hydraulic fluid through pipes connected to an on-shore electrical generator. Prototypes rated at 300KW have been tested at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, where the company is now testing a next generation 800KW device that would be deployed in arrays of many devices. Operating on an entirely different principle is Pelamis, whose eponymous device is named after the sea snake. Facing into the waves, rather than across them like the Oyster, the Pelamis consists of five large cylindrical steel tubes connected by flexible hydraulic joints. As each tube is tilted by incoming waves, the differential movement of each with respect to its neighbours pumps oil through hydraulic motors, which drive electrical generators. But in both these areas of research and experiment, the Darwinan process that eventually kills off the less successful technologies has yet to finish. For example, in wind energy the three-bladed, horizontal-axis, upwind turbine emerged triumphant from competing designs demonstrated during the 1970s and 1980s that featured different numbers of blades arranged horizontally and vertically. Britain built and encouraged various interesting prototypes, including a large vertical axis turbine at Camarthen Bay and an even larger 5MW horizontal axis turbine on Orkney. But these ultimately proved commercially unsuccessful. Denmark, by contrast, concentrated on building smaller but more commercially attractive turbines in the 200KW range, and now hosts one of the world’s most successful wind turbine manufacturers, Vestas. The encouraging speech to the conference given by UK energy minister Greg Barker might suggest that political support in the medium term for marine energy in the UK is strong; but the prospects may not be so promising beyond 2020. Under the UK electricity market reforms currently being implemented, wave and tidal energy, as still-developing technologies, will be offered a high strike price of some £305 per megawatt-hour (MWh) – considerably more than offshore wind at £155 per MWh. But this price will only apply to schemes of up to 30MW, with a contract duration of 15 years.  By contrast, the mature nuclear power industry is being offered 40 year contracts (at £92 per MWh) backed by government-guaranteed loans. It is debatable whether, despite the high price offered, such short contracts and an unclear future will draw in the investment required to make the best use of the seas’ potential. The UK government has pursued a highly confusing policy towards renewable energy in recent years, repeatedly changing rules and prices, causing uncertainty to long–term investors. And although the UK currently leads in off-shore wind power, even here recent policy changes have caused several large developers to scale back their plans. This stands in stark contrast to strong government encouragement for investment in new nuclear power, or in Britain’s shale gas and oil reserves from fracking. Just as it missed the opportunity to be a leading developer of onshore wind power in the 1980s, it seems the UK government’s prevarication risks letting Britain’s lead in another key renewable energy technology, marine power, slip through its fingers."

"Ten themes shape the dilemmas, challenges and opportunities for the 21st-century city. Each relates to how we live and shape our places.  The tradition of urban living, of urbanity, focuses both on the rights of its inhabitants to the city, and the responsibility they bear for the city. Urbanity in this sense first arose in the Italian city states, notably during the Renaissance. It marked the move towards meritocracy, providing a space for free thinking and freeing individuals from the yoke of feudalism. The German phrase Stadtluft macht frei (“city air makes you free”) encapsulates this idea. But over time the notion of urbanity degraded into the idea of the flâneur, someone who watches urban life go by without committing to the needs of the collective whole. Together, ten interlinked concepts frame our modern idea of civic urbanity, and can be used to reshape how we see and shape cities for the future. Using these we can seek to realign individual self-interest within a collective consciousness that is focused more on our joint responsibilities for our city, or indeed our world. The starting point is integrated and connected thinking. Only then can we discern the links and inter-dependencies in the city dynamic, and how to make the most of their potential. This requires a changed mindset and is difficult to prescribe. Even so, governments and decision-makers have increasingly realised the shortcomings of strict departmentalism and silo thinking that stymie the creative solutions required. There is a demand for a reinvigorated public and shared commons to stand against, but also to complement, an increasingly self-centred public culture. It should foster shared spaces, from parks to public libraries, that are free, non-commercial, and public, where citizens can express themselves in creative ways. With this ethos we can retrofit our cities with conviviality and the habits of solidarity, in order to nurture our capacity to build communities. Planners these days discuss sustainability and the effects of climate change, and there are many good initiatives worldwide. Yet few city planners make the hard choices to prevent the customary configurations of cities or developments that continue to make them unsustainable. Embedding a sense of eco-awareness in a city means building introducing zero-waste, cyclical economies and smart technologies. This can be a lever for economic development towards a clean, lean, green industrial revolution. We must avoid unhealthy urban planning – rigid land-use zoning that prevents the sort of mixed-use developments that blend living, working, retail and entertainment, big initiatives that fail to provide diversity and variety, or the tendency to think that, through economies of scale, only big can be efficient. And believing in the inevitability of the car leads to cities designed for vehicles, not people. Mixed uses are coming back forcefully as living, working and playing in the same place becomes the norm again. Seamless transport connectivity, or walkable cities, will be key. Many cities are ethnic and cultural melting pots, boosting economic growth long-term – but absorbing differences will continue to create stresses. Cultural literacy, an understanding of others and focusing on what we share, rather than what divides us, will be key – as will avoiding housing ghettos and gated communities. But market pressures will continue to push cities in the wrong direction. Magnetic cities, those that everyone wants to move to, are increasingly unequal. The divide between rich and poor grows, creating tension, resentment, unfulfilled potential – and even violence. Any city where haves and have-nots are strictly divided has failed to harness the collective imagination, energy and intelligence of its citizens. Clever cities will demand greater equality and inclusiveness, because it makes social and economic sense. The demographic time-bomb hangs over us all, but in cities especially there will be pressure to isolate the ageing population into “retirement zones” with housing adapted to their needs. More innovative cities will seek to incorporate an inter-generational perspective to their planning and develop adaptable housing that can be transformed as its inhabitants age. The aesthetic imperative reminds us that the city is an immersive experience that communicates through its structures, its natural forms, its activities, and atmosphere. The way a city looks and feels, its aesthetics, create an emotional response and a psychological impact. Old-fashioned words like beauty and ugliness will – should – re-enter the planning debate. The escalating complexities that cities face cannot be solved by a “business-as-usual” approach. Imagination and creativity are required to solve intractable urban problems of the future and create new and interesting opportunities. Unleashing the creativity of the city, its organisations and citizens is an empowering process, harnessing potential and is a new form of capital and currency. This reminds us: technology has moved in gigantic leaps, but our forms of representative democracy, organisation and management have remained largely the same for hundreds of years. This is why civic engagement has atrophied. Future cities will need to reignite the civic spirit by exploring new ways of communicating with citizens, rethinking regulations and incentives and empowering civil servants. This requires a new type of administration, a creative bureaucracy, radically different from the target-driven, efficiency and effectiveness-focused model. Being resourceful, strategically agile, responsive and imaginative will lie at its core."

Guest essay by Brandon Shollenberger
We can pack up our bags and go home.  The global warming debate is, except maybe as an academic curiosity.  I know this to be true because Skeptical Science says so.  And if they say so, it must be true.
Don’t believe me?  I understand.  It’s hard to believe.  But it’s true.  You may remember a post I wrote a couple days ago.  In it, I called Skeptical Science dishonest for repeatedly promoting a tweet from (not quite) Barack Obama that said:
Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree: #climate change is real, man-made and dangerous. Read more: http://OFA.BO/gJsdFp
As Cook et al’s study said absolutely nothing about whether or not climate change is dangerous.  Barry Woods followed up on this point at Skeptical Science in a few comments.  That’s when the Skeptical Science crowd said concerns about dangerous global warming are unimportant.

“Sphaerica”, who I believe is a moderator, said:
So your particular nit is that the paper’s authors didn’t correct the President of the United States (or, rather, those who manage his twitter feed) for the exact wording of a tweet?
An official moderator’s response from PW, whose initials I don’t recognize, says:
[PW] Cease the back-n-forth on this silly nitpick of a single tweet. Return to the topic and further nonsense about a single tweet will be deleted.
“Dikran Marsupial”, a major player at SkS, says:
Life is too short for pedantry and nit-picking, especially if it is only a means to avoid acceptance of what the TCP does actually show, i.e. that there is a broad consensus amongst scientists working on climate-related science that the majority of climate change is anthropogenic.
Let’s not focus on the fact Dikran Marsupial misrepresents Cook et al’s results.  Let’s not focus on the fact nobody corrects him about him.  Let’s not focus on the fact that is almost exactly the behavior described in my previous post.
Let’s just focus on the fact Skeptical Science tells us it doesn’t matter whether or not Cook et al’s work proves there is a consensus that global warming is dangerous.  They say that issue is a just a nit – an unimportant detail.  They say there is no relevant difference between a paper saying, “Global warming is mad-made” and saying, “Global warming is man-made and dangerous.”
That settles it.  They don’t care.  Why should we?

From AGU highlights:
Clouds, which can absorb or reflect incoming radiation and affect the amount of radiation escaping from Earth’s atmosphere, remain the greatest source of uncertainty in global climate modeling.
By combining space-based observations with climate models, researchers are able to derive baseline spectral signals, called spectral fingerprints, of how changes in the physical properties of the Earth’s atmosphere, such as the concentration of carbon dioxide or the relative humidity, affect the amount of radiation escaping from the top of the atmosphere.

Researchers can then use these spectral fingerprints to attribute changes in the observed top-of-atmosphere radiation to changes in individual atmospheric properties. However, recent research has shown that the way global climate models represent the interactions between clouds and radiation can complicate the process of making these spectral fingerprints. Researchers are finding that what matters is not only the presence or absence of clouds at each location represented in the model but also how the clouds are stacked vertically within each model grid.
Using a simulation experiment to mimic the future climate, Chen et al. tested how different approaches to parameterize cloud stacking affect the attributions of climate change signals in the longwave spectra recorded at the top of the atmosphere. The authors tested three approaches to parameterize cloud stacking and find that the differences in stacking assumptions affected the modeled global mean for outgoing longwave radiation by only a few watts per square meter. The global average for outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere is around 240 watts per square meter. However, based on which parameterization is used, similar changes in the portion of the sky covered by clouds (especially the clouds in the middle and lower troposphere) can lead to spectral fingerprints that differ by up to a factor of two in the amplitude.

Title: Non-negligible effects of cloud vertical overlapping assumptions on longwave spectral fingerprinting studies
Authors: Xiuhong Chen and Xianglei Huang: Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA;
Xu Liu: NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia, USA.
Abstract:
In order to monitor and attribute secular changes from outgoing spectral radiances, spectral fingerprints need to be constructed first. Large-scale model outputs are usually used to derive such spectral fingerprints. Different models make different assumptions on vertical overlapping of subgrid clouds. We explore the extent to which the spectral fingerprints constructed under different cloud vertical overlapping assumptions can affect such spectral fingerprinting studies. Utilizing a principal component-based radiative transfer model with high computational efficiency, we build an OSSE (Observing System Simulation Experiment) with full treatment of subgrid cloud variability to study this issue. We first show that the OLR (outgoing longwave radiation) computed from this OSSE is consistent with the OLR directly output from the parent large-scale models.
We then examine the differences in spectral fingerprints due to cloud overlapping assumptions alone. Different cloud overlapping assumptions have little effect on the spectral fingerprints of temperature and humidity. However, the amplitude of the spectral fingerprints due to the same amount of cloud fraction change can differ as much as a factor of two between maximum random versus random overlap assumptions, especially for middle and low clouds. We further examine the impact of cloud overlapping assumptions on the results of linear regression of spectral differences with respect to predefined spectral fingerprints.
Cloud-relevant regression coefficients are affected more by different cloud overlapping assumptions than regression coefficients of other geophysical variables. These findings highlight the challenges in constructing realistic longwave spectral fingerprints and in detecting climate change using all-sky observations.

 **Louis Houlbrooke**  
Communications Officer  
[New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/)



Another busy week fighting for _lower taxes, less waste, and more transparency_ on your behalf.



Last month, Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones claimed he was “[incredibly disappointed”](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/shanes-jones-fears-air-nz-begin-gouge-prices-following-jetstars-decision-stop-regional-flights) that Jetstar was cancelling its regional services.  
  
So we wondered what the self-proclaimed “champion of the regions” has done to support those services while crisscrossing the country as Minister for Regional Development, so we asked his office.  
  
Twenty-eight days after our original information request (the maximum time allowed under the Official Information Act), we can now confirm **Shane Jones has not flown with Jetstar since he was elected in 2017**. It seems the ‘regional champion’ is too good for cattle class.  
  
If politicians insist on using the swanky airline for all their taxpayer-funded travel, they shouldn’t cry crocodile tears when the budget option scales back services.  
  
[We’re calling on Shane Jones and all MPs to save money by using Jetstar for travel.](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/r?u=xVcHhMqrwqv6d3C0CC_O9nG6Iw8t6rT52vtz9plwVd81jNvtF_DAnYstlwhOXfgCJjPOJJxvpWwQYTyLjCUWTaAWK1HZyl2xcqgd4evOUrYd44MuspiJkOoBj4syQNxh&e=8d1357073ebc33070ff9a64e947e9f2d&utm_source=taxpayers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tu_nwsltr_191025&n=3) The government’s massive travel budget could have quite an impact on Jetstar’s capacity to serve the regions that Mr Jones claims to champion.



 **The government has signed off on a $13 million taxpayer-funded research grant for Te Reo voice recognition technology.**  
  
[According to the Ministry for Business, Innovation, and Employment](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/r?u=cS9TqS4Q_p-ntHw6Br358RZxbYobQvlC9geaMzZiQYGpLFkzRd3X0fNKk2nFkRk7ZRiMdf_c7szrClgJIaraRetnfJZ_qeuyg7wU6nNLyxyr7r64FafbA1Lz9Ef5rmf91o_B1LpXinIa4AyLnsPPHYLrsUxZooyN4cpWF2IXjUesDO_XGns8mXz553UX8wIIVVONCTacD9Mwl5hdIbd1WYR6HlC86PWrga5DWfg48kYStJkDrzHo6YF3SuhmAewXzQEtQGNrWYjxGoz4ruqong&e=8d1357073ebc33070ff9a64e947e9f2d&utm_source=taxpayers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tu_nwsltr_191025&n=4), the project is hoped to allow people to ask Siri or Alexa things like how to “find a choice as kai of panipopo”. This will “ensure a New Zealand identity is firmly embedded in the digital world”.  
  
It’s a classic case of taxpayer money being poured into a shiny, fashionable IT project that is a nice-to-have at best. We say these projects should be left to private companies who have an incentive to keep costs under control and develop technology that people will actually use.  
  
**Someone on the median wage would have to pay income tax for 1,500 years to cover the cost of this project. We say the money could have been used to provide more much-needed measles vaccines or tax relief.**  
  
This is the same “Strategic Science Investment Fund” that [last year allocated](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/r?u=cSoqv965O5QwEBXLw54H_2_ff8tL_MYwgJpWF1Ymz8XgQO4i6CBiOu9nqDiBQvx_K4ba3calS2R7NC8V31m1_Hd1oFi879i9ku1BOJsHwvltpOKAiwoBNEtYxdAq7SZmtU212nuonOZjaLY69c-mzA&e=8d1357073ebc33070ff9a64e947e9f2d&utm_source=taxpayers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tu_nwsltr_191025&n=5) $5.4 million for research into shoe leather.



The fact Minister Megan Woods is proudly [putting out press releases](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/r?u=jHGEcXvs8EsTIWjQeNaHlcZmu3WuHLdTsK6tlqWh1O9sbLq036oac5v6xoJmMGvuibTRWnGAdnyp47vcB-6i1OBfqUrmRyYQGIAwJkIXU18z8Cq7HeEmOol_t-DsP2Ex&e=8d1357073ebc33070ff9a64e947e9f2d&utm_source=taxpayers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tu_nwsltr_191025&n=6) about this kind of corporate welfare leads us to wonder whether she has taxpayers’ interests at heart.



The previous government’s $30 million bailout for Rio Tinto (the $36 billion corporate that owns the Tiwai Point smelter) was meant to be final. Now the company is [angling for another handout](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/r?u=7EL176YFyxKF3ox3wD2rUare8I0bSkv63od33kHlNR6P32Dz7D8L9pKCQ-HizrLm8JGvBvJiPofdlHvCmGstShMYN6YYroQ8-y3WEl9zzwJ7N_il_JRU0JiLj2Cdt5x8fdpv4U_J0lhvzymWeQUnrWLQvQ1gdbvlWfjhsQJCLM4lFKaPzgJTMr0dwUqZfLLs&e=8d1357073ebc33070ff9a64e947e9f2d&utm_source=taxpayers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tu_nwsltr_191025&n=7).



This would be a disaster for taxpayers. **The last thing we need is for international corporates to see New Zealand as a soft touch for corporate welfare.** There’s even a risk that companies will make false threats of closure in order to secure taxpayer dosh.  
  
Rather than doing favours for individual companies, the government could make it more affordable for anyone to do business, by cutting regulatory taxes and lowering the company tax rate (which, at 28 percent, is one of the highest in the OECD).



The government has [made the right decision](https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/r?u=c_p-YRjyhi9wH9_uQPX-WpMwtt_m0LAKE3YEyZ0PKM5sOl_Vzj7NG_hGgAbKb3c6sccWuA6f6zE8eNV7l4WQZ4CRMpliPc-QVdR5CGFn5yGwb_iWTozagm5vzOapcIxPNN9gJz1jQa8Tv_R_zwAlfrAFXvm7A3PuNlqkB5ReV3w&e=8d1357073ebc33070ff9a64e947e9f2d&utm_source=taxpayers&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tu_nwsltr_191025&n=8) by allowing farmers to develop their own emissions pricing system, instead of forcing them into the Emissions Trading Scheme.  
  
Bringing agriculture into the ETS quickly would have punished the economy and hurt farming communities – even while agricultural production shifted offshore, with only a minuscule net impact on global emissions.  
  
 **Politicians must not allow their desire to combat to develop into an “at all costs” mentality.** The government should also continue to monitor developments overseas to ensure climate action isn’t simply pushing domestic farming to other countries.

Donna LaFramboise writes to tell me:
The head of the IPCC has written a novel in which the central character [Sanjay] is infatuated with pseudoscience and in which UFO enthusiast Shirley MacLaine is presented as credible. The final installment of the Nobel Laureate Summer Reading series.
Excerpt from Donna’s Article:
As a young Hindu, Sanjay thinks about life’s great mysteries – and wonders how the soul passes from one body to another during the process of reincarnation. He consults a couple of swamis, visits a few sacred locales, and later, as a result of his meditation fame, comes to be regarded as a spiritual leader in his own right.

What kind of spirituality? The sort associated with Hollywood actress Shirley MacLean – who appears as a character in this novel, voicing lines written by Pachauri. These days, MacLean is famous for her outspoken views about extraterrestrial life. According to a recent article on Oprah Winfrey’s website, MacLaine has
seen many UFOs from the deck of her New Mexico property. “I’ve seen a mothership here, and I’ve seen them at my ranch,” she says. “One famous day, a friend of mine was sitting in my hot tub out there, and three UFOs came over and hovered over the hot tub for about 10 minutes.”
…Shirley says that she believes extraterrestrials are attracted to the many crystals around New Mexico. “Crystals amplify the consciousness,” she says. “They’re attracted to that crystal amplification.”
She says she has never seen an alien but says their teaching is that the soul does not die. “The soul is everlasting, and its learning experience is lifetime after lifetime.”
In the novel, MacLaine’s ideas are not ridiculed. Quite the opposite. Sanjay treats her as an intellectual equal and takes her advice. While she doesn’t mention UFOs specifically, she urges Sanjay to travel to Peru:
You won’t believe the spiritual richness of that land. God does not reside above in that place. He has actually descended on to the mountains, and you can feel his presence everywhere.
When Sanjay and MacLaine meet for dinner in that country, we’re advised that a member of her entourage is “known to communicate with the spirits.”

Protesters have taken to the streets in Istanbul, Turkey’s first city. The metropolis is a vibrant mix of cultures, as Byzantium lurks in the shadow of Islam. Geographically the city and country are divided between East and West by the Bosporus Strait. Politically Turkey is drawn by both the past and the future.



The planned demolition of a small park in central Istanbul triggered demonstrations in Istanbul. The heavy‐​handed response by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government spurred protests across the nation. Then came a flood of predictions that the “Turkish Spring” was set to sweep away yet another authoritarian regime.



Yet Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) was democratically elected, triumphing in three straight elections, winning a larger portion of the vote each time. One reason for Erdogan’s success is that he has systematically dismantled the authoritarian, military‐​dominated system that controlled the Republic of Turkey since its founding in 1923.



Although liberal and secular elites worry that he is constructing a more Islamist and repressive system, Erdogan retains the support of his traditional political base. The prime minister has been weakened, but continues to dominate Turkish politics.



Modern Turkey was born out of the rubble of the Ottoman Empire, which collapsed at the end of World War I. Military leader Mustafa Kemal Pasha, played a leading role during the conflict’s tumultuous aftermath and became Turkey’s first president. He took on the name Ataturk (“Father of the Turks”) and his image still dominates the modern nation. His statue dots city squares and his photo adorns shop walls across the land.



Turkey’s capital, Ankara, hosts a massive mausoleum and memorial that covers an entire city block. Official honorifics are routinely piled upon any mention of his name. For years anyone disrespecting his memory or destroying objects with his image faced jail. Only in North Korea have I seen a similarly suffocating personality cult.



Ataturk was determined to modernize the country, turning ruthless nationalism and secularism into Turkey’s governing philosophy enforced by a one‐​party state. More genuine democracy emerged after his death but the military still dominated, staging three hard coups, the last in 1980, and a softer variant in 1997.



There should be no nostalgia for the “good old days.” The military jailed and tortured opponents. The generals even executed ousted civilian leaders in 1961. Ethnic minorities like the Kurds faced brutal military oppression; tens of thousands of people died and thousands of Kurdish villages were destroyed as the Kurds fought for autonomy. (In the view of Turkish officials there was no such thing as Kurds, only “mountain Turks.”)



The military decided security policy, such as the 1974 invasion of Cyprus, with a majority Greek population. Religious minorities, such as the Armenian and Greek Orthodox, found little space for views considered contrary to the Turkish identity. The public square was stripped of any form of the dominant Islamic faith; even the wearing of head scarfs at university was banned.



The Kemalist establishment ruthlessly suppressed freedom of expression, both political and religious. Mild doubts about repression in the name of Ataturk resulted in prosecutions, trials, and imprisonment of academics, journalists, and others. Talk to Turkish liberals — most anyone who believes in a generally free society — and you will find people who were prosecuted, fired, and threatened for their views. One prominent journalist told me he remembered his father being imprisoned for the crime of opposing military rule.



Most of this is gone, courtesy of Prime Minister Erdogan. Who, not coincidentally, himself was jailed and barred from office at one time.



Civilians run the government. The military has been tamed, with a coup now inconceivable. The war against the Kurdish minority has lapsed, with an ongoing attempt to reach a long‐​term settlement. Enforced worship of Kemal Ataturk has been scaled back. Restrictions on freedom of expression and religion have been loosened. The government is friendlier to private commerce than most of the Middle East, and the Turkish people have prospered as a result. There’s even social progress — when I visited in late 2011 several women praised the Islamic government for making limited but real progress in confronting gender‐​based abuse and violence.



In short, by almost every measure Turks are better off than before the AKP swept a decrepit and discredited coalition from power in 2002. Unlike the regimes threatened by the Arab Spring — the dictators of Tunisia, Egypt, and Syria, as well as the many archaic kingdoms which dot the Persian Gulf — Erdogan came to power legitimately and confronted abuses, particularly by Turkey’s so‐​called Deep State.



These accomplishments seem to escape most of his American critics. In fact, what disturbs many of them is that Ankara has begun charting a foreign policy independent to that advanced by the U.S. and Israel. As the civilians have taken control no longer can the Pentagon call the Turkish generals to win a course correction. There is as much to criticize in Prime Minister Erdogan’s so far maladroit attempt to turn his nation into a regional Weltmacht, but Turkey is entitled to make its own way.



More tragically, however, Prime Minister Erdogan has stopped acting as a liberator, and increasingly begun acting as oppressor at home. His government has used preexisting security laws to prosecute civilians, including many journalists, as well as military officers for alleged crimes, some going back many years. While those who in their time persecuted others deserve little sympathy, misuse of the law puts the liberties of all into jeopardy. Warned the U.S. State Department in its latest human rights report: “Broad laws against terrorism and other threats to the state and a lack of transparency in the prosecution of such cases significantly restricted access to justice.”



Particularly threatening is the prosecution of journalists. Last year the Journalists Union of Turkey counted 94 reporters in prison, while another group figured that number at 104. The _New Yorker_ ’s Dexter Filkins cited “an extraordinary climate of fear among journalists,” leading many editors to expressly discourage criticism of the prime minister.



Of course, the government claims that it is responding to real threats, and that those arrested are criminals, not journalists. I have found avid civilian defenders of the ongoing prosecutions. One university professor recently told me that there was no attack on journalistic freedom, since those being prosecuted had conspired with the military against the democratically elected government.



Yet the improbably vast sweep of the alleged Diyarbakir KCK (Kurdish), Ergenekon (nationalist), and Sledgehammer (military) conspiracies warrant more than a little skepticism. Roughly 500 people were arrested and 300 charged in the Ergenekon case alone. Some defendants have been detained for years. While some of those accused may have been guilty of some crimes, the chief motivation appears to be to break political opponents.



Equally worrisome is the public intimidation resulting from the wide‐​ranging prosecutions as well as overt assaults on independent media. The State Department concluded: “Journalists, academics, and authors reported self‐​censorship was common because individuals in many case were afraid that criticizing the state or government publicly could result in civil or criminal suits or investigations.” Minimal television coverage of the recent protests probably reflected this climate of fear.



Such claims obviously are difficult to prove. However, a number of Turkish liberals with whom I talked in recent years acknowledged their reluctance to publicly criticize the government. Businessmen also fear political retaliation. These people uniformly praise Erdogan for limiting state power and enhancing human rights. But most of them believed the government had changed direction. The majority now feared losing their companies, academic positions, jobs, and even freedom.



The most explosive charge is that the AKP plans to create an Islamic state. The party has purged some centrist members and Istanbul party chairman Aziz Babuscu was quoted in April as saying “The Turkey we will construct, the future that we will bring about, is not going to be a future that [liberals] will be able to accept.” (He later denied making these remarks, which were reported by listeners.)



Still, after a third election victory and decade in power the prime minister has yet to push such an agenda. This suggests that he may be what he seems to be: a moderate Muslim who wants to bend, not break, the secular Turkish state. The problem is what he has done, including the aroma of corruption that follows his government, is more than what he intended.



Turkey needs an Arab Spring, but within the democratic process. The principal political challenge in Turkey today is unaccountable political power, which polls indicate motivated most protesters to act. That can be achieved through the ballot box.



Despite some conciliatory rumblings by the president and deputy prime minister, Prime Minister Erdogan’s control over the AKP appears solid. Said Sinan Ulgen, a visiting scholar with Carnegie Europe, Prime Minister Erdogan “remains by far Turkey’s most popular politician.” Nevertheless, the latter’s arrogance may end up curbing his ambitions. Argued Turkish newspaper columnist Mustafa Akyol, the premier “will have to back off from the dreams of the all‐​powerful presidency he wanted to design for himself through a new constitution.”



Ironically, by breaking the military’s hold over politics Prime Minister Erdogan made further democratic transformation of Turkey possible. It’s up to the Turkish people to take advantage of that opportunity. They will decide on constitutional reform. They will vote in upcoming municipal, presidential, and parliamentary elections. If they choose, a “Turkish Spring” could either elevate an opposition party or coalition to power, or force the AKP to reform itself in order to retain power.



The decision is up to the Turkish people.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSo far it’s been a very mild winter across Central Europe. Just days ago, with temperatures in the double-digit Celsius range, meteorologists and media wrote off the possibility of a white Christmas. Gradually all the snow being a “thing of the past” talk was starting up.
Wrong again. So unpredictable can chaotic systems like weather and climate be.

Wetter.net here reports that on Europe’s 2nd Christmas Day (December 26) snow will spread from the Alps and across southern Germany, and make its way through the east with temperatures dropping into the minus zones. By Saturday night readings will drop to as low as -6°C and snow will spread over the northwestern flatlands to the North Sea coast.
30°C temperature drop
Wetter.net writes that significant snowfall is expected for Saturday with a thick blanket over many regions. “Winter will be setting an exclamation mark!” Wetter.net warns of blowing and “massive drifting snow” and of chaotic traffic conditions. Temperatures will plummet to as low as -11°C, thanks to a low positioned over Italy pumping cold air from the East. By Tuesday, according to wetter.net, readings will fall to as low as -18°C in East Germany, some 30°C below values measured just days ago.
In Fulda the temperature may drop to as low as -20°C on New Year’s Eve.
How long will the cold linger? Forecasts are showing it to persist into early January. This year the North Atlantic has been especially tempestuous and forecasts have been difficult to pinpoint more than 3 days out.
Long-range forecasts by the NCEP have been pointing to normal winter conditions for the January to March period. But judging by what Central Europe has seen so far, everything from spring-like to Arctic conditions are likely this winter. Once again, the North Atlantic dominates Europe’s weather.

During his confirmation hearing last week, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, U.S. President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, took a tough stance on Russia, describing it as “a danger to our country,” even as Democrats criticized him for being insufficiently harsh. This is typical in the era of Trump, when those on both sides of the aisle routinely portray Russia as a dire threat to the United States. This bipartisan enmity toward Russia has pushed even Trump, whose rhetoric on the country often vacillates between open hostility and admiration, to adopt reflexively hawkish policies, from purposeless sanctions to nuclear saber rattling.



But rather than altering Russian behavior, these policies are all too often making the situation worse. A more effective Russia policy is possible. It would acknowledge the difficult realities of today’s U.S.-Russian relationship while focusing on both deterrence and reengagement, as needed. Regrettably, it cannot be achieved so long as the United States’ reaction to Russian actions is reflexive hostility and confrontation.



 **The Confrontational Status Quo**



It is not surprising, given Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, that many Americans are hostile to Russia. Although the scope of the interference remains unclear—and the impact questionable—it nonetheless feels like a violation. Yet today’s inflammatory rhetoric is still notable. Former Vice President Joe Biden recently wrote, for example, that “the Russian government is brazenly assaulting the foundations of Western democracy.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has called on Trump to “train his fire on the foreign adversary, Russia, that attacked us.” And Democratic Representative André Carson of Indiana warned of a “new Iron Curtain descending across Europe.”





Even if it proves impossible in the Trump administration to develop a long‐​term strategy for U.S.-Russian relations, today’s focus on hostility is fundamentally counterproductive.



Unfortunately, this threatening rhetoric not only serves to keep tensions high but also produces knee‐​jerk policy responses focused on mindless confrontation. Take last year’s sanctions legislation, theCountering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Although sanctions are rarely effective, the Obama administration’s Russia sanctions were at least narrowly targeted and included clear conditions—notably Russia’s compliance with the Minsk process to end the war in eastern Ukraine—under which they could be removed. CAATSA, in contrast, is largely punitive and offers no clear path for Congress to consider lifting the sanctions, thus providing no incentive for Russia to change its behavior.



The Trump administration, although reticent at first, has also taken confrontational steps in recent months. Some of these steps were clearly justified, such as the expulsion of Russian diplomats in response to the attempted murder in the United Kingdom of a Russian defector using a banned nerve agent. Yet others were far less so. In December, for example, the administration agreed to provide lethal aid to Ukraine—a step the Obama administration had avoided for fear of escalating the conflict there—despite any clear rationale for how it might improve the situation.



The White House’s policy documents have also presented a belligerent stance toward Russia. The National Security Strategy, released in December, describes Russia as one of the “revisionist powers,” listing it as a challenge along with “rogue regimes” such as Iran and North Korea. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, meanwhile, includes provisions for new low‐​yield nuclear weapons and cruise missiles explicitly designed to counter Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Many experts, such as Olga Oliker and Vipin Narang, worry that such weapons may simply make conflict with Russia more likely.



Even the recent strikes on Syria reflected this animosity. The strikes were limited, largely avoided Russian targets, and did not result in escalation. Yet some officials in the administration had argued for broader strikes that would affect Russian assets; the president even went so far as to taunt Russia about potential strikes in tweets. Thankfully, it appears that the more cautious approach advocated by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis prevailed.



 **How to Reengage**



Today’s confrontational rhetoric and policies toward Russia often ignore reality and highlight the need for an alternative approach. A more accurate assessment of Russia today would certainly acknowledge that the country has engaged in belligerent behavior, including repeated attempts at election meddling and violent murders of Russian defectors inside Western countries. It would also recognize Russia’s continued aggression toward its neighbors, including military action in Georgia and Ukraine, and its profoundly undemocratic political system. Yet at the same time, it would affirm that there is an underlying rationale for many of these actions. Some, such as the seizure of Crimea, reflect security concerns—in that case, the need to maintain Russian military bases inside Ukraine. The same can be said of Russia’s development of new nuclear weapons, which is a response to the George W. Bush administration’s decision to withdraw from the Anti‐​Ballistic Missile Treaty, which effectively initiated a new arms race. Domestic politics play a role, too. Russian President Vladimir Putin fears the West’s more open political systems, and he benefits from today’s antagonism, which helps prop up his domestic popularity.



A more realistic U.S. approach to Russia would reflect the limits of what Washington can and cannot achieve and thus define U.S. interests far more narrowly.



Ultimately, a more realistic U.S. approach to Russia would reflect the limits of what Washington can and cannot achieve and thus define U.S. interests far more narrowly. At the most basic level, Washington has a clear interest in preventing Russia from dominating Europe, a possibility that is today so far‐​fetched as to be laughable. Despite the talk of a new Cold War, Russia is not the Soviet Union. The United States also has a clear interest in preventing Russian from meddling in the United States’ domestic politics and in the domestic politics of its closest allies, whether that takes the form of hacking, election meddling, or other violations of sovereignty.



At the same time, the United States also has an interest in avoiding pointless conflict with Russia over states that are simply not that important to U.S. national security, including Syria and Ukraine. Although Washington’s broader stake in regional and global stability may extend to diplomatic or humanitarian engagement in these countries, it is not sufficient to justify military involvement or the risks of inadvertent escalation with Russia. It is unfortunate that in recent years, policymakers in Washington have often construed U.S. interests so broadly as to be meaningless. Instead, they should focus on—and more clearly define—the U.S. interests that are of true concern. This includes maintaining Russian cooperation on key global issues, such as nonproliferation, Iran, and North Korea. The good news is that these narrow interests are actually achievable. By shifting away from confrontational rhetoric and policies, Washington can lower tensions, create effective deterrence on issues of critical importance, and reengage with Russia on topics of mutual interest.



 **A Better Way Forward**



First on Washington’s to‐​do list should be to establish redlines with Russia. One of the biggest problems in U.S.-Russian relations in recent years has been the failure to effectively communicate U.S. interests. There is ambiguity over whether NATO will expand further, whether Washington will respond to cyberattacks, and whether it is willing to go to war to defend non‐​NATO members such as Georgia and Ukraine. A clearer indication of redlines would help deter Russia. Some, such as further meddling in U.S. elections, other violations of U.S. sovereignty, and Russian military action against a NATO treaty ally, are obvious and the crossing of them should be met with a clear response. Other possible redlines will require careful consideration: for example, when does Russian interference in the domestic politics of close allies require a U.S. response?



Violations of these more definite redlines should be met with responses that are not just clear but also flexible and creative. Rather than imposing another pointless round of sanctions or focusing on a military buildup, for example, the United States could react to future election meddling by using its extensive global financial intelligence network to publicly release information implicating key Kremlin figures in corruption. Diplomatic expulsions and financial restrictions on Russian state companies, meanwhile, may be a proportionate and effective response to meddling in the domestic politics of allies. Military options—from troop deployments to arms sales—should always be the last resort.



Second, Washington needs to understand that many of Russia’s actions against Western countries in recent years would not have been possible without the existence of vulnerabilities within the West, whether the increasingly partisan nature of politics in the United States, weak cybersecurity provisions, or a NATO alliance in which members rarely contribute to the common defense. Although some of these problems are easier to fix than others, they nonetheless point to how to shore up U.S. defenses.



Two key problems should be prioritized. Whether through the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or through the congressional intelligence committees, the American people deserve to know the scope and impact of Russian involvement in the 2016 election. A coherent picture of actual events is the only way to move toward effective safeguards against future meddling. At the same time, policymakers should build on recent improvements in NATO members’ military spending to spread the burden of defense more equally. Military spending should not be the only metric here. Washington must push other NATO member states to develop the capacity to contribute to the alliance’s military capabilities, making NATO less a U.S.-led organization and more an alliance of equals.



Finally, U.S. policymakers must try to reengage with Russia; the heated rhetoric of the last few years has seen the virtual dissolution of U.S.-Russian diplomatic ties. This has inhibited the capability of Russia and the United States to resolve crises and work together on mutual interests. The ability of U.S. and Russian diplomats to cooperate on nonproliferation issues, for example, ultimately helped produce the Iran nuclear deal.



North Korea is a key issue for both states; bringing Russia into multinational discussions on North Korea could help with crisis resolution while improving deteriorating U.S.-Russian diplomatic ties. More important, however, is a return to arms control negotiations, because many of the current generation of treaties are failing or are scheduled to lapse soon. The Intermediate‐​Range Nuclear Forces Treaty—of which Russia may today be in violation—offers one such negotiating opportunity, as does the pending expiration of the New START treaty in 2021.



 **A Political Roadblock?**



Ultimately, the key barrier to improving U.S.-Russian relations is political: in the current U.S. domestic climate, the incentives to emphasize hostility are heightened. The Trump administration is motivated to act harshly toward Russia to counteract suspicions tied to the ongoing special counsel investigation, and the president’s opponents find hostility an excellent way to implicate Trump in Russia’s bad behavior.



These incentives have led to an incoherent overall approach to Russia. Just this week, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, announced new sanctions on Russia related to its actions in Syria, a policy that was almost immediately contradicted by the White House. The administration’s approach to Russia appears to be caught in a stalemate between Trump’s more conciliatory impulses and the more hawkish instincts and rhetoric of his advisers and of Congress. Meanwhile, the White House seems to have no plans to prevent or deter future election meddling by Russia.



Yet even if it proves impossible in the Trump administration to develop a long‐​term strategy for U.S.-Russian relations, today’s focus on hostility is fundamentally counterproductive. Policymakers on both sides of the aisle should bear in mind that knee‐​jerk hostility to Russia—whether overblown rhetoric or confrontational policy responses—is likely only to make the situation worse in the long run.

"How can air bubbles trapped in ice for millions of years, or fossilised fern fronds, or the chemical make-up of rocks that were underwater in the distant past provide us with an inkling of our future? The answer lies in these clues provided by studying the Pliocene epoch, the span of geological time that stretched from 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago. This period of Earth’s history is interesting for many reasons, but one of the most profound is that the Earth’s atmosphere apparently contained high concentrations of carbon dioxide. Our best estimates suggest concentrations of about 300-400 parts per million (ppm) – much higher than concentrations of 100 years ago, but the same or lower than today after centuries of industrialisation and fossil fuel burning. So studying the Pliocene could provide valuable insight into the type of planet we are creating via global warming. Our researchers at the Cabot Institute recently released a video on the topic, which has coincided with pronounced flooding across the UK and renewed attention focused on our weather and climate. There is little doubt that increased carbon dioxide concentrations will cause global warming. The key questions are how much, and with what consequences. One of the key lessons from Earth history is climate sensitivity.  Climate sensitivity can be expressed in various ways, but in its simplest sense it is a measure of how much warmer the Earth becomes for a given doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. This is well known for the Pleistocene, and especially the past 800,000 years of Earth history, a period for which we have detailed temperature reconstructions and carbon dioxide records derived from bubbles of gas trapped in ancient ice cores.  During that time, across several ice ages, the planet’s climate sensitivity showed warming of about 2.5-3°C for a doubling of carbon dioxide, which falls in the middle of the range of predictions given by models. Ice core records, however, extend back no more than a million years, and this time period is generally characterised by colder climates than those of today. If we want to explore climate sensitivity on a warmer planet, we must look further back into Earth history, to times such as the Pliocene. Reconstructing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations without relying on ice cores is admittedly more challenging. Instead of directly measuring the concentration of carbon dioxide in gas bubbles, we must rely on indirect records. For example, carbon dioxide concentration influences the number of stomata (pores) on plant leaves, and this can be measured on the fossils of ancient leaves. Alternatively, there are a number of geochemical tools based on how carbon dioxide affects the pH of seawater, or how algae take up carbon dioxide as they photosynthesise – these are recorded in the chemical composition of ancient fossils. These means of drawing estimates come with larger margins of error, but they still provide key insights into climate sensitivity on a warmer Earth. Recent research indicates that these various carbon dioxide estimates of Pliocene carbon dioxide levels are converging, giving added confidence from which to derive estimates of climate sensitivity. In particular, it seems an increase of carbon dioxide from about 280ppm (equivalent to that before the industrial revolution) to about 400ppm in the Pliocene resulted in an Earth warmer by 2°C. Taking into account other factors, this suggests a climate sensitivity of about 3°C, which confirms both the Pleistocene and model-based estimates. It also suggests that we have yet to experience the full consequences of the greenhouse gases already added to the atmosphere, let alone those we are still putting into it. So then, what was this much warmer world like? First of all, it was not an inhospitable planet – plants and animals thrived. This should not be a surprise – in fact, the Earth was much warmer even further back into the past. The changes in the climate we are inducing is a problem for us humans, and for our societies, not the planet we’re on. However, the Pliocene was a rather different world. For example – relevant considering current events in Britain – higher global temperatures were associated with a climate that was also wetter than at present. That provides important corroborating evidence for models that predict a warmer and wetter future.  Perhaps most striking, sea level appears to have been between 10 to 40 metres  higher than today, indicating that both the Greenland Ice Sheet and Antarctic Ice Sheet were markedly smaller. To put that into context, the Met Office has already commented on how flooding in the UK has been affected by sea level rise of 12cm over the last 100 years, and will be exacerbated further by another 5-7cm by 2030. We must be careful in how we extract climate lessons from the geological record, and that is particularly true when we consider ice sheet behaviour. One widely discussed concept is ice sheet hysteresis.  This is a fancy way of saying that due to feedback mechanisms, it could be easier to build an ice sheet on Greenland or Antarctica than it is to melt one. If hysteresis is a force stabilising our current ice sheets, then it may be that a planet with today’s carbon dioxide levels of 400 ppm will not necessarily have a sea level 20 metres higher than that of today – as it was during the Pliocene. On the other hand if hysteresis is rather weak, then the question is not whether we will see such a massive sea level change, but how long it will take to arrive (probably hundreds or even thousands of years). Most importantly, the collective research into Earth history, including the Pliocene, reveals that Earth’s climate can and has changed. It also reveals that climate does not just change randomly: it changes when forced in ways that are relatively well understood – one of these is the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. And consequently, there is little doubt from Earth’s history that transforming fossil carbon underground into carbon dioxide in the air – as we are doing today – will significantly affect the climate we experience for the forseeable future. Professor Rich Pancost gives a public lecture on how biogeochemical cycles have regulated the global climate system throughout Earth’s history today, February 25th, in Bristol. The event is free and open to all."
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump is barreling into a confrontation with the courts barely two weeks after taking office, foreshadowing years of legal battles as an administration determined to disrupt the existing order presses the boundaries of executive power. Lawyers for the administration were ordered to submit a brief on Monday defending Mr. Trump’s order temporarily banning refugees from around the world and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. An appeals court in California refused on Sunday to reinstate the ban after a lower court blocked it. As people from the countries targeted by Mr. Trump struggled to make their way to the United States while they could, the president for the second day in a row expressed rage at the judge in the case, this time accusing him of endangering national security. Vice President Mike Pence defended the president’s tone, but lawyers and lawmakers of both parties said Mr. Trump’s comments reflected a lack of respect for the constitutional system of checks and balances. Late in the day, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to   blame the judge and the judiciary for what the president suggested would be a future terrorist attack. “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” Mr. Trump wrote, a day after referring to the “  judge” in the case. “If something happens blame him and court system. ” Even before the latest post, Republicans joined Democrats in chiding him. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said it was “best not to single out judges. ” “We all get disappointed from time to time,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union. ” “I think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually. ” The White House offered no evidence for Mr. Trump’s suggestion that potential terrorists would now pour over the border because of the judge’s order. Since Sept. 11, 2001, no American has been killed in a terrorist attack on American soil by anyone who immigrated from any of the seven countries named in Mr. Trump’s order. The impassioned debate over the immigration order brought to the fore issues at the heart of the Trump presidency. A businessman with no experience in public office, Mr. Trump has shown in his administration’s opening days that he favors an   approach with little regard for the two other branches of government. While Congress, controlled by Republicans, has deferred, the judiciary may emerge as the major obstacle for Mr. Trump. Democrats and some Republicans said Mr. Trump’s attack on the courts would color the battle over the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court as well as the president’s relationship with Congress. Other presidents have clashed with the judiciary. The Supreme Court invalidated parts of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, forced Richard M. Nixon to turn over Watergate tapes and rejected Bill Clinton’s bid to delay a sexual harassment lawsuit. The last two presidents battled with courts repeatedly over the limits of their power. The judiciary ruled that George W. Bush overstepped his bounds in denying due process to terrorism suspects and that Barack Obama assumed power he did not have to allow millions of unauthorized immigrants to stay in the country. Charles Fried, solicitor general under Ronald Reagan, said the ruling by a Federal District Court in Washington State blocking Mr. Trump’s order resembled a ruling by a Texas district court stopping Mr. Obama from proceeding with his own immigration order. But rarely, if ever, has a president this early in his tenure, and with such personal invective, battled the courts. Mr. Trump, Mr. Fried said, is turning everything into “a soap opera” with overheated attacks on the judge. “There are no lines for him,” said Mr. Fried, who teaches at Harvard Law School and voted against Mr. Trump. “There is no notion of, this is inappropriate, this is indecent, this is unpresidential. ” Other Republicans brushed off the attacks, noting that judges have lifetime tenure that protects them from criticism. But even some Republicans said Mr. Trump’s order raised valid legal questions for the courts. “If I were in the White House, I’d feel better about my position if the ban or moratorium or whatever you call it were based on an actual attack or threat,” former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, who served under Mr. Bush, said in an interview. Still, he said, when it comes to noncitizens overseas, “the executive has enjoyed great deference from the courts. ” Judge James Robart, a Federal District Court judge in Seattle appointed by Mr. Bush, on Friday issued a nationwide suspension of Mr. Trump’s order while its legality was debated. The administration quickly asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to overrule the judge, but it refused early Sunday and instead ordered the government to file a brief on Monday. The quick briefing schedule indicated that the appeals court could issue a ruling on the merits of the president’s order within days. In the meantime, refugees vetted by the government can proceed to the United States, as can any travelers with approved visas from the seven targeted nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Still, widespread confusion and anger were reported at overseas airports on Sunday. Unsure which orders to follow, airlines stopped even some of the people named in the lawsuits who were technically cleared to come to the country, according to a government official. The assertion of broad latitude by the president in areas of national security resembles the struggles of the Bush years, when in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks the administration claimed sometimes sweeping power in the name of fighting terrorism. Jack Goldsmith, who as head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under Mr. Bush argued that some of the initial orders went too far and forced them to be rolled back, said on Sunday that there were similarities. “But Bush’s legal directives were not as sloppy as Trump’s,” he said. “And Trump’s serial attacks on judges and the judiciary take us into new territory. The sloppiness and aggressiveness of the directives, combined with the attacks on judges, put extra pressure on judges to rule against Trump. ” This was not the first time Mr. Trump has castigated a judge who ruled against him. As a candidate last year, Mr. Trump asserted that Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, who was presiding over a fraud lawsuit by former students of Trump University, had a conflict of interest because his family was of Mexican heritage and he therefore would be biased because of Mr. Trump’s promise to build a border wall. Such comments from a sitting president, however, were unusual and triggered consternation in the legal community. Bartholomew J. Dalton, the president of the American College of Trial Lawyers, called Mr. Trump’s “insulting language” inappropriate. “It is wrong for the chief executive of the executive branch to demean a member of the judiciary with such language,” Mr. Dalton said in a statement. “This undermines judicial independence, which is the backbone to our constitutional democracy. ” Senators of both parties appearing on Sunday talk shows concurred. “I’ll be honest, I don’t understand language like that,” Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said on “This Week” on ABC. “We don’t have   judges. We don’t have   senators. We don’t have   presidents. We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. ” “The president is not a dictator,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, said on “Fox News Sunday. ” “The framers of our Constitution wanted a strong Congress for the very reason that most of these kinds of things should be done within the scope of lawmaking. This is done within the scope of executive power. ” It fell to Mr. Pence to defend Mr. Trump. “Well, look, the president of the United States has every right to criticize the other two branches of government. And we have a long tradition of that in this country,” he said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “The judge’s actions in this case,” he added, “making decisions about American foreign policy and national security, it’s just very frustrating to the president, to our whole administration, to millions of Americans who want to see judges that will uphold the law and recognize the authority the president of the United States has under the Constitution to manage who comes into this country. ”"
"The number of endangered bird species is rising and even with our best intentions, there isn’t enough money to save them all – so how do we decide which species we should let go?  A new approach has been pioneered by a collaboration of universities that could provide a method to decide how limited conservation funds should be spent. The technique uses genetics to ascertain how many relatives a bird species has, evolutionarily speaking, with the aim of identifying and prioritising species that demonstrate the most genetic uniqueness for conservation efforts, rather than simply those that are few in number. It could be argued that we shouldn’t have to do this at all. We could petition governments and funding organisations to spend more money to stop the ongoing loss of biodiversity right now. But conservation will always be less important than societal needs such as health care, and this means we have to conserve species efficiently.  So we have to assign species some value, to help us decide which ones to save. We might value species by their benefit to humans as ecosystem services providers (for example bees and pollination), their charismatic value (pandas and tigers) or their importance for ecological processes (elephants felling trees). The problem is that we don’t really know in a directly measurable way the value of a species ecologically or economically.  It has long been argued that we can use the evolutionary history, or phylogeny, of a species to capture their uniqueness and value. Phylogenies show how species are related to one another – they are the evolutionary equivalent of family trees. By examining phylogenetic trees we can see whether a species has many or few close relatives.  Most species have lots of close relatives and are not very distinct. For example, the greenfinch (Carduelis chloris), a familiar garden bird, has many close relatives and is ranked at 7909 on the list of evolutionary distinct birds. But any phylogenetic tree will usually have a small number of species whose closest relatives diverged many hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago and who now have very few recent relatives. These are the species that are termed the most evolutionarily distinct. Keeping this concept in mind, we looked at every bird species – 10,000, in total – and found out how genetically isolated they were from each other. We used a measure called evolutionary distinctness (ED). A species that is highly distinct has few evolutionary relatives and is genetically distinct. A species that scores low on the distinctness scale will have many relatives and will have a common genetic make-up. Less genetic biodiversity will be lost if these species go extinct. In fact, if highly distinct species become extinct we risk losing entire branches from the phylogenetic tree of birds, and with that we lose important ecological functions (such as pollination by nectar-feeding hummingbirds or seed dispersal by fruit-eating waxwings) and large amounts of our evolutionary heritage. For instance, our most evolutionary distinct bird is the Oilbird (Steatornis caripensis) of northern South America, which has almost 80 million years of unique evolutionary history. There is simply nothing quite like it.  But identifying those most distinct species is just a first step. A challenge for conservationists is not just to identify which species to save, but where and how to save them. In our study we show that the measure “evolutionary distinctness” can be combined with information about the size and placement of species’ ranges to generate a means to efficiently protect them, and the evolutionary history that lies within their genes. If we can identify those areas containing species that are both highly distinct and are restricted to occurring only in those regions, then it makes sense to target conservation efforts there. Despite being a goal of conservation biologists for more than 20 years, the technique of identifying the most evolutionarily distinct species has only slowly been incorporated into real world conservation. But things are beginning to change – the Zoological Society of London’s Edge of Existence programme now ranks species by combining their evolutionary distinctness with the level of threat to their survival. And this concept is not just limited to birds; with the amount of genetic data available –  and initiatives such as the Map of Life project making geographical data accessible – we can expand the scope to many other groups of organisms.  Using evolutionary information is just one way to value species for conservation, but there are many practical challenges that lie between the recommendations the technique suggests and conservation decisions made on the ground. Our work can be seen as one step along the road of making better decisions that fully encapsulate species’ ecological, evolutionary and social value, alongside practical aspects such as financial cost and future environmental threats. This way we can ensure the future survival of the species we cannot afford to lose."
"**Mass street rallies in Puerto Rico have been triggered by text messages between Governor Ricardo RossellÃ³ and his team, leaked on 13 July.**
They contained sexist and homophobic comments including references to Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin's sexuality.
But long before this, public anger was boiling over alleged corruption.
Gov RossellÃ³ now says he will not stand for re-election next year, but this is unlikely to satisfy protesters in a US territory who want him to resign.
On Monday, demonstrators blocked the main road in the capital San Juan, in what was expected to be the biggest rally in 10 days of protests.
Obtained by Puerto Rico's Centre for Investigative Journalism, the text messages span some 900 pages. They were from a group chat that included the governor and 11 of his aides and cabinet members.
The messages include jokes about Hurricane Maria victims along with sexist and homophobic comments. Nearly 3,000 people were killed when the hurricane hit the island in 2017. However a Harvard estimate puts the toll at more than 4,600.
In one conversation, Christian Sobrino, then chief fiscal officer of Puerto Rico, says he is ""salivating to shoot"" San Juan Mayor Carmen YulÃ­n Cruz. Ms Cruz has criticised the governor in the past.
Mr RossellÃ³ replies: ""You'd be doing me a grand favour.""
Another message from Mr Sobrino describes singer Ricky Martin as a ""male chauvinist"" before referring to his homosexuality.
Mr RossellÃ³ has apologised for the messages and said he respected the right to protest peacefully. He has also vowed to provide greater transparency and accountability to his government.
Mr Sobrino and Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin resigned following the leak.
A statement from White House spokesman Judd Deere said the events ""prove the president's concerns about mismanagement, politicisation and corruption have been valid"".
Major figures have come out in support of the protesters. Ricky Martin led a protest to the governor's house on Wednesday.
The singer said in a video on Twitter: ""They mocked our dead, they mocked women, they mocked the LGBT community, they made fun of people with physical and mental disabilities, they made fun of obesity. It's enough. This cannot be.""
Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda has shared images of the protests in Puerto Rico and attended a demonstration in New York.
Reggaeton artist Bad Bunny has stopped his European tour to return to Puerto Rico and protest. He praised the ""bravery"" of people on the island.
Puerto Rico has been a US territory since 1898. Everyone born on the island is an American citizen and holds a US passport. However they cannot vote in US presidential elections unless they are registered in one of the 50 US states.
Mr RossellÃ³ promised to push for the island to become a state during his election campaign in 2016.
He has faced criticism for his handling of efforts to recover from from Hurricane Maria.
The island is also in the midst of a financial crisis and has billions of dollars in debt."

Since failures in climate science claims are on the rise, can we start naming climate prediction failures after scientists and activists? I can think of  a few: The Hansen Hiatus, for example.
Climate campaigners seem to think they have a winner with this takedown of elected officials who reject global warming science, in which fake news reports talk of the turmoil and tragedy created by Hurricane Marco Rubio, Hurricane James Inhofe, Hurricane John Boehner and more.
The trouble is, the science on a connection between hurricanes and global warming is going in the opposite direction, if the near-final draft of next month’s climate science assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is any indication.

What? Polar bears are out on that disappearing sea ice in late summer?
To put all this into perspective, note that research in this region between 2000 and 2005 determined that, on average, only 3.7% of all Southern Beaufort polar bears spent time on land between mid-September and the end of October (Schliebe et al. 2008). As the estimated total population at that time was 1,526 bears (and still is), it means that on average, only about 56 bears spent time on land each summer in the early 2000s.
See Susan Crockford’s blog: Ten out of ten polar bears being tracked this summer in the Beaufort Sea are on the ice

A paper published today in Nature finds that marine algae, which evolved and thrived with atmospheric CO2 levels 15 times higher than the present, required a novel adaptation to adjust to the relatively low CO2 levels during the Cenozoic era, when CO2 levels were still more than twice current levels. According to the paper, this novel adaptation was to manufacture their own CO2 at the reaction site for photosynthesis, required due to a paucity of CO2 in the atmosphere. Algae evolved more than 500 million years ago, when CO2 levels were ~15-17 times higher than the present; current CO2 levels are near the lowest levels of the past 500 million years.

Rowers give up. Another “save the planet from global warming” Arctic trek gets a reality check from Nature:
Severe weather conditions hindered our early progress and now ice chokes the passage ahead.
Our ice router Victor has been very clear in what lies ahead. He writes, “Just to give you the danger of ice situation at the eastern Arctic, Eef Willems of “Tooluka” (NED) pulled out of the game and returning to Greenland. At many Eastern places of NWP locals have not seen this type ice conditions. Residents of Resolute say 20 years have not seen anything like. Its, ice, ice and more ice. Larsen, Peel, Bellot, Regent and Barrow Strait are all choked. That is the only route to East. Already West Lancaster received -2C temperature expecting -7C on Tuesday with the snow.”
Richard Weber, my teammate to the South Pole in 2009 and without doubt the most accomplished polar skier alive today, is owner and operator of Arctic Watch on Cunningham Inlet at the northern end of Somerset Island. Arctic Watch faces out onto our proposed eastern route. Richard dropped me a note the other day advising: “This has been the coldest season with the most ice since we started Arctic Watch in 2000. Almost no whales. The NWPassage is still blocked with ice. Some of the bays still have not melted!”
…we’d require at least another 50-60 days to make it to Pond Inlet. Throw in the issues of less light, colder temperatures, harsher fall storms and lots of ice blocking the route and our decision is easy.
…Our message remains unaffected though, bringing awareness to the pressing issues of climate change in the arctic.
We row into Cambridge Bay, the official conclusion of our Mainstream Last First expedition – MainStream Last First
Despite that admission of failure due to so much ice, readers are hard pressed to find many pictures of it in their photo stream: http://www.flickr.com/photos/95019072@N08/
I suppose showing pictures of ice is counter-productive to their mission, since like many fools before them, they expected the Arctic to be mostly ice free due to global warming. – Anthony

Uh, oh
New paper finds cloud assumptions in climate models could be incorrect by factor of 2
More problems for climate models: A new paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres finds that models must take into account not only the presence or absence of clouds but also how clouds are stacked vertically. The authors find that changes in vertical stacking of clouds can change radiative forcing assumptions by a factor of two [100%]. However, state of the art climate models do not take vertical stacking into consideration, and most global datasets of cloudiness also do not contain this information. “Clouds, which can absorb or reflect incoming radiation and affect the amount of radiation escaping from Earth’s atmosphere, remain the greatest source of uncertainty in global climate modeling,” and according to this paper, that uncertainty has just doubled from what was previously thought.

Why the forthcoming UN IPCC Report is already toast
The IPCC is set to release its latest Assessment Report 5 [AR5] in about 1 month, yet the report will be dead on arrival and hopelessly out-of-date in light of recent inconvenient peer-reviewed papers published after the cut-off date for inclusion, as well as papers published before the cut-off date which the UN continues to ignore. Since almost the entire report hinges on the output of climate models, and those models have recently been falsified at a confidence level of >98% over the past 15 years, and falsified at a confidence level of 90% over the past 20 years, the entire report and its Summary for Policymakers are already invalidated even before publication.

Michael Mann can’t be happy about this work.
Here’s a chat with two authors of an important new Science paper examining 10,000 years of layered fossil plankton in the western Pacific Ocean. The paper finds that several significant past climate ups and downs — including the medieval warm period and little ice age — were global in scope, challenging some previous conclusions that these were fairly limited Northern Hemisphere phenomena.
(video follows, an interview with authors)

The study finds that the rise in ocean temperatures in recent decades is far faster than anything seen earlier in the Holocene, the period since the end of the last ice age. But the researchers say that this rise is from a relatively cool baseline. Between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago, at depths between 500 and 1,000 meters, the Pacific Ocean was 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than today. (text from the video description)

Pacific Ocean Heat Content During the Past 10,000 Years
Yair Rosenthal, Braddock K. Linsley, Delia W. Oppo
Abstract:
Observed increases in ocean heat content (OHC) and temperature are robust indicators of global warming during the past several decades. We used high-resolution proxy records from sediment cores to extend these observations in the Pacific 10,000 years beyond the instrumental record. We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer by 2.1 ± 0.4°C and 1.5 ± 0.4°C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both water masses were ~0.9°C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65° warmer than in recent decades. Although documented changes in global surface temperatures during the Holocene and Common era are relatively small, the concomitant changes in OHC are large.

"No one was ready for 2020. None of us was really prepared for the bushfires, or coronavirus, or the fear and uncertainty about what these crises mean for our families and our lives. At Guardian Australia, we weren’t either. Along with the ongoing climate emergency, these have been the biggest stories and the greatest reporting responsibilities of our generation. They hit as we were already under pressure, from the digital platforms eating away at our advertising revenue, and from the populist forces – all the way up to the president of the United States – who want to undermine facts and truthfulness as the parameters of a civic conversation, eroding the very foundations of what we do. Like everyone – from frontline health workers to the cafe owners with no customers – we adapted. I scrambled to figure out how to lead a news organisation via Zoom from a desk in the corner of my bedroom. Reporters conducted interviews online or shouted questions from across the street to the newly unemployed on the Centrelink queues that were suddenly snaking along city blocks. We thought hard about how best to serve our readers who we knew were scared and potentially overwhelmed by information. From kitchen tables and home offices and makeshift bedroom desks across the country we ran a seven-days-a-week live blog to keep pace with the rapidly changing story, and used summaries, explainers and a data tracker to give readers quick access to the information they needed. We tried to avoid the sensational, to stay focused on facts. We questioned what we were told. We found new ways to talk to readers, Zoom-facilitated book clubs, and roundups of all the joy available online when our worlds contracted to our homes. Meanwhile, the economic impact of the virus so exacerbated the financial squeeze on media businesses that some were forced to close and most of us had to cut costs. It was a pandemic paradox – readership of most news sites soared, ours grew by 104% to reach 11.6 million Australians in March – but newsrooms kept closing, especially in the regions. At least 500 Australian journalists are likely to lose their jobs this year, according to the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, on top of the 3,000 or more jobs lost over the past decade. But the crises also demonstrated why factual news is indispensable and how information can save lives and soothe uncertainties. Readers showed that they value what we do with their attention and also with their wallets. Most mastheads reported increases in subscriptions. At Guardian Australia, where readers are asked for voluntary contributions so our reporting remains open rather than paywalled, reader contributions went a long way to addressing the ad revenue decline. Now we emerge from lockdown with even more questions to ask than before, and more urgent solutions to discuss. Surely Australia cannot continue without a credible national policy to address global heating? Having accepted that unemployment benefits were insufficient for those made unemployed during the Covid-19 crisis, how can they possibly revert to levels below the poverty line? Since scientific advice served us so well during the pandemic, surely policymakers should continue to heed it? And no, we haven’t forgotten sports rorts or the need to hold governments accountable for their decisions and their spending. With fewer journalists to ask those questions, the ABC facing funding cuts, a commercial media industry ownership more concentrated than ever, and vast tracts of Australia with no reporters at all, we need to step up. Studies in the US have shown that when factual local news disappears readers can turn to more partisan and polarising alternatives. We can’t let the news vacuum in Australia be filled by shrill voices trying to find an audience with climate denialism and confected culture wars. Scrutiny and accountability cannot be abandoned. We set up Guardian Australia seven years ago to create a new independent, influential source of reliable Australian news because we believed a diversity of news voices was something a healthy democracy needed. That need is now bigger than before and, with the support of our readers, we intend to find a way to meet it. The vicissitudes of 2020 prove, once again, that the alternative is unthinkable. • Guardian Australia has set a goal of growing its community to 150,000 supporters. Become a supporter with a contribution of any size or share this article with family and friends to help us reach our goal. Thank you"
"Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is the biggest threat to the livestock industry in England and Wales. At present, bovine TB is still not under control in parts of these countries, and there is no single measure that on its own is likely to change the situation dramatically. Vaccination of cattle or badgers, or both, could make a contribution to TB control. At present, the most likely vaccine for tackling bovine TB is Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG), but this does not guarantee full protection and vaccinated humans and animals can still be infected and develop disease.  Limited field studies underpinned by essential laboratory studies using colonies of captive badgers and cattle have demonstrated that vaccinating badgers and cattle with BCG can reduce the progression, severity and excretion of bovine TB, which should reduce the risk of infection and transmission of the disease.     The only TB vaccine specifically for badgers, BadgerBCG, was licensed by the UK Veterinary Medicines Directorate in 2010. After 10 years of studies by the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) and the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), laboratory tests demonstrated that it significantly reduced the severity and excretion of infection. Results of a four-year field study confirmed these results, and also revealed an indirect effect: non-vaccinated cubs captured were significantly less likely to test positive to TB when more members of their group had been previously vaccinated. The groups with the highest levels of vaccination consistently had the strongest indirect effect. BadgerBCG is currently being used in the 288km2 intensive Action Area in Wales funded by the Welsh Government, and in parts of England, including a Government funded Badger Vaccine Deployment Project (BVDP) in a 100km2 area of Gloucestershire. The aim of the BVDP is to study the practicalities of deploying an injectable vaccine, to train those who wish to vaccinate badgers, and to build farmer’s confidence in the vaccine. Defra supports the use of badger vaccination along with culling as components of a wider package of measures in England to address bovine TB. The vaccine is also being used by a range of lay vaccinators in England who have been trained and licensed. But vaccinating badgers with BadgerBCG means having to trap the animals, which is difficult, time-consuming and expensive. Providing a vaccine that can be deployed in bait to be eaten is the best prospect for vaccinating large numbers of badgers over a wide geographical area. It may also prove cheaper – but there is no oral badger vaccine that’s ready to be used.  So while vaccinating badgers against bovine TB should result in reduced infection rates in cattle, there is no direct evidence for this. Computer modelling indicates that sustained badger vaccination campaigns could lower TB incidence in cattle, but by precisely how much in reality isn’t known. BCG in cattle has been examined experimentally and in a field study in Ethiopia. The results indicated that around 60% of vaccinated animals would be protected, but as with other species, use of BCG in cattle would provide a spectrum of protection – some animals being partially protected and a few not responding at all. Before we have a BCG vaccine that’s UK licensed for use in cattle, field trials must be conducted in the UK. Vaccinating cattle against bTB is prohibited under EU legislation. This is because vaccinated animals can react positively to the tuberculin skin-test, and so cannot be differentiated from infected cattle during the current test-and-slaughter control programme using bovine tuberculin. Different tests will be required, and work is underway to develop the most promising. The redrafting of the EU Animal Health Legislation also potentially offers an opportunity to make the necessary changes to the legislation to permit their use. Vaccinating cattle alone is not a panacea, and as long as the possibility of reinfection from badgers remains, it is likely to only reduce rather than eliminate TB from British livestock. So to be most effective, cattle vaccination needs to be used alongside other control measures, such as the test and slaughter of cattle and control of disease in badgers. An oral badger vaccine and a vaccine for cattle are expensive tools to develop and there is no guarantee that they will reach market. Best estimates put it at 2019 for an oral badger vaccine and EU acceptance of a cattle vaccine by 2023 at the earliest. We persist nonetheless, as the vaccination of badgers or cattle – while unlikely to be single solutions to the problem – are important components of what must be a comprehensive, multi-faceted programme to ultimately eradicate the disease."
"Boris Johnson is to set out a “new deal” for jobs and infrastructure on Tuesday, painting himself as a “Rooseveltian” prime minister lifting Britain out of the biggest recession in centuries, and a pledge to use the coronavirus crisis to tackle unresolved challenges such as health, education and regional inequalities. “To that end, we will build build build,” he is expected to say. “Build back better, build back greener, build back faster, and to do that at the pace that this moment requires.  However, his promise to “build back greener” was greeted with dismay by environmental experts, who were concerned that the climate crisis receives scant attention in what the government is revealing so far of its plans. Most of the spending announcements will focus on the NHS, education and improvements for town centres. There will be £100m for roads and £10m for rail in Manchester, as well as £900m on unspecified “shovel-ready” local growth projects in England. Tree-planting is set for a boost, with Johnson re-affirming plans to plant more than 75,000 acres a year by 2025, with £40m for local conservation projects creating 3,000 jobs and safeguarding 2,000. Ed Matthew, of the Climate Coalition, said: “The only thing Rooseveltian about this plan is that it belongs in the fossil fuel age. There is very little announced today which will do anything to accelerate the transition to a zero carbon economy. The prime minister has to back up his rhetoric on a green recovery with action to prioritise green investment. Future generations will not forgive a government that fails to use this opportunity to build a safer climate for us all.” Tanya Steele, chief executive of conservation group WWF, added: “We are in the midst of a climate and nature crisis, and these lukewarm plans address only part of our nation’s much-needed recovery. The prime minister is out of touch with the scale of the challenges.” Calls for a green recovery have been gathering steam, with economists, businesses, healthcare professionals, creative industries and the government’s own advisers all making the case for one. Johnson is making his speech in the Midlands on Tuesday morning, while thousands of people are expected to gather online for a “mass virtual lobby” of parliament to discuss the potential for a green recovery. “Thousands of people are participating in the first ever virtual lobby of parliament on the day of this speech, calling for a green recovery,” said Matthew. “They will not be impressed.” Missing from the prime minister’s speech were much-trailed plans to boost energy efficiency through a national programme of home insulation, which was a £9.2bn Conservative manifesto pledge. The UK has the most inefficient housing stock in Europe, and renovating draughty homes would reduce people’s energy bills, improve living conditions, and cut carbon emissions. However, a report in the Financial Times suggested Dominic Cummings was against the programme. “If they can’t be trusted to deliver on their biggest climate pledge in their manifesto, what manifesto pledge can they be trusted to deliver?” asked Matthew. “If the government fails to deliver on this pledge, their climate credentials will be in shreds.” Environmental experts are also concerned that without a green recovery strategy in place, and without clear low-carbon directives, the prime minister’s call to “build build build” will result in high-carbon infrastructure being locked in. Steele said: “To avoid catastrophe, we need a low-carbon nature-powered recovery, not one weighed down by tarmac and concrete. This is another missed opportunity – and we don’t have many chances left.” The National Infrastructure Strategy, which is supposed to set out plans on key environmental issues such as energy networks, transport, flood defences and waste, has now been put off to the autumn, having been already delayed in March’s budget. The UK is in the international spotlight as host of the UN climate summit, Cop26, which has been delayed by a year from its original date of this November. Small developing nations in particular are looking to the UK for leadership at the summit, intended to revitalise the Paris agreement of 2015. Businesses have also called for a green recovery, with hundreds joining in events for the London Climate Week this week. David Smith, chief executive of the Energy Networks Association, said: “Jobs, skills and infrastructure are core to the UK’s green recovery. The networks are ready to support this growth with shovel-ready projects across the length and breadth of the country, projects which will themselves provide the backbone to our country’s net zero [carbon emissions] future.” Fatima Ibrahim, co-executive director of the Build Back Better coalition of groups calling for a green recovery, said: “The prime minister is completely right to call for a ‘New Deal’ for the UK, because he knows that Britain wants a change. But, as ever, the proof is in the details and despite the loud and proud rhetoric of a “positively Rooseveltian” economic stimulus, certain aspects of the £5bn stimulus package are just prepackaged proposals that show no concern nor plan for decarbonising the UK economy. This is deeply concerning for the millions of us that want to create a green, fair and strong economy off the back of this crisis.”"
"**United States President Donald Trump has disputed official findings that nearly 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of last year's hurricane.**
He added that the death toll had been inflated by adding people who died of other causes.
""If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them on to the list,"" he tweeted.
So is he correct to say this figure is wrong?
Nearly every study and report into the hurricane estimates a significantly higher toll than the early official estimates mentioned by the president.
The number of nearly 3,000 was released last month after an independent study by the George Washington University (GWU) in July, which was commissioned by the governor of Puerto Rico.
It found that 2,975 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria.
Since the hurricane struck in September last year, several investigations by academics and journalists suggested the death toll was much higher than the official count, which for months stayed at 64.
For the first few weeks, the death toll was only put at 16.
The task of counting the dead immediately after or in the months following a major disaster is not an exact science.
There are also no state or federal guidelines in the US for calculating storm or hurricane-related deaths.
The GWU study concluded the initial death toll only included those killed directly by hurricanes Maria and Irma - either by drowning, flying debris or building collapse.
GWU researchers also counted those who died in the six months following as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water.
The key part of the research is an estimate of ""excess mortality"" from September 2017 to February 2018.
Put simply, this is the difference between the predicted normal death rate if the hurricane had not struck (estimated using historical data), and the actual death rate for the period afterwards.
The researchers also factored in migration away from Puerto Rico in the wake of the storms.
""Overall, we estimate that 40% of municipalities experienced significantly higher mortality in the study period than in the comparable period of the previous two years.""
One important issue the GWU study raises is the process of recording deaths after the hurricane.
""Most physicians receive no formal training in death certificate completion, in particular in a disaster,"" it states.
Some of those they interviewed showed a reluctance to record deaths as hurricane-related.
The report also points to major communication and infrastructure problems which delayed the relaying of important information about health issues and procedures for recording deaths.
""Physician unawareness of appropriate death certification practices.... and the government of Puerto Rico's lack of communication about the death certificate process...substantially limited the count of deaths related to MarÃ­a.""
Head of statistics for BBC News, Robert Cuffe, describes the GWU report as ""comprehensive"".
He says it is more robust than an earlier study by Harvard University that concluded there could be a death toll ranging anywhere from 793 to 8,498.
Most media reporting of that study used the midway figure of 4,645 ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above what would be expected for the period from 20 September to 31 December 2017.
However, the Harvard researchers pointed out they were not giving a precise figure, and that there was an element of uncertainty in their estimates.
Mr Cuffe adds: ""Can we say that every extra death that happened up to six months after the hurricane was caused by it? Not definitively.
""Some extra people will have died of old age earlier than they would have if there'd been no hurricane.""
But does that mean the hurricane killed them?

"**The governor of Puerto Rico is facing calls to resign over a group text message scandal that has already caused two top officials to leave their posts.**
Governor Ricardo RossellÃ³'s leaked text conversations with members of his administration revealed sexist, profane and homophobic comments.
Protests began after the Center for Investigative Journalism published over 800 pages of texts on Saturday.
Mr RossellÃ³, who is up for re-election in 2020, has said he will not resign.
The governor of the US commonwealth, who leads the New Progressive Party, said in a radio interview that he might re-think his re-election bid next year, NBC News reported.
Local lawmakers, activists and advocacy groups have called on Mr RossellÃ³ to resign over the messages, which some say has damaged Puerto Rico's reputation.
Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin and Chief Financial Officer Christian Sobrino, two officials involved in the chat, resigned over the weekend.
The secretaries of the interior and public affairs, along with the former finance secretary, the governor's legal adviser and several non-public officials were other participants.
Dating from the end of last year to 20 January, the texts contain derogatory comments against women, political opponents and journalists as well as privileged information and instructions regarding public policy matters, according to the Puerto Rico Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI).
The BBC has not independently verified the texts.
In one message, the governor jokes with Mr Sobrino about shooting San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz.
Mr RossellÃ³ also used profanity when discussing the federal oversight group working on Puerto Rico's debt crisis. Puerto Rican pop star Ricky Martin was also referenced in a homophobic remark.
The governor has claimed the memes and jokes were ""done on people's personal time"", and while he was working stressful 18-hour days.
Mr RossellÃ³ said in a statement on Saturday: ""I was elected by the people and I will continue the mission that was granted to me, now more than ever.""
Ricky Martin tweeted that Mr RossellÃ³'s remarks were ""shameful and unacceptable"" and could not be resolved with an apology.
He called for the governor to give up his office as ""an act of true generosity"" for Puerto Rico, saying: ""We cannot allow our Puerto Rico to stay in the hands of such 'leaders.'""
This latest scandal comes as two other former top government officials from Mr RossellÃ³'s administration were among a group arrested last week and charged with conspiracy and fraud, involving millions in federal funding.
And Puerto Rico is still recovering from Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017 and claimed thousands of lives. Mr RossellÃ³ has faced criticism for his handling of the recovery efforts.
The commonwealth is also in the midst of a financial crisis with billions of dollars in debt."
"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination.**
Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out.
The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs.
Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff.
But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted.
A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported.
The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people.
The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday.
Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored.
Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales.
The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better.""
There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it.
But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different.
When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it.
From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000.
That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted.
Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first.
This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital.
It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it.
While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""
Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable.
The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK:
Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now.
It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available.
NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"".
But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation.
""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty.
The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government.
Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021.
Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue.
The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose.
Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group.
The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said.
The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut.
Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.
Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp.
""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today.""
The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing.
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice.
Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours.
Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed:
The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"".

Shocker: Global Warming Kneejerker Admits It


Posted on July 30, 2013 2:20 pm by Bill Quick


You can go wading in the lake at the North Pole – Boing Boing
At Climate Central, Andrew Freedman provides some really fascinating context that illustrates the changing nature of, well, nature … and draws a big, heavy underline on how difficult it can be to make assumptions about what is and what isn’t an effect of climate change. Arctic sea ice is melting in concert with rising global average temperatures, but (contrary to the knee-jerk assumption I made about this story) the lake at the North Pole may or may not have anything to do with that.
What? Global warming true believers making knee-jerk assumptions? Perish the thought.
Kudos for owning up, though.   http://www.dailypundit.com/?p=74441

National Geographic: You Know, James Hansen Just Might be a Bit of a Chicken Little
Don’t look now, global warmists, but National Geographic just put some science to one of James Hansen’s most outlandish claims.
In his book Storms of my Grandchildren, noted climate scientist James Hansen issued the following warning: “[I]f we burn all reserves of oil, gas, and coal, there is a substantial chance we will initiate the runaway greenhouse. If we also burn the tar sands and tar shale, I believe the Venus syndrome is a dead certainty.”
Keep your eyes on the ball here. Hansen doesn’t give us a number, but does say that Earth stands a “substantial chance” of going hot like Venus and burning off all our oceans if we were to burn up all of our reserves of oil, gas and goal.
What’s a “substantial chance?” And does it matter that Venus is only 67 million miles from the Sun, while Earth is 93 million miles from the Sun?
You’d think it would. It does.

Respected as Hansen is, the argument hasn’t convinced climate scientists who specialize in the evolution of planetary atmospheres. During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), 56 million years ago, a huge natural spike in CO2 sent temperatures on Earth soaring—but life went on and the ocean remained intact.
“I think you can say we’re still safe against the Venus syndrome,” says Raymond Pierrehumbert of the University of Chicago. “If we were going to run away, we’d probably have done it during the PETM.”

Maybe Hansen shouldn’t be so respected. I know from my years at NASA that among the staff who worked nearest him at the Goddard Space Flight Center and had to deal directly with him, he wasn’t.

Tamsin Edwards: Climate scientists must not advocate particular policies
I became a climate scientist because I care about the environment, but we have a moral obligation to be impartial .
As a climate scientist, I’m under pressure to be a political advocate. This comes mainly from environmentalists. Dan Cass, wind-farm director and solar advocate, preferred me not to waste my time debating “denialist morons” but to use political advocacy to “prevent climate catastrophe”.
…
I believe advocacy by climate scientists has damaged trust in the science. We risk our credibility, our reputation for objectivity, if we are not absolutely neutral. At the very least, it leaves us open to criticism. I find much climate scepticism is driven by a belief that environmental activism has influenced how scientists gather and interpret evidence. So I’ve found my hardline approach successful in taking the politics and therefore – pun intended – the heat out of climate science discussions.

Five or More Failed Experiments in Measuring Global Sea Level Change

New papers call into question the global sea surface temperature record
Two new companion papers published in Ocean Science call into question the data and methods used to construct global sea surface temperature records of the past 150 years. The authors find that measurements taken from ship engine cooling intakes can be “overly-warm by greater than 0.5°C on some vessels,” which by way of comparison is about the same magnitude as the alleged global sea surface temperature warming since 1870.
Furthermore, the authors “report the presence of strong near-surface temperature gradients day and night, indicating that intake and bucket measurements cannot be assumed equivalent in this region. We thus suggest bucket and buoy measurements be considered distinct from intake measurements due to differences in sampling depth. As such, we argue for exclusion of intake temperatures from historical SST datasets and suggest this would likely reduce the need for poorly field-tested bucket adjustments. We also call for improvement in the general quality of intake temperatures from Voluntary Observing Ships… We suggest that reliable correction for such warm errors is not possible since they are largely of unknown origin and can be offset by real near-surface temperature gradients.”






Data sets combining ship intake and bucket measurements show ~0.5C warming since 1870, but this new paper argues that the two types of measurement are from different sampling depths and should not be combined. Graph source: Bob Tisdale via WUWT

Is Shrinking Arctic Ice a Bad Thing?

There has been considerable alarm in recent years about the shrinking arctic ice cap.  Some shippers look forward to actually using the “northwest passage” for shipping to cut off a few thousand miles versus going through the Panama Canal or around Africa, while others fear the rising sea levels associated with glacial melting.  Polar bears who hunt for seals on polar ice have become the poster representatives of those who worry about ice caps melting.

Watch: State Department on President Obama’s Keystone XL Jobs Claims: “Sounds like there’s some confusion on this issue”

Imagine you are the spokesperson at the State Department live on TV having to answer questions from a number of reporters trying to find out how President Obama came up with the Keystone XL job numbers he cited in his New York Times interview this weekend.
They certainly didn’t come from the State Department Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
On Monday, Oil Sands Fact Check sent out an Issue Alert questioning whether President Obama had even read the State Department’s report on Keystone XL. If he had, why didn’t he use the numbers that professionals in his own administration had researched for nearly five years? And if he’s not relying on the experts at State, where exactly did he get his numbers from?
These are the questions reporters have been asking this week but have yet to get an answer out of the White House.  “[T]he White House could not say late Saturday what analysis Obama is basing his 2,000 jobs estimate on…” reports the Washington Post. The Hill, too, contacted the White House but they “didn’t respond.”
The Washington Post Fact Checker summed up the White House’s mystery job numbers this way:
“Ordinarily, we would expect the president to cite an estimate from his own State Department, rather than a think tank opposed to the project. (Note to President Obama: When researching such matters, reporters generally look askance at estimates produced by advocates or foes of a particular issue.)  Of course, perhaps the president just took State Department estimate of the construction jobs and divided it in half, to come up with an (incorrect) yearly figure. But that doesn’t make much sense either, because the White House routinely claimed the job gains created by the stimulus by adding up the number of “person-years” — in other words, one person employed per year. That’s how the White House could claim 3 million jobs were saved or created by the stimulus through 2012. (See Table 12 of this White House report.) Thus, using the White House’s stimulus math, the president should be saying Keystone XL would create as many as 7,800 construction jobs.”
The Tampa Bay Times Politifact did some homework too and found that even the Sierra Club had higher job numbers than President Obama on Keystone XL: “We looked at the website of the Sierra Club, one of the leading environmental groups opposed to the pipeline, and they used the State Department’s 3,900 annual number.” As Politifact put it, President Obama’s job numbers are simply “false”:
Our ruling
Obama said the Keystone XL pipeline might produce about 2,000 jobs during construction, based on the most reliable estimates. The White House provided no supporting evidence and the administration’s own State Department predicted that while the pipeline would produce few permanent jobs, the construction process itself would create nearly twice as many jobs as the president said.
We rate the statement False.
Perhaps today’s Grand Forks Herald editorial put it best: “This is pretty close to ludicrous.”
Which brings us back to the poor State Department spokesperson, who was left trying to explain this whole situation on live TV.  She certainly gave it her best shot before finally saying, “Well, sure. It sounds like there’s some confusion on this issue, so why don’t I take the question…”

Imager will provide greater detail to forecasters
– video follows
A key instrument that will fly on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite – R (GOES-R) spacecraft, NOAA’s next-generation of geostationary satellites, is cleared for installation on the spacecraft.
The Advanced Baseline Imager, or ABI, is GOES-R’s primary instrument for scanning Earth’s weather, oceans, and environment and is a significant improvement over instruments on NOAA’s current geostationary satellites. The ABI will offer faster imaging with much higher detail. It will also introduce new forecast products for severe weather, volcanic ash advisories, fire and smoke monitoring and other hazards.

“The United States is home to some of the most severe weather in the world including tornadoes, hurricanes, snowstorms, floods, and wildfires,” said Mary Kicza, assistant administrator for NOAA’s Satellite and Information Service. “The ABI offers breakthrough technology that will help NOAA develop faster and more accurate forecasts that will save lives and protect communities.”
The first satellite in the GOES-R Series is currently scheduled for launch in early 2016. GOES-R’s instruments will also feature improved lightning detection and solar weather monitoring tools, and will provide near real time data to forecasters during severe weather events.
The ABI has two scan modes. It will have the ability to continuously take an image of the entire planet, or a full disk image, every five minutes compared to every 30 minutes with the current GOES imager. It also has an alternative, or flex mode, which will concurrently take a full disk image every 15 minutes, an image of the continental U.S. every five minutes, and smaller, more detailed images of areas where storm activity is present, as often as every 30 seconds. This kind of flexibility and increased frequency of images is a boon for forecasters.
In early 2014 the ABI will be shipped from its developer, Exelis, in Ft. Wayne, Ind., to the spacecraft developer, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co. in Littleton, Colo., to be installed onto the first GOES-R spacecraft. Lockheed is building the spacecraft for the GOES-R series.
The remaining GOES-R instruments to be delivered are:

Geostationary Lightning Mapper, which will provide continuous surveillance for the first time of total lightning activity from geostationary orbit over the western hemisphere;
Space Environment In-Situ Suite, which consists of sensors that will monitor radiation hazards that can affect satellites, radio communications and navigation systems;
Solar Ultraviolet Imager, a high-powered telescope that observes the sun, monitoring for solar flares and other solar activity that could impact Earth by disrupting power utilities communication and navigation systems and causing damage to orbiting satellites and the International Space Station; and
Magnetometer, which will provide measurements of the magnetic field surrounding Earth that protects the planet from charged particles released from the sun. These particles can be dangerous to spacecraft and human spaceflight. The geomagnetic field measurements will provide alerts and warnings to satellite operators and power utilities.

A sixth instrument, the Extreme X-Ray Irradiance Sensor (EXIS), was completed in May 2013 and was the first of GOES-R’s instruments to be ready for integration. EXIS will provide important early warnings of impending solar storms and give scientists a more accurate measure of the power of solar energy radiating toward earth, which can severely disrupt telecommunications, air travel and the performance of power grids.
NOAA manages the GOES-R Series program through an integrated NOAA-NASA office, staffed with personnel from both agencies and located at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.

NOAA’s mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth’s environment, from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun, and to conserve and manage our coastal and marine resources. Join us on Twitter, Facebook and our other social media channels. Visit our news release archive.

This advanced satellite, its rapid 5 minute whole Earth imaging, and its high resolution, pretty much does everything Al Gore’s old satellite idea, Triana, promised, but better, while providing a platform for many more useful instruments.
Wikipedia says of Triana:
The satellite’s original purpose was to provide a near-continuous view of the entire Earth and make that live image available via the Internet. Gore hoped not only to advance science with these images, but also to raise awareness of the Earth itself, updating the influential The Blue Marble photograph taken by Apollo 17.
Translation: an expensive live screen saver.
Triana’s parts are being recycled into DSCOVR, now set to launch in 2015.
This video shows what the ABI instrument can do:

 _Stuff_ have in my opinion very foolishly put up an item praising the 15-year-old climate activist from Wellington, Micah Geiringer.



“climate rebel arrested at 15”. Wow how awesome _Stuff_! The journalist has elevated him to Greta heights by describing him as the ‘unlikely hero’ of the action, his heroic action being nothing more than going against common sense and his mother’s advice and gluing his hand to the door of the bank and getting arrested. 



Well Tom Hunt, journalist, that is no hero in my book. A hero is a teenager who rescues a woman from a crashed car and saves her from drowning, a hero is a teenager who sits beside a 15-year-old friend dying of cancer, a hero is a teenager who defends a friend from bullies etc etc. But elevating a disobedient, school skipping teenager for glueing his hand to a door and being arrested and taken home to a ‘realistic but proud’ mum, to hero status is tragic. I’ll save my respect for the other teenagers.

"The bad news had been building for months at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Even as crowds poured into shows on Hellenistic kingdoms and   fashion, the Met’s deficit was approaching $40 million and had forced the buyout or layoff of some 90 employees. An expansion into a satellite building cost millions of dollars more than expected. A new Met logo and marketing plan were rolled out at great expense  —   and greeted with ridicule. Then, last month, a new $600 million wing was postponed by several years, frustrating the Met’s efforts to become a serious player in the competitive field of Modern and contemporary art. Tension inside the Met, the country’s largest art museum, is running so high that when curators and conservators recently wrote a letter protesting compensation cuts, the museum’s leaders chose not to show it to trustees for fear of leaks and bad publicity. Those who wanted to see the document had to go to the office of the Met’s general counsel and read it under observation. After enjoying boom years, one of the most   cultural institutions in the world is now struggling with missteps and the perils of overreaching at a time of uncertain resources. While many museums face financial and competitive pressures, the Met’s troubles are magnified, given its stature on the world stage. How can a behemoth like the Met, the thinking goes, possibly stumble? Some curators and trustees have zeroed in on Thomas P. Campbell, the Met’s director and chief executive since 2008, as well as the board that has backed him. The anguish can be intense, given the love that all involved have for the Met. “It’s a tragedy to see a great institution in decline,” said George R. Goldner, who in 2014 retired after 21 years as the chairman of the Met’s drawings and prints department and has since served as a consultant to the museum. “To have inherited a museum as strong as the Met was 10 years ago  —   with a great curatorial staff  —   and to have it be what it is today is unimaginable. ” Several people inside the museum, most of whom spoke anonymously for fear of losing their positions, said the Met under Mr. Campbell had tried to do too much too fast: overhiring in the digital department overspending on an additional building, the Met Breuer, and on rebranding overdrawing from unrestricted endowment funds to cover costs emphasizing Modern and contemporary art at the expense of core departments and pursuing the new wing before the financing was in place. Instead, the Met should have been contracting, given falling revenue from its retail stores and admission fees and rising expenses. At the same time, some hope that by reckoning with its troubles, the Met is poised to turn a corner. “We’re getting to the same page,” said Keith Christiansen, the chairman of the Met’s European paintings department. “One benefit from all this: It’s brought the departments together with the administration to sit down at a common table, and that’s something. Now what do we do to move forward and make sure the mission of the museum is not compromised?” Efforts to right the ship have been difficult and painful. In addition to staff cuts, curators were asked to curtail spending for shows and acquisitions. The Met stages nearly 60 exhibitions a year, far more than most museums, but now expects to reduce its exhibitions to about 40 a year. Instead of moving forward with the architect David Chipperfield on a wing intended to help attract art and money from contemporary collectors, the Met has been forced to prioritize the replacement of its aging skylights and roof above the European paintings galleries. In an interview, Mr. Campbell acknowledged that the museum had “been through a trying year. ” “My colleagues have every right to feel upset,” he said. “At the same time, one has to step back and look at the success of the institution. ” To be sure, most agree that the museum’s expansive collections and ambitious exhibitions remain strong. The recent Kerry James Marshall survey at the Met Breuer was widely judged a success, though some critics say the museum’s first retrospective of a living black artist would have been even more momentous in the hallowed main building. In addition, the museum’s attendance has increased to about seven million visitors a year, including the Cloisters. The Breuer, which opened in March, has drawn 557, 000 visitors, exceeding projections. “We’ve got a whole Modern art collection in the Breuer we didn’t have before,” said Hamilton E. James, a Met trustee. “Attendance is at   records critical acclaim has never been as good. An awful lot of wonderful things have gone on. ” Moreover, Met officials say, many cultural institutions have been grappling with a structural deficit  —   when costs exceed revenues, despite a strong economy. The Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum, for example, also recently offered buyouts  —   though they did not then move to layoffs. The New York Philharmonic has delayed the tentative date for opening its $600 million rebuilt hall to get a better sense of its cost. And the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is struggling to raise nearly half the $600 million needed for its expansion. While the Met charged Mr. Campbell with strengthening the museum’s Modern and contemporary art activities, his focus on the Met Breuer and new wing has been controversial. Why try to compete with the new Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, some ask, instead of sticking to what the Met already does best? Mr. Campbell said he had aimed “to sustain an environment in which scholarship could flourish and be the engine of our program, as well as to expand our audiences, to digitize the institution and to revisit what it is to be an encyclopedic museum. ” “We’ve made remarkable progress, but these things are flexible, and they need modulation,” he added. “In the same period, we have had to balance our expenditures and our income. In light of that, we’re certainly doing some recalibration on the goals we’ve set ourselves. ” Some critics say Mr. Campbell has been out of his depth  —   a tapestry curator thrust into the large shoes of the legendary Philippe de Montebello, with no experience running a major institution. (Mr. de Montebello did not have chief executive in his title until 22 years into his   tenure as director.) Moreover, Mr. Campbell, by many accounts, has handled the economic crisis by hunkering down in a defensive crouch rather than reaching out to unite the staff  —   and the full board  —   behind his efforts. Internal critics say he failed to appreciate the upheaval caused by the turnover of   of the curatorial leadership through departures and retirements. They describe the pervasive sense that institutional memory is going out the door and the fear that the Met’s mission to educate through scholarship has been overshadowed by its desire to attract millennials through social media. Mr. Campbell said internal relations was often a challenge at the Met, with its more than   work force, and acknowledged that he could do better. “I’ve tried very hard to open up communications  —   bringing people into briefings, in town hall meetings,” he said. “I wouldn’t say we’ve got it right yet, but we’re heading in the right direction. ” “I myself need to evolve my thinking and my interactions,” he added. “We’ve identified those issues and taken steps to move forward in a very collective manner. ” The Boston Consulting Group, hired a year ago pro bono to help with the Met’s restructuring, was asked this month to interview staff members and trustees about their concerns because the museum recognized “that morale was challenged,” said Daniel H. Weiss, the Met’s president and chief operating officer. “It’s really important that people feel empowered to say what they think. ” When Mr. Weiss, formerly the president of Haverford College, came to the Met last year, he set out to cut $31 million from a $332 million annual budget. He said Mr. Campbell had been open to making the changes required. “We have gone through a significant and difficult time,” Mr. Weiss said. “Tom has been very supportive. ” Daniel Brodsky, the museum’s chairman, said that Mr. Campbell and Mr. Weiss had taken appropriate steps toward financial stability and that he and his fellow trustees had not lost confidence in Mr. Campbell’s capacity to lead. “Tom is a very bright person, and the board supports him,” he said. Mr. James, the trustee, said many of the Met’s struggles “were beyond the control” of a chief executive. “You get bumps in the road, and you have to deal with them. “The leadership team of Tom and Dan  —   I view it very much as a partnership,” he added. “Dan brings a discipline and a businesslike approach. ” Still, the Met’s current retrenchment inevitably looks like a repudiation of much of Mr. Campbell’s original agenda. He has been forced to let go many of his key hires, and his timetable for the new wing has been disrupted. The Breuer  —   the Whitney’s former Madison Avenue home, where the Met has an   lease  —   was to be a temporary hub for the museum’s Modern and contemporary activities during construction, so the new wing could be unveiled in 2020, on the Met’s 150th birthday. The wing is also a linchpin of Leonard A. Lauder’s transformative gift of Cubist artworks, valued at more than $1 billion, which needs a worthy exhibition space. But Mr. Campbell said he had not given up on his main goals to bolster contemporary art at the Met and broaden the audience in a technological age. “I love the Met, I love the work I’m doing here,” he said, “And I’m very committed to seeing all of these many projects through. ”"
"A group of prominent Democrats who served in recent administrations, including John Kerry and Madeleine K. Albright, have called on the courts to extend a ruling blocking crucial parts of President Trump’s travel ban, saying the White House executive order would “endanger U. S. troops” and disrupt antiterrorism efforts. The former officials expressed their concerns on Monday to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, which is considering the matter after a judge in Seattle effectively ruled that travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations as well as vetted refugees from all nations could, for now, continue to enter the United States. With Mr. Trump’s executive order, “we risk placing our military efforts at risk by sending an insulting message” to Iraqis working with American forces battling the Islamic State there, the legal filing to the court said. “The order will likely feed the recruitment narrative of ISIL and other extremists that portray the United States as at war with Islam,” it said, using another name for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. In addition to Mr. Kerry, a secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and Ms. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton, officials behind the filing included Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, and Leon E. Panetta, who served as secretary of defense and head of the C. I. A. The filing comes a week after Mr. Obama took issue with Mr. Trump’s order, saying in a statement that he “fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion. ” The former officials hope that adding their voice to the debate from a national security perspective undercuts a critical argument of the Trump administration: that the travel ban is meant to deter terrorist attacks by keeping the country safe from “very bad and dangerous people,” as Mr. Trump has put it. Noting that the 10 signatories to the filing “have all held the highest security clearances,” the letter asserts that Mr. Trump’s order “ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer. ” The travel ban was dealt a stinging setback on Friday, when a federal judge in Seattle issued the broadest ruling to date blocking major parts of the executive order. The Trump administration appealed Saturday, leaving the issue in the hands of the court in San Francisco. After the appeals panel rules, the Supreme Court is likely to take up the issue."
"Wind power is now big business in the US, and it is getting bigger. Last year, the US wind industry added 1,087MW of new wind power capacity, about the same as is currently installed in Austria, and by the year’s end 12,000MW was under construction, almost double that currently installed in the UK. New records for power output are set every year – for example, during the evening of March 26 this year wind provided 10,296MW of power to Texas electricity grid, meeting 29% of demand at that time. So why is wind booming in the US now, especially in Texas, known more for its rich oil and gas deposits? To understand what is going on we have to look at three factors: subsidies, transmission lines and the interplay of state and federal policies. As is the case elsewhere in the world, wind power in the US depends on subsidies, known as the production tax credit (PTC). The actual generation cost of a new project is about US$50 per megawatt hour (MWh): with the PTC providing US$23 per MWh, the project is profitable at a contract price of US$27, possibly a little less for project in a favourable site. This is competitive with fossil fuel power stations. It is worth pointing out that a 2008 study by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts found that wind received only 3.4% of subsidies given by the federal government to the energy sector. The big winner (in 2006) was biofuel ethanol, with 34.6%, and fossil fuels accounted for 45.9%. The problem is that the PTC has become a political football, sometimes renewed by Congress for only a year at a time. The situation today is that projects under construction at the end of 2013 receive the PTC (provided they are producing power in 2015), but later projects miss out. This creates a boom-and-bust cycle – of the 12,000MW of new projects that began construction last year, almost all (accounting for 10,900MW) started during the last quarter in order to take advantage of the subsidy. And essentially no projects will start construction during the first half of 2014, because the subsidy has ended. These cycles create high levels of uncertainty and complicate the task of supply-chain management. Sometimes operators must lock in construction contracts, financing and power purchase agreements during a short window of opportunity, while all their competitors are doing the same thing. What is really surprising is not today’s boom but the fact that the US wind industry has consistently achieved rapid growth over a long period. Annual capacity growth from 1990-2011 was 16.3%, and during the latter part of that period, growth continued unabated even while the cost of gas, a hugely important part of power generation in the US, was falling sharply. Transmission lines are vitally important. Texas is a huge state, in a huge country. While good wind conditions are found in regions like West Texas, they are hundreds of miles from cities with demand for power. A significant factor in today’s boom is that Texas recently completed what is probably the largest ever programme of co-ordinated investments in wind energy. The CREZ project (Competitive Renewable Energy Zones) designated five zones where wind could compete against fossil fuels in energy generation, and then built almost 3,600 miles of high-capacity transmission lines to deliver the output from an estimated 18,500MW of new wind capacity. The new transmission lines, even without the cost of the wind turbines themselves, cost almost US$7 billion, a cost paid for ultimately by a levy on consumers. Other major wind-related transmission projects are under construction (Prairie Wind Transmission, in Kansas) or about to start (Transwest Express, linking Wyoming to California). This brings us to the interplay of federal and state policies in the US wind market. If you listen to their rhetoric you know that Texas politicians are fiercely conservative. Energy is serious business here – not a playground for environmental activists or soft-centred liberals. In this state, subsidy is a four-letter word. So why is Texas leading the charge towards ever higher levels of wind penetration? It has 12,354MW of wind capacity installed, more than a fifth of the national total and more than any European country other than Germany or Spain. The reason why the conservatives who run the Texas energy sector like wind so much is very simple. If you leave federal taxes out of the equation as inevitable, wind is a very profitable proposition at state level. An economic study made in advance of the CREZ investment found that it would bring down prices to Texas consumers, attract industrial investment, create 40,000 jobs and boost the state’s leading position in wind-related industries. The same study found that CREZ would contribute to cutting water usage by 17 billion gallons, and CO2 emissions by 16%. With outcomes like that, even a Texas conservative can accept a subsidy from Washington. "
"**Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown.**
A tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into force in the nation, with businesses including hairdressers and beauty salons also able to open.
More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households.
The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"".
Meanwhile, the UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.
The first 800,000 doses will be available in the UK from next week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
England's new three-tiered system was backed by MPs in a Commons vote just hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan.
There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark.
And people arrived promptly to take advantage of a stock clearance sale at Debenhams department store from 07:00 GMT.
Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown.
It comes after a period which has seen the collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group, women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© and the failure of Debenhams to secure a buyer \- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk.
Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, but down by 24.1% on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard.
Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates.
She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online.""
Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy.
""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said.
""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month.""
Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.
Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand.
There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels.
British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers, with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"".
Pubs and restaurants are now allowed to reopen in tier one and two areas, although in tier two alcohol can only be served with a ""substantial meal"".
The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus.
And later on Wednesday about 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football League for the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March.
England's new coronavirus restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November.
Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Scotland operates a five-tier system while Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus restrictions \- with the latter currently in a two-week circuit breaker lockdown.
On Tuesday, a further 13,430 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK while a further 603 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 59,051.

"**A man who was recorded haranguing a woman for wearing a Puerto Rico flag shirt at an Illinois park has been charged with a hate crime.**
Timothy Trybus, 62, was previously charged with disorderly conduct and assault.
He allegedly demanded to know if a Latina picnicker was a US citizen in last month's incident.
A police officer who was filmed standing by as Mia Irizarry, 24, pleaded for his help has quit.
Mr Trybus faces a bail hearing on Friday on two counts of felony hate crime.
Ms Irizarry used her mobile phone to film the confrontation, which unfolded on 14 June as she set up a picnic for her birthday at Caldwell Woods in the Chicago suburbs.
In the viral clip a white man approaches her and demands to know why she is wearing her shirt, which had ""Puerto Rico"" written on it.
""You should not be wearing that in the United States of America,"" he shouts, repeatedly jabbing his finger at her.
""Are you a citizen? Are you a United States citizen?""
Ms Irizarry calls on a nearby park police officer for help.
But the officer, Patrick Connor, turns his back and walks towards his patrol car.
The suspect continued to harangue Ms Irizarry for about 10 minutes before other officers arrived and arrested him.
The Forest Preserve District of Cook County Police Department - where Mr Connor worked for 12 years - announced he had resigned late on Wednesday.
At a press conference on Thursday, Superintendent Arnold Randall said Mr Connor was ""very remorseful"" when he resigned.
But he said the officer considered it ""an unfortunate incident"" and felt he was not ""given a fair shake"".
Mr Randall added that Mr Connor's personnel file will say that he did not leave ""in good standing"", and will include a note that he left ""with discipline pending"".
He added that officials will review the mandatory diversity training that officers are required to take. Mr Connor had taken the course a year ago, officials say.
In an earlier statement, the police said that an investigation had been launched and the officer had been placed on desk duty.
In the unedited video, Mr Connor is seen trying to reassure the victim that Mr Trybus does not pose a threat to her safety.
Supt Randall said that Ms Irizarry deserved to be praised for her response amid a national trend of ""racially charged, abusive incidents we're seeing throughout the country"".
""We might start with the fine example presented by Mia Irizarry and her family, who handled this ugly incident with great composure, never stooping to the level of the man who attacked her,"" he said in a written statement.
He added that the park staff had apologised directly to Ms Irizarry and refunded the money she paid for her permit.
The video had angered public officials in the state of Illinois, as well as the governor of Puerto Rico.
The island of Puerto Rico is a US territory.
Meanwhile, a 30-year-old woman has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly using a brick to bludgeon a 92-year-old man near Los Angeles.
Laquisha Jones was also charged with elder abuse over the 4 July attack.
A witness said Ms Jones told the victim, Rodolfo Rodriguez: ""Go back to your country.""
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the assault may have been triggered by Mr Rodriguez bumping into a young girl who was with Ms Jones.
He suffered a broken jaw, broken cheekbones, two broken ribs and bruises on his face, back and abdomen, US media report."

 _Washington Post_ national political correspondent James Hohmann offers this example of how President Trump’s policies are hurting “his” voters: 



General Motors is cutting its second shift at the Lordstown Assembly plant outside of Youngtown, Ohio, next month. The move could cost 1,500 jobs at the 3,000-employee plant that builds the Chevrolet Cruze. … GM says it’s downsizing because there is “lower customer demand for compact cars.” The plant already downsized last year, moving from three shifts to two, partly because consumers are buying more crossovers, SUVs and trucks at the expense of smaller vehicles. 



Rep. Tim Ryan (D‐​Ohio), who represents the plant, blames reduced demand, and the pending layoffs, on Trump’s decision to scrap fuel efficiency standards–which the auto companies did not want. “While low gas prices paved the way for the decline of compact cars … Trump’s April announcement to weaken fuel economy standards put his thumb on the scale in favor of the larger cars and SUV’s made elsewhere, hurting our community specifically,” the congressman said in a statement last Friday. “The truth is, the fuel economy standards help sell more Chevy Cruzes.”



Hohmann and Ryan should be congratulated: in tying jobs to government‐​imposed automobile fuel mileage standards (known as “CAFE” among the acronym‐​loving folks inside the Beltway), they offer an even worse justification for CAFE than the ones policymakers usually provide. 



Congress first authorized CAFE in 1975, in the wake of the 1973–1974 Arab Oil Embargo. Lawmakers’ obvious intent was to reduce U.S. oil consumption and consumer spending on gasoline. However, the 21% spike in real gas prices between 1971 and 1974 seemed to provide consumers–and by extension, automakers–with for more fuel‐​efficient vehicles without any push from government. Nonetheless, the federal government has upped the fuel efficiency standards many times over the years, and has queued up more increases for the next decade. 



However, the fuel efficiency regime they created is a convoluted one. Originally, it divided most passenger vehicles into two categories–cars and light trucks–and set different fuel standards for each. The standards didn’t require that _every_ car and truck meet the applicable CAFE number, but rather that all the vehicles sold in the American market by each automaker average out to the relevant CAFE standard (hence the words behind the acronym: Corporate Average Fuel Economy). This opened the way for all sorts of marketplace mischief, including the rise in popularity of SUVs (which were classified as light trucks and subject to a lower gas mileage standard) and the collapse in demand for station wagons (classified as cars), as well as the cross‐​subsidization of smaller (and seemingly less safe) vehicles by larger vehicles. CAFE has only grown more convoluted–and more mischief-prone–over time. 



In recent years, policymakers have added a second justification for CAFE: to fight climate change by reducing vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. However, the fuel standards do this only indirectly, controlling the amount of hydrocarbon fuel _consumed per mile_ rather than the amount of carbon and other greenhouse gases _expelled in total_. A simple carbon tax would be a much more direct and efficient way to cut these emissions. 



Now Hohmann and Ryan are offering a “jobs” justification. Admittedly, they don’t explicitly say the Trump administration should have kept the planned CAFE increases in order to preserve current jobs, but their criticism of the policy change is just short of a call for industrial policy. 



And it’s not a particularly sensible criticism, even if we were to embrace CAFE as industrial policy. Yes, jobs at the Lordstown Cruze plant may be lost because government isn’t pushing consumers to purchase vehicles that they otherwise wouldn’t. But those consumers will instead purchase more of the vehicles they prefer: crossovers, SUVs, and light trucks, as Hohmann acknowledges. And plenty of American workers are employed in making those automobiles. 



Whatever the merits of the Trump Presidency (and count me among its critics), many of candidate Donald Trump’s voters were attracted to him for his promise to not use government to distort the will of Americans, but instead to respect that will. Using CAFE as industrial policy is a case of distorting that will; far from Ryan’s claim that Trump is “put[ting] his thumb on the scale,” the Trump administration move is (partly) taking government’s thumb off of the scale. It’s doubtful that many Trump voters will be upset that government won’t be using fuel efficiency standards to coerce automobile buyers in order to protect some particular jobs at one particular factory.
"
"

It is an article of faith in the Trump campaign that he will “bring our jobs back from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.” (To be sure, at the cost of raising prices on American consumers — but his campaign doesn’t mention that part.) And The Donald is hardly alone in making this promise. While visiting a factory in Ohio last month, Hillary Clinton assured the audience that she had “always been committed to bringing back manufacturing.” Similar promises can regularly be heard from Bernie Sanders, John Kasich, and even Ted Cruz. There’s hardly a politician out there who doesn’t want to “bring back American jobs.”



It is true that manufacturing is a much smaller portion of the American economy than it was in, say, the 1950s. Manufacturing’s share of the U.S. economy is just 12.1 percent of GDP, compared with a peak of 28.1 percent in 1953. But that’s not because, as anti‐​trade zealots would have it, “we don’t make things any more.” U.S. manufacturing’s value added in 2014 hit an all‐​time high of $2.1 trillion, compared to just $110 billion in 1953 (in constant dollars). Yes, a lot of the things you find at your local Wal‐​Mart are made somewhere else, but that’s because U.S. manufacturing has shifted toward high‐​end products. The U.S. manufacturing sector is so robust that the stock of foreign direct investment exceeds $1 trillion, far more than foreigners invest in our competitors.



Manufacturing has declined as a share of the overall U.S. economy, not because our manufacturing sector has been “hollowed out,” but because other industry sectors have grown even faster. This includes industries, like information technology, that barely existed in the 1950s. For instance, in terms of value added, professional, scientific, and technical services contribute four times more to GDP today than they did in 1955.





‘Bringing back jobs’ in low‐​end manufacturing is not the answer.



That’s a good thing. It’s called progress. After all, do American parents really aspire to have their children sitting at a sewing machine making shirts? Or do they want their children to become doctors, computer programmers, or technology specialists — good jobs with good futures.



Manufacturing jobs have been declining for 40 years or more, a trend that started long before NAFTA or any of the other trade agreements that Trump so hates. There are many reasons for this decline, but they have little to do with China or Mexico “stealing our jobs.” Rather, the single biggest reason that the manufacturing sector has shed so many jobs is that American workers are increasingly productive. Simply put, it takes fewer workers to produce the same thing.



Even when manufacturers have been bringing factories back to the United States — a small but positive trend in recent years — that doesn’t mean they are bringing back jobs.



Robots and automation have changed everything. The biggest threat today to low‐​skilled workers is not China, but automation. As detailed in the 2016 Economic Report of the President, jobs with an hourly wage of less than 20 dollars have a median probability of being automated 2.7 times higher than jobs paying 20 to 40 dollars. And robots are steadily getting smarter and able to handle more tasks. Think what self‐​driving cars could mean to everything from taxis to long‐​haul trucking.



Again, that’s a good thing. There is a story, likely apocryphal, about Milton Friedman. While touring China, he came upon a team of nearly 100 workers building an earthen dam with shovels. Friedman pointed out that with a bulldozer, a single worker could create the dam in an afternoon. A Communist official replied, “Yes, but think of all the unemployment that would create.”



“Oh,” said Friedman, “I thought you were building a dam. If it’s jobs you want, then take away their shovels and give them spoons.”



Trying to preserve low‐​skilled manufacturing jobs in America today makes little more sense than Friedman’s spoon brigade. And such jobs are only going to become less viable in the face of government policies that make workers even more costly compared to the amount of value their labor provides. This week, Governor Jerry Brown and the California legislature seem to have reached a deal to impose an increase in the minimum wage from its current $10 an hour to $15 an hour by 2022. California is currently home to some 600,000 low‐​skilled manufacturing jobs. The new minimum wage will put many of those jobs at risk. It makes little difference whether they are taken by robots or outsourced to China or simply eliminated. Those jobs will be gone.



Moreover, many of the manufacturing processes moving overseas are designed to build products not to ship back to this country, but to better serve foreign markets. Shortening shipping distances, avoiding foreign trade barriers, and creating an on‐​the‐​ground presence in emerging markets can help U.S. firms sell more products to those countries. In fact, studies suggest that more than 90 percent of outsourcing jobs involves foreign‐​market considerations rather than labor costs. Slapping tariffs on foreign goods is not going to change that calculation. Indeed, all it would mean is that companies would sell still more of their products overseas and fewer here.



Of course, the change in American manufacturing has been far from painless. Certain cities, regions, and individuals pay a disproportionate price. I was born in a small New England town that was once a center of the textile industry. But within a decade of my birth, that industry and its jobs were mostly gone. At that time they left not for Mexico or China, but for Southern states that had lower wages, lower taxes, and fewer regulations. The destination didn’t matter much, though, for the people left behind. Losing that industry was devastating for the entire community.



But it was also inevitable and had nothing to do with foreign trade.



Instead of false promises about returning us to the 1950s, we would be better served if the candidates focused on how to create a climate for economic growth and entrepreneurship that will lead to new jobs — jobs that will fit with today’s economic reality. Our rate of new‐​business creation is half what it was in the 1980s, and we are only 33rd in the World Bank’s rankings of how easy it is to start a business. Yet we see candidates like Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders promising to pile new taxes and regulations onto American businesses. Similarly, Donald Trump’s proposal for 45 percent tariffs will not just hurt consumers; it will mean less investment in new jobs and new industries.



We can’t climb into a time machine and return to the 1950s even if we wanted to. What we can do is prepare for a vibrant new economic future.



There’s a strange perversity to promising to bring jobs back from overseas while destroying the jobs that are here today. And, when you take into account that the promise of returning jobs is nonsense, while the job destruction is real, you realize that looking backward is more than just bad political rhetoric.



We can’t climb into a time machine and return to the 1950s even if we wanted to. What we can do is prepare for a vibrant new economic future. That means cutting taxes and regulations to boost entrepreneurship. It means breaking the stranglehold that the teachers’ unions have over our schools so that we can educate future workers for future jobs. It means embracing economic growth as a goal. And it means understanding that free trade contributes to that growth and ultimately produces more winners than losers.



Unfortunately, it is far easier for politicians to make promises that they know they can’t keep.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German daily Bild, the world’s sixth largest daily in print by circulation, reported on the climate demonstration in New York and on the stars who appeared, foremost Leonardo DiCaprio.
At first Bild describes the event as the “largest climate demonstration of all time” and how the event drew more than 300,000 in New York, making it sound impressive.
But then Bild pours cold water on the noble planet rescue attempt and made it look like one hijacked by big Hollywood publicity seekers, and making star Di Caprio look like a hypocrite for demanding climate action while living a lavish life of luxury, mega-yachts, private jets and limousines.
Bild writes:

DiCaprio’s dedication however drew derisive comments. US news site “The Daily Caller“ accused the actor of hypocrisy.
At Twitter critics ridiculed how the star flew over to New York for the demonstration with his private jet. Others pointed out with outrage that the actor was a guest on the giant yacht of an Arabian multi-billionaire earlier this summer.”

Reactions/comments by Bild readers are practically unanimous, with the underlying message: Climate science is a farce and DiCaprio is behaving like a hypocrite. What follows are just a random few I’ve translated:
Reader Liliia Lilianenko comments:

Leonardo di Caprio should refrain from his luxury yacht if he doesn’t want climate change.”

"For many in the West, it might seem a marvel that slug-like sea cucumbers could be at risk of extinction from their popularity on dining tables. But to Asian consumers, this news should be no great surprise. A new study sheds light on why these humble sea creatures are at serious risk worldwide. Sea cucumbers are the less glamorous cousins of starfish and sea urchins, occurring in all of the major oceans and seas. Eaten in China and other southeast Asian countries for centuries, they are appreciated for their soft texture, dietary and medicinal properties.  Dried tropical species can retail from anywhere between US$10 and US$600 per kilo in Hong Kong and mainland China. One cold-water species farmed in China and Japan sells for up to US$3,000 per kg dried. They are regarded as one of the “culinary delicacies” of Chinese cuisine and are often expected to feature on the menu of festive and formal dinners.  With growing affluence in China, demand for sea cucumbers and other luxury seafood has surged in recent decades. Fishing pressure follows on from this demand. Recent research shows that sea cucumber fisheries have expanded into more than 70 countries and intense fishing in low-income countries has depleted many wild populations.  A recent evaluation of all 377 species of Aspirochirotida sea cucumbers for inclusion on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species placed 16 (some of which are the most commercially valuable) in threatened categories, corresponding to an elevated risk of extinction. Our study shows that high market value is the most influential factor in categorising sea cucumber species on the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable or Endangered. Species that are appreciated on the market and attract the highest prices are those first targeted by fishers. Subsequently, they are those that are most at risk.  For some marine life, such as Bluefin Tuna and Sturgeon, increasing rarity makes them valuable and drives them towards extinction. But this is not true for sea cucumbers: their high value drives intense exploitation eventually making common species rare. The large geographic range of a species can contribute to over-exploitation and an increased risk of extinction as a result. The reason is that widely distributed sea cucumbers have enough influence in Asian seafood markets to become well-known, making them high in demand. Rare sea cucumbers and those from isolated locations remain relatively unknown to Asian consumers and don’t exert enough influence on the market to become highly valued. Other important drivers of extinction for sea cucumbers are human population density and poor economies near to species. Wild populations that are overfished to critically low levels can be linked to poverty and this puts conservation in contention with peoples’ livelihoods. Support from wealthier nations is needed for low-income countries to implement trade regulations and conservation measures. Based on a high proportion of threatened species, geographic hot-spots identified for conservation action included east Africa, the Coral Triangle in the southwest Pacific and Central-Western Pacific. The Asian seafood market accepts at least 60 species. When the higher-value sea cucumbers are wiped out from fishing grounds, fishers will probably shift to lower-value species. Coastal livelihoods are diminished as a result of lost income opportunities, which are relatively few in many island countries. But coastal fishers and wealthy Asian consumers aren’t the only ones to suffer from overfishing and local extinctions. Sea cucumbers play a significant role in the ecological system. They help turn over sand in reef lagoons and seagrass beds. By feeding on dead organic matter mixed with sand and mud, the nutrients they excrete can be again taken up by algae and corals – a pathway of nutrient recycling on reefs. Sea cucumbers have also been found to buffer reefs from ocean acidification. Feeding on reef sand by tropical sea cucumbers increases the alkalinity in surrounding seawater. This may help to protect corals and other reef organisms from ocean acidification.  Our study underscores that a loss of sea cucumbers from overfishing poses a threat to tropical biodiversity and important ecosystem services to coral reefs already under global stress from changing ocean chemistry. Much of the research attention in marine conservation has been placed on “charismatic” fauna such as sharks and whales. The extinction risk of many sea cucumber species remains difficult to determine because of insufficient data. If we are to safeguard critical ecosystem functions and livelihoods for future generations, this disparity must be redressed with less charismatic fauna like the lowly sea cucumber."
"**Puerto Rico has acknowledged that Hurricane Maria killed 1,427 people in the US territory, not 64 as it has previously reported.**
Maria hit the island in September 2017 and it has struggled to repair its infrastructure and power grid.
The latest figure was in a draft report for US Congress, requesting $139bn (Â£108bn) in recovery funds.
The official figure of 64 has remained unchanged since last year despite some experts estimating 4,600 deaths.
The New York Times was first to report that the island's authorities had quietly accepted the revised estimate.
A government spokesperson acknowledged the latest number as a ""realistic estimate"" but said that the death toll had not been officially changed, as the authorities were awaiting the results of a study by George Washington University.
""We don't want to say it out loud or publicise it as an official number... until we see the study and have the accuracy,"" Pedro Cerame from the island's Federal Affairs Administration told the Times.
The government has faced criticism for underreporting the number of those killed in the wake of 2017 storm.
Researchers from Harvard University said interviews conducted in Puerto Rico suggested a 60% increase in mortality in the three months after the storm.
Many died from interrupted medical care and lack of access to hospitals. The power outage also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis.
Hurricane Maria caused the largest blackout in US history, according to research consultancy the Rhodium Group.
There have also been repeated power cuts since then, including an island-wide one in April, nearly seven months after the hurricane.
Overall, Hurricane Maria caused losses of $90bn, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said.
The Caribbean island is home to 3.4 million US citizens."
"Surfers and spectators gathered along the Severn Bore in Gloucestershire, England, in recent days to take advantage of the tidal wave that swept upstream. What’s known as a tidal bore – a wave of up to 2.8 metres – came in from the Atlantic on Sunday and a five-star bore (the largest waves that occur) coursed up the river on Monday morning.  Tidal bores are one of the most famous tidal effects where rising water from the ocean creates tidal waves which wash inland, up rivers. They take place on the Amazon and the Qiantang River in Southeast China, where the event is held to be sacred and marked by temples and large crowds. On the Severn Estuary in Southwest England the all-important sea level can rise and fall as much as 14 metres in the space of 12 hours. That’s the height of three double decker buses. All around the world the sea level rises and falls every day with the tides. They vary from month to month, season to season and place to place. In the Mediterranean the tides are small. Along parts of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts their rise and fall can be extreme. Tides are caused by the combining gravitational pull of the sun and the moon in relation to forces created by the spin of the earth. The gravity of the moon pulls at the earths surface, as water is “loose” it moves in response. Sometimes the gravitational pull of the sun (which is weaker on the earth as the sun is so far away) counteracts that of the moon and tides are lower. Sometimes the pull of moon and sun are in line (at new and full moon) and the highest, spring tides occur.  Before gravity was understood the tides were a great mystery to science and religion. The 8th Century British scholar and theologian, The Venerable Bede, wrote that the tides were somehow created by the breath of the moon. This is because the complex rhythm of the tides broadly follows the rhythm of the waxing and waning moon. The Severn Estuary has the second highest tides in the world – after the Bay of Fundy in Canada – and the highest in Europe. The estuary is basically funnel shaped, going from west to east. This means that, as the Atlantic tide rises, a vast volume of water gets pushed up the estuary and, as the channel narrows, the depth of the river changes rapidly too into the lower reaches of the Severn River. As a result, the advancing top level of the water picks up speed and becomes a fully-fledged tidal wave followed by a surge of water. On certain days of the year very high tides occur and these lead to what are called four or even five star bores – the biggest and most spectacular. The tidal wave gathers speed and height and crashes up the river channel making the Severn “the river that sometimes flows backward”.  The record rainfall this winter threatened to hinder the height of the bore, which gains height from the river being shallow. But the river levels were able to drop back down as the rain subsided over the last couple of weeks, allowing for better bore forming over the weekend. Crowds gather to watch, websites show the best viewing areas and surfers and kayak canoeists come to ride the waves, adding to the drama and spectacle. The world record for the longest distance travelled in one go on a surfboard has been held on the Severn Bore by surfer Steve King. He rode the wave for a one hour and 16 minutes, travelling more than seven miles upstream. Because of the way they are created the tides don’t fit our normal day-night sequence in a simple way. High tides, and low tides – they always follow each other – can take place at any time, throughout the day or night. So they bring distinctive and special senses of time and rhythms to the places they affect. Both nature (such as wading birds) and society (sailors, farmers, fisher folk, walkers) must plan their day not by the clock of the sun, but by the clock of the moon. Their unique timetable and the spectacular nature of tidal landscapes and phenomena such as the bore has been the inspiration for many artists and writers over the years. But tidal landscapes, despite being culturally and ecologically rich and unique, are under severe pressure nationally and internationally. Development, flood defences and land reclamation are serving to alter the often desolate and lonely – but very beautiful – landscapes of tidal areas. "

We continually see papers in the supposedly “scientific” literature that just assume climate change, usually warming, and then draw conclusions based in that assumption.
The media also does this. A recent example is a study documented on the BBC on North American pika, a small rodent that lives on rocky hillsides in the mountains of North America. The study area in this example was in British Columbia, Canada, in the coastal mountains and the northern reaches of the Rocky Mountains in Banff National Park.

The pika has neither adapted to 6°C climate change, nor moved to higher elevations. Shown above is the American pika with mouthful of dried grass. Sequoia National Park, CA. Dcrjsr – own work, CC BY 3.0. 
Here are Dr. Philippe Henry’s assumptions:
I decided to study the American pika [pronounced pee-kah] along BC’s Coast Mountains because we have observed a six degree temperature change along an elevation gradient from sea level to 1500 meters where the pika lives…we know from previous studies of the pika that it is particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, which made it ideal for our study. The key for me is to have sustainable and safe interactions with wildlife as researchers. To me, there is a direct connection with this and UNBC’s status as Canada’s Green University.”
 What questions did Dr. Philippe Henry wish to answer when he set out on his research?

(1) Would the pika move from that habitat in flux?
(2) Would it stay and, if so, would it die off or find a way to adapt?
Here are the actual temperature conditions as measured at Banff National Park:

Temperature record by NASA GISS for Banff National Park (as measured at the townsite of Banff).
Note that the temperature increase as measured at the trend line is less than 1°C, and for the recent 30 years it has been cooling by about 0.5°C. There has certainly not been a 6°C temperature change, though there was one year in the 20th century at 0°C average temperature and one year of over 5°C average temperature, most years have been in the range of 2 to 4°C.
Dr. Philips discovered that the pika were not moving to higher elevations, so he decided that they are adapting in place.
And because of his assumptions, (and perhaps to protect his grant money) he could not allow himself the conclusion that the pika are quite happy right where they are because the climate is barely changing.

When President Donald Trump threatened to abandon NATO if delinquent European states didn’t pull their socks up and start paying their fair share of the collective defence pact, the panic was palpable. European nations like France and Germany have been free-riding on America’s dime for decades. Confident that the Americans would pay to keep the Soviet Union at bay, continental mendicants skived off paying their obligatory 2% of GDP to their own defence.



In return for its vast expenditure on collective defence, all America got in return was endless sneering and contempt from European elites.



President Trump wasn’t putting up with it. His threat to abandon NATO was met with a swift response: panicked European leaders fell over themselves to promise to pay their dues.



Trump is now issuing the same ultimatum to the most delinquent globalist entity of all, the United Nations. For its part, the UN is belatedly waking up to the fact that it needs America far more than vice-versa.



Facing a massive hole in its budget, the United Nations is implementing “emergency measures” to avoid missing payroll and other obligations before the end of the year. Unsurprisingly, UN bosses are demanding that taxpayers in America and other nations hand over more money now or face global catastrophe. Even UN officials and apologists, though, have blasted the “bloated” organization for squandering massive amounts of money on everything from luxurious air travel and fancy hotels to globalist propaganda promoting its own agenda. Trump reacted to the whining by calling on the UN to go look for money elsewhere.



America blows something in the order of $10 billion every year – more than 185 other member states combined. It’s not like America is getting much bang for its UN buck. America funds up to a third of the UN’s budget. China, just 8%. Yet, while America runs just one out of 15 of the UN’s agencies, the Chinese communists run nearly a third. These are the agencies often stuffed with some of the world’s most authoritarian regimes, which constantly attack America and its allies.



Americans and their elected president are getting tired of shouldering an outlandish portion of the burden. On the campaign trail, for instance, Trump noted that the UN was not a friend to freedom or the United States. He has also repeatedly blasted globalism, most recently telling the UN General Assembly that the future did not belong to globalists, but to patriots […]



Since his victory, Trump has dealt several major blows to the UN, even before this budget impasse. For instance, in 2017, the administration managed to get the UN budget slashed by a quarter of a billion dollars. That same year, Trump announced that the U.S. government was withdrawing from the UN Paris Agreement on “climate change.” He also withdrew from several key UN organs including UNESCO, the UN’s totalitarian-controlled “education” bureaucracy; and from the dictator-controlled UN “Human Rights Council,” which specializes in praising mass-murdering regimes while constantly attacking America and other nations that still enjoy some freedoms. Trump defunded a number of UN programs, agencies, and schemes, too.



The UN is a bloated bureaucracy of “corridor elitists” which is increasingly violating its own charter – which promises to respect the sovereignty of member states. Yet the UN continually intrudes on member states’ sovereignty – most egregiously when it effectively toppled Libya’s regime, leaving the country a failed state with open-air slave markets.



The precursor to the UN was the largely forgotten League of Nations. The League lasted just 25 years before it was abandoned as a failure. The UN has hung around for three times as long, but it may well be that its time is long past. While it arguably played a vital role in the Cold War, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, that was nearly 60 years ago.



Rather than making it more efficient, or less corrupt […]liberty-minded lawmakers say the time has come for the U.S. government to completely ditch the UN and remove its headquarters from U.S. soil. “It’s full of dictators, and it’s also something that I don’t think our sovereign government should defer to”…Democrats hope to keep it bottled up. But if they lose control of the House at the next election, an “Amexit” from the UN may well end up on the agenda.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Trek of Fools – Ric Werme provides the link to a Spanish language video…the pictures tell the whole story:

The documentary provides the names and passport numbers of some of the Greenpeace activists.
=============================
Here’s a Spanish-language video clearly showing the “irreparable” damage to the Peruvian Nazca Lines done by renegade Greenpeace activists earlier this month.

In the video Ana María Cogorno, director of the Asociación Maria Reiche Internacional para el Arte & Ciencia, explains the “irrefutable evidence of damage” to the UNESCO World Heritage site. The video clearly shows Greenpeace protestors trampling the site, moving stones in order to hold down the signs so that aerial photos could be made for the purpose of publicity. And publicity they got.
Unfortunately I do not know Spanish and if any Spanish speakers could provide the important points made in the video by Ms Cogorgno, who is clearly showing the damage done, please do so and I will post.
Meanwhile Greenpeace is no longer a loved organization in Peru, as Russian RT news site here shows. The Greenpeace director unsuccessfully tries to manage the exploding public relations disaster amid angry protesters demanding justice:

Russian RT news site quotes one angry protester, writing:
The first thing that the people of Nazca are demanding in the name of everyone who makes a living from tourism is the punishment to the individuals responsible for this,’ a demonstrator said Friday.”

Doomsday cults have always been marked by their passion for desperately bizarre public attention-seeking. The mediaeval flagellants paraded themselves in a kind of grotesque theatre of piety, dressing in ritualistic robes and whipping their flesh into a bloody pulp in order to publicly affirm their superior virtue. The Moonies stage elaborate mass weddings. Jim Jones’ “Peoples Temple” took its monstrous theatre to the ultimate level, staging the infamous Guyana mass suicide in 1978.



It’s impossible not to think of these outbreaks of mass, public religious lunacy when observing the attention-seeking antics of the **Krazy Klimate Kult** , the “Extinction Rebellion” nutcases.



Like drug-addled hippies, XR-ers believe in fantasies of collective consciousness, pacifism and a pre-political state where mother nature is pregnant with an eternal harvest. It’s like a David Attenborough documentary without the kill scene. Set against this utopia is an equally illusory but sinister version of reality where evil white men are killing the Earth with CO2. XR believes it is engaged in a battle between life and death.



Climate activists have spent the past week protesting in low-emission nations of the West while ignoring the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters […]Why don’t they protest against China for producing 27.2 per cent of the world’s carbon emissions? Perhaps they could try locking themselves to the nearest United Nations office for refusing to hold China to account.



Logic and facts have little place in XR’s eschatological fantasies. Like all death cultists, they are utterly convinced of the “truth” of their revelation, and no reasoning will sway them.



Like all doomsday cults, XR ­believers frame martyrdom as a high calling […]The development of a will to martyrdom is rarely a good sign, but it is especially problematic among members of groups who share the belief in a doomsday scenario. If XR activists think the world will enter a death spiral after 2025, they have nothing to lose. Already, some appear to be suffering the effects of mass hysteria. Footage from protests has shown activists breaking down, weeping and wailing after chaining or gluing themselves to things […]as the collective’s emotional state deteriorates, its members seem less willing to consider counterintuitive facts.



This is classic cult behaviour – and very concerning. Cults have a habit of falling into downward spirals. The Flagellants weren’t content just to literally whip themselves into a frenzy: anyone who refused to join in was accused of being in league with the devil. Flagellants had a habit of murdering their opponents. The Jim Jones cult, a melange of messianic social justice and paranoid millenarianism, went from murder to mass suicide.



The widening gulf between XR theory and reality is a reason the public has begun to turn against the group […] Without a democratic mandate or a rational plan for conservation, XR activists can only shout and stamp their feet. They use resistance tactics to bypass democracy because they have no hope of implementing their policies by democratic means. Over time, they are becoming more militant and people are tiring of the soap opera.



When even Red Dan Andrews in Victoria and the Labor government in Queensland are turning on them, you know these cultists are beyond the pale.



More than 40 climate activists are facing up to five years imprisonment in Victoria after a week of chaotic protests that reportedly cost the state at least $3 million.



Victoria Police North West Metro Commander Tim Hansen said the response to Extinction Rebellion’s week of action, which threw Melbourne into chaos after protesters blocked key intersections and roads, racking up a total of 16,000 patrol hours involving officers from the public order response team, the mounted branch, highway patrol, brawler vans, search and rescue as well as logistic advisers and drones operators […]The Herald Sun reports the cost to the taxpayer will exceed $3 million.



Of course, cultists feed on a persecution complex. So, don’t expect them to go away soon.

"**US President Donald Trump has griped about emergency relief efforts in hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, saying federal aid cannot continue ""forever"".**
In tweets, he accused Puerto Rico of a ""total lack of accountability"", adding that ""electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes"".
The island, whose 3.4 million residents are US citizens, is 90% without power, some three weeks after Hurricane Maria.
On Thursday, Congress approved a $36.5bn (Â£28bn) disaster relief bill.
The cross-party bill, which still requires Senate approval, provides emergency storm relief for Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and the US Virgin Islands, as well as wildfire-ravaged California.
In Thursday's morning tweets, the US president noted it was up to ""Congress to decide how much to spend"".
But he added: ""We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!""
The mayor of Puerto Rican capital San Juan said Mr Trump's tweets highlight his ""desperation"" and the ""inadequacy"" of the hurricane response.
""It is not that you do not get it,"" Carmen Yulin Cruz added, ""it is that you are incapable of empathy and frankly simply cannot get the job done.""
White House chief of staff John Kelly said later the US would stand with Puerto Rico ""until the job is done"".
He also said the president was ""exactly accurate"" to assert that federal personnel are ""not going to be there forever"".
The storm killed at least 45 people in the US territory, while more than 100 others remain unaccounted for, say Puerto Rico officials.
The island is saddled with about $72bn in pre-hurricane debt that is being overseen by a federally created oversight board.
**Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter**
Imagine a devastating hurricane hits New York City, and the president repeatedly notes how bad things were there before the disaster. Or, three weeks after an earthquake levels Los Angeles, he says the government won't provide aid ""forever"".
There would be outrage. It's difficult to even imagine such responses.
That, however, is how Donald Trump is handling hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. For the president, the US territory - occupying a political no-man's land between US statehood and independence - is different.
When the chequebook comes out, empathy ends and reality sets in. The administration and Congress are in the middle of tough negotiations over government spending and tax reform. Coming up with billions for Puerto Rico relief is an unwelcome challenge.
So the president has said there is a limit to the help available for these taxpaying US citizens. Things were bad before - and they may stay that way.
Mr Trump's tweets also provoked a backlash from some Democratic lawmakers, who accused him of preparing to abandon US citizens.
""There is still devastation, Americans are still dying. FEMA needs to stay until the job is done,"" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer replied on Twitter, using the acronym for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Puerto Rico-born congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, another New York Democrat, tweeted that Mr Trump's comments were ""outrageous, indefensible and irresponsible"", adding: ""We will not allow our government to abandon our fellow citizens.""
She has written to the Department of Homeland Security to request an investigation into the official death toll, which she says may be vastly under-reported, and could be as high as 450.
""The federal response is woefully adequate and now we are seeing numerous reports that the death toll is unknown or not being reported accurately,"" she wrote in a letter co-authored with Congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi.
""The whole nation deserves to know what is happening to our fellow citizens.""
President Trump visited the US territory last week, where he told residents that recovery efforts had ""thrown our budget a little out of whack"".
He also said the islanders should be ""very proud"" the death toll was not as high as a ""real catastrophe"" like Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005.
The US president was pilloried by local officials after he threw rolls of paper towels at residents during his trip.
The San Juan mayor described that incident as ""abominable"".
But Mr Trump later depicted the outrage as confected, insisting to the Trinity Broadcasting Network that the crowd ""were having fun"" as he distributed ""these beautiful, soft towels""."
"If the surprisingly strong job gains in January revealed the economy’s resilience, they also exposed some of its stubborn weaknesses. Yes, the government’s report on Friday showed that employers fattened their payrolls by 227, 000 workers last month, an unexpectedly large increase. And yes, public optimism about economic prospects has persuaded a few hundred thousand Americans who had dropped out of the work force to return. But the very fact that so many sidelined workers could be lured back despite meager wage growth is evidence that the labor pool is not as shallow as some have argued. To the labor market bulls, consistently low official jobless rates have suggested that the economy is nearing capacity and that inflation lurks. Initial estimates released last month gave the impression that wages had taken a big step forward at the end of last year, lifting hopes that the momentum would continue, especially with a surge of local   increases taking effect across the country. Instead, the Labor Department’s latest figures showed baby steps  —   slower increases in earnings for December and January, bringing    average wage growth back down to its disappointing 2. 5 percent trend. “The increase in participation and drop in wages suggest we’re not at full employment,” James Athey, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said. Although officials at the Federal Reserve have said they expect to raise the benchmark interest rate three times this year in response to a strengthening economy, they made clear at their   session this week that nothing is guaranteed. “This is just what the doves at the Fed wanted to see,” Mr. Athey said, referring to those wary of raising rates and keen to keep the focus on fostering hiring rather than heading off inflation. “All of the numbers point toward it being more difficult to justify another hike in March,” when Fed members next meet. But just because the job market is not yet drum tight does not mean it is not improving. “The labor market started 2017 on the front foot,” said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. “This is a good, good number. ” President Trump, who previously dismissed the jobs estimates as “phony numbers,” said on Friday that the latest report showed there was a “great spirit in the country right now. ” The averages the government reported mask how fractured the labor market is regarding skills and pay. Employers in many sectors have complained about the difficulty of finding and keeping suitable workers, which has driven up pay in several sectors. “We’re still continuing to see wage pressure as the candidate market continues to shrink,” said Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing USA, which has 300 branch offices. In addition to the omnipresent hunger for engineers and other   workers, demand is strong for people with   trade skills like welding that fell into disuse during the recession, and for   warehouse and light assembly workers, Ms. Glaser said. “I’m definitely seeing a trend of employers targeting certain pools of workers like the disabled, retirees that may be looking to return to the work force, and    moms,” said Ms. Glaser, whose office is in Lexington, Ky. “Employers are getting very creative. Anything to get a competitive edge. ” David Nilssen, chief executive of Guidant Financial, a   financier based in Seattle, added 30 employees last year to his work force of 80. He said the trouble he has had recruiting and retaining staff members was echoed in a Guidant survey of about 2, 000 clients, who listed a shortage of qualified workers as their main challenge. Many American workers remain cut off from the competitive bidding that has emerged in the eighth year of the recovery. A mismatch of skills or location, the lack of support like child care and employer discrimination are some of the reasons that high school graduates,   factory workers, members of minorities, baby boomers and others have failed to find or regain a comfortable footing in the labor force. However strong (or weak) last month’s figures are ultimately viewed, they are a legacy of the Obama administration, since they are based on surveys before Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. Some employers may have made staffing decisions in anticipation of a Republican administration, but this report does not reflect any specific policy changes. (The way the government estimates the jobless rate does not change from one administration to the next.) Still, given the timing, the January job figures are one benchmark against which the new president’s stewardship of the economy will be judged. There are others. Economists at Moody’s Analytics said in a report this week that at least six other measures should be used to determine whether the economy has reached full employment. The list included the proportion of those not in the labor force who want a job, the size of the pool of   unemployed and the degree of wage growth. The share of   adults who are in the labor force, meaning they have a job or are actively looking for one, has been dragging along at historical lows, but it bumped up to 62. 9 percent in January, from 62. 7 in December, a sign that at least some people have returned and that still more might do so if prospects brighten. That growth in the work force raised the official unemployment rate to 4. 8 percent last month. A broader measure of unemployment, which includes the millions who are working part time but would prefer   jobs and those so discouraged by rejections that they have given up searching, also rose, to 9. 4 percent in January from 9. 2 percent in December. Revised estimates from December and November cut 39, 000 jobs from previous totals, although other routine adjustments by the Labor Department showed the overall job creation for 2016 was better than previously reported. Manufacturing jobs, which Mr. Trump has focused on, grew by 5, 000 in January, increases that were countered by a revised estimate that reduced December’s gains. The Department of Labor will issue one more revised estimate for December, and two more for January. At the lower end of the pay scale, state and local   increases  —   ranging from as small as 5 cents an hour in Florida and Alaska to $1. 95 an hour in Arizona  —   affected about 4. 3 million workers across 19 states in January. The widest impact was felt in Arizona, California and Washington, where more than 1 in 10 workers got a raise. Employees in Oregon, the District of Columbia and Maryland are scheduled to get an increase later this year. The disappointing overall wage growth can be traced in part to the financial industry, which had a 0. 1 percent drop in pay. Analysts, backed by research from the Federal Reserve, have been recalibrating their assessments of what constitutes a strong number of hires, given how far the official unemployment rate has fallen. Economists estimate that it takes 50, 000 to  110, 000 new jobs to absorb growth in the population and keep the jobless rate steady. The current   average is 183, 000. Mr. Trump, who ordered an    hiring freeze for the federal government last week, has pledged on the White House website to create 25 million jobs  —   a staggering number that would eclipse the total number of   jobs created during Ronald Reagan’s   tenure, George Bush’s   term and George W. Bush’s eight years combined."

Education has been one of the most extraordinary victories for the Marxists’ [Long March through the institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_long_march_through_the_institutions). Universities have become a wasteland of leftist groupthink, where the only differences of opinion allowed are between left, far-left and communist. Those academics have in turn inculcated generations of teachers in a dismal watermelon stew of dime-store socialism and deep-green nuttiness.



The result is an education system absolutely, unquestioningly in thrall to the pseudo-religious pseudoscience of climate change alarmism. Australia’s academic rankings are steadily falling (despite billions in increased funding) because activists are posing as teachers. But hey, who cares if kids complete 12 years of schooling and still can’t read or do maths properly, so long as they’re acceptably “woke”?



Well, one parent at least cares a great deal.



A fed-up father has pulled his son out of school and has accused staff of brainwashing children, after the climate movement made its way in to his son’s Year 4 classroom.



Around the country thousands of students have taken to the streets to protest on climate change, but Matthew Karlos is infuriated about the topic being taught at his son’s state school claiming, “it’s ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.”



The “topic” is not being “taught”. The dogma is being indoctrinated. There’s a difference.



When Max was told that one of his last days of the term, would be a ‘Greenie day’ it was the final straw for the young boy and his dad.



“All the other kids, ’cause (sic) we were all in the one class at the time, they were all going, yay we can dress up as hippies, and I just said, what’s so good about it? There’s nothing good about them,” Max said.



“They just sit around doing nothing all day.”



Students were also expected to sing to the go-to environmental song Big Yellow Taxi, written by Joni Mitchell, which has been covered numerous times, including by pop band Counting Crows.



Mr Karlos had already kept Max home weeks earlier when students were asked to give a speech on the environment.



“It was to do with mankind induced climate change and all this business they carry on about now,” he said.



Unlike the “green” teachers, it turns out Max’s dad actually knows a thing or two about the environment.



This father, who is a second generation water farmer, has long had a beef with greenies, who are against his water harvesting business in northern New South Wales.



“They don’t like the trucks on the road, they don’t like this, they don’t like that you know, so here we are” he said.



And now he’s had enough of his son also getting the greenie message at his state school.



Just as the old-school churches used to use the threat of fire and brimstone to keep their flock in line, the new Church of Gaia is using the threat of fire and carbon to terrify children into submission.



“You’ve gotta (sic) teach kids to be happy and positive and it’s all well and good to be concerned about the environment and wanting to teach kids good practices […]” [but] Mr Karlos believes scenes of protesting around the country, as well as activist Greta Thunberg speaking out, amounts to brainwashing.



“The fact that you’ve got supposed adults […]pushing ideas on a 16 year old girl and using her as a pawn, is just disgusting; it’s child abuse,” he said.



“Just stop brainwashing the kids and being negative and teach them how to be positive about making good positive changes for the world, not all doom and gloom.”



…Max will now start at a new school at the beginning of term four.



Unfortunately, Mr Karlos will quickly discover that the green fundamentalists have white-anted the school system, root and branch. Home schooling is looking more and more like the only sane option.

I have always liked Rachel Stewart’s work and Cam has always rated her highly. We might not agree with everything she writes but she is a skilled journalist and she owns a falcon which is really cool no matter which side of the political spectrum you sit on.



It is shocking that the NZ Herald was too scared to publish her latest article and it shows the integrity of the lady that she has quit rather than have her work censored and suppressed.



As the editor of _The BFD_ I would love to have her write for _Insight Politics_ once a week. At _The BFD_ she would be free to write what she wanted because at _The BFD_ **we welcome a range of different viewpoints.** We certainly would not be cowed like the _NZ Herald_ , as [Free Speech ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/the-free-speech-coalition-needs-your-support/)is something that we are 100% committed to: unlike Massey University which is a complete disgrace!



 ** _Speak Up For Women is publishing Rachel Stewart’s latest column, as the New Zealand Herald would not publish it. Rachel is an award winning journalist and one of New Zealand’s favourite opinion writers. It seems in today’s anti-women political climate, some feminist opinions are not welcome at the Herald. Please note it was written prior to the news breaking that Massey Uni had cancelled our venue booking._**



 **Rachel’s column:**



It seems far-fetched that the mere hiring of a Massey University venue by a feminist organisation could cause so much indignation and rage, but these are not typical times.



A bunch of females getting together within a public space to discuss the issues currently affecting them is far from new, and very far from radical.



Yet, the idea that ‘Feminism 2020’ would dare to congregate at a venue on Massey’s Wellington campus saw a number of students stage a sit-in, which culminated in the handing over of a petition calling on the university to cancel the event.



What is so threatening about women coming together and talking? According to the protestors and petitioners, the organisers of the event – Speak Up for Women – are essentially devil incarnates.



Petition organiser Charlie Myer said the university shouldn’t be “facilitating this kind of discussion”. Feminism 2020 “could have [the event] anywhere” but it wasn’t appropriate for them to hold it at a university, which was supposed to support transgender students.”



Last time I looked universities were required to respect and uphold the quaint, old-fashioned tenet of free speech too. And Massey has, thus far, held out against the pressure of every thrown guilt trip known to mankind. You know, we don’t feel “safe”.



Myer also disputed the group was feminist and simply meeting to discuss women’s issues. “If your feminism isn’t intersectional, it isn’t feminism.”



 **Don’t you just love it when men tell women what feminism actually is?** I find it adorable. Like a possum in my pear tree. So endearing.



Another endearing move was to then see the spokesperson for diversity and inclusion accreditation business Rainbow Tick Martin King say that if Massey did not cancel the event it was likely it would trigger a review of its accreditation.



The spectre of losing their Rainbow Tick must be downright scary for them. I mean, since students are now their financial customers, Massey naturally wants to keep the client happy at all costs.



But back to ‘Speak Up For Women’ and their apparently devilish ways. Why do some students so feverishly want them cancelled lest they be “harmed” by their words? Of course, you’d think simply not attending would put paid to that, but I’m being far too logical.



No. These students believe that no one should be allowed to discuss, debate, or hear the reasons why many women are concerned about an amendment (currently on hold) to the Births, Deaths, and Marriages Registration Bill that would allow a person to change their legal gender by simply signing a declaration.[…]

"At 11.40pm local time on the cold, moonless night of 14 April 1912, the crow’s nest lookouts on board the RMS Titanic sighted a large iceberg only 500m ahead. Despite quick action, the iceberg still struck the ship aft of the bows and water flooded into the ship across several compartments. In little more than two and a half hours the Titanic sunk, taking with her 1,514 lives.  The dramatic and sudden sinking of the ship that was touted to be unsinkable provoked a great search over the next 100 years to understand how the fateful crash happened. And whether or not there was a greater risk from the number of icebergs in  1912 has been a major cause for debate. Theories linking exceptional iceberg numbers to effects such as sunspots or extreme tides on the coast of Greenland have perpetuated the idea that 1912 was an exceptional year for icebergs, stacking the cards against the Titanic on her maiden voyage. Indeed, ships travelling through the northwest Atlantic in the days leading up to the tragedy did exchange a number of reports of ice.  But our recent research, using the iceberg records of the International Ice Patrol and an iceberg-ocean model, counters this accepted view. We’ve found that the number of icebergs in the region was neither exceptional nor unprecedented. Following the Titanic disaster, the International Ice Patrol was established to monitor ice hazards and warn ships in the northwest Atlantic. One way they measure the iceberg hazard is by reporting the number of icebergs seen south of 48°N, a latitude extending out into the Atlantic from the south of Newfoundland. This recording has continued since 1913, and ship reports prior to this gives data reaching back to 1900 of ice in the area that the Titanic sank.  In 1912, 1,038 icebergs were reported crossing this latitude circle. In a record that varies between no icebergs and well over two thousand a year, this qualifies as a significant number. But there are several years in surrounding decades with similar numbers, including five years with at least 700 icebergs crossing the region between 1901 and 1920. The iceberg risk in 1912 then, was significant, but not unprecedented, and has been much greater in recent decades. Our iceberg-ocean model also allows us to suggest a likely origin for the iceberg that collided with the Titanic. The longstanding view of iceberg movement in the northwest Atlantic is that icebergs from successive glaciers feed into the ocean current. Following it, they flow south along the east Greenland coast and then north along the west Greenland coast, finally circling Baffin Bay and heading south along the Labrador coast towards the Atlantic shipping lanes. There is no way to say from which point along this long journey the infamous iceberg might have originated – it suddenly appeared out of the night and then disappeared after colliding with the Titanic. But our model allows us to use the winds and currents of the time to give the likely origins and routes for icebergs reaching the vicinity of the Titanic sinking in mid-April 1912.  It is very likely that the Titanic iceberg calved (broke off) from a glacier in one of the fjords of the southwest corner of Greenland during the late summer or early autumn of 1911 and took a more direct path, across the northern Labrador Sea, to its rendezvous with the ship. Placing total faith in model results without supporting observations is problematic. And, even the model suggests there is a small possibility the iceberg originated from further north, in Baffin Bay, so the question of the Titanic iceberg’s origin can never be resolved with absolute certainty. But descriptions of the iceberg from survivors and the fact that five sixths of the icebergs modelled as passing 48°N latitude calved from southwest Greenland in 1912 support our model. More localised iceberg models are used on a regular basis by the International Ice Patrol to track icebergs in the NW Atlantic today, in combination with satellite and radar data. Even though there have been years of much greater iceberg numbers in the recent past, this constant monitoring has meant the risk to shipping is now much reduced.  Icebergs are still a threat, however, and the risk in regions without this constant monitoring is significant. As recently as 2007, the cruise ship MV Explorer sank after a collision with an iceberg in the Weddell Sea, off Antarctica and collisions elsewhere occur from time to time.  Indeed, icebergs will remain a real risk for years to come. Their number is likely to increase as Arctic glaciers respond to global warming and the sea-ice retreats. With shipping routes planned for the Arctic and the construction of coastal installations, monitoring iceberg hazards continues to be important to prevent more titanic disasters in the future."
"A major justification for exploiting natural resources, including burning fossil fuels, is that it helps improve the quality of our lives. We rely on oil, coal and gas, for example, to power our cars, keep our thermostats at a nice temperature and the lights on at night. Calls to curtail carbon emissions and our use of natural resources to protect the environment are often met with warnings that society will suffer as a result.  In fact, the tension between exploiting the environment and how it affects human well-being is not fully understood. Some have argued that after an initial phase of industrialisation and development, carbon emissions can be reduced, but well-being maintained. Adding to this debate is a new paper in Nature Climate Change. It compares the carbon emissions of 106 countries with the well-being of its citizens as these countries develop economically from 1970-2009. The study uses a measure called the carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB). This is derived from a country’s carbon emissions from industrial sources (burning fossil fuels and cement manufacture) per person relative to life expectancy. A low CIWB value is desirable from an environmental and human development standpoint.  A low value of carbon intensity of well-being indicates that a nation does not emit large quantities of carbon to make its citizens better off. Values are often high in developed nations – though these nations have long life expectancies, they usually have very high carbon emissions. Saying this, there is a lot of diversity among the 106 nations studied. While the USA and Australia have particularly high CIWB values, Japan and the UK have relatively low ones. The analysis focuses on assessing the relationship between economic development (measured by GDP per capita) and CIWB, and examining whether this relationship varies across regions. A key finding is that, in most parts of the world, economic development increases CIWB, which indicates that economic growth typically drives up carbon emissions more rapidly than it improves life expectancy. This suggests that the way economic growth is pursued does not encourage sustainable progress in most nations.  The effect of economic growth on CIWB was particularly high in North America, Europe and Oceania, indicating that further development in affluent countries makes them less efficient at improving well-being. In South and Central America and in Asia the effect of economic growth on CIWB increased over time, adding fuel to the argument that economic development comes at the expense of the environment. Only in Africa did development lead to any kind of reduction in CIWB – although by 2009 this effect had become negligible. Jorgenson’s CIWB is one version of a family of indicators that measure the environmental intensity of well-being. Another measure is the ecological footprint, which estimates the amount of land area needed to support a given level of resource consumption. This can highlight other aspects of how human activity affects the environment.   Likewise, other indicators of well-being can be looked at, such as the subjective well-being or feelings of happiness of a population. This is generally measured by responses to surveys. For example, the Happy Planet Index, developed by the New Economics Foundation, compares countries’ ecological footprint with a combination of life expectancy figures and people’s “experienced well-being”. They find that no country is able to combine success across the three goals of high life expectancy, citizens feeling happy with their lives and the country living within environmental limits. Due to a lack of survey data on people’s experienced happiness at multiple points in time for most nations, this new study by Jorgenson could not include people’s feelings in its analysis. Indeed, research continues to understand the ongoing relationship between human development and environmental impacts. Continuing research may determine whether different patterns are found for different types of measures. But, Jorgenson’s study serves to confirm much of the existing body of research on the environmental impacts of well-being. This research has established that most countries need to become better at improving people’s quality of life without relying on high levels of resource consumption, as this comes at the expense of the environment. Improvements to well-being may be attainable without adverse effects on the environment."

"**The small village of Toa Alta in the centre of Puerto Rico was right in the middle of Hurricane Maria's path.**
The level of destruction here is astonishing. Virtually nothing remains standing. Shoes, plates and items of clothing are scattered where homes once stood.
Thirty-year-old Jose Nieves and his young family evacuated the area just before Maria struck in September. When he returned days later, his worst nightmare had come true - he had lost his home.
""I was the one who built it, little by little, and it was built solid enough but the hurricane was stronger than I ever imagined. I thought it would withstand it. But it didn't - down it went.""
He now spends most of his days looking for clean water and milk for his two-month-old baby Jocelyn. Eight weeks after Hurricane Maria, Jose and his family are among the millions of Puerto Ricans still reeling from the storm and its aftermath.
It's hard to believe that this is a United States territory, that these people are American citizens. Many on the US mainland aren't even aware of the legal responsibility that the US government - which is in charge of Puerto Rico - has towards Puerto Ricans.
President Donald Trump was criticised for treating the island differently to other disaster zones on the mainland. He arrived in Puerto Rico a full two weeks after the hurricane, and at one event, threw paper towels at crowds who were without food, water, or electricity.
As those images were broadcast on television screens and streamed online, frustration turned to anger.
The more people I spoke to, the more I realised that many on the island feel that they are not part of the US and that they're treated like second-class citizens.
Chief among these is Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan. Soon after Maria struck the island, she entered a Twitter war with Mr Trump about what she regarded as his weak response to the crisis. President Trump described the mayor as ""nasty"" and alleged the island was broken long before the hurricane.
When I asked her if he was wrong to suggest Puerto Rico had existing issues, she told me: ""What is incorrect is for a president who is supposed to be the commander-in-chief to become the hater-in-chief and to become the person who just tweets away their hate. That's what's incorrect.""
Ultimately, how Puerto Ricans on the island feel about President Trump makes very little difference to whether he stays in office. They can't vote in presidential elections, since the territory has no votes in the electoral college.
But tens of thousands have already fled to the mainland following the devastation caused by the hurricane. There of course, they do have a say.
For the majority of the three-and-a-half million Puerto Ricans in the territory, it feels as though time has stopped. Rotting debris can be seen outside almost every property, as though the hurricane had only just happened.
There are concerns that the piles of rubbish could lead to a public health crisis. This island may belong to the most powerful country in the world but its citizens lack even the most basic of things.
All across the island, I spot dozens of people: men, women and children collecting water from open springs and from the sides of the mountains. The authorities have warned against using the water for drinking purposes, saying it may be contaminated.
Some are profiting from this scarcity. I spoke to one man who said he knows of people who are exploiting the elderly and the disabled by selling them gallons of potentially contaminated water collected from these points.
All this has led to deaths linked to lack of clean water. The official death toll is 55 but that's just people whose deaths have been verified by autopsy. The mayor of San Juan says it could be as high as 500. Cases of leptospirosis, a deadly bacterial disease often transmitted through contaminated water, have shot up since the hurricane.
So what is America doing to help? The Puerto Ricans I spoke to say not enough. They tell me they have felt neglected by the United States for decades, and now the island is in a deep financial crisis.
For most of the 20th Century, American companies which moved to the territory received significant tax breaks. They created jobs and became part of the island's fabric. Ten years ago, these incentives came to an end, and big corporations fled, taking with them hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Mass unemployment, mixed with decades of excessive borrowing by the local government, meant Puerto Rico was facing bankruptcy even before Maria hit. The island now owes Wall Street more than $72bn (Â£55bn).
The electricity grid was in such a bad shape that hundreds of thousands of people faced frequent blackouts. Many people didn't have access to clean running water. The hurricane has further exposed the difficulties that this island faces.
This is a catastrophe that has impacted everyone. Even the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), Alejandro De La Campa, who is tasked with providing relief and aid, told me he has no power.
""This is the largest Fema response in the Caribbean, the most catastrophic event in Puerto Rico and probably in the US,"" he says.
He pushes back when I question him about the criticism directed at Fema for not reacting quickly enough to the needs of Puerto Ricans, saying he and his team remain committed.
Many residents across this island told me they had almost resigned themselves to the fact that they may be without electricity for up to a year. Rebuilding Puerto Rico is an unprecedented task - and questions remain whether those enlisted to do it are up to the challenge.
Yalda Hakim's report, Rebuilding Puerto Rico, is on Our World on the BBC News Channel at 04:30 and 21:30 on Saturday 11 November and will be available to watch later on BBC iPlayer."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn track and field a sprinter setting a new world record in the 100 or 200-meter dash by a few hundredths of a second is already considered a sensation.
Now imagine a sprinter breaking the 100 or 200-meter dash record by a whole half second, or a pole-vaulter beating the old record not by an inch or two, which would be spectacular, but by an entire foot! That would be unworldly and observers would call it a mutation leap forward.

Antarctic sea ice takes a mutation leap. Source: Cryosphere
This is precisely what has just happened with sea ice growth at the South Pole around Antarctica.
Not only was last year’s all-time high sea ice record beaten this year, but smashed it by such a wide a margin that is meteorologically unworldly. If anyone is searching for a sign of a “tipping point”, this could be one. Unfortunately the tip seems to be in the opposite direction!
At least week’s Saturday Summary, Joe Bastardi even compared the South Pole’s new record to King Kong belting a 700-foot home run out of the ballpark. Not wanting to get too carried away, we have to keep in mind that we are looking here at the satellite record only, which goes back to 1979. Yet, it is still truly amazing by any standard.
Of course everyone’s question now is: Why has this happened? Unfortunately no one has an answer or even plausible hypotheses. It is mysterious. What is clear, however, is that once again alarmist global warming climatologists, who 10 years ago predicted a meltdown was imminent, are embarrassed and speechless. The same can be said about the media.
Never has the consensus been so unsettled.

From the University of Washington: Santa’s workshop not flooded – but lots of melting in the Arctic

By Hannah Hickey

Santa’s workshop at the North Pole is not under water, despite recent reports. A dramatic image captured by a University of Washington monitoring buoy reportedly shows a lake at the North Pole. But Santa doesn’t yet need to buy a snorkel.
“Every summer when the sun melts the surface the water has to go someplace, so it accumulates in these ponds,” said Jamie Morison, a polar scientist at the UW Applied Physics Laboratory and principal investigator since 2000 of the North Pole Environmental Observatory. “This doesn’t look particularly extreme.”
NSF North Pole Environmental Observatory The view from webcam 2 on July 26 shows open water on the ice.
After media coverage in CBS News, The Atlantic and the U.K.’s Daily Mail, Morison returned from overseas travel late last week to a pile of media inquiries. Over the weekend the team posted an explanatory page on the project website.
One of the issues in interpreting the image, researchers said, is that the camera uses a fisheye lens.
“The picture is slightly distorted,” said Axel Schweiger, who heads the Applied Physics Laboratory’s Polar Science Center. “In the background you see what looks like mountains, and that’s where the scale problem comes in – those are actually ridges where the ice was pushed together.”
Researchers estimate the melt pond in the picture was just over 2 feet deep and a few hundred feet wide, which is not unusual to find on an Arctic ice floe in late July.

In the midst of all the concern, the pool drained late July 27. This is the normal cycle for a meltwater pond that forms from snow and ice — it eventually drains through cracks or holes in the ice it has pooled on.
The now-infamous buoy was first plunked into floating ice in April, at the beginning of the melt season, about 25 miles from the North Pole. Morison drilled a hole about three football fields away for a second camera, which is pointing in a different direction and shows a more typical scene. Since then the ice floe holding both cameras has drifted about 375 miles south.


North Pole Environmental Observatory
Watch an April interview with Jamie Morison when he was deploying the buoy


The U.S. National Science Foundation has funded an observatory since 2000 that makes yearly observations at fixed locations and installs 10 to 15 drifting buoys.
The buoys record weather, ice, and ocean data, and the webcams transmit images via satellite every 6 hours. Images show the ice, buoys and yardsticks placed in the snow to track the surface conditions throughout the summer melt season. Maybe the instruments will survive the summer without getting crushed by shifting ice to record data for another year. Maybe they will fall in the water and eventually wash ashore. Researchers place the buoys to try to maximize their useful lifetime.
While researchers say the so-called lake at the North Pole is not out of the ordinary, there is a lot of meltwater that could affect the sea ice in coming weeks, in the closely watched lead-up to the September ice minimum.
Last summer the sea-ice hit a record low in extent since measurements began in 1979. This year the melting started a bit later than usual, Schweiger said, but picked up in the last couple of weeks. Late summer is usually the strongest period of shrinking because the ice is already thin.
“Whether we’re going to see another record or not is still up in the air,” Schweiger said.

A. Schweiger, UW
An aerial photo taken July 16 shows extensive meltwater pools off the Alaskan coast.
He flew over the ice last month in a joint project with the U.S. Coast Guard to drop instruments that measure oceanic and atmospheric conditions and ice motion.
Morison was last on the ice in April when he deployed the buoys. His forecast for this summer, based on years of experience, is included on a list of expert predictions compiled by the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration’s Seattle office.
Morison will not change his June estimate that this summer will come close to, but not pass, the 2012 record, but he is having his doubts. Looking at the photos from the recent flyover shows more melt along the Alaskan coast, and his experience suggests that ice is fragile.
“I think it’s going to be pretty close to last year,” Morison said. “Up in the Canada Basin the ice looks like Swiss cheese, with lots of holes. Even though the ice extent is pretty good, our thinking is that if there’s a big storm event we’re going to see a rapid breakup of that ice and it’s going to disappear pretty quickly.”
The UW team manages another sea-ice tracking tool. The U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center publishes daily images and calculations of sea-ice extent and area, while the UW group combines those satellite images and other data to tabulate sea-ice volume. For many people, the UW’s monthly updates are a go-to source for getting the latest numbers on sea ice.
And while the North Pole lake news stories don’t exactly hold water, UW researchers say that it at least shows public interest and concern.
“While the hoopla about Santa’s swimming pool was off the mark,” Morison said, “it is the long-term observational record from these buoys that provides the perspective needed to understand what really is going on.”

"**Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown.**
A tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into force in the nation, with businesses including hairdressers and beauty salons also able to open.
More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households.
The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"".
Meanwhile, the UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.
The first 800,000 doses will be available in the UK from next week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
England's new three-tiered system was backed by MPs in a Commons vote just hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan.
There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark.
And people arrived promptly to take advantage of a stock clearance sale at Debenhams department store from 07:00 GMT.
Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown.
It comes after a period which has seen the collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group, women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© and the failure of Debenhams to secure a buyer \- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk.
Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, but down by 24.1% on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard.
Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates.
She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online.""
Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy.
""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said.
""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month.""
Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.
Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand.
There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels.
British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers, with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"".
Pubs and restaurants are now allowed to reopen in tier one and two areas, although in tier two alcohol can only be served with a ""substantial meal"".
The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus.
And later on Wednesday about 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football League for the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March.
England's new coronavirus restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November.
Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Scotland operates a five-tier system while Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus restrictions \- with the latter currently in a two-week circuit breaker lockdown.
On Tuesday, a further 13,430 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK while a further 603 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 59,051.

"The theory that the Americas were populated by humans crossing from Siberia to Alaska across a land bridge was first proposed as far back as 1590, and has been generally accepted since the 1930s. But genetic evidence shows there is no direct ancestral link between the people of ancient East Asia and modern Native Americans. A comparison of DNA from 600 modern Native Americans with ancient DNA recovered from a late Stone Age human skeleton from Mal'ta near Lake Baikal in southern Siberia shows that Native Americans diverged genetically from their Asian ancestors around 25,000 years ago, just as the last ice age was reaching its peak. Based on archaeological evidence, humans did not survive the last ice age’s peak in northeastern Siberia, and yet there is no evidence they had reached Alaska or the rest of the New World either. While there is evidence to suggest northeast Siberia was inhabited during a warm period about 30,000 years ago before the last ice age peaked, after this the archaeological record goes silent, and only returns 15,000 years ago, after the last ice age ended. So where did the ancestors of the Native Americans go for 15,000 years, after they split from the rest of their Asian relatives? As John Hoffecker, Dennis O'Rourke and I argue in an article for Science, the answer seems to be that they lived on the Bering Land Bridge, the region between Siberia and Alaska that was dry land when sea levels were lower, as much of the world’s freshwater was locked up in ice, but which now lies underneath the waters of the Bering and Chukchi Seas. This theory has become increasingly supported by genetic evidence. The Bering Land Bridge, also known as central part of Beringia, is thought to have been up to 600 miles wide. Based on evidence from sediment cores drilled into the now submerged landscape, it seems that here and in some adjacent regions of Alaska and Siberia the landscape at the height of the last glaciation 21,000 years ago was shrub tundra – as found in Arctic Alaska today. This is dominated by dwarf shrubs such as willow and birch, only a few centimetres tall. There is evidence that there may have been some stands of spruce trees in these regions too in some protected microhabitats, where temperatures were milder than the regions around. The presence of a particular group of beetle species that live in shrub tundra habitats today in Alaska, and are associated with a specific range of temperatures, also supports the idea that the area was a refuge for both flora and fauna. This kind of vegetation would not have supported the large, grazing animals – woolly mammoth, woolly rhino, Pleistocene horses, camels, and bison. These animals lived on the vegetation of the steppe-tundra which dominated the interior of Alaska and the Yukon, as well as interior regions of northeast Siberia. This shrub tundra would have supported elk, perhaps some bighorn sheep, and small mammals. But it had the one resource people needed most to keep warm: wood. The wood and bark of dwarf shrubs would have been used to start fires that burned large mammal bones. The fats inside these bones won’t ignite unless they are heated to high temperatures, and for that you need a woody fire. And there is evidence from archaeological sites that people burned bones as fuel – the charred remains of leg bones have been found in many ancient hearths. It is the heat from these fires that kept these intrepid hunter-gatherers alive through the bitter cold of Arctic winter nights. The last ice age ended and the land bridge began to disappear beneath the sea, some 13,000 years ago. Global sea levels rose as the vast continental ice sheets melted, liberating billions of gallons of fresh water. As the land bridge flooded, the entire Beringian region grew more warm and moist, and the shrub tundra vegetation spread rapidly, out-competing the steppe-tundra plants that had dominated the interior lowlands of Beringia. While this spelled the end of the woolly mammoths and other large grazing animals, it probably also provided the impetus for human migration. As retreating glaciers opened new routes into the continent, humans travelled first into the Alaskan interior and the Yukon, and ultimately south out of the Arctic region and toward the temperate regions of the Americas. The first definitive archaeological evidence we have for the presence of people beyond Beringia and interior Alaska comes from this time, about 13,000 years ago. These people are called Paleoindians by archaeologists. The genetic evidence records mutations in mitochondrial DNA passed from mother to offspring that are present in today’s Native Americans but not in the Mal'ta remains. This indicates a population isolated from the Siberian mainland for thousands of years, who are the direct ancestors of nearly all of the Native American tribes in both North and South America – the original “first peoples”.

If ever you wondered how important institutions were for changing the climate of ideas, the Chronicle of Higher Education released a cover article today, “How Conservatives Captured the Law,” that should settle the question. Written by Michael Avery and Danielle McLaughlin – she a Boston attorney, he a Suffolk University law professor and former president of the far left National Lawyers Guild, whom I’ve debated more than once – it’s a surprisingly dispassionate chronicle of the growth and influence of the Federalist Society over the past 30 years.   
  
  
Cato, our outreach, and our _Supreme Court Review_ come in for mention early on. And the Legal Studies Institute of The Fund for American Studies, in which I co‐​teach, gets credit at the outset. But the main focus is understandably on the Federalist Society. Reflecting on its origins at the society’s 25th anniversary gala, Justice Antonin Scalia remarked, “We thought we were just planting a wildflower among the weeds of academic liberalism, and it turned out to be an oak.” It did indeed, with a membership today of more than 50,000 lawyers and law students, lawyer chapters in 75 cities, and student chapters in every accredited law school in the country, the society last year held nearly 2,000 events, including many involving Cato people.   
  
  
The authors’ dispassionate account notwithstanding, it takes little imagination to see where they stand:   




The Federalist Society’s membership includes many brilliant and sincere theorists who raise important and interesting issues. On the other hand, the society’s critics say, its overall impact is reactionary. By glorifying private property, demonizing government intervention (particularly at the federal level), insisting that originalism is the only legitimate method of constitutional interpretation, embracing American exceptionalism as a reason to remain apart from global governance, and pushing related policies, these critics say, the society advocates a form of social Darwinism that has been discredited by mainstream American legal thought since the 1930s.



Social Darwinism? That must be how Progressives see the eclectic group that speaks and debates through the Federalist Society’s auspices, because without so much as a beat in between, the authors continue:   




Membership includes economic conservatives, social conservatives, Christian conservatives, and libertarians, many of whom disagree with one another on significant issues, but who cooperate in advancing a broad conservative agenda. They generally support individual rights and a free market, and prefer states’ rights to action by the federal government.



We do indeed, discrediting the “Darwinism” – the Hobbesian war of all against all – that is the product today of the jurisprudence of the 1930s. And in that cooperation there is a lesson. To be sure, we don’t always agree. But we agree on enough to be able to work together to get something done. Read the whole piece to see how much has been done.

Share this...FacebookTwitterStep by step warmist scientists are no longer able to deny the fact that powerful natural oscillations do play a far greater role in climate than what they were allowed in climate models.
The GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel quietly issued a press release last week claiming that its scientists had found a method to improve climate forecasts and to tell how temperatures develop over the North Atlantic.

GEOMAR scientists see North Atlantic cooling over next decade. Photo: NASA
For the strength of a hurricane season, precipitation in West Africa, or winters in Central Europe – the surface temperatures of the North Atlantic are a decisive factor for all these developments. Geomar is realizing that they do indeed naturally fluctuate over periods of decades, in sync with the climate of the adjacent land regions.
A reliable forecast of North Atlantic conditions had been elusive because of a lack of recorded data. Now the climate scientists at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel describe in the international journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters the mechanism of these decadal oscillations of the North Atlantic surface temperatures and show that these have a high forecasting potential.
Climate “subject to natural oscillation”
For the climate and also for the weather in Europe, processes in the North Atlantic play a major role. The Gulf Stream and surface temperatures of the North Atlantic have profound impacts on the neighboring continents. The GEOMAR press release writes:
All these processes are subject to natural oscillations that play out over years, decades, or even centuries. ‘Concrete datasets often go back only a few decades,’ says climate scientist Professor Dr. Mojib Latif of GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. ‘That’s why it’s very difficult to assess oscillations over longer time domains and to differentiate them from changes caused by man.“
Suddenly we see an admission from Prof. Latif here that natural factors do matter – and especially in models.
Reliable simulation for the coming decade
The press release then writes that the team of modeling experts at GEOMAR have succeeded in developing a “reliable simulation of the surface temperatures in the North Atlantic since 1900 and that allows prognoses until the end of the coming decade.”
That’s wonderful. Now we are all very curious what their new model foresees for the next ten years.
Keep reading to find out!

Latif admits models have been wrong
Professor Latif elaborates further on their new model, as opposed to the existing ones:
That’s new. Particular about simulation is that the existing climate models have deviated strongly from the surface temperatures.”
In a nutshell: The other models so far have been worthless.
The press release describes the North Atlantic Oscillation and its important influence on continental Europe’s weather and how the scientists have data on this going back to the middle of the 19th century. This allows the modellers to reconstruct North Atlantic surface temperature oscillations in a climate model and to make a prognoses for the future. Latif and his team suggest that the Gulf Stream plays a huge role on the NAO and that Europe’s weather is governed in large part by these oceanic cycles. Latif explains.
The coupling to the NAO allows a reliable reconstruction of the North Atlantic currents between the year 1900 and 2010, even though concrete data goes back only to 2004. The oscillations in the ocean currents mainly govern the surface temperatures, thus allowing them to be derived and even be calculated five years in advance.”
Model foresees “negative trend”.
So what does their model see? Latif tells, doing his very best to disguise what warmists certainly dread and do not want to hear (my emphasis):
Our model tells us that the phase with a rather high surface temperatures in the North Atlantic will continue also over the coming decade, however with a lightly negative trend.”
The paper’s abstract presents the prognosis as follows:
The present warm phase of the AMO is predicted to continue until the end of the next decade, but with a negative tendency.”
That means “COOLING”!
A stunning conclusion by Latif, even in its disguised form. Just two and half years ago Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s book Die kalte Sonne (The Neglected Sun) reached the same conclusion. Back then Latif, in a lapse of professionalism, publicly belittled the two authors. Perhaps Latif is now ready to apologize, and/or at least next time read the book first before firing criticism at its authors.

Well not sure quite how I missed it but apparently an entire year has gone by since the _Whaleoil Raceteam_ ventured out in the mighty Mustang for a week of doing skids down here on the Big Island. But time has definitely passed us by and here we are again, gearing up for nearly 2000 km of good old fashioned hoonery, starting on Labour Monday at the Great Lakes Centre in Taupo.



This year we will be leaving my car Bruce behind in the South Island and will be utilising his slightly younger sister, Bruchetta, a 1997 Ford Mustang Cobra, which just happens to belong to your very own Mod, HR.



This car was built as a zero car for Targa back in the day alongside my own car, so we are pretty lucky to have a choice of awesome V8’y goodness with which to help create our own little climate crisis. I asked Greta if she would like to come for a wee ride but she said, “How dare you!”



This year’s event starts in Taupo on Monday 28th with documentation and scrutineering and will finish up down the road in Palmerston North, after taking the long way round, via New Plymouth, Wanganui, Whangamomona etc. We will get to enjoy over 760 kilometres of closed road race stages including classics like ‘Cop Corner’ and the ‘Inglewood Jumps’, plus another 1200-odd km of touring.



A big change for us this year is we have been promoted from our usual position as one of the official midpoint cars in the non-competitive Tour part of the event, up to being a ‘double zero’ car for the competition.



This means that we will be the first car through at race speed and will enter the stages after the promo cars have gone in. Our job will be to ensure the course is clear, and as a warning to spectators that the racers will be with them about five minutes later.



You will find some maps below of the locations and stages for each day, and daily reports can be found on the Targa [website ](https://targa.nz/)or Facebook [page](https://www.facebook.com/TargaNZ/posts/2553612898058085?__tn__=K-R).



So if you’re looking for something cool to do with the kids, whip them out of school for the day and come check out what good old capitalism can get you, because for sure there are some pretty flash rides out there.



And if you see the bright red and white Mustang be sure to give us a wave and stop by to say gidday during the lunch breaks etc.

As annoying children are wont to do, the gibbering nutbars of the [Krazy Klimate Kult](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/be-very-afraid-of-the-new-kkk/), “Extinction Rebellion”, have spent the past few weeks throwing tanties and generally getting under everyone’s feet. These loons would simply be dismissed as just another nutty religious cult if they’d just stop inconveniencing everyone else.



Well, might I suggest they follow the example of another bunch of end-of-the-world crazies?



A farmer has been arrested in the Netherlands after police discovered six young adults who had been living in his isolated cellar for nine years.



The group, who appear to be siblings aged between 18 and 25, had apparently been in underground rooms accessible only by a hidden staircase. It was unclear whether they had been held under duress. Some were not registered with the authorities at birth, were said to have “no idea that other people existed” and were waiting for the “end of days”.



The Klimate Kult are likewise waiting for the end of days. Perhaps they ought to adopt this Dutch family as their patron saints? They seem to have a lot in common, after all.



A 25-year-old man with wild hair and a dirty beard had escaped from the house and drunk five beers at the bar before asking for help.



I take that back: the Extinction Rebellion lot are mostly millennials: they **never** leave their parents’ houses.



But there are still plenty more similarities.



“He was very confused […]You could see he had no idea where he was or what he was doing”[…]he had never been to school[…]



He sounds like the ideal climate striker.



Police said the family had not seen the world outside the farmhouse for nine years.



The remote farmstead near Ruinerwold, about 32k from the German border, was surrounded by high fences and CCTV cameras. It was rented by a 58-year-old man, who visited every day in a Volvo to tend a goat, several geese and a large vegetable plot.



The tenant, who is not the father of the six, was taken into custody for “failing to co-operate” with the police investigation.



Failing to co-operate with police? Right on, brother!



Awaiting the end of the world in all that rural isolation sounds like the ideal sustainable solution for the Extinction Rebellion nutters. If nothing else, it’d certainly buy the rest of us some much-needed peace and quiet from their absurd tantrums.

"**The mayor of the Puerto Rican capital San Juan says President Donald Trump's response to the hurricane that devastated the US territory last year is a ""stain on his presidency"".**
Carmen Yulin Cruz's comments came a day after officials said 2,975 people had died in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria last September.
The revised death toll is nearly 50 times the previous estimate of 64.
""The Trump administration killed the Puerto Rican with neglect,"" she said.
Speaking to CNN, she added: ""The Trump administration led us to believe that they were helping when they weren't really up to par.""
The territory has struggled to repair its infrastructure and power grid since the storm, and is asking US Congress for $139bn (Â£108bn) in recovery funds.
Ms Cruz criticised Mr Trump personally for his response to the crisis, referencing a photo op during which the president threw rolls of paper towels to a crowd of hurricane survivors.
On Wednesday Mr Trump defended his administration saying: ""I think we did a fantastic job in Puerto Rico.""
""We have put billions and billions of dollars into Puerto Rico and it was a very tough one,"" he continued, adding ""I think most of the people in Puerto Rico really appreciate what we've done.""
""I only hope they don't get hit again,"" said Mr Trump.
""Shame on President Trump for not even once - not even yesterday - just saying: 'Look, I grieve with the people of Puerto Rico.'"" said Ms Cruz.
""This will be a stain on his presidency for as long as he lives. Because rather than come here to support us, he came here to throw paper towels at us, and we will never forget and we will always remember.""
President Trump praised the federal response to the hurricane-ravaged island in the weeks following the storm. But critics accused him of showing more concern for residents in Texas and Florida after they were hit by hurricanes.
But on Wednesday Mr Trump contrasted the two responses, saying ""Puerto Rico was actually more difficult because of the fact it was an island"".
During a visit to Puerto Rico in October, Mr Trump suggested officials should be ""proud"" the death toll - at the time only 16 - was not as high as ""a real catastrophe"" like Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
The authorities have faced criticism for underreporting the toll of Maria - the most powerful storm to hit the region in nearly 90 years.
Until Tuesday, the official figure was 64. It was limited to those killed directly by the hurricane, crushed by collapsing buildings, drowned or hit by flying debris.
The island had previously acknowledged the death toll was probably much higher. In the wake of the disaster, some experts estimated as many as 4,600 deaths.
The latest findings - accepted by the island's authorities - were made in a report by experts from George Washington University, which the governor commissioned.
This counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor health care and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis.
Doctors are also said to have ""lacked awareness"" on how to appropriately certify deaths attributed to natural disasters.
Researchers tracked the number of deaths using death certificates and other mortality data between mid-September 2017 to mid-February of this year.
The Caribbean island is home to 3.3 million people, some 8% of which have since left the island, the study said.
It also said that those from poorer backgrounds in Puerto Rico were 45% more likely to have been killed in the aftermath of the hurricane.
The governor of Puerto Rico said he would sign an executive order to create a committee to examine and put into practice the report's recommendations."
"The Morrison government is designing a support package for the tourism sector that might include consumer incentives to take holidays in some Australian regions to offset the loss of revenue from international visitors. In an interview with Guardian Australia’s politics podcast, the tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, said the sector was a special case because it was hit first by the catastrophic summer bushfires and then by the public health measures invoked to flatten the curve of Covid-19 infections.  He said the government’s objective in developing the assistance package was crafting stimulus measures to offset the revenue loss from overseas visitors given the international border was likely to remain closed for some time. Birmingham noted that Australians spent $65bn on overseas holidays last year, and international visitors spent $45bn in Australia. He said if Australians spent two-thirds of what they spent going overseas on domestic travel “you would have the same level of expenditure happening in Australian businesses”. “Now whether we can actually get people to do that, whether it is in the right places and the right regions and the same business is part of the challenge, and what we are working through right now.” The north Queensland MP Warren Entsch, whose electorate relies on tourism, has called for the jobkeeper wage subsidy to be extended beyond September. He says it is unlikely the sector will recover before next March. While arguing tourism was a special case, Birmingham suggested if jobkeeper were to be extended in the sector, it would not be in its current form. There is concern in the government that the wage subsidy creates an incentive for businesses to suppress their turnover in order to qualify for the payment, which goes to the balance sheet of the business, and for employees to decline shifts. Birmingham said income support for the next phase of the crisis needed to provide an incentive for people to return to work and “any future support is going to have to be more targeted, more proportionate and more carefully structured”. The looming assistance packages for sectors such as entertainment and tourism, and the unwinding of the fiscal support offered to Australians during the pandemic, were discussed by cabinet and the expenditure review committee this week, but the government is yet to reach a decision. The prime minister told reporters on Thursday he was not going to be rushed into any decisions, but he gave a broad hint workers were more likely to be given income support through a welfare payment than a wages subsidy once the transition was executed. Birmingham said the best way to drive economic recovery in the tourism sector was to try and normalise trading conditions and that was becoming more possible with the reopening of state borders. He said some tourism businesses would not survive the shock of the pandemic and the government should not be in the business of propping up unviable businesses. Birmingham also holds the trade portfolio, and this week opened negotiations on a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom. Australia is also pursuing a trade deal with the European Union. Europe has flagged it will use the free trade agreement to cement Australia’s support for emissions reduction targets agreed to under the Paris accord. The EU has flagged it wants the “respect and full implementation of the Paris agreement” underscored in the text of the agreement. The UK is also a pace-setter in global climate talks. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, contends signatories to the Paris agreement, including Australia, agreed to hit net zero “in the second half of the century”. But scientists say that signatories will need to hit net zero by 2050 to meet the central Paris goal of keeping global temperatures rises to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C – a commitment Australia adopted in 2015. Taylor says it is not Australia’s policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, despite signing up to the Paris agreement, because the Morrison government will not adopt a mid-century target in advance of a plan to achieve it. Asked whether climate was likely to become a flashpoint in the trade talks, Birmingham said that wasn’t his expectation. “In both cases I would expect that we will make some commitments around environmental measures, and in the main, those commitments will be restating existing commitments that Australia has made as part of other international obligations,” he said. “I don’t see this as an obstacle at this time.” Birmingham said there might be shared technology opportunities to explore in newer fuel sources like hydrogen. He said Australia did not as a matter of principle settle domestic policy through trade agreements. “We will talk about [our international climate commitments] and if there are areas that align with trade policy that we can reach agreement on … we do so, and sometimes that involves restating commitments that we’ve given in other international instruments to acknowledge that we are equally committed to those other instruments, but it is not the case that we suddenly sit down and start negotiating the Paris accord as part of the Australia/EU free trade agreement.”"

Environmentally friendly cars as death boxes
First is that people who drive small cars in order to save the climate are seriously putting themselves at risk, or even dying if involved in a serious accident. That’s the result of newly conducted crash tests reported here at Spiegel. Citing crash test results from the US Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and the EuroNCAP Test 2014, Spiegel tells us that the Mazda 5 fared the worst.
Also among the worst-performing cars were “environmentally-friendly” electric cars like the Renault Twizy 80, top-selling electric car Nissan Leaf, and the Nissan e-NV200 Evalia. People who drive such cars with the aim of not killing the climate are actually risking getting killed, because the cars don’t adequately protect the occupants.
Also potential death boxes exposed by the crash tests were a number of compact models, e.g. made by FIAT or Renault. Indeed drivers are far better off behind the wheel of a good German-built car, which today are also very fuel efficient.
White German Christmases not more seldom

On a different subject, Spiegel here reports on 5 myths concerning Christmas. One of them it turns out is that white Christmases are not less frequent today than they were 100 years ago. Spiegel writers Axel Bojanowski and Holger Dambeck tell us:
The longing for a white Christmas gets traced back to a postcard; indeed on Christmas Eve in the German lowlands it is traditionally green. Weather data show: Despite global warming white Christmases over the last 100 years have not become more seldom.”
The Spiegel authors write that the chances of a white Christmas in Germany as a rule increase the further inland one goes away from the North Sea. Chances of a white Christmas are especially high in the Alps. The idyllic impression of a German white Christmas stems from an 1863 Vermont (my home state) postcard, Spiegel writes. I checked the weather records myself and the frequency of a white Christmas at the northern port city of Bremen, for example, is roughly twice every decade.
A short post today, but certainly a couple of points here you can use to annoy the global warming family members, friends or acquaintances at this evening’s festivities.
Well, I see the sparkling wine is now getting close to the ideal temperature. HAPPY NEW YEAR everyone, and cheers!

"The likelihood of the UK experiencing deadly 40C temperatures for the first time is “rapidly accelerating” due to the climate crisis, scientists have found. The research shows that such searing heat could become a regular occurrence by the end of the century unless carbon emissions are cut to zero. Global heating has already made UK heatwaves 30 times more likely and extreme temperatures led to 3,400 early deaths from 2016-19.  The highest temperature recorded in the UK is 38.7C, set in Cambridge in July 2019, while the summer of 2018 was the joint hottest on record. The new analysis found an increasing risk of even higher temperatures. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change. Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America. When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage. Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK, it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather. Today, a high of 40C is expected once every few centuries. But this would be every 15 years in a medium emissions scenario, in which carbon cuts are made but not enough to meet the 1.5C or 2C limits agreed by nations in the 2015 Paris climate deal. In a worst-case scenario, with emissions continuing the trend of recent decades unchecked, somewhere in the UK would reach 40C every 3.5 years. The new analysis follows research in 2019 that used the same medium emissions scenario to indicate that by 2050 London will have the same climate that Istanbul has today, Leeds will be like Melbourne, Cardiff like Montevideo in Uruguay, and Edinburgh like Paris. All these foreign cities have already broken 40C. “The probability of recording 40C, or above, in the UK is now rapidly accelerating,” said the scientists in the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. Its lead author, Nikolaos Christidis, at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: “The rate of change is remarkable.” “Last year, we had the record temperature in the UK and [Public Health England] reported spikes in mortality,” Christidis said. “When these kinds of events happen, we have detrimental impacts to our transport infrastructure, agricultural catastrophes and water shortages. We need to reduce our vulnerability to these kinds of impacts.” Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds and not part of the Met Office study, said: “Heatwaves are a real risk to life in the UK, especially if we do not begin modifying our homes, workplaces and hospitals to manage their expected overheating.” The government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said on 25 June “the UK is poorly prepared for the very serious impacts of climate change, including … overheating”. “However, we should note that in terms of heatwaves, the UK will get off lightly compared with most other nations,” said Forster. “Heatwaves in the major crop-growing regions of the world could have more profound effects, both globally and for the UK.” The Met Office research combined temperature measurements at 1km scale across the UK with 16 large-scale climate models to calculate the likelihood of an extreme temperature being reached somewhere in the nation in a particular year. The significantly larger risk in the high-emissions scenario compared with the medium-emissions scenario shows cutting carbon emissions makes a big difference in reducing the frequency of extreme heat, from breaching 40C once every 3.5 years to once every 15 years. The scientists also examined the likelihood of exceeding 35C. This occurs in the UK about every five years at present, but would be an annual occurrence by the end of the century in either emissions scenario. The south-east and south regions of the UK are most affected by the rising heat, because other regions benefit more from the cooling influence of the Atlantic ocean. The study found that many areas in the north for which 30C is extremely rare may exceed that level at least once per decade by 2100. Some scientists argue that the high-emissions scenario is unrealistic given the action being taken by nations to at least curb carbon emissions. However, Forster said: “Fortunately, the increasing use of fossil fuels portrayed in [the high-emissions scenario] is unlikely, but the average temperature levels seen at the end of the century under this scenario still remain a real risk if some of the worst-case amplification effects in the Earth system come to pass, such as massive permafrost thawing.”"
"HOUSTON  —   There was the game on the field, and there was the one watched through the political prism of these times. On social media, the Atlanta Falcons were not just the N. F. C. champions, they were   for   ferment, coming from a staunchly Democratic city and facing a Patriots team whose owner, head coach and starting quarterback are all friends with the president, to varying degrees. “Falcons are fun and their biggest stars aren’t pro Trump,” JayZito wrote on Twitter. “I’m a Falcons fan today. ” Not long before the game started, President Trump, in an interview on Fox, which was broadcasting the game, predicted a Patriot win by 8 points in part out of support for his friends. That prediction was the object of ridicule as Atlanta surged ahead, but then it ended up appearing prescient as the Patriots stormed back to win,   in the first Super Bowl overtime. Mr. Trump did not attend the game, opting for a traditional    party near his    vacation home in South Florida. (Social media users dissected a picture of Mr. Trump and his family not looking enthusiastic at a table there and took sometimes harsh note of Mr. Trump’s departure with nearly an hour and a half left in the game.) Vice President Mike Pence attended the game and drew some boos when he was shown on a stadium screen talking with James Baker, who served as secretary of state under former President George Bush. Mr. Bush did the opening coin toss from a wheelchair on the field, accompanied by the former first lady Barbara Bush. A succession of commercials with themes of inclusion, immigration and multiculturalism were seen by many viewers as commentary on Trump’s executive orders restricting immigration and his calls for a wall along the Mexican border. One commercial made by   follows the path of one of the company’s   Adolphus Busch, as he immigrated from Germany to the United States. The ad was criticized by some   commentators who created a hashtag, #BoycottBudweiser. The actor Morgan Freeman appeared in a commercial for Turkish Airlines, speaking about “bridging worlds and finding delight in our differences. ” Before, during and after the game, people talked about an ad for the   company 84 Lumber that featured imagery of a Mexican mother and daughter on a journey north for a better life in the United States. The company deleted some scenes depicting a border wall but included the full ad on its website. The   website Breitbart News, in its live coverage of the game, grew exasperated. “These commercials have been a bonanza of leftist activism: two immigration commercials, a feminist commercial, now an eco wacko commercial? Am I missing anything?” one of the editors wrote. About the only aspect of the game that generated a surprisingly more muted political discussion than expected was the one everybody seemed to think would cause a stir: the halftime show by Lady Gaga, a persistent critic of Mr. Trump. With a dash of patriotic imagery  —   red and blue drones forming the shape of the United States  —   she mostly stuck to her hits, with only a few gestures that some interpreted as subtle digs at the president. During her song “Million Reasons” she hugged a woman of uncertain ethnicity and sang, “Why don’t you stay,” a move that people on Twitter thought was a statement about race and immigration. The N. F. L. tried in its own way to unify the country for a few hours. Fans at the stadium were given small flags to wave during the singing of the national anthem, and when the teams ran onto the field, they were led by soldiers and sailors holding large American flags. The league even ran a   commercial called “Inside These Lines” to show that “the power of football” can “bring people together. ” Still, outside the stadium it was another story. The president’s unabashed support for the Patriots turned into a punch line on social media when the Patriots fell behind by 25 points early in the second half. Some fans accused the president of jinxing the team. In Houston, hundreds of people protested the president and his policies near the stadium, crossing paths with thousands of fans heading to the game. Chants of “Black Lives Matter” were applauded by Falcons fans. Similar protests took place last week near an N. F. L.  park downtown. Atlanta, the capital of a solidly red state, was suddenly adopted as a darling of   football fans. One commenter on Twitter joked, “The Falcons respect an independent judiciary,” a dig at the president’s criticism of the federal judge in Seattle who temporarily halted the refugee ban. Some Patriots fans, uneasy with their team’s link to the president, encouraged fellow fans to donate to organizations like the N. A. A. C. P. and Planned Parenthood each time the Patriots scored. After the game, Martellus Bennett, a tight end for the Patriots, reiterated his vow not to attend the customary congratulatory ceremony at the White House, because he opposes Mr. Trump. Still, at the end Mr. Trump exulted, once again stoking support and derision. “What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots,’’ he wrote on Twitter. “Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!”"
"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.**
It is now expected that the first vaccinations of people in Scotland will take place on Tuesday 8 December.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the process would begin with those who will be administering the vaccine, followed by those with the greatest clinical need.
The jab - which is given in two doses several weeks apart - offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness.
The NHS has been on standby to begin vaccinating people as soon as supplies of approved vaccines become available.
Ms Sturgeon said that if Scotland receives the vaccine when it expects, the first doses will be administered on 8 December.
Early plans suggested that up to one million people could be vaccinated by the end of January - if there are no delays.
All going well, everyone else will be vaccinated throughout spring and summer 2021.
The UK has ordered 40m doses of the the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - enough for 20m people. Around 10m doses should be available soon, with the first 800,000 arriving in the UK in the coming days.
The first minister said Scotland's share of the UK's vaccine supply equates to 8.2% of the UK population.
Everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 will be offered a vaccination. That's 4.4m people.
The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has drawn up advice on how people should be prioritised.
It has said that the priorities for the first wave of vaccine distribution, from December to February, are:
Ms Sturgeon said the process would start with those who will be vaccinating everyone else, before moving on to those with greatest clinical need.
This will include older care home residents, health and social care workers, and people over the age of 80.
Those who meet the criteria will be contacted by post or, if they work in health and social care, by their employer.
After these people have been vaccinated, the current advice says that those aged 75 and over should be next, followed by those aged 70 and over and people who are clinically extremely vulnerable.
That would be followed by those aged 65 and over, then those under 65 who are at additional clinical risk, such as people with chronic heart, kidney, liver and respiratory diseases.
Then we move to vaccinating the wider population.
All going well, public health experts have said that mass vaccination of those who are not in the most vulnerable groups would likely be in spring or summer next year.
But this all really depends on how many doses are available.
There are no plans to make vaccination mandatory.
Women who are pregnant, or who plan to be pregnant in the next three months, are not being advised to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at this stage.
Chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith said this was due to the limited amount of data available on its use within that group.
""It may be that over time we are able to develop more information in relation to that, but at this point in time we are not advising it for that group,"" he said.
The BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is the first to be approved for use.
There are other vaccines that could be approved in the near future and the UK government has secured early access to 355 million doses of experimental vaccines, including:
Although it sounds like a lot of vaccines, remember that some vaccines will require patients to be given two doses to be effective.
The UK government is ordering vaccines on behalf of the four nations, and then the supply will then be divvied up between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland on the basis of population.
The manufacturers Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine say the jab could prevent 95% of people from getting Covid-19.
And so far no safety concerns have been raised.
It is what's known as an RNA vaccine - a new type of technology. It involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body to train the immune system.
Antibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus.
One complication is that the vaccine must be stored at -70C. It can be kept for five days in a normal fridge before it is used.
Scotland has 22 commercial freezers that will be used for storing vials at the ultra-low temperatures, but the requirement to keep it so cold may present some challenges when it comes to transporting to more remote areas.
Officials say that they do have plans for how to transport this vaccine across the country, but concede it is easier to bring people to the vaccine than to transport it to people.
So it may make sense to use this vaccine in larger urban hubs and opt for a different vaccine to administer to rural communities.
Another complication to transporting it is its packaging. To get the vaccine out as quickly as possible, Pfizer has packaged 195 multi-dose vials in each box, meaning each box contains 975 doses.
Because the vaccine has to be stored at such a low temperature, it is difficult to split the doses up, transport and administer them in further away places all within 120 hours of the vials coming out of the -70C freezers.
Trials of the Oxford vaccine, which is being developed by British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca and Oxford University, show it stops an average of 70% of people developing Covid symptoms.
There is also data that suggests perfecting the dose could increase protection up to 90%.
This may be one of the easiest vaccines to distribute, because it does not need to be stored at very cold temperatures.
It takes a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees and genetically modifies it to resemble coronavirus to try to provoke an immune response.
Then there is the Moderna vaccine, which has also made it to phase three trials. It's another RNA vaccine.
Moderna believe its vaccine protects 95% of people from getting Covid symptoms.
Only five million doses have been secured by the UK government so far, and they won't be available until the spring.
However, it does not need to be kept quite as cold and so can be stored in a normal freezer.
And then there's the Janssen vaccine, which uses a common cold virus that has been genetically modified to make it harmless and to look more like coronavirus at a molecular level.
This should train the immune system to recognise and fight coronavirus.
Several other vaccines are in the final testing stage, and more results from other teams working on advanced trials are also expected in the coming weeks and months.
It's unlikely you'll get to choose which vaccine you get. That will depend on a number of factors - what is available, where you are being vaccinated (so for example, it's much easier to give those who live in urban areas the Pfizer jab than it is to transport it at -70C to a small island), and what we know about how the vaccines work by the time you are being vaccinated.
Scientists will be studying the efficacy of the injections as people are given them, and it may well turn out that different vaccines suit different parts of the population.
So, it might turn out that what vaccine you get is dependent on your age, for example. But it is early days - we'll learn more in the months ahead.
It is a national programme, so guidance and logistics will be provided by the Scottish government.
NHS boards will lead local delivery and handle staffing.
From phase two, there will be a booking service.
More than 2,000 vaccinators and support staff will be needed by the end of January, with about a million people having been vaccinated by this time.
Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says there are currently 971 vaccinators and support staff in place for the programme to begin in December.
This isn't going to be straightforward.
There are some problems Scotland faces that other places might not.
For example, the diversity of the country's geography - from densely populated urban areas, to much more rural and remote areas.
In remote areas, the logistics and storage requirements will present challenges.
Public health officials have said that logistical challenges of reaching certain communities will be taken into consideration when supplies are being allocated, to avoid doses being wasted.
And then there are things to consider such as how do we safely vaccinate those in care homes who cannot travel to get their vaccine?
The Scottish government has said it plans to take the vaccine to them, and give them the jab in the homes.
In other circumstances, vaccination teams in the community might give people the jab at home."
"At a sweltering refugee camp on the   border, dozens of Somalis who had cleared all the final security and medical checks to enter the United States were told to prepare themselves for a flight to a new life. In Pittsburgh, a medical student from Iran finally got back to school after a chaotic journey that left him sleeping on a chair for four days. Inside Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport in New York, a    boy sprinted across the arrivals hall to embrace a family friend who had finally made it back to the United States after being marooned for a week in his home country, Sudan. With the door open again for travelers and refugees who had been excluded by President Trump’s order on immigration, the race to reach the United States accelerated on Sunday among waves of people fearing the opportunity might be fleeting. The rush inundated some domestic and international airports, reunited loved ones and friends, and prompted another round of criticism from Mr. Trump that national security was being endangered by court orders that blocked his tight border policy from taking effect. Mr. Trump and his aides have suggested that terrorists and others who wish to do harm to the United States could arrive through normal immigration channels and that the administration needs time to tighten its vetting procedures. Those travelers now being admitted to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim nations singled out for a temporary ban by Mr. Trump had already been granted visas after screening. Refugees from those countries and elsewhere who were rushing to reach the United States had likewise already been vetted, even more extensively, in a process that involves dozens of checks and can take more than two years. But it was unclear whether a court order blocking Mr. Trump’s policy from taking effect, issued by a federal judge in Seattle, would remain in place for long, creating a sense of urgency among those trying to reach the United States. The back and forth had sown confusion, anxiety, fear and disbelief, but the court order created “a temporary window that we wish to take advantage of,” said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, an intergovernmental agency that facilitates refugee resettlement. “Our staff are being told to move like crazy. ” Families and immigration advocacy groups were buoyed twice over the weekend  —   first when the Seattle judge temporarily blocked the executive order, and again when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco denied the government’s attempt to gain an emergency stay. But a mood of uncertainty persisted after a week in which thousands of travelers bound for the United States were halted in transit and turned away at airports, and courts across the country issued conflicting rulings over whether and how the executive order should be carried out. Mr. Trump reacted angrily on Sunday. In a Twitter post, he seemed to give immigration lawyers and advocates reason to fear that the country may not remain open for long to refugees, or to visa holders from the seven nations  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. “I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!” he wrote. Mr. Doyle said that between Monday and Feb. 17, about 2, 000 refugees would be rebooked on flights to the United States. Those who were expected to leave first had moved out of their apartments or refugee camps, sold their belongings and turned in their food ration cards. In Kenya, dozens of Somalis who had cleared all the final security and medical checks to enter the United States were waiting on Sunday in the refugee camp, where they were told that they might be able to travel in the next few days. But they were no longer sure who  —   or what  —   to believe. “I feel completely ruined,” said Ahmed Hassan, a Somali refugee heading for Rhode Island. In the past few weeks, Mr. Hassan was bused out of the camp sent to a transit center in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, several hundred miles away given travel documents told he was about to fly to America told he was not about to fly to America bused back to the camp and then told he might actually fly to America after all. He boarded a bus in Nairobi to return to the camp just hours before the federal judge lifted the travel ban. Mr. Hassan had sold his home and feared that he could be targeted as an American sympathizer by the Islamist and   militants known to move in and out of the camps. He had arrived back at the refugee camp on Saturday afternoon, retreated from the crowds shouting questions at him and hid inside a room. On the floor of Terminal 4 at Kennedy Airport, Wael Izzeldin, 6, clutched a green marker as he wrote a welcome sign for his father’s best friend, Dr. Kamal Fadlalla. Dr. Fadlalla is a   resident at Interfaith Medical Center in   Brooklyn, and had been on vacation visiting his mother in Sudan, his first time home in three years. When Dr. Fadlalla appeared, the boy went running across the arrivals hall, leapt and wrapped himself around the doctor, crushing the tiny sign. Dr. Fadlalla was ebullient but fatigued. Though he holds a visa for people in specialty professions, he had been turned away at the airport, and spent a week marooned in Sudan. Around him, members of his union, Committee of Interns and Residents, wearing white lab coats, cheered. “I’m glad justice won,” he said, adding that he was happy to return to his family and patients. “I need to get back to my work. ” Across the country on Sunday, the nongovernmental agencies that place refugees into homes and help them find jobs were gearing up to resettle as many as possible, while recovering from the whiplash of last week. Before Friday, their work had begun to trickle off, as they could resettle only refugees who were already in transit when the president’s order was signed. They had been preparing for their activities to come to a halt for four months in accordance with the order. Leslie Aizenman, of Jewish Family and Children’s Services, a resettlement agency in Pittsburgh, had already put back on the market an apartment prepared for a family from Homs, Syria, who had been scheduled to arrive in the United States on Tuesday. The State Department canceled their trip last week, and Ms. Aizenman was unsure when it would be rescheduled. Her staff had already returned the backpacks filled with school supplies and stuffed animals they had prepared for the family’s    son and    daughter. They had also told another Syrian family in Pittsburgh, who had volunteered to make a warm meal to welcome their new neighbors, not to bother. Because of the   change, Ms. Aizenman said that refugee family may have to live briefly in temporary housing, and settle for a restaurant meal rather than something homemade. “We had stopped the process, but no matter what, we’ll accommodate them when they get here,” she said. An interim ruling on whether the executive order may be enforced is likely to come quickly from the appeals court. But the ultimate decision on whether the order is lawful will take much longer, and is likely to come from the Supreme Court. That means people seeking to travel or settle here may be in limbo until the case is finally resolved. Over the weekend, lawyers were telling clients to take advantage of the precarious window. “We are encouraging people to come in as soon as possible,” said Mary McCarthy, executive director of the National Immigrant Justice Center, a   organization that provides legal services and advocacy to immigrants. “If you need to be back in this country, you should do it now. ” Ms. McCarthy said her organization had been in regular contact throughout the weekend with a network of roughly 1, 500 lawyers who had volunteered to help travelers pro bono. They were just some of the lawyers stationed in shifts at airports across the country, observing customs officials to ensure that the Seattle judge’s ruling was being carried out. “We are being very vigilant,” she said."
"WASHINGTON  —   Judge Neil M. Gorsuch’s first taste of    Washington politics was bitter and lingering. He was 15 years old and his mother was a   official in the Reagan administration caught in an ugly showdown with Congress. When she was forced to step down, her reputation in tatters, young Neil was furious. “You should never have resigned,” he told his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, by her later account. “You didn’t do anything wrong. You only did what the president ordered. Why are you quitting? You raised me not to be a quitter. Why are you a quitter?” More than three decades later, Judge Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, has been nominated to the Supreme Court by President Trump and faces a political culture even more caustic than the one that destroyed his mother’s public career. Like her, he is a committed conservative and can expect strong opposition, but where she was bold and brash, he has advanced to the pinnacle of the judiciary with understatement and polish. Now 49, he arrives at his own moment of testing as a child of the Reagan revolution who saw up close the promise and the perils. He inherited a frontier skepticism of government rooted in his home of Colorado and nurtured in Washington during the 1980s. An examination of his early, formative years finds that he swam in the liberal waters of Columbia and Harvard and rebelled against the dominant thinking to develop a fully formed conservative philosophy that has propelled him to the threshold of the Supreme Court. Those early years shaped his views on the law and life and provided a searing lesson in the realities of the political world. Despite the family ordeal, friends and relatives said, he emerged from the crucible of his youth tempered about politics yet not soured on public service. He decided to pursue goals similar to his mother’s if only by a different path. The first woman to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Ms. Burford argued that states were better custodians of resources and that market forces would bring more discipline to regulation. As she cut spending and pared back rules, critics called her an enemy of the environment. Her downfall came when, at White House direction, she refused to turn over documents related to a   program. Congress cited her for contempt. “It was an example to him of what the realpolitik of Washington could be like,” said Richard M. Segal, a Harvard Law School classmate who is now a lawyer in San Diego. “He viewed his mother as an environmentalist, and his mother viewed herself as an environmentalist. And meanwhile she was made the poster child of the view that the Reagan administration was just out there to rape the environment. ” The teenager was his mother’s conscience. “Neil knew from the beginning the seriousness of my problems,” she wrote in a memoir before her death in 2004. He was “smart as a whip” and “had an unerring sense of fairness, as do many people his age. ” When she resigned, “he was really upset. ” By most accounts, he did not dwell on it later in life, but it clearly echoed in his work. In preparing a moot court brief at Harvard on workplace safety, he tried to add material concerning the E. P. A. that did not fit, recalled a classmate, Ellen M. Bublick, who is now a law professor at the University of Arizona. In his time as an appeals court judge in Denver, his most notable writings have concerned the power of government regulators. “We talked about that prior history in relation to that,” Professor Bublick said. “He definitely was proud of his mom and had a sense that in the Reagan era certain people took a fall for him in order to protect him. And I think that was really his view of what happened to his mom. ” Neil McGill Gorsuch’s earliest years were spent in the West, where at Rocky Mountain campsites and fishing streams he internalized a faith in rugged individualism. He grew up in a     house in the east Denver neighborhood of Hilltop. His parents, Anne and David Gorsuch, were lawyers who had three children: Neil in 1967, Stephanie in 1969 and J. J. in 1973. His mother raised them Catholic his father was not religious. (Judge Gorsuch is now Episcopalian, according to his brother, possibly inspired by his time studying at Oxford University.) Studious but not standoffish, Neil shared a bedroom with his brother and attended Christ the King, a Roman Catholic school. Relatives and friends recalled him lugging stacks of books and once rounding the baseball diamond in   cowboy boots after leaving his athletic shoes at home. “If anybody was going to be the president, it was going to be Neil Gorsuch,” said Gina Carbone, 49, a classmate. In 1976, Ms. Gorsuch was elected to the State Legislature, often aligning herself with a small but powerful group of conservatives, called the “House Crazies,” who were determined to cut taxes and loosen regulations. Women’s groups supported her campaign, but in office she led a fight to kill the Colorado State Commission on Women. Fervently   she was, one politician told The Washington Post in 1983, “almost paranoid about any kind of abortion legislation. ” She rose quickly. “She was very prominent in the shaping of policy,” said Steve Durham, a leader of the House Crazies. She had a “knack and ability to get along with people and put them at ease. ” But she was famously tough. The Rocky Mountain News wrote that she “could kick a bear to death with her bare feet. ” After two terms, Ms. Gorsuch became one of three Coloradans to take prominent posts in the Reagan administration, along with James G. Watt, the interior secretary, and Robert Burford, the director of the Bureau of Land Management. Called the “Colorado mafia,” they managed the nation’s natural resources with a fierce belief that the government had gone too far in regulating private enterprise. It was widely believed that they had the backing of Joseph Coors, the conservative Colorado beer magnate. By the time Ms. Gorsuch moved to Washington in 1981, she was headed for a divorce, and the children toggled between the capital and Colorado. It was an adjustment for children used to the informal ways of the West. “All of a sudden we were across the country, having to dress up in coats and ties and having to act like   at prep school,” said Michael Trent, a Californian whose father was deputy transportation secretary at the time and who found in Mr. Gorsuch a similar spirit. The two boys took walks after dinner discussing the world. “The two of us were huge fans of Reagan,” said Mr. Trent, who was later best man at Judge Gorsuch’s wedding and made the judge godfather to his children. “And it was because of our family upbringings. It was so much a part of our lives at the time. ” Mr. Gorsuch soon had a stepfather when his mother married Mr. Burford, whom she had met in the State Legislature. Known for wearing furs and smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, Ms. Gorsuch became a prominent face of the new administration as she cut back lawsuits against polluters and tried to relax parts of the Clean Air Act. “There was obviously a lot of controversy regarding her work as she was carrying out the president’s program,” Ed Meese, a top Reagan adviser, recalled. “I’m sure that undoubtedly had an impact on her son. ” J. J. Gorsuch, 43, now a vice president of a Denver marketing technology company, said his mother’s political life had shaped the family psyche but ultimately made his brother stronger. “If anything, it probably prepared him for the experience ahead in a great way,” he said. “He knows better than most how ugly the political process might get. So in that sense it’s hopefully prepared him for the nomination process. ” His mother emerged from her 1983 resignation demoralized about Washington, which she called “too small to be a state but too large to be an asylum for the mentally deranged. ” But if her tribulations scarred him, Judge Gorsuch gave little indication while at Georgetown Preparatory School, a   Jesuit school outside Washington. His classmates  —   many the children of politicians themselves  —   knew the family connection, said Bill Hughes, son of a Democratic congressman, but left it unmentioned. As Mr. Trent said, “I can’t imagine what a difficult thing it would have been to go through that, but he never let it show. ” Judge Gorsuch focused on schoolwork and excelled at debate, competing nationally. “Even as a kid, he would be able to step back from situations and be able to make judgments about them,” said Stephen Ochs, a history teacher. “He had the ability to be curious and look at both sides without being threatened. ” His conservative identity was already forming. The school yearbook jokingly listed him as founder of a “Fascism Forever” club, which an editorial note clarified “happily jerked its knees against the increasingly ‘ ’ tendencies of the faculty. ” Mr. Trent called that “sort of his little dig getting back” at a teacher with whom he disagreed. His views apparently cost him little among his peers, who elected him student president. Classmates speculated that his poise would lead to the law and perhaps politics, said one classmate, Brian Cashman, who is now general manager of the New York Yankees. “He looked the part and acted the part. ” Judge Gorsuch arrived at Columbia in 1985 as the historically liberal university was recovering from student protests the previous spring and beginning to divest from corporations operating in South Africa. In three years on campus  —   he graduated a year early  —   he emerged as the intellectual leader of a resurgent right. It was “a happy band of dissenters,” as Brian Domitrovic, a classmate and fellow conservative, put it. His eloquence impressed many. That he was tall, clean cut and handsome only helped. He danced and drank Manhattans and martinis, Mr. Domitrovic said. He joined Phi Gamma Delta, a fraternity with a reputation for partying, and quietly attended religious services. But principally, Judge Gorsuch became known as a fierce and lucid writer in the Columbia Daily Spectator, where he published columns, and later The Federalist Paper, which he helped found. Part newspaper, part opinion journal, The Federalist Paper drew comparisons to the conservative Dartmouth Review. “There was a   system at Columbia in the ’80s: the liberals and the socialists,” said Stephen Later, who worked on the paper. “The Fed was a response to this echo chamber. ” Judge Gorsuch was out of step with campus zeitgeist. He bristled at attempts to bar military recruiting on campus, minimized the   affair and dismissed a shantytown built on campus to protest South African apartheid. The main subject that animated his writing was the political hegemony he perceived at the university. A “tyrannical atmosphere of ‘ideas,’” he called it in February 1987. “There is little or no room at Columbia for dissenting voices: one is either Right or Wrong, Moral or Immoral, Compassionate or Heartless. ” In March 1987, as students debated the fraternity system’s treatment of women and minorities, Judge Gorsuch   a piece defending   clubs. In a familiar rhetorical move, he reframed the issue as free speech. In their “heavy handed moralism,” he wrote, the system’s critics missed “the fact that Columbia is a pluralistic university, that its fraternity is equally pluralistic, with options available for everyone. ” That spring, as students boycotted Coors beer, posters on campus alleged that The Federalist Paper, which accepted the company’s advertising, had received funding from the Heritage Foundation, financed by the Coors family. Mr. Gorsuch mocked the “professional protesters” who had created the posters, and he threatened a libel suit. “He had a real regal way of writing about this stuff that made us look small,” said Tom Kamber, a leader of the liberals. “His role was really to write these screeds that would try to take the winds out of our sails. ” The battle continued at Harvard Law School, where Judge Gorsuch arrived in 1988 along with a young man from Chicago named Barack Obama. The two did not intersect much  —   Mr. Obama was six years older  —   but they mirrored each other as intellectual leaders who managed to disagree without being disagreeable. “Neil was not quite as public a person as Barack was, but at the same time, for the people who knew him, he was very well respected,” said Mr. Segal, the classmate. Young conservatives were inspired as the Soviet Union and its empire collapsed. “It was an incredibly optimistic time, and it was a time when a lot of us developed a strong belief in the power of free markets and rule of law,” said Ken Mehlman, another classmate who went on to become chairman of the Republican National Committee. Harvard was the epicenter of a debate over whether the Constitution was a living document to be interpreted in evolving times or a neutral, unchanging charter judged by its original text. “It was a pretty contentious time at Harvard Law School,” said Adam H. Charnes, a classmate. “There were conservatives who were provocateurs. He wasn’t anything like that. ” Judge Gorsuch befriended liberals, including Norm Eisen, later a White House aide and ambassador under Mr. Obama. “He stood out among the conservative group in not being loud,” Mr. Eisen said. “He managed to stay above that while making his conservative positions clear. I thought it was impressive. ” Through all of this, Judge Gorsuch made little mention of his famous mother. Indeed, one friend who stayed close after law school said he had realized the relationship only years later. Once when a fellow student said something disparaging about her on the assumption that he was not actually related, he brushed it off. “He deflected it in a very classy way that made me think it was not the first time somebody had said something like that,” Mr. Eisen said. Judge Gorsuch’s mother did not live to see the day he was nominated to the Supreme Court. But for the family, his rise represents a vindication of sorts. If he survives confirmation, he will have conquered the capital that did her in."

It may be early days in the Democratic primary race, but Bernie Sanders is now the favourite to win the party’s nomination and set up a Trump‐​Sanders presidential election.



As the prospect of Sanders winning becomes ever more real, some commentators are downplaying his socialist credentials, painting the veteran Senator as no more than a moderate social democrat.



“Memo to left‐​wing Americans who adore Sanders’s radical ‘socialism’…” says Al Jazeera’s Mehdi Hasan, “in most other Western/​European countries, Sanders would be considered a pretty mainstream, centre‐​left social democrat.”



His view is shared by the economist Paul Krugman. Dastardly Republicans might have the audacity to use Sanders’ own preferred label to describe him, but since he doesn’t want to “nationalise our major industries” or “replace markets with central planning”, Sanders “isn’t actually a socialist.” Ignore scare stories about Venezuelan economics then, Krugman advises. Sanders just wants the US to look more like Denmark.



Sanders’ platform goes far beyond any modern social democracy in terms of government size and scope.



Krugman is right to say that Sanders shuns nationalisation. To simply label him a socialist, without any caveats, is misleading. But it’s even more grossly misleading to suggest his “democratic socialist” ambitions stop at a Scandinavian‐​style welfare state. More redistribution is central to his agenda, sure, but he also proposes massive new market interventions, including the Green New Deal, a federal jobs guarantee, expansive price and wage controls, overhauling labour and corporate governance laws, and enforced mutualisation of companies.



Any given European country might engage in one or some of these interventionist policies. Combined though, whatever label you give it, Sanders’ platform goes far beyond any modern social democracy in terms of government size and scope. Indeed, his policies can only be considered moderate if some three‐​way lovechild of the economics of 1970s Sweden, Argentina, and Yugoslavia’s market socialism is the baseline.



Rather than countries, perhaps we might use another politician as a barometer here. Hasan suggests Sanders is less “left” than Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, which is quite a low bar to crawl under. Corbyn and McDonnell are certainly widely regarded as contemporary socialists and not social democrats.



So, is Hasan right? Our best tool is to compare Labour’s 2019 manifesto against the Sanders’ economic platform. Doing so makes clear that Bernie is more radical than Corbyn on economics, both in absolute terms and relative to their countries’ respective politics.



Take the size of government. The Manhattan Institute’s Brian Riedl calculates that Sanders’ promises would add $97.5 trillion to spending over a decade, taking total annual US government spending to around 70% of GDP and more than doubling the size of the federal government. Even if climate investments prove a one‐​off, spending would settle at a massive 64% of GDP. That’s far higher than Labour’s planned 44% and even France’s current 57% (itself the highest in the OECD).



A look at certain individual spending areas also underlines just how radical the Sanders agenda is. Like Labour, he wants government‐​funded free public higher education. Unlike Labour, he’d also forgive all existing student debts. On climate change and infrastructure, Labour planned for £400 billion investment over 10 years (about 20% of current annual UK GDP). Sanders wants to invest $16.3 trillion over 15 years (about 75% of current annual US GDP.) On healthcare, both want government spending to expand to cover all medical treatment, prescription charges, long‐​term care for the elderly, and dentistry. But only Sanders would explicitly ban private health insurance (Labour did consider that proposal but held off in the end).



True, Corbyn and McDonnell favoured nationalising buses, railways, the energy sector, water, and parts of the broadband network. Corbyn even wanted free government‐​funded broadband for all. But even here the results of Sanders’ pledges would bring similar results. He would set up “publicly owned” and “democratically controlled” broadband networks. And his Green New Deal would bring most public transport under government control and deliver effective public ownership of energy production. And Sanders historically has supported exactly the types of nationalisations Corbyn favours.



When it comes to financing their promises, Sanders is arguably more radical again. Labour planned to only borrow to invest, raising the deficit by about 2% of GDP per year. But Bernie’s tax plans get nowhere near fully funding his agenda. Absent further broad‐​based tax rises, Riedl calculates annual borrowing would soar to around 30% of US GDP if his spending plans were implemented.



That doesn’t mean he hasn’t got radical plans for higher tax rates as well. As with Labour, Bernie would tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income and introduce a new financial transactions tax. But he’d also go much further in terms of higher rates on the rich and corporations.



Combined with national insurance, Labour’s top marginal income tax rate would have been 52%. Sanders’ top _federal_ income taxrate alone would be 52%, bringing a top combined top rate of around 80% once state and payroll taxes are considered. Sanders wants a new wealth tax too, another option Labour shirked. And while Labour wanted to raise the UK’s main corporation tax rate to 26%, Bernie would opt for 35% with a broad base.



Again and again on economics, where there are differences, it’s because Sanders is offering the more radical leftwing policies. He and Labour both proposed big minimum wage rises, national rent control, mandated employee ownership, and workers on boards, for example. But where Labour proposed 10% worker ownership stakes in large companies, Sanders would mandate 20%; while Labour want 33% of boards to be made up of worker representatives, Sanders wants 45%.



Then there’s Sanders’ federal jobs guarantee — the mammoth plan to offer any American who wants one a $15‐​per‐​hour job with full benefits. If implemented, the federal government would become the largest global employer by far. No European country engages with such a large labour market intervention. Nor did Labour propose one.



Now, there are no doubt some areas where Labour or even the current Tory government are more interventionist than Sanders envisages. It may well be true too that, in their hearts, Corbyn and McDonnell are more hardcore ideologically socialist than Sanders, and that their 2019 manifesto merely reflected having to gain acceptability from the broader party and country, whereas Sanders (for now) is just trying to win a primary.



Certainly, there are more constraints on elected leaders in the US, meaning Sanders’ full agenda has less chance of being implemented than Labour’s would have done. And economics isn’t everything. Sanders seems more deferential to American institutions than Corbyn was to British ones, and though Sanders has himself had staffing and historical problems of unpleasant racial or foreign policy views, he doesn’t suck up to terrorists and authoritarian regimes in the way Corbyn has for his entire political career.



Nevertheless, on the role of government, the declared economic platforms are instructive. Call it “democratic socialism,” or just plain old “interventionism,” Bernie Sanders is, in many respects, putting a more radical interventionist offer to the electorate than Jeremy Corbyn did.



Given how Corbyn crashed and burned in a country much less hostile to “socialism” and “big government”, I can understand why commentators such as Hasan or Krugman might want to downplay the revolutionary nature of the platform. But that doesn’t make them correct.

Chapter 13 of the IPCC 5th WGI Report claims that sea level will rise by an amount between 0.26 to 0.97 metres by 2100 according to which of their new scenarios actually happens
Relative Sea Level,the distance between the level of the sea and the level of neighbouring land is what matters to most of us. The Level of the open ocean is only of minor importance. This Report tries to mix the two up in a single chart.
Relative Sea Level is measured by tide gauges which measure the distance between the level of the sea registered on specialist equipment and a supposedly constant benchmark location on the neighbouring land. carried out in over 1000 coastal locations all over the world. The records are averages, over a day, week, month or years.

Both the level of the sea and of the neighbouring land constantly vary  from place to place.and from  time to time.
The sea changes level constantly, diurnally and seasonally.  It is influenced by winds, storms and hurricanes and also by earthquakes. The level of the sea may be influenced by breakwaters and harbour works. The equipment may be damaged or its location altered by storms. Severe storms may prevent correct measurement and give a false reading which interferes with claims for “change.
Land surfaces may change. The land may subside by weight of buildings, and removal of minerals and groundwater. The Report illustrates the problem of measurement near land covered in iceGeological change (Isostasy) may result from plate movements and earthquakes. Many of these effects cause an upwards bias to the readings.
Long term trends may as much show these changes as any other influence. As a result they are not a reliable guide to the future.which should be based on a recent period of reliable measurements.
The recent installation of GPS levelling equipment on m,ay sites has greatly improved the reliability of the land-based benchmark. It has resulted in a nearly constant sea level change for many records it is therefore wrong to place reliance on older readings in order to assess future behaviour. It should be based on the most recent measurements which are the least likely to be affected by previous bias.
The records are publicly available at the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level  (PSMSL) website at   at http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/map.html  which features a very convenient map of the world from which all the records can be obtained.
Many records are defective in one way or another. Many have gaps or sudden changes, Few have a long-term continuous record.  Frequently there is little sign of change during the recent decade. evidence. that currently there is little or no change in sea level. The following figure from Chapter 13, FAQ 13.1 Figure 1. illustrates this error.

It shows six tide gauge records compared with the supposed global average..
The actual current records, which are shown (rather small), disagree with this supposed trend
San Francisco is unchanged since 1990.
Charlottetown is unchanged from 1995 to 2010.
Antofagasta  is unchanged from 1980 to 2012
Pago Pago is unchanged since 2000.
Stockholm is actually falling.
Manila is a rogue record.The following website states that the gauge is subject to subsidence
http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.shtml?stnid=660-011
The following records from the Philippines, show no recent rise.

I have published a study of the Pacific islands which also display no recent rise at
http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/south_pacific.html
Recently there was a Pacific Forum meeting in Kiribati attended by our Prime Minister which complained that the islands were sinking. And we must take action
This is a recent tide gauge record from Kiribati

. These figures and also those from Australia continue to show little change. He same is true for many islands as shown at
http://www.contrepoints.org/2013/10/01/140868-les-oceans-montent-dangereusement-sauf-autour-iles
Future projections for different places from the latest IPCC Report Chapter 13 are shown in their Figure 13.23 .

Every one of these actual measured sea levels have shown no sign of change for at least ten years, yet all the projections claim that this settled behaviour will suddenly change to an upwards level of around half a metre by the end of the century.
This is based on models which have failed to predict the lack of a global temperature increase for the past 17 year,.yet it is claimed they  are causing melting of ice, particularly in the Arctic
All the models assume that any temperature rise will be least at the poles and greatest at the tropics because the water vapour feedback is lower at the poles..They do not mention Antarctica where the ice is currently increasing
There are no measurements of temperatures on ice anywhere, on ice caps, oceans or glaciers. In all cases there are other influences.on their behaviour. In the Arctic it is the temperature of the ocean and the behaviour of the ocean oscillations.
The ice in the Arctic is beginning to grow now
The satellite measurements do seem to show a steady increase in sea level, but it seems to be little known that the instruments are subject to drift and they have to be calibrated on tide gauge measurements,
This is described in the following web address
http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=DcXZF9vogtkC&pg=PA121&dq=sea+level+rise+satellite+measurements&hl=en&sa=X&ei=c4BoUtXJA82fiAeX0IDoCw&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sea%20level%20rise%20satellite%20measurements&f=false
which can be boiled down to
http://tinyurl.com/ljt4w5m
These satellite measurements have only been going since 1992. There have been several calibration problems and it is unclear to what extent it incorporates errors from tide gauges
CONCLUSION
Models based on an assumption of a temperature change that is not currently happening, and on melting ice which is absent from Antarctica and which appears to have ceased in the Arctic, are poor guides to practical sea level changes near a coast. These need to be judged from tide gauges measuring recent local behaviour with reliable equipment,, . The IPCC “projections” are thereby grossly exaggerated.

"The idea that tiny amounts of antidepressants present in our rivers and estuaries may be affecting aquatic life is generally met with surprise, sometimes scepticism, or even a degree of humour.  The public were first alerted to pharmaceuticals in the environment in the 1990s through studies which showed that synthetic oestrogens, such as in the contraceptive pill, could feminise male fish, even in incredibly low concentrations of nanograms per litre (ng/L). This led to concerns of a similar effect on male human fertility, although it’s been hard to draw any conclusions.  The idea that even tiny amounts of chemicals might dramatically alter the physiology of fish and other aquatic organisms isn’t that new. Back in the 1980s scientists were aware that concentrations even below 10ng/L of tributyltin or TBT, a compound used in anti-fouling paints for ships’ hulls, would cause female dog whelks (a sort of sea snail) to grow a penis.  This resulted in catastrophic reproductive failure in females which wiped out snail populations along the world’s coasts, which had knock-on effects on organisms further up and down the food chain. A more recent example is diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug given to lame cattle in India and Pakistan. While considered harmless to mammals, what was not predicted was that vultures preying on dead cattle would suffer catastrophic renal failure, resulting in their populations plunging by 90%. Some scientists have suggested that reduced vulture populations led to a boom in feral dog populations and an increase in rabies among the human population. Highly publicised, this focused people’s attention on the toxicological impact of human and veterinary drugs on wildlife.  So what’s the evidence that anti-depressants, now quite commonly prescribed medicines, are affecting aquatic wildlife? After all, studies have found that sewage effluent entering rivers can carry anti-depressants at concentrations up to around 1µg/l (one microgram, equal to 1000ng/L), although in most rivers the concentrations recorded are considerably less at around 10-20ng/L. There is growing evidence that even at these low concentrations of under 100ng/L medicines can cause changes in a wide range of biological functions and behaviours.  For example, many anti-depressants were designed to modulate serotonin. Serotonin is a hormone that is found throughout the animal kingdom and is known to play a role in controlling behaviour, growth, metabolism, reproduction, colour, and the immune system. At the Institute of Marine Sciences in the University of Portsmouth we published an article in 2010 that demonstrated that serotonin in amphipods, a crustacean rather like a tiny prawn, was responsible for controlling their preference to seek light or dark areas.  As amphipods high in serotonin preferred light areas, would anti-depressants such as fluoxetine (Prozac) have the same effect? We found that a few weeks’ exposure to 10-100ng/L of fluoxetine – about the level found in rivers around urban areas – resulted in a five times greater preference for light. A special edition of the journal Aquatic Toxicology has pooled together studies of antidepressants in the aquatic environment. The most striking results suggest that many species, including fish, snails, bivalves, cuttlefish and crustaceans, are affected by anti-depressants even in low concentrations. The observed effects include altered swimming and behaviour patterns, locomotion, immune function, reproduction, feeding and predator behaviour through to gene expression – even a physical change of colour. There appears to be considerable variability between the species affected. Despite these findings however, there is no evidence that these particular pharmaceuticals have the same effects in the wild as all studies to date have been laboratory studies. While it’s relatively easy to determine whether a fish has had past exposure to, for example, an oestrogenic chemical, it’s currently very difficult to determine abnormal behaviour from exposure to antidepressants. Others have expressed caution, suggesting that these studies must be repeated at other laboratories and rigorous measurements must be taken on the exposure concentrations used in the laboratory experiments.  There are other factors to consider too: while the crustaceans exposed to serotonin showed a preference for light, some of the species studied also carry parasites which have evolved to alter their host’s serotonin precisely so that they swim in open areas. This makes them more vulnerable to being eaten – the ultimate goal of the parasite, for whom the crustacean is merely an intermediate step towards entering the predator’s body where it completes its lifecycle. This isn’t just about anti-depressants. We consume hundreds of different types of medication every day and they all appear to some extent in sewage effluent. Even the most modern, most costly sewage treatment processes still aren’t able to filter out all chemical contaminants. The question of “greener” pharmaceuticals that break down more readily into harmless chemicals has been suggested, but this may prove incredibly difficult to achieve given they are formulated specifically to work optimally in the human (or animal) body. Some countries are strongly debating the need for national take-back programs whereby unused medication is collected and appropriately disposed. I expect the next few years will strengthen the evidence that anti-depressants and other biologically active compounds are pollutants of concern, in which case they will join a long list of chemicals, including industrial pollutants such as sulphur and lead, whose effects on health were scientifically established and regulations passed to protect human and environmental health."
"Ministers are bracing themselves for a powerful new rebuke from the government’s own advisers over the nation’s inadequate response to the climate crisis. In its annual progress report, to be published on Thursday, the Committee on Climate Change will lambast continuing failures by the government to tackle the issues of overheating homes, flash floods, loss of biodiversity and the other threats posed as our planet continues to overheat dangerously. Last year, the committee complained that no areas of the UK’s response to the climate crisis were being tackled properly. “The whole thing is run by the government like a Dad’s Army,” said the committee’s chairman, Lord Deben.  And this year’s report will bring no happier news for ministers. Instead, the committee will highlight the fact that virtually no progress has been made over the past year to tackle the misery that will be brought by climate change. And although global carbon emissions have decreased during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, many scientists warn that any benefits for the climate are likely to be temporary. As a result, the committee is expected to make a number of key proposals to try to get Britain back on track and moving towards its commitment to bring all greenhouse gas emissions in the UK to net zero by 2050. It will recommend: Enforcing strict environmental conditions to any corporate bailouts made during the pandemic crisis, in line with standards imposed in France, Germany and Canada Making major improvements in broadband provision and cycling routes to ensure the nation avoids a surge in car use as people return to work while trying to avoid using buses and trains Consideration of a new tax on fossil fuels Introducing new policies on energy efficiency in buildings, planting more trees, and protecting peatland The need to take action over climate change has become increasingly urgent, scientists have warned over the past few weeks. Despite the recent dip in carbon emissions, last month was the warmest May on record, according to Nasa, and scientists say 2020 could be the warmest year on record. Siberia is now sweltering in a heatwave and its permafrost is in danger of melting, releasing plumes of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And in the Antarctic, researchers have reported the spread of algal blooms triggered by rising temperatures. No part of the globe is going to escape the crisis, researchers insist, and the UK must be prepared to tackle the inevitable threats of rising sea levels, coast erosion, flooding, heatwaves and epidemics of diseases, such as malaria. At the same time, it needs to rapidly curtail its reliance on fossil fuels to meet global emission pledges. “The UK is due to host the critical United Nations climate change summit next year, but its credibility as a climate leader is now under threat,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. “Successive committee reports have warned we are not on course to meet our carbon budgets which set future emissions targets. The government needs to use the economic recovery packages from Covid-19 to put us back on track.” Petrol and diesel vehicles need to be phased out, moves begun to eliminate gas central heating, and work started on adapting homes and workplaces against flooding and heatwaves. “These will all require massive investments, but they will also create new jobs and economic growth,” added Ward.

For most of Obama's years as president, he has opposed raising the gas tax. Now, in his last, lame-duck year, he is proposing a $10 per barrel tax on oil. Since a 42-gallon barrel of oil produces about 45 gallons of gasoline, Diesel, jet fuel, and other products, this is roughly equal to a 22 cent per gallon gas tax, well above the current 18.4 cent tax.   
  
The distinction between Obama's oil tax and a gas tax is that the oil tax wouldn't go into the Highway Trust Fund, where up to 80 percent goes for roads and 20 percent goes for transit. Instead, he proposes to spend $20 billion per year on alternatives to autos, including urban transit, high-speed rail, and mag-lev. Another $10 billion per year would be given to the states for programs that would supposedly reduce carbon emissions such as ""better land-use planning, clean fuel infrastructure, and public transportation."" Finally, $3 billion would go for self-driving vehicle infrastructure that is both unnecessary and intrusive.   
  
Obama proposes that the oil tax be phased in over five years, so that $33 billion is the average of the first five years; when fully phased in, the tax would bring in nearly $60 billion a year. This would be a huge slush fund for all kinds of social engineering programs.   
  
The Republicans who run Congress plan to ignore Obama's plan. The president's ""proposals are not serious, and this is another one which is dead on arrival,"" says Senate Environment & Public Works Committee Chair James Inhofe (R-OK). Still, it's worth looking at the plan as a preview of what might be proposed by the next president if that president happens to be a Democrat.   




The first thing to note is that the White House no longer makes any pretense that taxes should be raised to fix supposedly crumbling highway infrastructure. As I've noted before, the claim that highways are falling apart is just a fiction used to generate support for more funding for rail lines and other boondoggles. None of the money raised under Obama's new proposal would be used to repair or maintain roads, and--since maintenance doesn't reduce greenhouse gas emissions--probably none would be used to repair or maintain rail transit lines that, unlike roads, truly are crumbling.   
  
Second, anyone who agrees with Obama's claim that there is no ""greater threat to future generations than climate change"" should wonder why his plan proposes no tests to insure that funds would cost-effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Urban transit uses as much energy and emits as many grams of carbon per passenger mile as driving. High-speed rail could actually be worse than driving, especially when the energy costs of building the infrastructure are counted. It would be more cost-effective to spend that $33 billion per year buying 1.4 million Priuses and trading them to owners of existing gas guzzlers.   
  
Third, the land-use planning that Obama proposes to fund would no doubt follow the example of California's SB 375, which aims to coerce more people into living in apartments rather than single-family homes on the pretext that higher densities lead people to drive less. This claim has been disproven by research and the experience of the San Francisco Bay Area, whose two-thirds increase in population density since 1980 was accompanied by a one-third reduction in per capita transit trips and an increase in per capita driving.   
  
Fourth, Obama's plan would significantly increase the cost of living. On one hand, Obama's political calculus is that raising taxes is easier when oil prices are low. On the other hand, at today's prices, a $10 per barrel tax increases fuel costs by nearly a third. Though the administration claims that the $10 tax would be ""paid by oil companies,"" those companies would, of course, pass the cost to consumers. As Americans consume about 2.5 gallons of oil per person per day, the tax would impose costs of about $200 per person per year.   
  
The White House argues that its plan ""builds on the success the country has seen as a result of the American Recovery and Re-investment Act of 2009."" What success? The transportation share of that trillion-dollar boondoggle built a few streetcar lines (one of the least energy-efficient forms of urban travel), increased speeds on a few intercity rail lines by a few miles per hour, and otherwise disappeared into a black hole of pork-barrel spending. Did it reduce greenhouse gas emissions or create any jobs that wouldn't have been created without it? Probably not.   
  
In short, as one budget analyst confided to me, Obama's plan is ""Premeditated coercion and higher costs of living masquerading as environmentally friendly, job-creating transportation 'investments.'"" Republicans will be right to reject it, but they will be wrong to dismiss it as a similar plan is likely to appear next year if a Democrat wins the White House.

While my fellow Fed-watchers have had their eyes firmly glued to the repo-market for several weeks now, I've been preoccupied with some other Fed monkey business: its plans to launch a new real-time retail payments service. Having recently testified before the Senate on that topic, I finally have some time to devote to add my two cents to what others have had to say about the Fed's repo-market tribulations.



By the ""repo-market imbroglio,"" I mean, for those of you who haven't been watching the repo-market at all, the Fed's struggles of late to keep short-term private-market interest rates, including both the fed funds rate and rates on private repurchase agreements (or ""repos""), from rising above—if not well above—the top of its fed funds rate target range.



The basic problem is that the IOER rate has been steadily losing gravity, (""gravity"" being its power to keep money market rates orbiting around it) for some time. The following chart illustrates the point with reference to the effective fed funds rate:



![Fed, IOER, Liquidity, Repos, Standing Repo Facility](https://cdn.alt-m.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/RepoImproglio.png)



Here the blue line shows how the gap between the fed funds rate and the IOER rate, which was originally negative, has grown since mid-2018, while the red line shows the four five-point ""technical adjustments"" to which the Fed has resorted in order to keep the funds rate from creeping above the upper limit of its target range. On September 17th, those adjustments, at last, proved inadequate, with the effective funds rate briefly bursting through the target upper limit. More disturbing still was the even sharper rise in repo rates that day, which had some borrowers paying 10 percent for secured overnight funds. In response to those spikes, the Fed began injecting fresh reserves into the banking system through its own repo offers. So far, as the next chart shows, banks have borrowed several hundred billion dollars of fresh reserves; and they are likely to keep borrowing them for some time.



![Fed, IOER, Liquidity, Repos, Standing Repo Facility](https://cdn.alt-m.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/FedRepos.png)



What all this means is that, for the time being at least, the Fed's ""floor"" operating system, which it decided to make permanent only this January, is broken. Under a proper floor system, temporary open-market operations shouldn't be necessary. Instead, banks earn enough interest on their excess reserves to be content to hoard such reserves, and are in turn supplied with so many reserves that they never have to borrow them on the private market, let alone directly from the Fed. Because reserves are no longer scarce in this setup, marginal changes to the stock of reserves no longer influence market interest rates. Instead, the central bank adjusts the stance of monetary policy by changing the interest rate it pays on bank reserves, triggering an arbitrage process that results in corresponding changes to money market rates.



Simplicity is supposed to be the hallmark of this arrangement. As New York Fed Vice President and acting System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager Lorie Logan put it before things went sour, compared to arrangements that depend on routing open-market operations, a floor system is simple and efficient to operate. The interest rate the Fed pays on excess reserves serves as the primary policy implementation tool, with support from a standing facility that offers overnight reverse repos (ON RRPs) at an administered rate. There is no need to forecast specific factors affecting reserves or to conduct discretionary open market operations each day… Market forces keep the federal funds rate in the FOMC’s target range by allowing a wide range of counterparties to price trades against the alternative option of investing with the Federal Reserve.



In fact, as Stephen Williamson points out in his own excellent post on the repo-market mess, the scale of the Fed's recent repo-market operations far eclipses that of its routine pre-2008 temporary open-market operations. It also overshadows the Fed's unwind, which at its peak had the Fed withdrawing $50 billion in reserves each _month_.



What went wrong? In brief, Fed officials found out that keeping the banking system flush with reserves, as a floor system requires, is harder than it sounds. More precisely, they discovered the hard way that even $1.4 _trillion_ in excess reserves wasn't sufficient to avoid a mad scramble for scrambling for cash.



That Fed officials were caught off guard by this discovery isn't altogether surprising. After all, before the Fed switched to a floor operating system, banks managed with a grand total of less than $2 _billion_ in excess reserves, or _1/700th_ of their recent holdings! Yet under that old arrangement, with all its pesky forecasting requirements, the fed funds rate never wandered far from the Fed's target, which was, moreover, a precise value rather than the generous 25-point bullseye the Fed gets to aim at today. Of course, individual banks often found themselves short of reserves in that arrangement. But when they did they could readily make up for those shortages, and do so without paying a premium, by borrowing on the fed funds market.



Of course, Fed officials understood that the new system called for substantially more reserves than the pre-crisis set-up did. They just didn't know precisely what ""substantially more"" meant. Surely, they reasoned, banks wouldn't need all the reserves provided to them through the Fed's crisis-era QE programs. So some unwinding seemed appropriate. But just how much was unclear. Hence the Fed's decision to proceed gingerly and, ultimately, to suspend its unwind sooner than expected in response to mounting evidence that reserves were getting scarce again.



That those symptoms of reserve scarcity started to show while there were still almost $2 trillion in reserves outstanding made it natural to suppose that, instead of an aggregate reserve shortage, what was being witnessed was a distributional problem only, reflecting a breakdown of some kind in the market's ability to get reserves where they were needed. ""Apparently,"" Williamson observes,



banks holding reserves were foregoing large profit opportunities to lending in the repo market and fed funds market, and fed funds market lenders were similarly lending unsecured overnight and foregoing large profit opportunities to secured lending in the repo market. … The problem is that overnight markets – particularly in the United States – are gummed up with various frictions.



But it turns out that most of the ""frictions"" in question consist of regulations that have substantially boosted the demand for excess reserves, particularly among the largest banks. Five of those banks hold about 90 percent of all outstanding excess reserves; and once one allows for all the liquidity regulations to which those banks are subject, the possibility that they can't afford to part with any of them becomes increasingly plausible.



What regulations? Basel III's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement is the most obvious culprit. According to it, large banks, meaning those with over $250 billion in total assets or over $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposure, must hold enough High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) to fund their anticipated cash outflows for 30 days. Under Basel's rules, both U.S. government and agency securities and excess reserves qualify as level 1 HQLAs. But when reserves yield more than Treasuries banks have every reason to prefer them. Thanks to an inverted yield curve for which the Fed itself bears some responsibility, using excess reserves to meet LCR requirements has been a no-brainer since June:



![Fed, IOER, Liquidity, Repos, Standing Repo Facility](https://cdn.alt-m.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ExcessReserveOpportunityCost.png)



But none of this explains why the big banks didn't fund the private repo market as repo rates rose sharply above the Fed's IOER rate. After all, since the repos we're talking about are temporary swaps of reserves for Treasury securities, banks that engage in them don't reduce their HQLAs. Yet they stand to profit when repo rates spike. But the LCR requirements were far from the only liquidity requirements big banks had to meet. ""Banks,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said at the peak of the turmoil, ""have a tremendous amount of liquidity, but also have a tremendous amount of restraints on how they use that liquidity.” As Francisco Covas and Bill Nelson explain in a recent BPI post, besides Basel's LCR requirements the very largest U.S. banks are also ""subject to non-public liquidity stress tests, non-public liquidity requirements associated with their resolution plans, and non-public _ad hoc _examiner mandates.""



Bill Nelson first drew attention to those ad-hoc examiner mandates almost a year ago, causing yours truly to complain in turn that Fed supervisors were, perhaps unwittingly, placing artificial limits on the Fed's ability to shrink its balance sheet, as it was endeavoring to do at the time. In particular, as Zoltan Pozsar explains in a remarkably detailed and prescient May 2019 essay, which I can't do justice to here, ""increased supervisory focus on _intraday_ liquidity increased banks' demand for reserves just as the taper was destroying them"" (my emphasis). Pozsar also delves into liquidity requirements connected to banks' resolution plans, which grew out of Dodd-Frank's ""living will"" provisions. Suffice to say that those requirements, besides being much stiffer than ordinary LCR requirements, can only be satisfied by excess reserves. Finally, as if all this weren't enough, some banks, including J.P. Morgan, are subject to a capital surcharge that depends on the extent of their repo lending.



The bottom line is that regulators have managed to raise the biggest banks liquidity needs enough to compel them to sit on most of the banking system's seemingly huge stock of excess reserves, and to do so even as repo markets present them with an opportunities to earn five times what those reserves are yielding just by lending them out overnight.



While regulatory requirements, assisted by an inverted yield curve, have been ramping-up banks' demand for excess reserves, other factors have caused the supply of excess reserves to shrink considerably more than Fed officials bargained for. As the next FRED chart shows, between October 2017, when the Fed began its unwind, and September 17th, when the repo market started to go haywire, the Fed had shed about $600 billion in assets. Excess reserves, on the other hand, fell by almost $780 billion.



![Fed, IOER, Liquidity, Repos, Standing Repo Facility](https://cdn.alt-m.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DeclineinExcessReservesFactors.png)



Two causes, also shown in the chart, account for the overall discrepancy. The first and better known has been an accumulation of Treasury General Account (TGA) balances. The less well known contributor to the reserve drain has been an increase, practically all of it coming from Japanese banks, in the size of the New York Fed's ""foreign repo pool."" The basic story is the same for each: unlike most of us. but like depository institutions, both foreign central banks and the U.S. Treasury can have accounts with the Federal Reserve. But when they accumulate balances in those accounts, they remove a corresponding amount of reserves from the banking system. (For more details, see this excellent just-released essay by BPI's Bill Nelson.)



A final factor that helped set the stage for last month's reserve shortage was the Treasury's need to fund the Trump administration's $1 trillion fiscal 2019 deficit. That meant having primary dealers underwrite a like amount of newly-issued Treasuries. Because the Primary Dealers Act of 1988 obliges those dealers to get a ""reasonable price"" for Treasuries they underwrite, they typically submit bids at a range of prices on their own accounts. They can therefore find themselves acquiring substantial security inventories to dispose of gradually following the initial offering. But dealers have only so much money on hand, in so-called ""clearing"" accounts they keep at the Bank of New York Mellon, with which to finance their Treasury inventories. Because they only intend to carry such inventories for short periods, dealers naturally look to the repo market for additional funding and to replenish their depleted clearing accounts. Thanks to the inverted yield curve (again!), the demand for new Treasury securities hasn't exactly been brisk. Dealers' inventories and their demand for short-term funds by which to finance them have grown accordingly. On the very day of the repo spike, the Treasury placed about $50 billion in securities on the market, causing primary dealers in turn to purchase and then repo a substantial portion of those securities.



So there you have it: a host of developments adding to banks' demand for excess reserves, while others gradually chipped away at the stock of such reserves. Add a spike in primary dealers' demand for short-term funding, a coinciding round of tax payments that transferred as many reserves to the TGA, and binding intraday liquidity requirements at the banks holding a large share of total system excess reserves, and you have the makings of last month's perfect repo-market storm.



On second thought, ""perfect storm"" is not the right metaphor, since such a storm is a freak event that's unlikely to be repeated. What happened in the repo market is, in contrast, quite likely to repeat itself, and might be repeating itself as I write this were the Fed not repeatedly offering fresh reserves to the money market. Perhaps ""climate change"" is more like it.



In any case, so far as Fed officials are concerned, adding still more excess reserves to a U.S. banking system that once seemed to be drowning in them is the only way to fix things. In place of ongoing ad-hoc repo operations, the Fed ultimately intends to (1) establish the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) it has been contemplating for a while now, and (2) to begin expanding its balance sheet once again. Word on the street has it that the SRF will be up and running sometime early next year. As for renewed Fed balance sheet growth, Chairman Powell has already suggested that it's coming, and odds are the FOMC will announce new purchases at this month's meeting. Joe Gagnon expects the Fed to purchase about $250 billion in securities over the coming six months; but don't be surprised if it buys even more.



But are these really the only solutions? The answer is that they are so _only assuming that the Fed must stick to a floor system of monetary control_. But a floor system is only one of many alternative operating systems the Fed could rely upon; and one need only recognize this to see, not only that there are other ways for the Fed to regain control of interest rates, but that some of those other ways make a lot more sense than the Fed's preferred solution.



Two options in particular come to mind. One is to leave the banking system with a systematic liquidity deficit that makes it systematically dependent upon the proposed Standing Repo Facility. Implementing monetary policy would then be a simple matter of adjusting the overnight rate implicit in the terms of the SRF's full-allotment (that is, unlimited) collateral purchases and sales. According to Ulrich Bindseil (p. 51), this sort of arrangement, which was long employed by the Reichsbank, and is similar to the way the Fed operated when it was first established, is actually ""the simplest way to steer short term interest rates."" Besides making further outright security purchases unnecessary, the set-up would dispense with the need for a rate target ""range"" and the Overnight Reverse Repo Repurchase arrangement used to define and policy that range's lower limit. Under it, excess reserves could still bear interest, though at a rate set below the SRF rate. Finally, to deal with financial crises, the SRF could be supplemented with a broader facility that would offer liquidity to banks in exchange for non-Treasury collateral at rates set using ""product-mix"" auctions designed to price risk and allocate emergency funds efficiently.



Alternatively, the Fed could replace its floor system with a corridor system. That means keeping the SRF rate above the Fed's target, while setting the interest rate on reserves below it, and resorting to daily open-market operations to limit target rate variations within those boundaries. This solution is more challenging, owing to the very large open-market operations that might be needed to accommodate ""autonomous"" changes in the stock of reserves connected to changes in either the TGA balance or the size of the foreign repo pool. But the Fed could reduce that difficulty by placing caps on both the foreign repo program and the TGA, forcing the Treasury, through the latter change, to once again make use the TT&L (Treasury Tax and Loan) program for their originally intended purpose, namely, ""reducing uncertainty about the supply of reserves in the banking system and simplifying the Fed's implementation of monetary policy.""

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning believes it’s high time for the skeptic side to respond more forcefully to the often hyper-exaggerated claims launched by the government funded global warming alarmists and is calling for the founding of an independent Germany-based climate research initiative.

Dr Lüning co-authored together with professor Fritz Vahrenholt the leading skeptic book, Die kalte Sonne, which subsequently was translated in English as The Neglected Sun. Their book clearly provides overwhelming scientific evidence of governing natural factors like the sun and oceans driving climate change throughout history.
Lüning’s idea is dubbed the KlimaForschungsInitiative (KFI) – Climate Research Initiative – which he feels is necessary because the criticism of the apocalyptic end-of-world visions is coming from only a few courageous shoulders and citizens who have recognized the “faulty development” in climate science. The debate is completely lopsided, Lüning writes.
These climate realists as a rule receive no financial support for their work. To the contrary it is highly risky to challenge the IPCC line because positions outside the political mainstream are punished by scientific and societal marginalization. Inconvenient criticism of the climate alarmism line is undesirable. The German Federal Ministry of Environment even published a blacklist of [German and American] climate realists. It’s a real career blocker for scientists at the state-supported research institutes. A University of Graz music professor even suggested the death penalty for people who do not tow the IPCC line.”
Under such a hostile and intolerant climate, who on earth would want to raise a finger?
Climate of political intimidation and fear
Lüning says the pressure is in fact so strong that also western industry is visibly intimidated: “Too large is the fear of upsetting those with political power by presenting inconvenient facts.” Rather than rocking the boat, industry has opted to play along –  and to ship jobs overseas instead, or to shut down complete parts of their company, as is the case with German power giant E.On, Lüning says.
Recently the media reported that lawyers are gearing up to sue the major fossil fuel companies for causing extreme weather, like tropical storm Haiyan“ in the Philippines. Such claims, Lüning writes, are fully based on junk science which he describes as resembling superstition and Medieval witch-hunting.
Lüning comments that the world seems to have gone a bit hysterical. The Philippine tropical storm is a good example. From s scientific view it can be excluded that Haiyan resulted from climate change, a view that is supported by scientific literature. Yet, there are plenty demands being made for industry to pay for the damage.
Too often, Lüning writes, false scientific arguments and outright tricks are allowed to go insufficiently challenged. The German geologists says it is essential that an independent climate research initiative be founded by qualified climate-related scientists who are skeptical of the alarmist scenarios in order adequately to respond to the “wild climate claims” through the use of factual and scientific arguments.
Lüning writes that the main activities of an independent Climate Research Initiative would be determine:
1) The real value of CO2 climate sensitivity.

2) The real role of ocean cycles for the 1977-1998 warming phase.
3 If the correlation between solar activity and the temperature development over the last 10,000 years is just a coincidence, as the climate models like to suggest.
4) If extreme weather events are part of natural variability.
The German maverick geologist writes that here more climate-historical scientific studies are needed in order to better document natural climate variability over the past decades, centuriesand millenia. Important: “Which trends and cycles are really detectable and could they be useful for making climate forecasts?”
Lüning envisions a climate research initiative supported by private individuals and the business sector who are truly interested in finding out what really drives the climate. Lüning proposes the six main responsibilities:
1) Identifying the open, disputed climate issues.
2) Targeted support of research projects, publication of results in peer-reviewed journals.
3) Systematie evaluation of existing climate literature on natural variability and compilation of results.
4) Intensive communication with institutes and media concerning the results. Internet communication with the public.
5) Participation in German and international scientific conferences and workshops.
6) Training seminars for non-scientists, advising.
Lüning is convinced that what is required for a sustainable and rational debate is a “structured cooperation with an independent team of experts with a solid financial foundation” in order to address what the real fears are and which scenarios are unrealistic.

"**A woman wearing a Puerto Rican flag shirt at an Illinois park was racially harangued by a white man as a police officer stood by.**
Mia Irizarry, 24, filmed the stranger's tirade, which unfolded as she set up a picnic to celebrate her birthday.
She repeatedly urges an officer to intervene as the man confronts her, jabbing his finger at her and demanding to know if she is a US citizen.
Local officials said the officer has been assigned to desk duty.
The Forest Preserves of Cook County, a local government agency that manages parkland in the Chicago suburbs, said it was investigating the officer's actions.
Authorities said the intoxicated suspect was arrested and charged with assault and disorderly conduct over the 14 June incident.
He was named in police reports as 62-year-old Timothy Trybus.
In the video clip, as Mia Irizarry sets up her picnic the man approaches and demands to know why she is wearing her shirt, which had ""Puerto Rico"" written on it.
""You should not be wearing that in the United States of America,"" the man shouts.
""Are you a citizen? Are you a United States citizen?""
Ms Irizarry tells him Puerto Rico is part of the US, politely addressing the man as ""sir"".
""We don't own Puerto Rico,"" the man replies. ""Are you educated?""
She asks a park police officer to help, saying: ""I am renting this area and he's harassing me about the shirt that I'm wearing.""
But the policeman does nothing.
She says: ""Officer, I'm renting, I paid for a permit for this area.""
""I do not feel comfortable with him here, is there anything you can do?""
But the officer walks away.
Coming closer, the man says: ""You're not gonna change us, you know that?""
""OK, OK,"" Ms Irizarry says, trying to placate him.
Pointing at her, the man says: ""You're not American, if you were American you wouldn't wear that.
""Why is she wearing that [expletive]?""
As more police officers arrived, the man was detained.
Ricardo Rossello, the governor of Puerto Rico, has tweeted about the Facebook video, which has garnered 1.3m views.
Cook County Board Chairman Toni Preckwinkle said she had spoken to Governor Rossello about the incident.
She said the officer's ""completely unacceptable"" actions do not reflect Cook County's values.
Ms Preckwinkle said: ""I apologise to the young woman who had this terrible experience.""
Illinois Congressman Luis Gutierrez released a statement on Tuesday afternoon urging the Department of Justice to investigate.
State Senator Iris Martinez called for the officer to be fired.
Puerto Rico is a US territory whose residents have been American citizens since 1917."
"Until the Trump presidency became a reality, the main order of business in any review of “24: Legacy” would have been to assess whether the franchise is still viable without Jack Bauer, Kiefer Sutherland’s memorable counterterrorism operative, as its lead character. Now, though, and especially given the events of the past week, it’s the show’s chosen villains, not its hero, who demand attention. That’s because a good number of them speak in foreign accents, and some embody President Trump’s bogyman of the moment, the radical Muslim terrorist. This round of “24” begins Sunday night on Fox after the biggest   television can offer, the Super Bowl, and the first thing viewers will see is foreign terrorists ransacking a home whose owner, an Army Ranger, is tied to a chair and covered in blood. The intruders have already killed his wife and child. “This is for Sheik ” one of them says before shooting the ranger in the head. The premiere was filmed back when it seemed unlikely that Mr. Trump would be elected  —   it was screened in New York on Nov. 7  —   but the opening moments play as if they were scripted to support the immigration restrictions he imposed last week. The series grows considerably more layered as it goes along, with the panoply of villains encompassing a variety of demographics, yet the choice of a bin Laden surrogate as the starting point is sure to reignite the debate over the demonization of Muslims that “24” has encountered before. The new hero is Eric Carter (Corey Hawkins of “Straight Outta Compton”) who led the squad of Rangers who killed   preventing a devastating attack on the United States. For their safety, the Rangers involved were given new identities and   jobs, but Eric quickly discovers that all but he and Ben Grimes (Charlie Hofheimer) an unstable fellow, have been tracked down and killed. The men hunting the Rangers, we learn, are interested less in revenge than in something taken during the   raid. The signature “24” format  —   each episode represents an hour in real time  —   is as   as ever. One ingredient that has more or less disappeared, at least in the first four episodes, is the use of torture as a reliable way to get information, a frequent target of “24” critics. But while Jack Bauer’s violent tactics were repellent, the inner darkness they suggested gave the character a certain complexity. He could show fatherly concern about his daughter one minute and draw blood from a bad guy the next. Eric Carter isn’t as complicated or, as a result, as memorable, at least in the early going, though, by the fourth hour, the character has begun to gain traction. The new story branches quickly into multiple threads in classic “24” fashion, briefly visiting a high school that might be linked to a sleeper cell and also setting up possible romantic entanglements. Before pursuing his enemies, Eric drops off his wife, Nicole (Anna Diop) for safe keeping with his brother, Isaac (Ashley Thomas) a heavily armed drug dealer whom she used to date. (All three characters are black, and yes, it seems fair to ask why the show couldn’t have a black hero without making his brother a stereotypical black gangster.) And, of course, there is the   Unit, C. T. U. with its skilled staff and interoffice intrigues. The job of filling the   void left by Chloe, the analyst played so appealingly in the original series by Mary Lynn Rajskub, appears as if it were going to fall to Mariana (Coral Peña) who also has plenty of attitude and ability. She isn’t used enough early on, but presumably the role will grow. The crisis catches the unit at a moment of leadership change: Rebecca (Miranda Otto of “Homeland”) is stepping down as national director to allow her husband, John (Jimmy Smits) a senator, to run for president. (It’s a “24” rule that a president, potential president or past president must be involved in the  .) Mr. Smits has big shoes to fill  —   the past “24” presidents played by Dennis Haysbert and Gregory Itzin were two of TV’s standout characters in the first decade of this century. Mr. Smits, like Mr. Hawkins, gets off to a slow start, but, by the fourth hour, is becoming interesting. So aside from Jack Bauer, all of the standard “24” elements are in place, including the   look. Yet the terrorism aspect, for now at least, overshadows all. It should be noted that, at least in the first four episodes, the link between  ’s followers and Islam is merely implied, but there’s no doubt who and what are being invoked. (A different subplot involves a radical mosque.) Previous seasons of “24” spread the nefariousness around  —   villains included the Chinese, the Russians, Mexican drug cartels, American politicians and more  —   and “24: Legacy” aims to be an   demonizer, too. Not all of the venal characters here have brown skin or foreign accents, and, in one thread,   bigotry, not radical terror, is the problem. Broadly speaking, however, the world of “24: Legacy” is one in which Islam equals terror radical Muslim operatives are everywhere and no one can be trusted. Yes, the series is fiction, and yes, most TV viewers can distinguish between entertainment and reality. But the stakes for this “24” seem weightier than for most previous versions, because two things are more evident now than they were the last time we saw Jack Bauer. One is that certain people, including some now working in the White House, can’t, or won’t, separate the real from the fake when it supports their interests or beliefs. The other is that an insidious part of human nature thrives on having somebody to hate."
"It seems an anomaly that among the 15 autonomous, specialised agencies within the United Nations – such as the FAO, WMO, WHO, or UNESCO – there is no dedicated environmental organisation.   This secondary status and the subsequent lack of coherence in environmental matters harms global environmental governance. Wouldn’t having a World Environment Organisation (WEO) help to coordinate global environmental and climate change efforts? There have been 40 years of debate over a World Environment Organisation, starting with calls from US foreign policy strategists for an International Environment Agency. Instead, following the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) was created the following year. Despite this positive step, this was a weaker reform than many proposed, and effectively curtailed further debate over the need for a specialised agency. Such a global body was again suggested in 1989, principally by the Netherlands, France and Norway, in order to manage the reduction of ozone-destroying CFCs under the Montreal Protocol which came in to force that year. After the Rio+5 meeting in 1997, Germany, Brazil, Singapore and South Africa again called for a global umbrella body for the environment at the UN General Assembly. The need for the UN to attend more efficiently to environmental matters was once again recognised at the 2005 World Summit. A draft proposal for environmental governance reform was discussed in 2008, but by February 2009 efforts had stalled. Yet again, in the run up to Rio+20 in 2012 there were calls to use this significant milestone to reform international environmental governance. The challenges identified included the need to integrate science and policy, provide a voice for environmental sustainability, secure funding, and to build a coherent and cohesive approach to working within the UN system and meeting the needs of individual countries. In the wake of the conference, it was recognised that global sustainable development issues need a permanent international champion. But delegates failed to uphold the proposal to “upgrade” UNEP to a specialised agency. So despite more than 20 years international conferences since the first Rio environmental summit in 1992, there is today a specialised agency for industrial development, but not for sustainable development. The compromise reached in 2012 was to grant universal membership to UNEP, meaning that any of the 193 UN member states can hold a seat on the governing council, and it will receive with more funding from the UN budget. Despite the UN statement’s claims, this does not tackle any of the structural problems identified at Rio+20, such as the lack of an authoritative, global voice for the environment, and UNEP’s weak role at the science-policy interface. There are more than 500 Multilateral Environment Agreements; these are legally binding international agreements between three or more countries to tackle specific environmental challenges, many of which have their own secretariats and legal structures. But UNEP is, on the whole, unable to help implement policies. It has around 15 offices, whereas the UN Development Programme has 177. Its budget pales in comparison to other organisations. There is also significant overlap of function and expertise between the various organisations that currently exist (and operate autonomously) at the international level. A WEO would deliver the same institutional specialisation of expertise that has been a feature of the UN system to date, and greater coordination on environmental issues. According to a recent report, 62 of 66 countries studied have “flagship” climate change legislation in place. Countries are taking action, but international coordination is conspicuous by its absence. If there are to be Sustainable Development Goals post-2015, as with the Millennium Development Goals, there needs to be an organisation that can coordinate worldwide efforts and monitor progress. If supplied with adequate funding, a specialised agency for the environment could provide greater regional presence, deliver more on the ground, as well as offer improved technical assistance and policy guidance to governments. The lack of a WEO remains a clear sign that the environment is not given the same global status as trade, health and labour, or even maritime affairs, intellectual property and tourism – all of which are represented by UN agencies. This continues, despite the existence of high level political groups on sustainable development, or initiatives like Ban Ki-moon’s Year of Sustainable Energy for All. But is it too late? There would certainly be difficulties in integrating all those involved in administering the various environmental treaties and protocols, which have filled the void left by the lack of a more powerful agency specific to the task. Such an organisation would provide a central point for collaboration around global efforts to tackle the causes and effects all environmental challenges, of which climate change may be the largest. As summarised by the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s (AAAS) excellent What We Know report, “we are at risk of pushing our climate system toward abrupt, unpredictable, and potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts”. I would argue that the reform of UNEP is a step in the right direction, but the job is far from done. Will there be renewed calls for more cohesive global governance following the latest report from the IPCC? The UN Economic and Social Council does have the mandate to create a specialised agency, a move that is strongly supported by 35 nations, but not backed by the US, Russia or China. Forty years on from Stockholm and 20 years on from Rio, a World Environment Organisation still seems a long way away."
"The  UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports has once again called for a “massive shift” to renewable energy. The challenge of curtailing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is considerable, but scientific developments mean that renewables, such as solar power, are becoming economically competitive and a viable option – even in the UK. Despite Britain’s reputation as a cloudy country, the amount of energy the sun shines down on it still greatly exceeds current and projected power consumption. Harnessing solar power is possible without any impact on land use by using photovoltaic (PV) panel systems that can be mounted on top of buildings. England alone has 2,380km2 of roof space that, if lined with conventional solar panel technology, could give a maximum energy generation capacity of 380 GWp (one Wp is one watt of electricity generated by a PV system under full sun). This gives an average power generation of around 50 GW – far outstripping the current average UK power consumption of 36 GW.   Solar capacity can be further increased using unprofitable land such as road verges and building facades. Siting solar power systems close to the point of consumption can also help to reduce transmission losses, reducing overall power consumption. Currently only a fraction of one percent of UK power is provided by solar PV. In Germany, however, a country with similar amounts of sunshine to the UK, solar power provides about 6% of all German electricity annually, and this fraction continues to grow. German solar power helps to meet up to 50% of daytime peak in electricity demand, largely offsetting generation that was previously supplied by gas power plants. Because solar generation is variable – available only during daytime and more abundant in summer – it must either be stored in batteries or complemented by other sources such as other renewables and flexible gas plants. In Germany, experience has shown that the seasonal fluctuation in solar power is partly balanced by wind power, which is strongest during winter. This potential complementarity of wind and solar resources is also true for the UK. The UK government’s 2014 solar strategy aspires to an installed capacity of 20 GWp by 2020. This eightfold increase from the current UK capacity of 2.7 GWp is entirely feasible with present technology, as shown by the German example over the past decade.  The target 20 GWp of PV would generate more than 5% of the UK’s electricity demand and could be integrated as part of a technology mix without major changes to the set up of the country’s power system. Further growth in solar (and other renewable) energy to levels exceeding 20% of average demand could be facilitated with smart grid technology, capable of balancing demand with intermittent sources of generation. Solar PV is a low carbon energy source, with present day PV technology incurring less than 10% of the emissions per unit of electricity power than fossil fuel based generation. The target of 20 GWp solar PV installed in the UK by 2020 could reduce electricity related carbon emissions by 7%. For every GWp installed, this equates to avoiding 500,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. Historically, solar modules were extremely expensive to install. Financial incentives such as feed-in tariffs were necessary to encourage people to set up PV panels. Recently, however, prices have begun to fall with the global growth in panel production. The cost of setting up PV panels and connecting them to existing power systems is also decreasing. Currently, they contribute to half of the total system cost, but this is projected to decrease by 40% over the next five years. The UK government estimates that the price of solar-generated electricity will decrease by more a quarter before 2020, at which point it could be up to 10% cheaper than power from coal-fired power plants. Solar PV systems are expected to become competitive with conventional power in other parts of Europe within a few years. The transition to solar power can be helped with incentive schemes that help to meet upfront costs of installing PV and guard against electricity price fluctuations in the future. Developing new solar PV and related technologies can further reduce carbon emissions both by reducing costs and by broadening the range of applications for solar power. For example, different types of PV panel that are translucent, coloured, flexible or light could be used on building facades, windows and public spaces. Cheaper energy storage technologies would allow PV to be used more widely in off grid situations and for mobile power. Research is also being done to manufacture PV technology more economically. Systems are being developed that are based on printable materials, which can churn out solar cells. This will lower costs and carbon emissions in the manufacturing process. Meanwhile advances continue to be made in the associated technologies of installing panels, energy storage and grid integration. These kinds of emerging solar technologies will help to meet emissions reductions targets and fulfil the promise of low cost, widespread solar power – even in cloudy Britain."

Christopher Luxon has started off his campaign to win Botany by single-handedly pissing off every single existing National caucus member, especially Todd Muller, who is seen as the wet team’s hope to replace the failing Simon Bridges.



But that win could still come hard for Luxon. Ross is fighting for his entire career, and has clear talent in sabotaging others. This could get dirty.



Yes, it is. It is going to be unbelievably dirty. Let’s hope he has tidied up his secret Ashley Madison profile and made sure that the taxi drivers of Auckland have nothing bad to say about his frequent custom.



One difficult thing that Luxon is going to have to explain himself about is his cosy relationship with Jacinda Ardern.



Local Botany delegates (58 out of 60) have already seen off hierarchy-approved star candidates, preferring local candidates and so having to select someone who is so wet he could have an ocean named after himself and also is chummy with the PM might be a step too far. His climate change nonsense and carry-on won’t get him very far in Botany. Neither will his forty-year absence from the area. The last time he lived near Botany there were green fields, dairy farms and the Howick Country Club in the middle of nowhere. All of those are gone along with any memory of his connection to the area. He will be seen as a carpet-bagger being parachuted in by a failed president working with Michelle Boag.



Christopher Luxon enters politics with a target on his back



He won’t just have a target on his back; there will be one on his forehead and on his chest.



The other surprise was the manner of the announcement: a story from the political editor of the top news show in the country. This is a privilege not available to all the other National Party hopefuls who will be looking to stand in Botany.



It was followed by an endorsement by Air NZ board member John Key, who said Luxon would be a “world-class candidate”.



Luxon may already be in breach of candidate selection rules which forbid candidates from speaking to the media. This has all the hallmarks of Boag to scare off other worthy candidates like local girl, re-elected Councillor Katrina Bungard and recently-elected Orakei local board member and cancer campaigner Troy Elliot. They will be displeased by the apparent rule–breaking of Luxon but, with Boag rumoured to be handling his campaign, they should get used to it.



The writer of this article is spot on. It is going to be DIRTY, unbelievably dirty.



Luxon might have thought this was a bright idea to stand for parliament but with a head like his he runs a real risk of being labelled **the Uncle Fester of New Zealand politics.** Especially if rumours are true that he is using Michelle Boag.

"Carl Sagan’s description of our planet as a “pale blue dot” captured two important elements about the Earth: its loneliness in the enormity of space, and the ocean’s overwhelming dominance of the planet. But what it doesn’t quite capture is just how important the ocean is. A description of the ocean by numbers is impressive: a mass of water covering 71% of the planet’s surface with a volume of around 1.3 billion km3. Around two thirds of its volume is below 1,000 metres deep, while its deepest point is 11 km beneath the surface. This vast volume of water exerts a profound influence on the atmosphere, on land, and on the frozen cryosphere. It stabilises planetary temperature, determines our weather, and regulates the content of our atmosphere. The ocean is the heart and lungs of the planet, and without it life would be very difficult or impossible. At a human scale, the ocean’s importance lies in terms of its capacity to provide food, support livelihoods, culture and economies. Coastal populations have been estimated at 1.2 billion people, with population densities along coasts three times higher than the global average. More than 1.5 billion people receive 20% of their protein from fisheries. More than 350 million people are employed due to the ocean, and many see the ocean is the way to meet the future food needs of a growing global population. So while the case for the ocean’s importance goes on and on, the message is straightforward – it is more than a day at the beach, it is critical to life as we know it. But despite its importance to humanity, the ocean and its ecosystems are in decline across many of its regions. Over half the world’s fisheries are fully exploited and at least a third are over-exploited, depleted, or recovering from depletion. Many ecosystems such as coral reefs, oyster beds and kelp forests are declining at rates of 1-2% per year. Marine pollution is spreading rapidly, with both plastic and chemical pollutants found in most parts of the ocean. And oxygen levels in large areas of the deep ocean are plummeting, creating so-called dead zones where life cannot be supported. The list of changes goes on and on. No one in particular is to blame: we all are. Putting blame aside, however, travelling farther down this path the negative consequences become very significant. With so much at stake, the  President of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, stood up at the first World Ocean Summit in Singapore in 2012 and announced the Global Partnership for Oceans.  This “new deal” for the Ocean currently includes over 150 governments, organisations and industry partners including participants from multibillion-dollar companies, non-government organisations, small island states, and leading research institutions. The idea behind the partnership is to bring everyone to the table to solve what are otherwise complex, multidisciplinary, and by nature, wicked problems. The path forward requires complex solutions that benefit all involved parties and do not result in perverse outcomes of winners and losers. That is, matters of conservation should go hand in hand with improvements to food security, economic benefits and commercial incentives. The Blue Ribbon Panel of the partnership – involving leading conservationists, seafood company CEOs, entrepreneurs, government leaders, and NGOs – envisaged the ocean as a single system, with the solutions involving all actors as beneficiaries. Inspiring words.  But isn’t this vision a little impractical.  After all, how could seafood companies really live in harmony with environmentalists? Don’t they have opposing motives – one to catch fish, one to protect fish?  And how could poverty be eliminated in communities while companies made profits and ecosystems were protected? The devil is clearly in the detail. However, what was fascinating about participating in this group was the fact that everybody was of the opinion that working towards a sustainable use of the ocean was an absolute must.  Everyone also recognised that current approaches have failed and that doing more of the same was unlikely to have much of an effect. This week hundreds of leaders will converge on The Hague in the Netherlands for the Global Oceans Action Summit, to discuss how to bring about new partnerships and actions globally. US Secretary of State John Kerry announced at the second World Ocean Summit in February that the US would host an International Oceans Conference on June 16-17 at the US Department of State. Indonesia will host the World Coral Reef Conference in May. The signs are that the world might just be waking up in time to the threat that it faces from its declining oceans."
"**When Hurricane Maria**hit **Puerto Rico, Sofia Abregu became trapped in a seafront apartment overnight and her mum's house in San Juan was partly destroyed.**
**Sofia, who is 26 and a housekeeper, has spent the last month documenting her recovery and sharing it with the BBC.**
**On Thursday, US President Donald Trump classed the government's relief efforts on the island as**""A+"". **Here, Sofia gives her verdict:**
I think a big part of the island is losing hope.
The power is still not on. Some parts of the island are getting power but it's not fully stable.
Debris in the Toa Baja area of San Juan where I live is not being picked up yet - the municipality had to first clear a clandestine garbage dump that residents made.
It brought a plague of rats, cockroaches and deadly bacteria. I was told that an 11-year-old died because of it last week.
Debris in the tourist parts of San Juan is being removed but not in the other worst-hit parts. But the CataÃ±o area is clean - the mayor has done an amazing job.
My place was one of the really damaged houses in the hurricane when a dam burst in Tao Baja.
Flying debris broke the wooden roof and ripped out electric wires, while concrete parts of the house cracked, too. It's been raining inside the house.
Contractors told me the repairs will cost $20,000 (Â£15,170) alone. I cannot afford this.
The one update I can give you is that we managed to get the tarps for the roof and I actually installed them today.
Schools are closed - most are being used as shelters, so they are figuring out how to still provide that service and to keep children safe.
I heard on the radio that some schools should be open by today, others by next week.
Hospitals are open and working to the maximum capacity. Most of the hospitals were hit pretty hard but they are doing their best, especially dealing with the dead.
I have to say that the armed forces and police are doing their best to keep things under control and making sure people get the supplies they need.
The shelter near me is providing food, water, hygiene and even Clorox.
Mobile-phone signal is still bad but it's getting better - towers are being repaired around the island to make sure that everyone can communicate.
It will take time to reach places, which is making people angry, but the authorities are truly doing the best that they can from what I've seen.

We are drowning in people who talk a lot and do very little, so it’s refreshing to find someone who doesn’t say much but actually does something useful.



Boyan Slat is passionate about tackling pollution but he’s no social justice warrior because Boyan does stuff more than he talks. He didn’t preach or whine about our polluted oceans, he just got on and did something about it, and Ocean Cleanup was born.



Boyan was 16 years old when he started designing an oceanic garbage collection system that uses ocean currents to collect the enormous plastic garbage floating about. He wanted to collect the plastic waste and recycle it to fund the process, and nine years later he finally cracked the tricky retrieval process. 



“System 001/B is successfully capturing and collecting plastic debris. After one year of testing, **we have succeeded in developing a self-contained system** in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch that is using the natural forces of the ocean to passively catch and concentrate plastic, thereby confirming the most important principle behind the cleanup concept that was first presented by Boyan Slat at a TEDx conference in October 2012.”



Earlier this year, ExPFC wrote for _Whaleoil_ that he was impressed by Boyan’s “pretty ingenious system involving a floating U-shaped boom hundreds of metres long, which is designed to be abandoned in the ocean while it gets blown about by the wind and currents, casually trapping thousands of tonnes of plastic ready for later removal by a ship for recycling.” He was however highly critical of Ocean Cleanup’s self-imposed time frame. 



“If all goes according to plan the device could eventually remove half the plastic in the great Pacific Garbage Patch – a trash filled vortex in the Pacific Ocean that is more than twice as large as Texas – within five years.” 



“By their own admission, the GPGP covers over 1.6 million square kilometres, that’s apparently three times the size of France. Each one of these booms has an open end of just 100 metres or so, that’s only 0.1 sq kms of area trawled for each kilometer drifted. In any case, there simply will never be enough of them to make any difference whatsoever.But at least they have managed to take some plastic out of the water on their ill-fated trial.The plan, which has so far cost over $20 million, was to ramp up the program with the aim to soon have around sixty of these booms floating about in the ocean, leading to 50% of the plastic being removed every five years!”



ExPFC did some thinking and came up with the idea of placing Boyan’s retrieval booms at major river mouths because that’s where 95% of plastic enters the ocean.



Now, if someone were to tell Boyan about ExPFC’s brilliant idea it might grow legs!



Compare Boyan Slat at 16 years old with his antithesis, Greta Thunberg, at the same age.  
Where Boyan’s passion for pollution is channelled into the energy needed to design a solution, Greta’s passion about climate change is focused on making sure the whole world knows about her angst on the subject. She protests by skipping school once a week, going on hunger strikes and generally berating the world about not doing enough about climate change.



Greta preceded our PTPM when she assailed us from the UN podium, which was a good thing because Greta doesn’t need any lessons from Ardern about **talking about problems rather than solving them.** Both women are experts in the art of saying much and doing little.



We need a resurgence of the art of saying little and doing much. Our hero in this, by the way, is Donald Trump – a rarity in politics due to his ability to talk and walk at the same time.

The northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula is Warming Fast   
\-- BBC, August 23, 2012



No, it’s not. When BBC reported this, the Northern Peninsula hadn’t on average warmed a lick in thirty years.   
  
In the 1990s and early part of this century, news reports about the dramatic warming of the northernmost Antarctic Peninsula—the tip of the 800-mile dagger pointed at the heart of Tierra del Fuego—were a common staple. And, while scientists wouldn’t write this in the literature, they were happy to blame it on dreaded carbon dioxide on television, as paleoclimatologist Robert Mulvaney did in the 2012 BBC feature.   
  
The story has become increasingly curious. Marc Oliva of the University of Lisbon recently examined the high quality weather stations over the northern peninsula and the nearby South Shetland Islands. There is a decent warming trend, averaging around 1.5⁰C, from the beginning of the data in 1957 (the year when Antarctica was instrumented as a part of the International Geophysical Year) to the early 1980s, or about a quarter-century. That’s a warming, if it continued (and surely it would!), of 6⁰C per century. The warming that gets huge attention is actually only from a single station, Faraday (now renamed Vernadsky), which warmed roughly 2.5⁰C during the same period. If that continued (and surely it would!), that’s 10⁰C/century!   
  
Oliva et al. wrote that the “Faraday/Vernadsky warming trend is an extreme case, circa twice those of the long-term records from other parts of the AP.” The variability in the Faraday/Vernadsky record is also huge—around three times as much as other stations in the area, probably because it is often at the edge of the sea-ice.   




Satellite data show that sea-ice around Antarctica grew from when satellite data began in 1978 through early 2016, especially after 2000. Last April, the satellite’s sensor started sending back bizarre data. The University of Illinois people who archive this at _Cryosphere Today_ have been using backup sensors that are giving completely strange stuff, such as a huge crash in Antarctic sea ice—larger and faster than anything in the record—followed by an even larger gain. That seems impossible, so recent sea ice data are just plain suspect.   
  
The data shown below are from Olivia et al. What is obvious is since the early 1980s—over three decades ago—there’s no net change of which to speak. And if you want to be picky about it, there a net decline in temperature that begins in the late 1990s, the same time the infamous “hiatus” in global warming started.   
  
Last year, John Turner published a paper in _Nature_ providing evidence that the lack of recent warming is consistent with natural variability _as well as the previous warming_. To wit:   




Therefore all of these [nearby ice-core] studies suggest that the rapid warming on the AP [Antarctic Peninsula] since the 1950s and the subsequent cooling are both within the bounds of the natural decadal-scale variability of the region. 







But that’s not what the public hears.

Guest Essay by Barry Brill
The timing couldn’t be worse.
On 23-26 September, scores of representatives of the world’s Environment Ministries are scheduled to meet in Stockholm to wordsmith the final draft of the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) of the key WG1 (physical science) portion of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC).
The draft SPM, sent to governments on 2 August, is a 22-page condensation of 14 chapters comprising 1,914 pages of material discussing scientific papers that were published between 2006 and 15 March 2013.
This SPM is (or could be) a document of world-shaking importance. As Bloomberg points out – “it is designed to be used by ministers working to devise by 2015 a global treaty to curb climate change”. 
The timetable for the global treaty was deferred at the Durban COP because developing countries (particularly China and India) felt that the 2013 SPM was an indispensable input to the negotiations. Governments need an authoritative up-to-date assessment of both the extent and the causes of the climate change threat, present and future.
But the SPM has been sidelined by momentous climate change events that occurred after its March cut-off date – and even after the date the draft was circulated.

Climate sensitivity
The “extent of warming” issue turns on how sensitive the planet is to increasing CO2 concentrations. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) was crudely estimated by Charney in 1979 at 3.0 ±1.5°C and that range remained more-or-less constant through all four previous IPCC reports.
During 2012, several groups of researchers noted that recent data and modern diagnostics now showed that the 30-year old 3°C mid-point had been grossly over-stated. Peer-reviewed journal papers included:
• Ring et al: estimates of climate sensitivity ranged from 1.5 to 2.0°C.
• Van Hateren: millennium-scale sensitivity found to be 2.0 ±0.3°C.
• Aldrin et al: the 90% credible interval ranges from 1.2°C to 3.5°C, with a mean of 2°C
This, of course, led to great dissension and became the major challenge faced by the lead authors of WG1. Although we don’t yet know how they finally reacted, a leaked copy of the SPM draft suggests that they mainly held to the longstanding orthodoxy.
In January 2013, the British media reported that the UK Met Office was projecting a 20-year standstill in global warming by 2017. This ‘pause’ had not been predicted by climate models. In February, IPCC chairman Pachauri admitted that the temperature data had already been flat for 17 years, while opining that a standstill of 30 years would be required to rebut the previous consensus.
Both “cause” and “extent” issues are heavily dependent on the validity of climate simulations by the contemporary Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), as are all IPCC projections of future planetary temperatures and their impacts. Serious scientific doubts about either ECS-related inputs or the accuracy of temperature outputs would be fatal to the credibility of the AR5.
After the March cut-off date for WG1 papers, the following 2013 papers have strongly reinforced concerns regarding the exaggeration of climate sensitivity:
• Otto et al: the best estimate of sensitivity is 30% below the CMIP5 multimodel mean.
• Forster et al: analysis of CMIP5 shows that 2/3 are above the Otto ‘likely’ range.
• Masters: median estimate of ECS is 1.98°C.
• Lewis: improved methodology shows the mode and median to be 1.6K
In congressional testimony, Judith Curry cited the Hawkins graph depicting observed trends below 90% of CMIP5 projections, and notes that warming may not resume until mid-century. James Hansen attributes the ‘hiatus’ to a combination of natural variability and lower sensitivity but predicts “temperature will rise significantly in the next few years with the nex El Nino phase.”
Temperature standstill
The temperature standstill has been apparent in the data for many years, but the tribalism of climate science rendered it unmentionable until the public disclosures of early 2013. Once spoken, it demanded an explanation – and it then became clear there was a great dearth of research on the subject. By the time researchers were ready to fill this gap, the draft SPM had already been dispatched.
During August 2013, a flood of highly influential papers have appeared:
• von Storch & Zorita[1] found that observed temperatures 1998-2012 were not consistent with 23 tested CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, even at the 2% confidence level. The inconsistency increases rapidly with trend length and a 20-year trend (ie to 2017) would lie outside the ensemble of all model-simulated trends.
• von Storch & Zorita (the same paper) concludes that ‘natural’ internal variability and/or external forcing has probably offset the anthropogenic warming during the standstill. Overestimated sensitivity may also have contributed.
• Tung & Zhou[2] reported that the “underlying net anthropogenic warming rate has been steady since 1910 at 0.07-0.08°C/decade, with superimposed AMO-related ups and downs ..”. The sharply increased CO2 concentrations of recent decades has not caused warming to accelerate, as was predicted by the models.
• Yu Kosaka & Shang-Ping Zie[3] plausibly found that climate models have vastly under-estimated natural variation. La-Nina-like cooling in the Eastern Pacific throughout the 21st century (since the PDO turned negative) has conquered the projected greenhouse warming. The 0.68°C warming trend during 1975-98 (when the PDO was positive) would have been[4] 0.4°C natural and only 0.28°C anthropogenic.
• Katz et al[5] says the critical uncertainty measures used by the IPCC are “out of date by well over a decade”. Modern statistical techniques could improve assessments “dramatically”.
• Fyfe Gillett & Zwiers[6] focused on the extraordinary gap between the temperature simulations of 37 CIMP5 models and the observed outcomes. Due to a ‘combination of errors’, the models have overestimated warming by 100% over the past 20 years and by 400% over the past 15 years.
Come the revolution…
These new papers devastate the IPCC orthodoxy that current and future global temperatures are mostly driven by greenhouse gas emissions, and will reach dangerous levels later this century. On the other hand, all older papers are blindsided by their apparent failure to take account of the recent data (standstill).
The IPCC’s 2001 report cautioned[7]: In climate research and modelling, we should recognise that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible. The most we can expect to achieve is the prediction of the probability distribution of the system’s future possible states by the generation of ensembles of model solutions. This reduces climate change to the discernment of significant differences in the statistics of such ensembles.
The “dangerous anthropogenic global warming” (DAGW) hypothesis is based on a clear difference between CMIP5 runs with natural plus anthropogenic forcing, versus natural variability only. That difference now disappears when ensembles are adjusted to reflect current empirical data. It is quite conceivable that natural variabilty (including natural forcing) has historically dwarfed anthropogenic effects and will persistently do so in future.
In his seminal 1962 work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn persuasively argued that science does not progress through the linear accumulation of knowledge but undergoes periodic revolutions or ‘paradigm shifts’.
In Kuhn’s view, no evidence that is incompatible with the current paradigm will be entertained during long periods of normal science. However, as anomalous results build up, science eventually reaches a crisis which drives the necessary acceptance of a new paradigm, which subsumes both the old and new results into a new framework. Kuhn calls this transformative point, revolutionary science. 
2013 is ushering in a long-delayed revolution in climate science. A new paradigm is demanded which recognizes that AGW is but one non-determinative component in a ‘non-linear chaotic system’.
Dealing to the paradigm shift
All of this leaves the IPCC in a terrible bind regarding its September meeting. Should it:
• rubber-stamp a SPM that has been overtaken by events?
• add a major caveat to the state of play in March 2013, promising an addendum will be issued to cover post-cut-off papers? or
• adjourn the meeting to accomodate a crash program to re-write both the WG1 Technical Report and the consequent SPM?
The business as usual course is the worst option. With tense international negotiations riding on this document, it is far better that it be delayed than wrong – or indefensible. No government can make far-reaching policy decisions on the basis of a report which is widely believed to be obsolete before it is released.
An interim report suffers from a similar credibility deficit. Already[8], Environment departments from the USA and the European Union have formally sought more clarity on the “warming hiatus” and have asked the IPCC to include full information in the SPM.
“The recent slowing of the temperature trend is currently a key issue, yet it has not been adequately addressed in the SPM,” said the EU.
Although the draft says the trend has tapered off, the implications are unclear – causing the US to comment “a bunch of numbers are [left] up in the air without a concrete conclusion.”
Several countries, including China, seek information on the heat uptake of the oceans or other natural variances which might have depressed climate change data.
The draft SPM apparently fails to mention[9] that 30-year warming trends have declined each year since peaking in 2003. Or that the latest 10-year period (2003-12) is the coolest decade[10] since satellite records began in 1979.
WG1 has a track record of ignoring inconvenient research on grounds that it is ‘isolated’ or published in obscure journals. That can hardly be the fate of the August papers. All but one have been accepted by Nature Climate Change. Several of the authors are active contributors to IPCC reports, with Zwiers a current vice-chairman of WG1 and Fyfe a review editor.
Revolutionary climate science is under way. The question now is whether the IPCC is up to the challenge.

President Obama’s administration has been defined by executive actions issued in response to congressional gridlock. At every stage, conservatives challenged those actions as violations of the separation of powers, and with the election of Donald J. Trump, each of them can now easily be rescinded. Though the Supreme Court will expand with a Trump nominee to replace Justice Scalia, its docket will get a lot smaller. What Obama’s pen‐​and‐​phone giveth, Trump’s Sharpie‐​and‐​Twitter will taketh away.



First, the Court’s immigration docket is set to shrink. In June 2016, the Supreme Court divided four‐​to‐​four on the legality of Obama’s executive action on immigration, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). Currently, the case is pending before the federal district court in Brownsville, Texas, but it won’t be for long. Once the policy is rescinded, as Mr. Trump has promised it will be, Texas will move to dismiss the case. A bigger question looms over Obama’s 2012 immigration action, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. DACA was not held up by the courts, and nearly 1.5 million aliens have received lawful presence under it. President Obama may renew those benefits for an additional two years, but Trump could cancel them instantly.





The president‐​elect could very quickly dismantle Obama’s legacy of executive action.



Second, the Court will not have to decide another thorny religious‐​liberty conflict. Last May, the Justices were unable to resolve the appeal of the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns that objected to Obamacare’s contraceptive mandate. Religious charities, including the Little Sisters, objected to Obamacare’s contraceptive mandate. The government insisted that female employees of the charities must be provided contraceptive coverage through the _same_ health‐​insurance plan that covered their regular doctors’ visits. The charities did not object to their employees using contraceptive coverage, but wanted it to be provided through a _different_ plan entirely separate from their own agreements with insurers. Through one simple regulatory process, Trump could satisfy the Little Sisters of the Poor while providing female employees contraceptive coverage on a separate plan. Though it would create a slight burden for the employees, they’d get their coverage, and the Nuns would not feel complicit in sin. The Justices, who were torn by this difficult ethical question, could take a pass.



Third, the Justices will likely not have to determine the validity of the Obama administration’s policy prohibiting discrimination against transgender students in public‐​school bathrooms. The case of _Gloucester County School Board v. G.G._ concerns the Department of Education’s interpretation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972: Does discrimination on the basis of “sex” include discrimination on the basis of gender identity? Obama’s DOE answered that question affirmatively in a “Dear Colleague” letter sent to educational institutions nationwide, rather than through the formal notice‐​and‐​comment rule‐​making process. A Trump administration could simply withdraw the “Dear Colleague” letter, and ask the Supreme Court to take the case off its docket. Schools would still be free to provide protections to transgender students, but could not be compelled to do so by the federal government.



Fourth, President Obama’s climate‐​change agenda is toast. With a simple executive order on January 20, 2017, President Trump could withdraw the so‐​called “Clean Power Plan.” The Environmental Protection Agency would then commence a new rule‐​making process to rescind the Obama administration’s interpretation of the Clean Air Act. And the Justice Department would ask the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to put the pending litigation on hold. (Recall that one of Justice Scalia’s last acts before he passed away was to halt the Clean Power Plan while the case was still pending.) Once the rulemaking process is complete, President Trump could formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Without the participation of the United States, the agreement will likely fall apart.



Fifth, the case of _House of Representatives v. Burwell_ will draw to a premature close. The Obama administration has made payments to insurance companies that Congress never appropriated. Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan have pursued litigation to challenge the legality of these payments. Once the Trump administration halts the subsidies, the case will be dismissed. Insurance companies will still be free to bring private causes of action against the government, but the House’s litigation will wind down.



More generally, the insurance companies will have to deal with a unified government committed to repealing Obamacare. Because the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010 through the reconciliation process to avoid a Republican filibuster, the law can also be repealed through the same process in 2017. I am already planning the final book in my Obamacare trilogy. The first book was titled _Unprecedented_. The sequel, released last month, is titled _Unraveled_. The final entry will be called _Undone_.

"The Saharan dust that clogged air and dirtied cars recently may seem like a nuisance, but in fact contains some essential nutrients – if, that is, you’re phytoplankton. The dust and sand blown from Africa into the ocean provides nutrients for these microscopic ocean plants, upon which the entire marine food chain depends. The most important is iron. And although these plants only need very small quantities, iron is essential – and only supplied by dust or by other contact with land masses. As part of a wide ranging endeavour to study changes in the open ocean and to improve our predictions of how the oceanic system may change over the coming decades, the National Oceanography Centre maintains three multidisciplinary observatories. These are observation and recording stations anchored to the ocean floor around 4,800m deep with but with sensors extending up to the surface.  Attached to these moorings are a variety of sensors and samplers some of which send data every few hours by satellite to the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton. Each is set in a very different environment, in terms of how productive the ocean around it is, how much desert dust reaches it, and the extent of carbon dioxide exchange between the air and sea. For example, the observatories at the Northern Oligotrophic Gyre (NOG, in the middle of the North Atlantic), and the Southern Oligotrophic Gyre (SOG, between Brazil and West Africa,) are fixed in locations right in the middle of the most unproductive, desert-like parts of the world’s oceans. But one of the crucial differences seen from comparing recordings from them is that although phytoplankton concentrations from satellite observations at each seem very similar, the amount of carbon being sequestered at NOG is about double that at SOG. The reason for this difference is the greater supply of Saharan dust reaching the NOG, although the exact mechanism for this is still under discussion. It could be that the iron from the dust enables some specialist phytoplankton called diazotrophs to take up nitrogen from the seawater as dissolved nitrogen gas (a process which requires a lot of iron), providing a growth spurt just as fertiliser would do on crops on land. As the growing phytoplankton use this nitrogen and other nutrients they also take up carbon dioxide, as do plants on land. Another explanation could be that the dust supply itself acts as ballast, making sticky carbon-rich organic particles heavier and dragging them to the bottom where the carbon can be considered sequestered from the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years. The third observatory, the Porcupine Abyssal Plain observatory (PAP, well beyond the edge of the continental shelf southwest of Ireland) is one of the most sophisticated and longest-running observatories in the open ocean. For the past 25 years an increasing number of measurements have been recorded at the site, sending back data on carbon dioxide, oxygen, plant pigment, particle and nutrient concentration by satellite every few hours. Other recordings such as time lapse photographs of the seabed and passing creatures and the downward flux of particulate matter in the deep ocean are recovered once per year when we visit the site on one of the NERC research vessels.  Although this recent visit of Saharan dust to Britain’s south and east has caused some consternation, the supply reaching the PAP observatory has not been very great as its trajectory from the Sahara swept across the continent and not out to sea. In any case, at this time of year iron would probably not be in short supply at PAP. This regular supply of dust to the ocean has changed massively over timescales of 10,000 to 100,000 years, and will do so again in the future – possibly much more quickly as a result of climate change brought about by human activity. It’s of key importance to understand how the system functions and what the consequences of these changes will be on the oceans’ ability to continue to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. At present it draws up about a third of the planet’s carbon emissions, but there is considerable debate about whether this will increase or decrease in the future. Our ambition to reduce atmospheric CO2 further has driven a debate over whether we could encourage the oceans to take up more CO2 than at present. After all, much of the ocean is short of iron nutrients, and it was suggested around 25 years ago that fertilising the ocean with iron to boost phytoplankton growth and so drawn out more carbon from the atmosphere would be inexpensive as such small quantities are required. The jury is still out about whether this is a viable proposal, and such research has been strictly regulated due to possible unintended consequences. This is in my opinion the right way forward, although funds for carrying out this research have so far been hard to acquire. It is essential for decisions about geoengineering to be taken with a good knowledge of the benefits and costs; hopefully such research can be conducted before it is too late."

Julia’s guest is Matt Ridley, the science and climate change writer, who joins her to discuss the Extinction Rebellion protests over climate change and what the proposed targets to cut carbon emissions will actually mean for the lives of ordinary people. 



A Tory peer, Matt Ridley has been writing about science for 30 years, for the Spectator, the Economist, The Times and the Daily Telegraph. 



He is also the author of several best selling books on science, selling more than a million copies, including The Rational Optimist – How Prosperity Evolves.

"Europe has lost a vastly increased area of forest to harvesting in recent years, data suggests, reducing the continent’s carbon absorption capacity and possibly indicating wider problems with the EU’s attempts to combat the climate crisis. Many of the EU’s forests – which account for about 38% of its land surface area – are managed for timber production, and thus harvested regularly. But the loss of biomass increased by 69% in the period from 2016 to 2018, compared with the period from 2011 to 2015, according to satellite data. The area of forest harvested increased by 49% in the same comparison, published in the journal Nature Research.  This indicates that much more harvesting has occurred in a short period, even accounting for natural cycles and the impact of events such as forest fires and heavy snows. The harvested area could be expected to vary by less than about 10% owing to cycles of growing and planting, and similar effects, according to Guido Ceccherini of the EU Joint Research Centre, lead author of the study. Other factors are therefore likely to be in play, and these could include increased demand for wood as a fuel, and bigger markets for timber and other wood products. The satellite data could therefore be an early indicator of unsustainable demands being placed on the EU’s forests. The loss of forest biomass is most pronounced in Sweden, which accounted for 29% of the increase in harvesting, and Finland, for about 22%. Much less affected were Poland, Spain, Latvia, Portugal and Estonia, which jointly accounted for about 30% of the increase in the 26 countries studied. Ceccherini told the Guardian that the observed increase in harvesting and the loss of biomass was unlikely to result in a decline in the area of the EU that is forested overall, as most of the harvested forests would be regenerated. But it would disrupt the carbon absorption capacity of the EU’s forests in the short term, he said. “The forests continue to remain a carbon sink, but less than before,” said Ceccherini. “Even if part of the harvested biomass carbon is used in long-lasting wood products, possibly replacing more energy-intensive materials such as steel or cement, most of it will return to the atmosphere as CO2 in a short period of time, [from] months to a few years. Until the carbon stock in harvested areas returns to previous levels, which takes several decades, depending on the type of forest, an increase in harvest is therefore equivalent to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere.” Forests offset about 10% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions. As the areas harvested are likely to be replanted, the new growth will continue to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so Europe’s carbon balance may not be greatly affected in the long term. However, the researchers said it was important to find out why the harvesting has increased so suddenly, in case it indicates wider underlying problems with the way in which Europe’s forests are being managed. This study cannot definitively establish the causes of the increases in harvesting, so more research is needed. Increase in demand for timber and wood products, such as pulp and paper, and more burning of biomass for fuel may be behind the rapid rise in harvesting observed in the Nordic countries. If so, according to the researchers, it is important to know so that any adverse impacts can be quickly contained. Prof Thomas Crowther, founder of Crowther Lab, who was not involved in the research, said: “It is concerning to see that the increasing demand for forest products may be reducing the carbon stored within living biomass in European forests. It is possibly more concerning that forest removal may also threaten the storage of carbon below ground. These high-latitude forests support some of the largest soil carbon stock on earth. If forest clearing threatens the integrity of high-latitude soil carbon stocks, then the climate impacts may be stronger than previously expected.”"

The price of gold, oil and many other commodities crashed last week. The stock markets zoomed and economists smiled, suddenly seeing positive consequences in three areas — inflation, the trade deficit and the fiscal deficit.



These three factors had earlier dragged down the economy to its lowest growth rate for a decade, just 4.7 per cent in the last quarter. But the global commodity crash should reduce inflation in India too, cheaper imports should shrink the trade deficit, and the fiscal deficit should shrink because oil and fertiliser subsidies will reduce. This is a triple helping of manna from above. Does it mean that the worst is over, and that the flagging Indian economy will now take off?



Not so fast. First, wait and see if the price crash last week was a blip that will soon be reversed. If in fact it is a new trend — which seems likely — there remains the danger that it signals another global recession. Historically, a simultaneous crash in gold, oil and other commodities has heralded falling world demand, culminating in recession. So, manna from heaven could turn into poison.





The bursting of a bubble is often a sign of a supercycle ending, and hopefully that’s what is happening today.



Without ruling this out, I incline towards a more favourable interpretation: we are seeing the end of a global commodity super‐​cycle, driven for a decade by double‐​digit growth in China, India and other developing countries. The end of the super‐​cycle promises a favourable price climate for the coming decade, but this will yield fast growth only in countries with growthfriendly policies, which India lacks today.



Commodity super‐​cycles occur with gaps of several decades. The last big one was in the 1970s, ending in the early 1980s. Super‐​cycles drive up commodity prices hundreds of percent. This happened between 2002 and 2012, when oil went from $25/​barrel to $120/​barrel, and gold went from $ 250 per ounce to $ 1,890.



In the earlier super‐​cycle in the 1970s, high commodity prices induced new technologies that sharply reduced consumption of materials (stronger but lighter steel, energy‐​efficient vehicles and appliances). Besides, from the 1980s to 2000, global growth was dominated by the West, which had entered an area of services‐​intensive growth requiring relatively few materials (more entertainment, tourism and cellphone/​internet rather than buying large clunky goods). So, global demand for commodities decelerated and stayed low, keeping prices low too.



But then followed the rise of China and India in the 1990s. Cumulatively, the developing countries began to dominate world growth in the 2000s. These developing countries were still at a material‐​intensive stage of development — the rising middleclass wanted more goods of every sort. So, their fast growth hugely increased world demand for commodities. Supply could not catch up quickly, partly because environmental rules had become much stiffer and led to long delays in approval. These factors stoked a fresh commodity super‐​cycle. But, as before, this induced material‐​saving technologies (small and hybrid cars, e‐​commerce, and paperless offices).



After the Great Recession of 2007-09, many analysts thought a sharp global recovery would follow, with a continuing super‐​cycle. China, India and others managed rapid growth again in 2009-10 and 2010-11, and commodity prices rose again. But then the global recovery ran out of steam, the US recovery weakened, and the Eurozone plunged into crisis and stagnation. Rich countries could no longer soak up ever‐​rising imports from Asia, and so Asia slowed too.



Global growth is going to be much slower in the coming decade, with China and India aiming at no more than 7–8 per cent growth. So commodity demand will be more sober, even as long‐​delayed new mines are opening. There’s a good chance of returning to at least a decade of modest, stable prices.



The bursting of a bubble is often a sign of a supercycle ending, and hopefully that’s what is happening today. In the 2000s, speculators piled into commodity markets, and traded trillions of dollars worth of commodity derivatives daily. In some cases, speculative demand rather than industrial demand was the main inflationary force, gold being the outstanding example.



Going by this optimistic interpretation, the worst may indeed be over for the Indian economy. It does not mean an automatic return of fast growth. Deep structural problems have arisen in infrastructure, land acquisition, and environmental, forest and panchayat clearances of projects. Many industrialists say they are going abroad to invest, since investment in India has become so difficult. Only with purposive reform will growth become rapid again. Even so, it will not exceed 7–8 per cent.



But don’t count your chickens before they hatch. Watch out, first and foremost, for the possibility that last week’s commodity crash heralds another global recession. Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.

Europe Climate Policy Blows Engine…”Giant Failure” … Scientists “Failed Tricking Their Way Past Democracy” …”Mood Of Resignation”

Good news!
This is about one of the most damning pieces on the European climate movement I’ve read all year. An atmosphere of resignation is truly sweeping through Germany’s climate movement. Flagship media are waking up.
We’re winning!




“Failed tricking their way past democracy”
Germany’s equivalent of the Washington Post, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) has written a blistering criticism of Hans Schellnhuber’s WBGU and activists’ efforts to impose a green authoritarian society on the rest of the world. They overshot and missed the curve. The FAZ introduction reads:
The rescue of the planet gets cancelled. The climate advisory council to the government played high stakes poker. And lost. They failed at tricking their way past democracy.”
In the eyes of one Germany’s leading flagship national dailies, the renowned Frankfurter Allgemenine Zeitung, the attempted green coup led by a small group of elite scientists and a mass of activists has come to grinding halt.

"While many Super Bowl advertisers chose to be silly or sentimental with their commercials on Sunday, it was the few that ventured  —   or appeared to venture  —   into political territory that attracted the most attention. Among the major brands that used their commercial time for social commentary was Airbnb, which had decided just last week to run an ad. In the ad, the company promoted its view of an open, multicultural world, reflecting its commitment to housing refugees.   revived an ad it ran during the 2014 Super Bowl featuring people singing a multilingual version of “America the Beautiful. ” It managed to strike a new chord with viewers, given the recent national conversation around immigration and diversity, and it prompted a flood of conversation on Twitter. “I thought it was great for Coke to air an old ad because today it feels even more relevant than it did in 2014 when they first aired it,” said Lynn Power, chief executive of J. Walter Thompson New York. It was a smart move from the brand to   an old message, she added, given that “you can’t say it’s a reactionary thing. ” In an interview before halftime during the game, Rob Schwartz, chief executive of TBWA’’Chiat’’Day New York, said, “If there’s anything that’s screaming out here, it’s diversity. ” He added: “People are saying, ‘Is this trolling Trump?’ I don’t think it’s trolling. It’s a big smack in the face of ‘dude, this is America. ’” Still, for the most part, overtly political statements were few and far between  —   by design. A   advertiser, 84 Lumber, had its initial proposal for a commercial rejected by Fox last month for being “too controversial” because it showed a   mother and daughter confronting a border wall between the United States and Mexico. The company edited its spot to remove the wall and directed users to see the end of its commercial online. Budweiser spent days telling the news media that its ad was not a response to President Trump’s recent immigration crackdown. The company’s commercial featured the journey of one of its founders to the United States from Germany in the 1800s and the discrimination he overcame on his way to success. The hashtag #BoycottBudweiser trended on Twitter early on Sunday evening, apparently started by people who disliked the ad. But it was then used by others to defend Budweiser and mock the people who were boycotting the ad. Carl Marci, chief neuroscientist at Nielsen, the TV ratings company, said, “If you make people think too much or get too serious during a game where people are really looking to be entertained, you’re taking a risk. ” That risk can pay off, though. Audi’s ad went viral before the game, having passed five million views on YouTube as of Friday. It was narrated by a father asking pointed questions about what to tell his young daughter one day as she competed in a cart race, such as, “Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets?” As she won the race, he reflected that perhaps he would be able to “tell her something different. ” The commercial ended with text including a line saying that Audi of America is “committed to equal pay for equal work. ” But escapism and sentimentality were the strategy for many advertisers as brands tried to provide an antidote to the weighty issues facing the country this year. Mr. Clean was unexpectedly portrayed as something of a sex symbol. Michelob Ultra used the theme song from “Cheers” in its ad, which presented the label as a   beer. Justin Bieber showed off his dance moves for   while Avocados From Mexico jokingly used subliminal messaging to urge more avocado consumption. “Very often on the Super Bowl, we see emotional advertising, or we see   advertising,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. He added, “All the controversy in the country is making advertisers nervous about addressing big, significant issues, and in a polarizing time, it is safest to stick to the product and stick to lighthearted humor. ” Advertisers were willing to pay, on average, about $5 million for   spots during the Super Bowl this year  —   or around $167, 000 per second  —   and even more in promotional costs to reach the game’s more than 100 million viewers. Many released the full ads or teasers online before Sunday while brands such as Snickers and Hyundai went the opposite route, producing their commercials during the game itself, which aired on Fox. Some were not impressed by the bulk of the ads that aired on Sunday, particularly given the rising cost of the commercials. “Comedy, celebrities and anthropomorphic creatures seem to be the   schtick,” said Andrew Essex, the chief executive of Tribeca Enterprises and a former C. E. O. of the creative agency Droga5. “After 50 years, half a century, it’s all feeling a little formulaic,” he added. “I find myself, as someone who’s not doing this anymore, wondering if this is the single greatest act of economic immolation on the planet. ” Others felt that the ads delivered. “People want to see lighthearted things in the Super Bowl, especially at a time when there are so many big issues in the country,” Mr. Calkins said."
"**President Donald Trump has been bellyaching about Puerto Rico's parlous finances, as the US territory struggles to regain its footing after Hurricane Maria.**
His focus on the Caribbean island's more than $70bn (Â£53bn) debt mountain has renewed questions about how it is to be solved.
The Puerto Rican government can't borrow money on the private market to rebuild due to the debt problems.
Hurricane Maria, which brought economic activity to a halt, has also created an immediate fiscal crisis: the government is running out of money.
Congress has just approved more than $36bn in disaster funding, including a $4.9bn loan to keep Puerto Rico operating.
But the remainder will be divided up among all areas affected in recent storms, including Texas and Florida.
Does Trump care about Puerto Rico's hurricane victims?
Puerto Rico debt crisis: How did we get here?
Lawmakers in Congress have said they will consider additional funds for more long-term building efforts, but it's not clear how much that might be.
Moody's Analytics estimates property damage from Hurricane Maria could reach as high as $55bn, with total losses hitting $95bn.
Governor Ricardo Rossello has said the island of 3.4 million people, many of whom live in poverty, faces an ""exodus"" without a strong aid package.
Already Puerto Rico's population has plunged by more than 10% since 2006 amid a years-long recession precipitated in part by the end to tax benefits for manufacturers on the island.
Representative Rob Bishop, whose committee oversees US territories, including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, said he expects funding for recovery on Puerto Rico to be ""significant"".
He added that he is focused on legal changes to ease deployment of that money and encourage private investment.
""The federal government by itself is not going to just rebuild two territorial economies [including the Virgin Islands]... going forward,"" he said.
Puerto Rico's power in Congress is limited by its status as a territory and not a state.
It has traditionally found its strongest allies among Democrats, many of whom have slammed the Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria as slow and inadequate.
The White House has said it is committed to the island and President Trump has dismissed the criticism as political posturing.
Puerto Rico's population swap: The middle class for millionaires
Puerto Rico: 'Why did help take nine days to arrive?'
But the president has shown reluctance to help Puerto Rico before.
In a tweet this spring, he described funding for Puerto Rico as a ""bailout"" proposed by Democrats.
On Thursday, he laid responsibility at the door of lawmakers, tweeting that it is for ""Congress to decide what to spend"".
Matt Fabian, a partner at the research firm Municipal Market Analytics, said he doesn't see appetite for major rebuilding funds for Puerto Rico, especially given constraints created by the Republican push for major tax cuts.
""This is not the Congress that is going to provide large unfettered aid for Puerto Rico,"" he said.
In 2016, Congress tried to address Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis through the so-called Promesa law.
The law put the island's finances under the control of a federal oversight panel and created a way to restructure the debts under cover of a kind of bankruptcy protection.
The storm leaves negotiation of those questions back at square one.
Hurricane Maria could give negotiators for Puerto Rico a stronger hand in debt-restructuring talks, bolstering the argument that the government and its agencies cannot pay the debts, Mr Fabian said.
He said the destruction may have also created new opportunities to create deals with bondholders, if the government moves to privatise infrastructure and publicly owned utilities as part of the rebuilding effort.
President Trump earlier this month appeared to raise the tantalising possibility, when he told broadcaster Fox News: ""We have to look at their whole debt structure.""
""You know, they owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street, and we're going to have to wipe that out. You can say goodbye to that.""
The prices of Puerto Rican bonds plunged after the remarks.
But White House advisers swiftly walked back the statement, saying the administration will stick to the path established by Promesa, and that Wall Street shouldn't take the president's comments ""word for word"".
The president cannot unilaterally eliminate the debt - the subject of court battles that are just getting started - and while the federal government could, theoretically, step in and pay off the debts, analysts say politics makes that unlikely.
Some hope aid can lift the economy, ultimately generating tax revenue - and easing repayment of its debt.
But others say the storm will accelerate the island's economic contraction, as people leave for the mainland."

Where are all the hurricanes Al Gore, Bill McKibben, Joe Romm, and Brad Johnson say are supposed to happen due to global warming? Article includes most recent forecast from Klotzbach and Gray 
Bloomberg News: August is about to end without an Atlantic hurricane for the first time since 2002, calling into question predictions of a more active storm season than normal.
Six tropical systems have formed in the Atlantic since the season began June 1 and none of them has grown to hurricane strength with winds of at least 74 miles (120 kilometers) per hour. Accumulated cyclone energy in the Atlantic, a measure of tropical power, is about 30 percent of where it normally would be, said Phil Klotzbach, lead author of Colorado State University’s seasonal hurricane forecasts.
“At this point, I doubt that a super-active hurricane season will happen,” Klotzbach said in an e-mail yesterday.
The most active part of the Atlantic season runs from Aug. 20 to about the first week of October. The statistical peak occurs on Sept. 10, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

ABSTRACT
Information obtained through July 2013 indicates that the remainder of the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season will be more active than the average 1981-2010 season. We estimate that the remainder of 2013 will have about 8 hurricanes (average is 5.5), 14 named storms (average is 10.5), 75 named storm days (average is 58), 35 hurricane days (average is 21.3), 3 major (Category 3-4-5) hurricanes (average is 2.0) and 7 major hurricane days (average is 3.9). The probability of U.S. major hurricane landfall and Caribbean major hurricane activity for the remainder of the 2013 season is estimated to be above its long-period average. We expect the remainder of the Atlantic basin hurricane season to accrue Net Tropical Cyclone (NTC) activity approximately 140 percent of the seasonal average. We have decreased our seasonal forecast slightly from early April and early June, due to anomalous cooling of sea surface temperatures in the tropical and subtropical eastern Atlantic.
This forecast was based on a newly-developed extended-range early August statistical prediction scheme developed over the previous 33 years. An earlier statistical model that was utilized for several years has also been consulted. Analog predictors were also considered.
Cool neutral ENSO conditions are currently present in the tropical Pacific, and we believe that these conditions are likely to persist for the remainder of the Atlantic hurricane season. While sea level pressure anomalies across the tropical Atlantic have been relatively low during June and July, sea surface temperatures have anomalously cooled in the eastern tropical and subtropical Atlantic. These cooler SSTs are typically associated with less favorable thermodynamic conditions which we believe could cause slightly less TC activity than expected earlier.
Starting today and issued every two weeks following (e.g., August 16, August 30, etc), we will issue two-week forecasts for Atlantic TC activity during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season from August-October. A late-season forecast for the Caribbean basin will be issued on Tuesday, October 1.
Why issue forecasts for seasonal hurricane activity?
We are frequently asked this question. Our answer is that it is possible to say something about the probability of the coming year’s hurricane activity which is superior to climatology. The Atlantic basin has the largest year-to-year variability of any of the global tropical cyclone basins. People are curious to know how active the upcoming season is likely to be, particularly if you can show hindcast skill improvement over climatology for many past years.
Everyone should realize that it is impossible to precisely predict this season’s hurricane activity in early August. There is, however, much curiosity as to how global ocean and atmosphere features are presently arranged as regards to the probability of an active or inactive hurricane season for the coming year. Our new early August statistical forecast methodology shows strong evidence over 33 past years that improvement over climatology can be attained. We utilize this newly-developed model along with an older August statistical models when issuing this year’s forecast. We would never issue a seasonal hurricane forecast unless we had a statistical model constructed over a long hindcast period which showed significant skill over climatology.
We issue these forecasts to satisfy the curiosity of the general public and to bring attention to the hurricane problem. There is a general interest in knowing what the odds are for an active or inactive season. One must remember that our forecasts are based on the premise that those global oceanic and atmospheric conditions which preceded comparatively active or inactive hurricane seasons in the past provide meaningful information about similar trends in future seasons. This is not always true for individual seasons. It is also important that the reader appreciate that these seasonal forecasts are based on statistical schemes which, owing to their intrinsically probabilistic nature, will fail in some years. Moreover, these forecasts do not specifically predict where within the Atlantic basin these storms will strike. The probability of landfall for any one location along the coast is very low and reflects the fact that, in any one season, most U.S. coastal areas will not feel the effects of a hurricane no matter how active the individual season is.

DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS
AccumulatedCyclone Energy (ACE) – A measure of a named storm’s potential for wind and storm surge destruction defined as the sum of the square of a named storm’s maximum wind speed (in 104 knots2) for each 6-hour period of its existence. The 1950-2000 average value of this parameter is 96 for the Atlantic basin.
Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) – A mode of natural variability that occurs in the North Atlantic Ocean and evidencing itself in fluctuations in sea surface temperature and sea level pressure fields. The AMO is likely related to fluctuations in the strength of the oceanic thermohaline circulation. Although several definitions of the AMO are currently used in the literature, we define the AMO based on North Atlantic sea surface temperatures from 50-60°N, 10-50°W.
Atlantic Basin – The area including the entire North Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico.
ElNiño– A 12-18 month period during which anomalously warm sea surface temperatures occur in the eastern half of the equatorial Pacific. Moderate or strong El Niño events occur irregularly, about once every 3-7 years on average.
Hurricane (H) – A tropical cyclone with sustained low-level winds of 74 miles per hour (33 ms-1 or 64 knots) or greater.
Hurricane Day (HD) – A measure of hurricane activity, one unit of which occurs as four 6-hour periods during which a tropical cyclone is observed or is estimated to have hurricane-force winds.
Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) – A globally propagating mode of tropical atmospheric intra-seasonal variability. The wave tends to propagate eastward at approximately 5 ms-1, circling the globe in roughly 40-50 days.
MainDevelopment Region (MDR) – An area in the tropical Atlantic where a majority of major hurricanes form, which we define as 10-20°N, 20-70°W.
MajorHurricane(MH)– A hurricane which reaches a sustained low-level wind of at least 111 mph (96 knots or 50 ms-1) at some point in its lifetime. This constitutes a category 3 or higher on the Saffir/Simpson scale.
MajorHurricaneDay (MHD) – Four 6-hour periods during which a hurricane has an intensity of Saffir/Simpson category 3 or higher.
Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) – An index defining ENSO that takes into account tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, sea level pressures, zonal and meridional winds and cloudiness.
NamedStorm (NS) – A hurricane, a tropical storm or a sub-tropical storm.
NamedStorm Day (NSD) – As in HD but for four 6-hour periods during which a tropical or sub-tropical cyclone is observed (or is estimated) to have attained tropical storm-force winds.
Net Tropical Cyclone (NTC) Activity –Average seasonal percentage mean of NS, NSD, H, HD, MH, MHD. Gives overall indication of Atlantic basin seasonal hurricane activity. The 1950-2000 average value of this parameter is 100.
Saffir/SimpsonHurricane Wind Scale – A measurement scale ranging from 1 to 5 of hurricane wind intensity. One is a weak hurricane; whereas, five is the most intense hurricane.
Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) – A normalized measure of the surface pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin. Low values typically indicate El Niño conditions.
SeaSurfaceTemperature– SST
Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly – SSTA
ThermohalineCirculation (THC) – A large-scale circulation in the Atlantic Ocean that is driven by fluctuations in salinity and temperature. When the THC is stronger than normal, the AMO tends to be in its warm (or positive) phase, and more Atlantic hurricanes typically form.
TropicalCyclone (TC) – A large-scale circular flow occurring within the tropics and subtropics which has its strongest winds at low levels; including hurricanes, tropical storms and other weaker rotating vortices.
TropicalNorthAtlantic (TNA) index – A measure of sea surface temperatures in the area from 5.5-23.5°N, 15-57.5°W.
TropicalStorm (TS) – A tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds between 39 mph (18 ms-1 or 34 knots) and 73 mph (32 ms-1 or 63 knots).
Vertical Wind Shear – The difference in horizontal wind between 200 mb (approximately 40000 feet or 12 km) and 850 mb (approximately 5000 feet or 1.6 km).
1 knot = 1.15 miles per hour = 0.515 meters per second
1 Introduction
This is the 30th year in which the CSU Tropical Meteorology Project has made forecasts of the upcoming season’s Atlantic basin hurricane activity. Our research team has shown that a sizable portion of the year-to-year variability of Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) activity can be hindcast with skill exceeding climatology. This year’s August forecast is based on a new statistical methodology derived from 33 years of past data along with an earlier August forecast scheme. Qualitative adjustments are added to accommodate additional processes which may not be explicitly represented by our statistical analyses. These evolving forecast techniques are based on a variety of climate- related global and regional predictors previously shown to be related to the forthcoming seasonal Atlantic basin TC activity and landfall probability. We believe that seasonal forecasts must be based on methods that show significant hindcast skill in application to long periods of prior data. It is only through hindcast skill that one can demonstrate that seasonal forecast skill is possible. This is a valid methodology provided that the atmosphere continues to behave in the future as it has in the past.
The best predictors do not necessarily have the best individual correlations with hurricane activity. The best forecast parameters are those that explain the portion of the variance of seasonal hurricane activity that is not associated with the other forecast variables. It is possible for an important hurricane forecast parameter to show little direct relationship to a predictand by itself but to have an important influence when included with a set of 2-3 other predictors.
A direct correlation of a forecast parameter may not be the best measure of the importance of this predictor to the skill of a 3-4 parameter forecast model. This is the nature of the seasonal or climate forecast problem where one is dealing with a very complicated atmospheric-oceanic system that is highly non-linear. There is a maze of changing physical linkages between the many variables. These linkages can undergo unknown changes from weekly to decadal time scales. It is impossible to understand how all these processes interact with each other. No one can completely understand the full complexity of the atmosphere-ocean system. But, it is still possible to develop a reliable statistical forecast scheme which incorporates a number of the climate system’s non-linear interactions. Any seasonal or climate forecast scheme should show significant hindcast skill before it is used in real-time forecasts.
1.1 2013 Atlantic Basin Activity through July
The 2013 Atlantic basin hurricane season has had approximately average TC activity, based on the ACE index, during June and July.
Andrea developed on June 5 from an area of low pressure in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. It slowly intensified as it moved northeast and then accelerated northeastward ahead of an upper-level trough. Andrea reached a peak intensity of 55 knots just before making landfall along the Big Bend of Florida late on June 6. It rapidly weakened after
landfall, becoming a post-tropical cyclone on June 7. Andrea’s post-tropical remnants were responsible for three fatalities in North Carolina.
Barry formed from an area of low pressure in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June 17. It drifted across Belize as a tropical depression, nearly being downgraded to a remnant low in the process, before intensifying into a tropical storm when it emerged over the southern Bay of Campeche on June 19. A ridge over the southern Gulf of Mexico steered Barry westward, and it made landfall in the state of Veracruz, Mexico on June 20 with maximum sustained winds near 40 knots at landfall. It rapidly weakened over the course of the day, being downgraded to a tropical depression a few hours after landfall and then a remnant low later that day. Three fatalities in Mexico and Belize have been attributed to Barry.
Chantal developed from an easterly wave in the central tropical Atlantic late on July 7. It moved rapidly westward as it was steered by a strong ridge to its north.
Despite its accelerated speed, Chantal intensified slowly over the next day, due to relatively light vertical wind shear. It reached its maximum intensity of 55 knots on July
9. Strong westerly shear soon interacted with the system, and Chantal weakened rapidly. It degenerated into an open wave on July 10. Chantal’s remnants caused heavy flooding in Hispaniola and killed one individual in the Dominican Republic.
Dorian formed in the eastern tropical Atlantic from an easterly wave on July 24. The system intensified into a tropical storm later that day as it moved rapidly westward. It reached its maximum intensity of 50 knots the following day while traveling through an area of relatively light shear. By July 26, Dorian began to encounter relatively strong southwesterly shear and drier air and began weakening. A large upper-level trough to the west of Dorian continued to impart strong southwesterly shear over the system, and it degenerated into a tropical wave the following day.
Table 1 records observed Atlantic basin TC activity through 31 July, while tracks through 31 July are displayed in Figure 1. All TC activity calculations are based upon data available in the National Hurricane Center’s b-decks.

2 Newly-Developed 1 August Forecast Scheme
We developed a new 1 August statistical seasonal forecast scheme for the prediction of Net Tropical Cyclone (NTC) activity last year. This model uses a total of three predictors, all of which are selected from the ERA-Interim Reanalysis dataset, which is available from 1979-present. The major components of the forecast scheme are discussed in the next few paragraphs.
The pool of three predictors for this new early August statistical forecast scheme is given and defined in Table 2. The location of each of these predictors is shown in Figure 2. Skillful forecasts can be issued for post-31 July NTC based upon hindcast results over the period from 1979-2011 as well as a real-time forecast in 2012. When
these three predictors are combined, they correlate at 0.91 with observed NTC using a drop-one cross validation approach over the period from 1979-2012 (Figure 3).
Table 2: Listing of 1 August 2013 predictors for this year’s hurricane activity using the new statistical model. A plus (+) means that positive deviations of the parameter indicate increased hurricane activity this year, and a minus (-) means that positive deviations of the parameter indicate decreased hurricane activity this year. The combination of these three predictors calls for a slightly above-average hurricane season. None of these predictors deviate significantly from their 1981-2010 average values.

Table 4 displays our early August cross-validated hindcasts for 1979-2011 along with the real-time forecast in 2012 using the new statistical scheme. Our early August model has correctly predicted above- or below-average post-31 July NTC in 30 out of 34
years (88%). These hindcasts have had a smaller error than climatology in 24 out of 34 years (71%). Our average hindcast errors have been 19 NTC units, compared with 46 NTC units had we used only climatology.

2.2 Physical Associations among Predictors Listed in Table 2
The locations and brief descriptions of the three predictors for our new August statistical forecast are now discussed. It should be noted that all forecast parameters correlate
significantly with physical features during August through October that are known to be favorable for elevated levels of TC activity. For each of these predictors, we display a four-panel figure showing linear correlations between values of each predictor and August-October values of SST, sea level pressure (SLP), 850 mb (~1.5 km altitude) zonal wind (U), and 200 mb (~12 km altitude) zonal wind (U), respectively.
Predictor 1. July Surface U in the Caribbean (+)
(10-17.5°N, 60-85°W)
Low-level trade wind flow has been utilized as a predictor in seasonal forecasting systems for the Atlantic basin (Lea and Saunders 2004). When the trades are weaker- than-normal, SSTs across the tropical Atlantic tend to be elevated, and consequently a larger-than-normal Atlantic Warm Pool (AWP) is typically observed (Wang and Lee 2007) (Figure 4). A larger AWP also correlates with reduced vertical shear across the tropical Atlantic. Weaker trade winds are typically associated with higher pressure in the tropical eastern Pacific (a La Niña signal) and lower pressure in the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic. Both of these conditions generally occur when active hurricane seasons are observed. Predictor 1 also has a strong negative correlation with August-October- averaged 200-850-mb zonal shear.
Predictor 2. July Surface Temperature in the Northeastern Subtropical Atlantic (+)
(20°-40°N, 15-35°W)
A similar predictor was utilized in earlier August seasonal forecast models (Klotzbach 2007, Klotzbach 2011). Anomalously warm SSTs in the subtropical North Atlantic are associated with a positive phase of the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM), a northward- shifted Intertropical Convergence Zone, and consequently, reduced trade wind strength (Kossin and Vimont 2007). Weaker trade winds are associated with less surface evaporative cooling and less mixing and upwelling. This results in warmer tropical Atlantic SSTs during the August-October period (Figure 5).
Predictor 3. July 200 mb U over Northern Tropical Africa (-)
(5-15°N, 0-40°E)
Anomalous easterly flow at upper levels over northern tropical Africa provides an environment that is more favorable for easterly wave development into TCs. This anomalous easterly flow tends to persist through August-October, which reduces shear over the Main Development Region (MDR). This predictor also correlates with SLP and SST anomalies over the tropical eastern Pacific that are typically associated with cool ENSO conditions (Figure 6).

Figure 4: Linear correlations between July Surface U in the Caribbean (Predictor 1) and August-October sea surface temperature (panel a), August-October sea level pressure (panel b), August-October 850 mb zonal wind (panel c) and August-October 200 mb zonal wind (panel d).

Figure 5: Linear correlations between July Surface Temperature in the Subtropical Northeastern Atlantic (Predictor 2) and August-October sea surface temperature (panel a), August-October sea level pressure (panel b), August-October 850 mb zonal wind (panel c) and August-October 200 mb zonal wind (panel d).

Figure 6: Linear correlations between July 200 MB Zonal Wind over tropical north Africa (Predictor 3) and August-October sea surface temperature (panel a), August- October sea level pressure (panel b), August-October 925 mb zonal wind (panel c) and August-October 200 mb zonal wind (panel d). The color scale has been reversed so that the correlations match up with those in Figures 4 and 5.
Table 5 summarizes the statistical model output from the new forecast as well as an earlier statistical model discussed in detail in Klotzbach (2007). The newly-developed model calls for a relatively active season, while the Klotzbach (2007) model calls for a very active remainder of the season.

3 Forecast Uncertainty
One of the questions that we are asked regarding our seasonal hurricane predictions is the degree of uncertainty that is involved. Obviously, our predictions are our best estimate, but there is with all forecasts an uncertainty as to how well they will verify.
Table 6 provides our post-31 July forecast, with error bars (based on one standard deviation of absolute errors) as calculated from hindcasts/forecasts of the Klotzbach (2007) scheme over the 1990-2009 period, using equations developed over the 1950-1989 period. We typically expect to see 2/3 of our forecasts verify within one standard deviation of observed values, with 95% of forecasts verifying within two standard deviations of observed values.

4 Analog-Based Predictors for 2013 Hurricane Activity
Certain years in the historical record have global oceanic and atmospheric trends which are substantially similar to 2013. These years also provide useful clues as to likely trends in activity that the 2013 hurricane season may bring. For this early August
forecast we determine which of the prior years in our database have distinct trends in key environmental conditions which are similar to current June-July 2013 conditions. Table 7 lists the best analog selections from our historical database.
We select prior hurricane seasons since 1950 which have similar atmospheric- oceanic conditions to those currently being experienced. We searched for years that had cool neutral ENSO conditions and slightly above-average tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures.
There were five hurricane seasons with characteristics most similar to what we observed in June-July 2013. The best analog years that we could find for the 2013 hurricane season were 1952, 1966, 1996, 2007, and 2008. We anticipate that 2013 seasonal hurricane activity will have activity that is slightly above the average of these five analog years. We believe that the remainder of 2013 will have above-average activity in the Atlantic basin.

5 ENSO
Cool neutral ENSO conditions currently persist across the tropical Pacific. SST anomalies are generally below-average across the central and eastern tropical Pacific.
Table 8 displays July and May SST anomalies for several Nino regions. No significant changes in SST have been observed in any of the four Nino regions over the past two months.
Table 8: May and July 2013 SST anomalies for Nino 1+2, Nino 3, Nino 3.4, and Nino 4, respectively. July-May SST anomaly differences are also provided.

It appears that cool neutral ENSO conditions are the most likely scenario for the peak of this year’s hurricane season. While there had been some upper-level ocean warming in the past few weeks, trade winds near the International Date Line have recently reasserted themselves. Consequently, the anomalous warming of upper ocean heat content that has developed in recent weeks has recently begun to level off.

Figure 7: Upper-ocean (0-300 meters depth) heat content anomalies in the eastern and central Pacific since August 2012. There has been an increase in upper ocean heat content anomalies since the middle of May, but this increase has leveled off during the second half of July.
Both dynamical and statistical models are in good agreement that neutral conditions are likely for the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season from August-October. Figure 8 displays the current forecasts issued by various ENSO models. In general, the statistical models are calling for slightly cooler conditions than those predicted by the dynamical models. No statistical or dynamical models call for El Niño development during the August-October period.

Figure 8: ENSO forecasts from various statistical and dynamical models. Figure courtesy of the International Research Institute (IRI).
As was found with the early June prediction, the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) typically shows the best prediction skill of the various ENSO models. The correlation skill between a 1 July forecast from the ECMWF model and the observed September Nino 3.4 anomaly is 0.89, based on hindcasts/forecasts from 1982-2010, explaining approximately 79% of the variance in Nino 3.4 SST. For reference, the correlation skill of a 1 May forecast from the ECMWF model was 0.82, indicating that approximately 15% additional variance can be explained by shortening the lead time of the forecast from 1 May to 1 July. The ECMWF model has recently been upgraded to system 4, indicating that improved ENSO skill may be possible. The average of the various ECMWF ensemble members is calling for a September Nino 3.4 SST anomaly of approximately 0.1°C (Figure 9).

Figure 9: ECMWF ensemble model forecast for the Nino 3.4 region. Most members call for neutral conditions throughout the August-October period. The green dots represent the approximate average of the ensemble members.
Based on this information, our best estimate is that we will likely have cool neutral ENSO conditions during the August-October period. Consequently, we do not anticipate increased vertical wind shear associated with El Niño to be present this year.
6 Current Atlantic Basin Conditions
Conditions in the tropical Atlantic have become somewhat less favorable over the past couple of months. The primary negative factor has been the development and advection of cool SST anomalies from the subtropical northeast Atlantic into the tropical Atlantic. Figure 10 displays the SST change from late May 2013 to late July 2013, with the significant cooling of SSTs in the eastern tropical Atlantic being the most definitive feature.

Figure 10: Late July 2013-late May 2013 SST anomaly. Note the anomalous cooling that has taken place across the tropical and subtropical eastern Atlantic. This cooling predominately took place during the month of June.
Despite this cooling, SSTs across the MDR are still somewhat above their climatological averages (Figure 11). In addition, two early season TCs formed in the MDR (Chantal and Dorian). From a climatological perspective, thermodynamics are typically what restricts early season TC development in the MDR, and consequently, the development of Chantal and Dorian indicates that MDR thermodynamics are not particularly unfavorable. Table 9 displays the 10 seasons since 1851 that have had two storms form in the MDR prior to 1 August. All of these years had at least average activity, with many of these seasons being very active.

Figure 11: Current SST anomalies as estimated by NOAA/NESDIS. In general, warm anomalies still predominate in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic despite the recent cooling shown in Figure 10.

Sea level pressure anomalies over the past month have been quite low, implying that the trade winds across the Main Development Region are weak and the Tropical
Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) is reduced in strength (Figure 12). A weakened TUTT typically relates to reduced vertical wind shear across the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean (Knaff 1997). We do not foresee a strong TUTT formation this season.

Figure 12: July 2013 Atlantic SLP anomaly. Negative anomalies have predominated across the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean throughout the month.
As was the case last year, the tropical Atlantic atmosphere appears to be somewhat more stable than normal. The Cooperative Research Institute for the Atmosphere (CIRA) monitors real-time conditions for genesis in the tropical Atlantic, and according to their analysis, vertical instability is somewhat limited this year (Figure 13). Positive deviations from the curve displayed below indicate a more unstable atmosphere than normal. In general, the atmosphere has been more stable than normal since the start of the hurricane season.

Figure 13: Vertical instability across the tropical Atlantic since the start of the hurricane season. In general, this year’s instability has been lower than normal, indicating a relatively stable atmosphere this year.
It is primarily these mixed signals in the tropical Atlantic which are causing us to reduce our forecast slightly.
7 West Africa Conditions
Enhanced rainfall in the Sahel region of West Africa during the June-July time period has been associated with active hurricane seasons (Landsea and Gray 1992).
Figure 14 displays a combined satellite/rain gauge estimate, referred to as the African Rainfall Estimation Algorithm Version 2 (RFE 2.0) of percent of normal rainfall over the June-July 2013 time period. In general, it appears that rainfall in the Western Sahel has been at near-average levels during June-July.

Figure 14: Rainfall Estimation Algorithm Version 2.0 (RFE) estimate of percent of normal rainfall for June-July 2013.
8 Adjusted 2013 Forecast
Table 10 shows our final adjusted early August forecast for the 2013 season which is a combination of our two statistical schemes (with June-July activity added in), our analog forecast and qualitative adjustments for other factors not explicitly contained in any of these schemes. The average of our two statistical forecasts (with June-July activity added in) and our analog forecast call for an above-average season. We thus foresee an above-average amount of TC activity for the remainder of the Atlantic hurricane season.

9 Landfall Probabilities for 2013
A significant focus of our recent research involves efforts to develop forecasts of the probability of hurricane landfall along the U.S. coastline and in the Caribbean.
Whereas individual hurricane landfall events cannot be forecast months in advance, the total seasonal probability of landfall can be forecast with statistical skill. With the observation that landfall is a function of varying climate conditions, a probability specification has been developed through statistical analyses of all U.S. hurricane and named storm landfall events during the 20th century (1900-1999). Specific landfall probabilities can be given for all tropical cyclone intensity classes for a set of distinct
U.S. coastal regions.
Net landfall probability is shown linked to the overall Atlantic basin Net Tropical Cyclone activity (NTC; see Table 11). NTC is a combined measure of the year-to-year mean of six indices of hurricane activity, each expressed as a percentage difference from the long-term average. Long-term statistics show that, on average, the more active the overall Atlantic basin hurricane season is, the greater the probability of U.S. hurricane landfall.
Table 11: NTC activity in any year consists of the seasonal total of the following six parameters expressed in terms of their long-term averages. A season with 10 NS, 50 NSD, 6 H, 25 HD, 3 MH, and 5 MHD would then be the sum of the following ratios: 10/9.6 = 104, 50/49.1 = 102, 6/5.9 = 102, 25/24.5 = 102, 3/2.3 = 130, 5/5.0 = 100,
divided by six, yielding an NTC of 107.

Table 12 lists strike probabilities for the 2013 hurricane season for different TC categories for the entire U.S. coastline, the Gulf Coast and the East Coast including the Florida peninsula. We also issue probabilities for various islands and landmasses in the Caribbean and in Central America. Note that Atlantic basin post-1 August NTC activity in 2013 is expected to be above its long-term average, and therefore, landfall probabilities are above their long-term average.

Probabilities of a tropical storm, hurricane and major hurricane tracking into the Caribbean are also provided. The long-term mean annual probability of one or more landfalling systems during the last 100 years is given in parentheses.

Please also visit the Landfalling Probability Webpage at http://www.e- transit.org/hurricanefor landfall probabilities for 11 U.S. coastal regions and 205 coastal and near-coastal counties from Brownsville, Texas to Eastport, Maine as well as probabilities for every island in the Caribbean. We suggest that all coastal residents visit the Landfall Probability Webpage for their individual location probabilities.
As an example we find that the probability of Florida being hit by a major (Cat 3- 4-5) hurricane during the remainder of this year is 28% which is higher than the long- term seasonal climatological average of 21%.
South Florida is much more prone to being impacted by a hurricane on an individual-year basis compared with northeast Florida. For instance, the probability of Miami-Dade County being impacted by hurricane-force wind gusts for the remainder of this year is 16%. For Duval County (Jacksonville metropolitan area) in northeast Florida, the probability of being impacted by hurricane-force wind gusts is only 4%. However, considering a 50-year period, the probability of Duval County experiencing hurricane- force wind gusts is 75%.
For the island of Puerto Rico, the probability of a named storm, hurricane and major hurricane tracking within 50 miles of the island this year is 43%, 21%, and 7%, respectively.
10 Summary
An analysis of a variety of different atmosphere and ocean measurements (through July) which are known to have long-period statistical relationships with the upcoming season’s Atlantic tropical cyclone activity indicate that 2013 should be a relatively active season. Cool neutral ENSO conditions should generally provide favorable upper-level winds across the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic. Two early season MDR storms are also indicative that the season should be quite active. The only significant negative factor at this point is the anomalous cooling that has occurred in the eastern tropical and subtropical Atlantic over the past two months. However, this cooling has abated in recent weeks.
11 Can Rising Levels of CO2 be Associated with the Devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy (2012) along with the Increase in Atlantic Hurricane Activity since 1995?
We have extensively discussed this topic in many previous papers which can be found on our Tropical Meteorology website. We believe the hypothesized influence of atmospheric CO2 increases on increased hurricane activity has been exaggerated.

Story submitted by Cornelis de Jager
(past president ICSU;past pres. COSPAR)
In a recent publication entitled Terrestrial ground temperature variation in relation to solar magnetic variability, including the present Schwabe cycle, Cornelis (Kees) de Jager and Hans Nieuwenhuijzen, from the Space Research Organisation of the Netherlands have analysed the dependence of the global earth temperature on the polar as well as the equatorial magnetic fields. The new aspect in this research is that all earlier investigations in this field only sought for the dependence of the terrestrial ground temperature on the number of sunspots, which is a “proxy” for  the equatorial magnetic fields of the sun.  But the sun has two big magnetic areas, the equatorial and the polar one. In this research both are included.
In their analysis the Utrecht scientists restricted to the relatively long-term variation of both fields as well as the temperature, such in order to exclude short-term phenomena such as temperature variations due  to volcanoes or processes like El-Nino.

By including the two magnetic field areas in their  analysis it could be shown that during the major part of the four centuries investigated, i.e. the period 1610 till  around  1900 – 1950 , the  average terrestrial ground temperatures depend solely on solar magnetic field variations. After 1900 there is an increasing excess in the temperature which is ascribed to anthropogenic  activity.  After the impressive Grand Maximum of the 20thb century the sun went through an exceptional,  not before observed phase transition that lasted relatively long, i.e. from about 2005 till 2010.
Usually,  the transitions between solar variability phases takes no more than one to two years. During that transition period and after that, solar activity was exceptionally low. The consequent small contribution to the terrestrial temperatures is the cause for the standstill in the rise of temperature observed since the middle of the 20th century.

The above can be illustrated in figure 1, the diagram  shows three curves. The middle one is the average terrestrial ground temperature  (dots) through which a smoothed average curve is drawn .(The LOWESS technique is used for smoothing). The upper line shows the solar contribution and the bottom curve is the difference between the two. It shows a nearly flat variation which demonstrates that the long-term component of terrestrial temperatures is solely due to the variation of the sun’s magnetic fields.  The average “zero-line” show a very slow , yet unexplained, increase over the centuries.
The paper is published in Natural Science vol. 5, pp. 1112- 1120, 2013 (open access). It can also be consulted at http://www.cdejager.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-CdeJ-HN-Sun-climate-NS-5-1112.pdf

One of the main reasons for the drop in oil prices that began in 2014 was a rapid increase in U.S. oil production—it reached the level of the other two biggest producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia, that same year. That, in turn, decreased U.S. demand for imported petroleum and hence put downward pressure on the oil price worldwide. There is one aspect of the shale revolution that gets much less attention than geopolitical or environmental issues: What were the institutional conditions that allowed the technological innovation to happen? In essence, it was a combination of secure property rights, a favorable tax regime, minimal red tape, and a strong entrepreneurial culture (there were around 13,000 small U.S. oil companies fiercely competing with each other).



This paper explains how the quality of institutions determines whether natural resource abundance is a blessing or a curse: Will it boost or stifle innovation and economic development? Institutional deficiency in resource economies perpetuates rent‐​seeking, autocracy, and slower economic growth as illustrated by multiple examples. One of the most alarming among them is Venezuela. While the country possesses the largest oil reserves in the world it is at a brink of economic collapse and is struggling with mass food shortages.



Nonetheless, the evidence presented in this paper is at odds with the “resource curse” hypothesis that mineral‐​exporting countries are doomed to stagnation. A number of countries with high levels of economic freedom, such as Australia, Canada, Chile, and Norway, demonstrate that it is possible to build a prosperous and innovative economy with a significant share of income from the sale of minerals. Furthermore, sound institutions can help diversify the economy and weather the storm of low commodity prices. As exemplified by several countries in the 1980s and in later years, petroleum exporters with strong institutions can achieve positive growth even during oil price drops.





  
Although more than half a century has passed since the creation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its redistributive model of ""resource nationalism,"" many OPEC countries have not lived up to expectations and have not experienced an acceleration of growth.1 In general, the results were negative: private investment was crowded out, rent-seeking and corruption increased, and overall productivity fell.



Employing a barrage of populist anti-colonial rhetoric, authorities in the developing countries that account for most of the global production of hydrocarbons seized control of resources through expropriation, nationalization, and abrupt changes in the terms of contracts with international companies. Effective government control in the mineral industry, which was higher than in other sectors, created numerous opportunities to extract rents. The peak of ""resource nationalism"" came in the 1960 — and in its wake OPEC was created. Institutional development in those countries then began to decline. And the lower the quality of institutions, the more profitable it became to engage in rent-seeking, and the less profitable it became to engage in productive entrepreneurship.



In the first decade of the 21st century, high oil prices served to prop up inefficiencies in public administration in a number of oil economies. Over time, even high prices became insufficient for boosting economic development because of corruption and institutional deterioration. As a result, economic and social stagnation occurred in many petrostates even during the long period of inflated oil prices (2002–14). Such stagnation is one of the reasons for growing discontent in several petroleum-based economies.



July 2014 marked the beginning of the most significant decline in oil prices since the 1980s (see Figure 1.) Several factors that increased supply and slowed demand have changed the global oil market. One of the main reasons for the drop in oil prices was a rapid increase in U.S. oil production, which in 2014 reached the level of the other two biggest producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Greater reliance on domestic production has decreased U.S. demand for imported oil and hence has put downward pressure on the oil price worldwide.



 **Figure 1. Real and Nominal Oil Price (monthly) since January 1972**  




In addition, the rapid increase in shale gas production, accompanied by a drop in domestic gas prices in the United States, has increased the share of gas in the overall U.S. energy mix, lessening U.S. dependence on oil in particular.2 All in all, the U.S. ""shale revolution"" is having a major impact on global energy markets. Moreover, the drop in oil prices is a result not only of the rapid increase in production but also of the slowdown in consumption. The world as a whole and Western countries in particular have made a big leap toward efficient energy consumption. For instance, one major development has been the decrease in the volume of liquid fuel consumption in engines. Various types of technological innovations have occurred simultaneously that have contributed to the drop in oil prices.



Since oil prices began to fall in 2014, economic and institutional deterioration in many petrostates has accelerated. Other mineral commodities, such as metals and coal, have also experienced depressed prices since 2011. That factor has put many mineral-exporting countries under significant pressure to adjust their policies and institutions. In recent years, Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Brazil, and Malaysia all saw civil protests. All in all, low commodity prices push governments to improve public administration and seek alternatives to old models of governance and the redistribution of rents.



This paper argues that resource economies (economies reliant on exports of natural resources)3 with better economic and political institutions manage their revenues better than countries with poor institutions and can achieve superior results in economic growth and social development. The evidence presented here is at odds with the ""resource curse"" hypothesis that stipulates that mineral-exporting countries are doomed to stagnation. The quality of institutions is what essentially determines whether natural resource abundance is a blessing or a curse. Furthermore, strong institutions can help achieve long-term growth during periods of low commodity prices. To support that argument, the performance of resource economies in different parts of the world is compared in relation to their institutional rankings, the property structure of their extractive industries, and other key parameters.



The first section provides an overview of major studies of resource economies. It compares various approaches to such issues as the ""Dutch disease"" and the effects of commodity price volatility. Experience shows that mineral-exporting countries are by no means cursed by their resource wealth. An alternative to the resource curse hypothesis emphasizes the positive influence of the rule of law and strong property rights and the negative role of rent-seeking, which appears to be one of the main hindrances to economic development in resource economies.



The second section looks at policy choices facing resource-based economies. It examines such policy areas as the institutional climate, the government's share in oil companies, stabilization funds, and government investments. The economic and social performance of resource economies depends primarily on the strength of their institutional framework, of which economic freedom is a key component.



The third section looks at the institutional conditions for major innovations in extractive industries, such as the shale revolution and breakthroughs in the development of other unconventional resources. It then briefly summarizes the experience of four countrie — Australia, Canada, Chile, and Norway — and looks at particular policies that allowed them to achieve more rapid growth and higher levels of social development compared with peer countries with resource-based economies. Finally, this section looks at the experiences of oil-exporting countries that managed to maintain high growth rates during the crude price drop in the 1980s.





  
This section provides an overview of major studies of resource economies and compares various approaches to problems associated with dependency on mineral rents. It analyzes the phenomenon of rent-seeking, which appears to be one of the main obstacles to economic development in resource-exporting states.





  
Although some economists have raised doubts about the role of natural resources in economic development, up until the late 20th century, no significant efforts had been made to study the possible negative impact of resource dependency. One of the possible reasons for that was the commonsense view that a country's natural resources should positively affect its economic growth. Several authors have argued that natural resource — notably coal as a source of energy — were among the primary drivers of the Industrial Revolution.4



That approach started to change in the 1990s with the publication of several notable studies. American scholar Terry Lynn Karl spent two decades studying the experience of troubled petrostates. The results of that research are contained in her 1997 book The Paradox of Plenty: Oil Booms and Petro-States.5 She identified some of the resource economies with the most evident institutional failures. One of the most notable cases is that of Venezuela. Venezuela's economy is remarkable in several ways. With regard to its real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, Venezuela went from being one of the most well-off countries in Latin America and worldwide in the 1950s to a period of stagnation and even decline. Over two decades, its real income per capita declined by 25 percent. In 1988, 2.4 percent of Venezuelans were living below the poverty line. But by 1998, when Hugo Chávez was elected president, that figure had risen to 18.5 percent.6



Few people realize that Venezuela's current oil reserves are the largest in the world. They are about a dozen times larger than what Venezuela had at its disposal in the 1980s. An oil-abundant and oil-dependent autocratic government need not concern itself with income per capita, poverty, inequality, and other indicators of the well-being of its general population, but one would imagine that it would at least maintain oil production in order to fill government coffers. Yet Venezuela's example refutes even that intuitive assumption. It is hard to believe, but Venezuela's overall oil production is actually lower today than it was half a century ago.7



Venezuela is not the only country that has failed to realize its hydrocarbon potential. Iran is another peculiar case. It possesses the largest combined oil and gas reserves in the world and is second only to Russia in natural gas reserves. It could clearly have been a frontrunner in natural gas exports with a booming economy. But although sitting on enormous reserves, in 2014 it was actually a net gas importer.8 Something must be wrong with a country's institutions and policies if even its own oil and gas industry, a government cash cow, can go into stagnation. Apart from Venezuela and Iran, Libya represents one of the most unfortunate examples of institutional failure among oil-exporting countries. As shown in Figure 2, Libya's GDP per capita went through a rapid adjustment from six times the world average in 1977 to below the global median income in a quarter of a century.



 **Figure 2. Real GDP per Capita (PPP) as Percentage of World Average in Three Oil & Gas Economies since 1963**  




One of the first significant systematic studies of economic problems associated with natural resources was published in 1995 by Jeffery Sachs and Andrew Warner.9 That study laid the foundation for what later became known as the resource curse hypothesis. The study's main finding was that economies with a high ratio of natural resource exports to GDP grew more slowly than the world average during the 20 years from 1970 to 1990. Even after accounting for a number of variables that correlate positively with economic growth, a negative relationship between economic growth and resource dependence was still evident. They also found that lowering the share of natural resources in overall exports by 10 percent causes an increase in growth of 1 percentage point.



A number of economists conducted similar analyses to test their findings. For example, Xavier Sala-i-Martin published a 1997 paper, provocatively titled ""I Just Ran Two Million Regressions,""10 in which he confirmed the findings of Sachs and Warner. Sala-i-Martin identified 22 variables that had a statistically significant influence on economic growth — natural resources were one of those identified as having a negative effect.



In the 1990s many economists agreed on the existence of a ""resource curse."" The phrase itself was coined by Richard Auty, an economist who specializes in the influence of natural resources on economic development. But simply stating that mineral resources have a negative effect on growth was insufficient. An explanation was needed. Hence, several approaches emerged that emphasized various channels through which resource dependency hinders growth. The earliest explanations focused on economic channels. Sachs and Warner concluded that it was the effect of the ""Dutch disease""11 that economists had studied since the 1970s.12 The expression stems from the Dutch economic crisis of the 1960s following the discovery of North Sea natural gas. It refers to the effect of an inflow of foreign currency from commodity exports. The resulting local currency appreciation makes the country's nonmineral products less competitive on the global market. Cheaper imports can also suppress domestic manufacturing. In the 2000s, a group of authors still following the economic channel approach also investigated the influence of commodity price volatility on growth and development.13



In recent years, as more rigorous econometric analysis has been conducted using new, more extensive data sets, doubts about the resource curse hypothesis have begun to emerge. Several economists arrived at different conclusions concerning the effects of natural resources. First, there were doubts about the particular time period that Sachs and Warner chose to analyze. In 2001 Osmel Manzano and Roberto Rigobon14 argued that in the historical period used by Sachs and Warner (1970–90), a significant commodity price drop that started in the 1980s lasted for 20 years (this period is sometimes referred to as the ""1980s oil glut""). That price decrease might have had a negative effect on economic growth. Furthermore, they argued that the high commodity prices of the 1970s allowed governments of resource-exporting countries to go on a borrowing spree, which created a debt overhang that in turn further slowed growth. After correcting for those factors, the resource curse was no longer identifiable.



In 2007, two economists at the World Bank, Daniel Lederman and William Maloney, raised doubts over the very attempt to generalize about the effect of natural resources on growth and development.15 They suggested that some of the indicators used in previous analyses might be unrelated to relative natural resource endowments.16 They concluded that economists have been trying to generalize about the effect of resource abundance while failing to discover precisely which characteristic is affecting growth negatively. A number of other economists looked at more extensive data sets covering longer time periods and discovered that natural resources had either no influence or a very weak influence on growth.17



Doubts about the direct economic impact of resource abundance encouraged a number of authors to look for a hidden channel through which natural resources might affect development. Although the macroeconomic explanation emphasized such issues as the Dutch disease and price volatility, a dissenting group of institutional economists developed an alternative approach, one that considered institutional deficiencies as the main factor inhibiting growth in resource economies.



It is important to stress the difference between two schools of thought within the institutional approach. One stems from the resource curse hypothesis and sees natural resource abundance as a cause of institutional degradation and corruption within the ruling elite, which consequently affects growth and development. Essentially, the resource curse becomes an ""institutional curse.""



The other school of thought, ""institutionalism,"" also emphasizes institutions, but the causality works in the opposite direction: countries abundant in natural resources are not condemned to develop deficient institutions, but rather weak institutions are themselves the reason for the slowdown in growth and development. Figure 3 displays the various approaches to examining resource economics. The two schools of thought — the resource curse hypothesis, which emphasizes the institutional channel for the ""curse,"" and institutionalism, which considers weak institutions to be the primary issue — have a lot in common. Both stress the vital role of institutions. Yet the practical policy implications of the two approaches are distinctly different. It is easy to see why. For the resource curse hypothesis, natural resources are the problem, and hence the solution is essentially to decrease economic reliance on resource sales. For the institutionalist approach, resources per se are not the issue or at least, one could argue, not the main issue. A number of countries illustrate how a large proportion of natural resource exports can exist alongside a developed institutional framework (I will look closer at such examples later). Institutions are thus viewed as the key factor determining the development trajectory of resource economies, and therefore policy recommendations are aimed mostly at improving the institutional framework.



 **Figure 3. Resource Abundance and Economic Growth: Major Schools of Though**  




The two schools of thought — the resource curse hypothesis, which emphasizes the institutional channel for the ""curse,"" and institutionalism, which considers weak institutions to be the primary issue — have a lot in common. Both stress the vital role of institutions. Yet the practical policy implications of the two approaches are distinctly different. It is easy to see why. For the resource curse hypothesis, natural resources are the problem, and hence the solution is essentially to decrease economic reliance on resource sales. For the institutionalist approach, resources per se are not the issue or at least, one could argue, not the main issue. A number of countries illustrate how a large proportion of natural resource exports can exist alongside a developed institutional framework (I will look closer at such examples later). Institutions are thus viewed as the key factor determining the development trajectory of resource economies, and therefore policy recommendations are aimed mostly at improving the institutional framework.



The institutionalist approach has practical and analytical advantages. It looks at the root of the problem and provides a better foundation for long-lasting policies. As with any issue, however, it is not black and white. Limiting oneself to a single school of thought is not a very practical position. Although institutions are essential, that is not to say that natural resources per se do not matter. A balanced institutionalist position would acknowledge that although countries reliant on resource exports are not doomed to fail or stagnate, they may face certain difficulties in implementing pro-growth policies. Certain institutions in resource economies may play a greater role than in resource-poor economies; consequently, weak implementation of those institutions may have a stronger negative effect. This subject will be discussed in more detail later. It would therefore be more accurate to speak of a ""resource challenge"" rather than a ""resource curse.""



It is clear, however, that the institutional approach has been gaining ground in the field. The reason the institutional approach is starting to replace the resource curse hypothesis was well captured by Andrew Rosser.18



Scholars have been asking the wrong question: rather than asking why natural resource wealth has fostered various political pathologies and in turn promoted poor development performance, they should have been asking what political and social factors enable some resource abundant countries to utilize their natural resources to promote development and prevent other resource abundant countries from doing the same.



The outcomes of analyses of resource-abundant countries' performances vary significantly depending on the data used and the time periods examined. As a result, the conclusions of different authors range between a negative effect19 of resource abundance on growth and no significant effect20 or even a positive effect.21



Those findings raise another important question: What actually is resource abundance and which countries qualify as resource economies? That question has many possible answers. The two most common measurements of resource abundance are the ratio of natural resource exports to overall exports and the ratio of natural resource exports to GDP. This paper uses both criteria in the following way: a country is resource dependent if over 25 percent of its exports consist of natural resources and the ratio of natural resource exports to GDP exceeds 10 percent. A number of authors use the former criterion, which is consistent with the definition of resource-dependent countries used by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The latter criterion is added to ensure that countries with very low volumes of overall exports do not fall into the abundance category. The Appendix provides a full list of countries that qualify as resource economies, on the basis of data from both the IMF and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).





  
At the end of the 1950s, several significant offshore natural gas discoveries were made in the Netherlands. Gas exports had a strong economic effect, causing an appreciation of the Dutch guilder and a contraction in the nonextractive industries. That effect gave rise to the term ""Dutch disease,"" which was coined in 1977 by _The Economist_.22 The Dutch disease was the first instance where this economic phenomenon was thoroughly studied.23 To be more precise, the Dutch disease is not just a single consequence of increased mineral exports but a series of several effects.



The impact of the oil or gas boom on the broader economy can be divided into three main effects: the ""resource movement effect,"" the ""spending effect,""24 and the ""exchange rate effect."" Let's assume that a small open economy has three major sectors: a manufacturing sector, a nontradable (service) sector, and a resource sector, which emerges quickly as a result of, say, a major oil discovery, causing a boom in oil exports. The ""resource movement effect"" produces a shift of labor and capital to the resource sector from the rest of the economy as profits and wages in the resource sector begin to rise. The ""spending effect"" occurs when — as a result of windfall earnings in the resource sector — demand for both tradable and nontradable goods rises. However, the effects on the two sectors differ. In the nontradable sector, increased demand for services is met by an increase of supply and a consequent rise in both prices of nontradables and wages in the nontradable sector. But increased demand for tradable goods is met by increased imports, not by an increase in demand for domestic manufacturing goods.



Here the ""exchange rate effect"" comes in. It occurs as a result of an increased inflow of foreign currency (U.S. dollars in the case of oil exports), which causes the domestic currency to appreciate. The appreciation of the real exchange rate of domestic currency has a double effect on the manufacturing sector: (a) it suppresses demand for domestically manufactured goods, as imported goods become more affordable; and (b) it decreases exports of manufactured goods, as they also become less competitive in the international market as the relative value of domestic currency increases.



The Dutch disease is a well-studied and well-documented phenomenon. The fact that it exists and that there are certain mechanisms through which it affects a resource-exporting country's economy is accepted by almost all economists who study the issue. What is much less clear is whether it has any considerable negative effect on overall economic growth as such or on social development. If it has a negative effect in either area, then it is important to determine how that effect, or effects, can be mitigated through public policies.



It is worth clarifying any confusion between two distinctively different questions. One is, does the Dutch disease change labor and capital allocation in a resource economy and thus its very structure? Based on the evidence, the answer to that question is yes. However, a different question is, are those structural changes negative and, more specifically, do they have a negative effect on growth? Although it may appear to many people that the Dutch disease slows down economic growth and is therefore an unambiguously negative phenomenon, some commonsense analysis casts doubts over that conventional view.



In essence, the Dutch disease is an adjustment to a new economic situation that emerges as a result of increased commodity exports. Such economic adjustments happen in all open economies, not just in resource-exporting ones, as a reaction to higher returns on both labor and capital in specific industries. A contraction in the manufacturing tradable sector is simply evidence of relatively higher returns in other industries (extractive and nontradable). Such shifts in economic equilibriums occur constantly because of technological progress and global competition. A major business or technological innovation may shift the balance of labor and capital allocation if an economy gets a boost from developing a new export product.



An example is a high-tech product that matches a certain trend in global technological development and thus rapidly increases international demand for it (Finnish corporation Nokia's mobile phones in the 1990s and 2000s come to mind). Few would see that as a negative development. Yet when a boom happens in the natural resources sector, it is received with a mixture of anxiety and suspicion. It is true that some empirical evidence points to cases of economic and institutional failure in resource-dependent countries. And the Dutch disease may exacerbate the state of such an economy through the channels described above. But that is different from saying that the Dutch disease is to blame for such misfortunes in the first place.



An increase in income through the sale of natural resources, other things equal, accounts for a proportionate increase in GDP. Although it may be accompanied by a contraction in nonresource manufacturing, that does not mean that GDP growth will unavoidably suffer from this reallocation of sources of income. It is, in fact, much more likely to increase. Furthermore, undermining the argument about the Dutch disease as a source of stagnation in many resource economies, Dutch disease effects are very limited because there is either a very small or practically nonexistent manufacturing sector to start with, such that, by definition, no reallocation can occur. Nonetheless, countries with only resource and nontradable sectors have experienced slowdowns and even negative growth (for example, several Middle Eastern countries in the 1980s). To understand the nature of stagnation in some resource economies, one must seek a different explanation, which is explored later.



A number of economists subsequently reached the conclusion that the effects of the Dutch disease were not the primary drivers of resource economies' growth trajectories. For instance, Raymond Mikesell25 analyzed the performance of a group of resource-exporting economies and concluded that for the majority of them the Dutch disease had no effect on their growth patterns. Gary McMahon comes to similar findings in his study.26 Ragnar Torvik argues that output and productivity can either increase or decrease in both tradable and nontradable sectors, depending on the structural and institutional characteristics of the economy.27 The latter view appears more accurate. An open-market economy with low entry barriers and minimal obstacles to businesses will adjust to both the ""resource movement effect"" and the ""spending effect"" of increased commodity exports, just as it adjusts to any other changes in its export structure.



Thus, the Dutch disease can be looked at in different ways. In a narrow sense, it is about the reallocation of resources among various sectors. To view it is a ""disease"" — a problem in and of itself — means to apply a certain value judgment and a preference toward a certain way of generating income, that is, the nonresource tradable sector, usually concentrated in manufacturing. It then essentially becomes much more of a political than an economic issue. And that is indeed what has happened in many resource economies. In an attempt to ""save"" the contracting nonresource manufacturing sector, governments created subsidized dependent industries, which dragged their respective economies into an economic slowdown. Thus, what is initially marketed as a remedy for the Dutch disease often becomes a source of economic problems itself.



The question, then, is whether any corrective action is required for the Dutch disease and specifically for the exchange rate effect. That question has no straightforward answer. It depends on the degree of resource dependence, the size of the economy, and its share in the production of a particular commodity on the world market. Furthermore, the exchange rate effect is not entirely negative either. It may make some exported goods less competitive, but it does have the effect of making all imported goods more affordable. The net effect depends on a variety of factors that are specific to each individual economy.



To prevent abrupt hikes of the nominal and real exchange rate of the domestic currency, it would be advisable for a government to have a mechanism in place to sterilize excess inflows of foreign currency, such as a stabilization fund or another similar venture. That practice has been widely adopted throughout the world and has generally allowed governments to keep a lid on the exchange rate of their respective currencies, as well as to save money for a rainy day when commodity prices go down. Since the sharp drop of oil prices in 2014, the relevance of commodity price volatility and the importance of having enough government savings to weather the storm of low prices have risen tremendously. Consequently, worries about the Dutch disease and adverse effects of windfall profits have diminished significantly as profits themselves have fallen sharply.





  
Given the above-mentioned doubts about the negative influence of the Dutch disease, several economists sought an alternative economic channel that could have a negative effect on some resource-dependent countries. That led to the emergence of what can be described as the ""volatility curse"" hypothesis. The main idea is that the problem is not resource dependence per se, but rather the volatility of mineral commodity prices in the global market. Observation of the harmful effects of commodity price volatility was one of the outcomes of broader research into resource economics in the 1990s. Raymond Mikesell found that economies with a high proportion of natural resource exports over the two decades between 1972 and 1992 experienced an overall trade volatility three times greater than nonresource economies.28 Both Mikesell and Auty suggested that revenue volatility may be one of the major causes of economic slowdowns in resource economies.29 Other studies published later focused specifically on the price volatility effect.30



For example, regression analyses conducted by Tiago Cavalcanti, Kamiar Mohaddes, and Mehdi Raissi showed that, for 62 primary commodity-exporting countries, price booms themselves had a positive impact on GDP growth.31 However, volatility of prices and consequent volatility of export earnings affected it negatively. For the remaining resource-poor countries, volatility of commodity prices had no effect on their total factor productivity, investment patterns, or GDP growth. Given that resource-poor countries are still consuming natural resources and thus are also affected by price volatility as consumers and importers of oil, gas, and other minerals, Cavalcanti, Mohaddes, and Raissi's findings suggest that price volatility can harm growth only at a sufficiently high level of economic dependency on income from a certain export product. Thus, the more sophisticated argument is that only a sufficiently high degree of price volatility, often seen in natural resources, is distractive.



The price volatility hypothesis seems to make somewhat more sense than the Dutch disease hypothesis. The Dutch disease hypothesis essentially argues that through several channels, high income from the sale of natural resources harms rather than accelerates growth. But common sense would lead us to the opposite conclusion: extra income generates extra growth. And many, though not all, economic regressions demonstrate exactly that. The price volatility hypothesis makes a different argument: reliance on mineral commodity exports harms growth through the external volatility of prices. Such fluctuations do not allow the economy and its main players, both private and public, to adjust; thus, such fluctuations impede innovation, investment, and development. Volatility harms fiscal policies, public spending in particular, as the government is left with less money to spend at times of low prices.



Although it raises legitimate questions, the volatility curse hypothesis suffers from several problems. First, exactly as with the Dutch disease, it is difficult to see how natural resources generally differ from other commodities traded in an open international market. Some degree of volatility is inherent in the very nature of all commodity prices or indeed any prices in a free market. Second, many goods, such as certain consumer goods, medicines, and high tech devices, are subject to intense price volatility. Nonetheless, one never hears about a ""gadget price volatility curse.""



There is another reason to be skeptical about the volatility curse hypothesis. If one is to believe that commodity price volatility is the source of trouble for economic growth in general, then that implies that the firms that are most exposed to that harmful volatility — that is, companies in extractive industries, refining, petrochemicals, and so forth — would be affected to an even greater extent. Oil companies, for example, suffer from a 100 percent exposure to oil price volatility, whereas governments of oil-producing countries are exposed to it only to the degree to which their budgets are dependent on oil incomes (that can be higher or lower, but only in a handful of countries does it come close to 100 percent). However, if we look at long periods of time, oil companies demonstrate roughly the same returns on investment as firms in other sectors. Evidently, extractive industries have developed mechanisms to mitigate commodity price volatility and avoid a volatility curse.



Governments of resource economies could benefit from studying such mechanisms and applying them to government finances. Some of the methods used by private companies include hedging through various financial instruments, insurance, scenario analysis, corporate planning, and cost reductions. Using such instruments in a competent and strategic manner could be generally described as _efficient management_. This efficient management is precisely what allows some businesses to thrive under price volatility. And the lack of it is what makes other businesses go under.



Price fluctuations are just one of the many risks that any business has to take into account and manage. All of that seems to be self-evident when applied to businesses, but somehow it disappears entirely when economists look at countries and, particularly, their governments. Then volatility suddenly changes from a risk to a ""curse."" In that sense, the price volatility hypothesis does not fundamentally differ from the Dutch disease or any other similar approach that essentially falls into the resource curse paradigm.



One example of successful hedging policies in an oil-exporting economy is Mexico. Agustin Carstens, a Chicago University–trained economist and the current governor of the Central Bank of Mexico, has been pursuing a persistent and sophisticated hedging strategy in Mexico. Since the beginning of the decade, Mexico has been selling 25 percent of its annual crude output forward (about 200 million barrels). During the latest oil price plunge, the Mexican government benefited from the hedge quite substantially: although the price at which it hedged its sales in 2015 was $76.40 per barrel, the actual average price that year fell about a third below that number.32



The basic argument — explored in the following section — is that instead of fighting various ""curses"" and ""diseases,"" governments would do much to look inward and analyze their own performance, along with the shape and role of the institutions that they create, maintain, and occasionally destroy. In that sense, both the Dutch disease and the effect of commodity price volatility are essentially institutional rather than purely economic problems. Both become obstacles under specific circumstances, which are usually associated with the lack of certain institutions. It would also be helpful to supplement public administration tools with those already successfully employed by companies (for example, those for managing price volatility). Various governments have done exactly that by creating stabilization funds and other similar measures.



Mikesell captured the role of price volatility and the effects of the Dutch disease in resource-reliant economies in the following way:



A legitimate question is whether the shocks caused by primary commodity export booms are more serious than the shocks experienced by resource poor countries. Perhaps they are, but they can be handled by adopting appropriate policies.33



On a more fundamental level, although adopting private-sector practices may alleviate some of the difficulties that publicly owned corporations face, it won't solve multiple problems inherent in state-dominated industries. The more efficient solution (which is often also more politically cumbersome) is to introduce more actual private management into resource industries through the process of privatization. For instance, a study by Erika Weinthal and Pauline Jones Luong argues that more private ownership in the industry would increase overall efficiency and also boost government income. Thus, in their view, to avoid the resource nationalism problem, domestic private ownership by national private companies is a more feasible solution.34





  
Rent-seeking is a prominent feature of many petrostates. It is certainly not unique to petrostates, but it does appear to have a particularly strong effect on them and to cause institutional weaknesses. Rent-seeking is not just corruption through bribery. Although bribery is very often part of rent-seeking, it is helpful to distinguish between illegal and legal rent-seeking activities. Corruption and bribery are in the first category, whereas the second includes a broad range of activities, such as creating regulatory barriers to entry, ring-fencing mineral licenses for a certain group, or channeling state subsidies.



Several authors have explored the phenomenon of rent-seeking.35 In 2006, Halvor Mehlum, Karl Moene, and Ragnar Torvik suggested an analytical model for examining which economic forces are at play in resource economies.36 They also went one step further and looked at why some countries are negatively affected by rent-seeking and some are not. Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik's model suggests how rent-seeking can influence economic growth under different institutional conditions.



They begin by establishing the distinction between production and special forms of rent-seeking. They argue that all forms of rent-seeking can be harmful to economic development but not to the same degree. The productive economy and rent-seeking can be either complementary or competing, and it is the latter that is more harmful to growth and development. Rent-seeking competes with production when institutional quality is poor. The authors provide some illustrations:



Dysfunctional democracies invite political rent appropriation; low transparency invites bureaucratic corruption; weak protection of property rights invites shady dealings, unfair takeovers and expropriation; weak protection of citizens’ rights invites fraud and venal practices; weak rule of law invites crime, extortions and mafia activities; a weak state invites warlordism.37



Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik call the most harmful type of rent-seeking ""grabbing"" and call institutions that increase returns on such rent-seeking ""grabber-friendly."" The better the quality of institutions, the less profitable it is to be engaged in grabbing, and the more profitable it is to be engaged in production.



They then go on to establish two possible frameworks: a resource economy with grabber-friendly institutions and one with producer-friendly institutions. Let us imagine that in both of those economies, a major new oil discovery is made, which swiftly increases income from oil exports. In an economy with grabber-friendly institutions, resource income provides a new source of income for grabbers, bringing their profits up, while producers' profits remain unchanged. The result is fewer producers, more grabbers, and lower income for all. That is exactly the situation that is described as ""the paradox of plenty,"" when higher resource income reduces total income.



Under grabber-friendly institutions, the sequence of developments is as follows: high resource rents pull entrepreneurs into grabbing. That causes profits in production to go down, which in turn pushes even more entrepreneurs into grabbing. Grabbers generate negative externalities, and producers generate positive externalities. This explains why the negative income effect from this reallocation of entrepreneurs dominates the direct positive income effect of more resources.



In an economy with producer-friendly institutions, increased receipts from the sale of natural resources provide an additional source of income for producers and consequently shift production profits upward. The result is more producers and fewer grabbers. Furthermore, in a producer-friendly system, increased income from natural resources stimulates overall production. Its boost to overall incomes is higher than the incremental increase from the sale of minerals alone. That happens because positive complementarities exist between various producers. Thus, Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik's model has a multiplier effect in resource economies, such that both positive and negative tendencies get amplified. In essence: ""With producer-friendly institutions natural resources stimulate production. With grabber-friendly institutions natural resources hamper production.""38



Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik suggest a visual representation of patterns of growth in different economies (see Figure 4). They compare four hypothetical countries: resource-poor countries A and A*, where country A has grabber-friendly institutions, and country A* has producer-friendly institutions; and resource economies B and B*, where country B has grabber-friendly institutions and country B* has producer-friendly institutions. The four countries initially have the same income level Y0. The country with producer-friendly institutions, A*, grows faster than the country with grabber-friendly institutions, A. Similarly, country B* has a higher growth rate than country B. One of the main features of this model is that resource economies with producer-friendly institutions outperform resource-poor countries with producer-friendly institutions (B* and A*, respectively), whereas among grabber-friendly countries, it is the other way round: resource economies (B) end up lagging behind all other groups. Hence, Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik's main conclusion is that the quality of institutions determines whether natural resource abundance is a blessing or a curse.



 **Figure 4. Growth Paths of Resource-Rich and Resource-Poor Economies According to the Mehlum, Moene and, Torvik Model**  




  
To examine the performance of different resource economies depending on the strength of their institutions, I analyzed empirical data that illustrate their economic and social development. I then took the three most frequently quoted indexes, deliberately using three different reports, to assess the effect of institutional quality as measured by different research teams. I grouped the economies according to their score on the global indexes. The following three indexes were used:



The list of resource economies includes 68 countries. The Appendix provides a full list of the countries that qualify, based on IMF and UNCTAD data, as well as groups of countries according to their scores on the three indexes used. This list does not include some of the world's major oil and gas producers, such as the United States, Mexico, and Brazil. The reason is that although those countries produce a significant amount of hydrocarbons (as well as other mineral commodities), their share as a percentage of GDP and overall exports is lower than the criteria for resource economies (10 percent of GDP and 25 percent of exports).



The resource economies are divided into four quartiles in accordance with their performance on the three indexes. The performance of those quartiles is then compared using five parameters as measures of economic and social development:



A trend is visible in all groups and for all parameters. That trend confirms a previous hypothesis: a better institutional environment in resource countries correlates with higher income per capita, higher living standards, and more social development. Comparing groups with the most developed institutions (the first quartile) with the world average also demonstrates that development levels in resource countries with strong institutions are greater than that of the world average. The strong performance of that first quartile is particularly important, as it refutes the popular resource curse hypothesis. The findings of this empirical research are demonstrated in Figures 5 through 9.





  
This section looks at policy choices facing resource-based economies. It examines such policy areas as the institutional climate, the government's share in oil companies, stabilization funds, and government investments. In this section I argue that economic and social performance of resource economies depends primarily on the strength of their institutional framework, of which economic freedom is a key component.



 **The Influence of Economic Freedom on Development in Resource Economies**  
How should economic freedom be defined? The _Economic Freedom of the World_ (EFW) report provided a definition:



Individuals have economic freedom when property they acquire without the use of force, fraud, or theft is protected from physical invasions by others and they are free to use, exchange, or give their property as long as their actions do not violate the identical rights of others. An index of economic freedom should measure the extent to which rightly acquired property is protected and individuals are engaged in voluntary transactions.39



The EFW measures 42 government policies that affect economic freedom.40 The Fraser Institute measures those policies using quantifiable characteristics and independent surveys. The data are organized into five main categories, which, broadly speaking, define the institutional framework that constitutes economic freedom:



Economic freedom is important because it is a major prerequisite for economic growth and development. Economic growth is strongly associated with economic freedom.41 It is also strongly related to certain other parameters of human development. Higher economic freedom is positively correlated with such indicators as life expectancy, literacy, and civil and political rights. It is negatively correlated with poverty and corruption.42 And since economic rights and, more narrowly, property rights are an inalienable part of fundamental human rights, political and civil liberties are incomplete in the absence of economic freedom.



Where do resource economies stand in relation to economic freedom? If one first looks at the bottom 10 global economies' economic freedom scores, they may appear to prove the resource curse hypothesis. Eight out of 10 qualify as resource economies: Mozambique, Algeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, the Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Myanmar, and — closing the global list as least economically free — Venezuela.



However, this gloomy picture for resource economies is somewhat improved when one then switches to the top 10 most free economies. Half of them are resource economies to varying degrees: Australia, Canada, Bahrain, Finland, and Chile. What seems to be the case here is not the ""resource curse"" but rather ""resource polarization,"" consistent with Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik's producers vs. grabbers model, in which resource economies with institutional deficiencies perform worse than resource-poor countries with the same level of institutional development. At the same time, mineral resources can boost those economies with more developed institutions.



A number of economists have analyzed the role of institutions, which determines the overall level of economic freedom and influences growth in resource economies.43 Overwhelmingly, those authors concluded that institutional development is both positively and strongly correlated with economic success in resource economies. The mechanisms through which economic freedom fosters growth and development are largely related to its effect on rent-seeking. Secure property rights, fair and efficient enforcement of contracts, freedom of trade, and limits on the government's ability to transfer wealth through subsidies and regulation in effect reduce the rate of return on unproductive economic activities.



On the other hand, the stronger those institutions are, the more profitable it is to generate wealth through productive entrepreneurship instead of grabbing. One other channel through which economic freedom can stimulate growth and development is the reduction of conflict. Erik Gartzke found that economic institutions are by far more effective than noneconomic institutions in diminishing violence.44



A study by Louis-Philippe Béland and Raaj Tiagi45 looks at how economic freedom, as measured by the EFW index, correlates with economic growth in countries with a high share of income from exports of metals and ores (in mining but not oil and gas economies). The study examined real GDP per capita from 1970 to 2006.



Béland and Tiagi indicate that, in countries with low scores for economic freedom, natural resources hamper growth, whereas countries with high levels of economic freedom perform significantly better.46 They even outperform their resource-poor peers with the same score in economic freedom. Those results also show that a mineral-exporting country can catch up in its economic development if it improves its level of economic freedom. Even with relatively small improvements in economic freedom, the effect on growth and development is positive and quite significant. All of that is consistent with Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik's model, which suggests a multiplier effect in resource economies, so that both positive and negative tendencies are amplified, as producer-friendly institutions stimulate production, whereas grabber-friendly institutions hamper production.47

**Figure 6. Foreign Direct Investment in Resource Economies, 2013 Countries Grouped According to Their Rankings in Three Reports Measuring Institutional Strength (Fraser Institute, World Bank, and World Economic Forum)**  




Andrei Illarionov of the Cato Institute and the Institute for Economic Analysis undertook a number of studies examining the role of institutions and economic freedom in various groups of countries, including oil producers. He used both the _Economic Freedom of the World_ index and other measures of institutional development. Illarionov divided various groups of economies into subgroups according to their rating of economic freedom. In particular, he looked at the performance of oil-producing countries in the Arab world and concluded that the main reason for slow growth in many of those countries is insufficient progress in economic freedom.48 Illarionov analyzed the performance of other petrostates, specifically Russia, and came to similar conclusions.



 **Figure 7. Human Development Index (HDI) in Resource Economies, 2013 Countries Grouped According to Their Rankings in Three Reports Measuring Institutional Strength (Fraser Institute, World Bank, and World Economic Forum)**  




As shown in Figures 5–9, there is a strong positive correlation between economic freedom in resource economies and the level of real GDP per capita (PPP) and other economic and social indicators. Similar to the other two institutional ratings, in all groups and for all parameters, in countries with higher levels of economic freedom, both real per capita income and human development scores are higher, and there is more investment and more civil rights. Greater economic freedom also correlates with lower crime and corruption. The most important conclusion is that the economic and social performance of resource economies depends primarily on the strength of their institutional framework, of which economic freedom is a key measurement.

 **Resource Economies, Excessive State Interference, and Associated Inefficiencies**  
Government interference in resource economies is often more significant than in nonresource economies. The most important reasons, in my view, are the following four:



Although government interference in resource economies is often more significant than in nonresource economies, certain features of state intervention have universal characteristics across all countries. All in all, various types of government involvement in the economy fall into three broad categories: regulation, redistribution, and ownership.



Some areas of regulation are essential for a well-functioning institutional system (as discussed earlier), such as independent courts or law enforcement agencies. However, the further a specific area of regulation is removed from the core functions of government, the more likely it is to have negative effects on economic growth. Regulation possesses a ""multiplier effect,"" which can be either positive or negative: efficient regulation, which reinforces the rule of law, can boost economic development, whereas even small regulatory agencies can slow down growth through red tape, bottlenecks, and market distortions. In resource economies, the multiplier effect for both positive and negative aspects of regulation tends to be especially pronounced.



The second category of government activity is redistribution. The process of taxing individuals and business and spending the receipts through various government programs has several costs associated with it. Among such costs, as outlined by Daniel J. Mitchell, are the following three.49



In resource economies, redistribution often takes the form of government direct investments, which are typically large-scale infrastructure developments and are commonly ""white elephant"" projects with low rates of return. Government investment initiatives often boost politicians' popularity and not coincidentally provide excellent opportunities for extracting rents and committing outright misappropriation.



Since direct government investment is often hard to defend because of its poor reputation, some governments in resource economies embrace a somewhat more sophisticated policy, which is often referred to as ""diversification."" That policy entails supporting companies in certain sectors through subsidies and loans. It is defended on the grounds that a more diversified economy is less vulnerable to commodity price volatility and is thus more sustainable. The general premise is reasonable and may even seem to derive from the same concerns articulated above. Other things being equal, diversified economies usually have a more balanced growth trajectory and often enjoy higher growth rates. But the devil is in the details. Diversification is a means to an end, namely, to higher growth through increased economic efficiency. The problem with government-subsidized diversification is that it reverses this logic by making diversification a goal of government policies in itself.



Diversification makes sense only when it actually increases overall efficiency, which is hardly possible if the government is picking winners. When a given economy is not diversified, it is usually the result of economic inefficiency and bureaucratic red tape in certain sectors, which prevents businesses from making a profit. By pouring money into those sectors, the efficiency problem is not resolved but rather aggravated, because greater capital is allocated to inefficient businesses without alleviating their inefficiency. As Maria Sarraf and Moortaza Jiwanji point out, ""Governments tend to invest in projects with low rates of return compared to the private sector.""50 And government-driven diversification suffers from the same rent-seeking and corruption problem as direct investments and infrastructure programs.



Apart from redistribution by the state, another category of government involvement is direct ownership of companies: when the government owns certain enterprises, either creating a monopoly or competing with private companies. Lower efficiency of government-owned enterprises can affect the overall economy in several ways, including by underperforming relative to the private sector, by crowding out private investment, and by monopolizing a certain industry. In many countrie — for instance, many members of OPEC — the natural resources sector is the most state-dominated among all industries. It is worth looking at how different structures of ownership in the extractive industries (private, state, or mixed) and various policies related to redistribution (such as stabilization funds) can affect overall economic growth and development in resource economies.



 **The Influence of the Government's Share of Ownership in Extractive Industries on Overall Economic Performance**  
OPEC was founded in 1960. It developed into a club of countries with mostly government-dominated oil sectors. Since then, the world oil and gas industry has gone through a profound evolution of ownership. In the many developing countries that account for most of global hydrocarbon production, governments took control of their oil and gas sectors by expropriations, nationalization, or renegotiations with international companies. Such takeovers resulted in an industry in which not only the reserves in the ground were owned by governments, but also most of the oil and gas was produced by government-controlled corporations. The latter are usually referred to as national oil companies, whereas major privately owned transnational corporations are called international oil companies.



National oil companies dominate the industry for various reasons, including particularly the appeal to resource nationalism. For the purposes of this paper, however, what interests us is the relative economic performance of oil companies that adopted different models of ownership and sector organization. It is helpful to separate the issue of overall management efficiency from political sentiments. As Thorvaldur Gylfason from the University of Iceland argued:



What seems to matter for economic growth is not the abundance of natural resources per se, but rather the quality of their management, and of economic management and institutions in general.51



 **Figure 10. Net Income per Barrel of Leading Oil Companies in 2013**  




One way to evaluate the efficiency of various ownership models is to compare the world's largest oil companies by one key parameter that characterizes their performance: net income per barrel of oil equivalent produced (which includes combined production of both oil and gas). The average net income per barrel of the six leading privately owned oil companies in 2013 was 56 percent higher than that of the six leading state-owned oil companies ($17.35 and $11.12 per barrel, respectively, as shown in Figure 10). That number includes leading oil companies with production above 2 million barrels a day for which detailed financial reporting is available. It is worth noting that for many government-owned oil companies such reports are unavailable, specifically companies in Gulf countries.



Moreover, most private international oil majors demonstrate more resilience during the collapse of oil prices (see Figure 11). Consider companies' performance in 2014, the year when Brent lost half its value — from a peak $115 per barrel to $58 per barrel by the end of the year. In 2014, the performance gap broadened even further: the net income per barrel of leading privately owned oil companies was as much as 87 percent higher than that of leading state-owned oil companies ($15.28 and $8.19 per barrel, respectively). Remarkably, three out of six of the private corporations had even higher incomes per barrel in 2014, the year of the oil price crash, than they did in 2013. These results demonstrate not simply the higher efficiency of privately owned companies but also their stronger resilience to oil price fluctuations, which is an important attribute in this industry, given significant commodity price volatility.



 **Figure 11. Net Income per Barrel of Leading Oil Companies in 2014**  




Oil companies differ in various ways, including in their property structures and organizational models. Their portfolios have varying ratios between production and refining, their fields have distinct geological characteristics, and they operate under different regulatory regimes. The above-mentioned results are largely achieved in otherwise unequal circumstances as well. Most of the state-owned companies operate in their home territory, where they enjoy favorable conditions and access to more reserves with higher quality, which is not the case with most privately owned companies. The latter nonetheless manage to outperform government producers while normally facing tougher environments, which often include abrupt changes of contract terms, higher taxes, and occasional license revocations and expropriations.



Despite such telling evidence, the balance of ownership has even of late continued to shift in the direction of state oil companies. Although the peak of nationalizations of the 1960s and 1970s is long gone, the idea of resource nationalism is still going strong. The irony is that, from the available evidence, not only the income per barrel is significantly higher among private companies, but also the earnings that governments receive in taxes from the operations of private firms are often higher on a per-barrel basis than the earnings from the operations of government-owned enterprises. As demonstrated by the cases of Iran, Venezuela, and Mexico, a prolonged state monopoly of the oil industry results in its stagnation and an overall fall of government income. Mexico's Pemex is a very powerful example. Mexico's petroleum sector was nationalized in the 1930s, which makes Pemex one of the longest-surviving state oil monopolies. Overall results are telling: even under the high oil price of 2012, the company was on the verge of receiving a negative return on a barrel of oil produced (its net profit was only 10 U.S. cents per barrel). Before 2012 it had actually been operating at a loss.



At the same time, the shale revolution in the United States demonstrates the efficiency of private ownership in the energy sector. The examples of Australia and Canada also show how, on the back of a surge in hydrocarbon production, they enjoyed rapid economic growth even in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007–08, whereas many other member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have struggled with a recession.



It is worth noting that although evidence argues strongly in favor of private resource production, privately owned companies are not a universal remedy. Without strong and transparent institutions, private companies are quickly corrupted through rent-seeking, as returns on grabbing outweigh returns on productive enterprise. The result is a structure that may look privately owned on the surface but is actually a system of state-affiliated interest groups and clans. That is the case in a number of petrostates with poor ratings on the corruption index.52



The importance of institutional quality is once again highlighted when we compare oil and gas production in resource economies grouped by their ratings in the World Bank's _Doing Business_ report. Production volumes are only partially determined by reserves in a particular country; institutions play a crucial role. That factor is evident particularly when we recall that Iran and Venezuela are among the top three countries with hydrocarbon reserves. Both lag far behind several other countries in production because of low investment and industry mismanagement.



The superior results of private firms are not limited to oil economies; they are also evident from the experiences of countries with substantial mining industries.53 As a consequence of opening its mining sector to private investment, Indonesia was able to boost its production of gold, tin, nickel, and copper by about 50 percent in less than 10 years. The Indonesian government increased its revenues from the mining sector almost fivefold, from $700 million in 2000 to $3.4 billion in 2006, while (not coincidentally) actually reducing its overall tax and royalty rates on mining companies, from 60 percent to 45 percent.54 Armenia managed to become one of the main global producers of molybdenum after the government sold the country's largest processing complex to a private consortium of Armenian and German companies, which led to higher output. Today, 12 private companies operate functioning mines in Armenia, which account for 17 percent of industrial production and make a significant contribution to economic development.55



Finally, there is the difficult question of how to analyze the unique models that exist in the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countrie — Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Their main characteristic is a combination of unmatched hydrocarbon reserves and production, and small (sometimes very small, as in Qatar or Bahrain) populations. The exception is Saudi Arabia, which has a population of 28.8 million. The overall reliance on expatriate labor is unparalleled: immigrants represent between 30 percent (in Oman and Saudi Arabia) and over 80 percent (in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) of the population.56



Oil and gas production in GCC countries is predominantly state controlled, but it relies heavily on international service companies and highly skilled expat specialists working for Gulf national companies. GCC oil companies are arguably the most cosmopolitan in the world — even more so than international oil corporations. Although the hydrocarbon sector is state controlled, in many of the Gulf countries overall economic policies outside of the oil industry are very open and favorable to foreign investors. Gulf states generally rate highly on the _Economic Freedom of the World_ index. At the same time, high levels of economic freedom coexist with very low ratings on civil liberties. Governments of all Gulf Arab countries are organized as traditional monarchies.



Given the proportion of foreign nationals, most of whom do not integrate into the social and cultural fabric of the host nation, it is possible to argue that GCC countries have, in fact, not one but two parallel societies that coexist and codepend on each other. Whatever one might think of the unusual economic and social arrangement that exists in the Gulf Arab states, one thing is certain: that particular system is largely an anomaly and is unlikely to be replicated elsewhere for a variety of economic, political, and cultural reasons. It would therefore be fair to look at Gulf Arab countries as outliers that need to be analyzed separately from most other resource economies.



 **Stabilization Funds and Alternative Solutions**  
The idea of stabilization funds has certainly gained popularity over the past several decades, as some countries have successfully developed such national entities. Comparing economies with and without them, the overall results moderately favor stabilization funds.



From 1966 to 1989, Botswana was the fastest-growing economy in the world, transforming itself over that period from one of the poorest states to an upper-middle-income country (its performance over half a century relative to another African mining economy, the Republic of the Congo, is shown in Figure 12). That success has largely been due to both strengthened institutions and prudent management of Botswana's diamond revenues (nearly a quarter of the world's diamond reserves are located in Botswana).



Botswana follows a strategy of fixed public spending, allowing the government to accumulate revenue surpluses during boom years. Recurrent revenue surpluses that are not spent are transferred into Botswana's Foreign Reserves Fund. By the mid-1990s, interest payments on those reserves became the largest source of Botswana's government revenue after diamond sales. Between 1976 and 2008, foreign exchange reserves grew from $75 million to $10 billion, which equaled 33 months of import cover. Those reserves mitigate the impact of price volatility, allowing the government to maintain public spending when commodity markets turn bearish.



In Norway, a large part of the state income from oil and gas exports is diverted into the Government Pension Fund of Norway. It is the second-largest sovereign fund in the world, only after the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The overall value of its assets is 1.5 times Norwegian GDP, and it controls over 1 percent of all publicly traded shares in the world. Stabilization and sovereign funds have significantly aided public administration in a diversity of countries, such as Malaysia and Oman. In Russia, the Stabilization Fund helped the country weather the storm of the financial crisis and the oil price drop in 2008–09 by providing an emergency reserve for the economy.



 **Figure 12. Real GDP per Capita (PPP) in Two African Resource Economies since 1962**  




In summary, governments usually allocate some part of receipts from mineral exports to a special fund in order to alleviate the Dutch disease and to save for a rainy day. Stabilization funds, if designed and run properly, can serve the following purposes:



Whether a stabilization fund achieves those goals depends on whether it is sufficiently insulated from political pressures. With weak institutions, a stabilization fund will simply become another vehicle for redistributing mineral revenues into the hands of political cronies.



Assuming the fund operates independently of political pressures, what should be done with the accumulated reserves? The most common option for a stabilization fund is to invest in the global stock and bond market. That strategy is often politically inconvenient for the government, because it can be perceived as unpatriotic. Despite that, it does have some advantages. It can be a partial solution to the Dutch disease by sterilizing the inflow of foreign currency into the domestic economy during commodity price booms. Some people argue that such a strategy is also more detached from domestic interest groups and thus less prone to rent-seeking.



If implemented properly with the right level of self-discipline, stabilization funds may be a useful economic policy tool. But they are not a panacea. As outlined earlier, the Dutch disease and the negative impact of price volatility are essentially institutional rather than purely economic problems. Thus, both should have an institutional solution. A freer economic environment with equal opportunities stimulates private investment, entrepreneurial activity, and innovation in nonresource industries. As to price volatility, vulnerability to price fluctuations is reduced, because a freer economy relies less on redistribution and payouts by the government. Private-sector firms are better at dealing with the effects of commodity price volatility than state-run corporations.



Stabilization funds that invest in global market — assuming they attract qualified fund managers and stay as far from politics as possible — can be effective if implemented on a limited scale. Whether they are an optimal way to manage government income is still an open question. One might argue that, for economies that depend almost entirely on exports of a single mineral commodity, such as Oman or Botswana, it is important to maintain sizable reserves in order to manage public spending when prices are low. For those countries, having a limited emergency fund would be a good idea.



But where is the limit? What happens when reserves in the fund continue to grow on the back of high prices during commodity price booms? Should the government reduce (or even suspend) the amount of money diverted into the fund after it reaches a certain level? These are not rhetorical questions. If the government manages to maintain a balanced budget while more and more money flows into the sovereign fund, it simply means that the state extracts from the economy far more than is necessary to fulfill its obligations.



The question then is, should the government continue to take that much from the economy if it is not even sure what to do with the money? Would it not be fairer and more efficient if the surplus money was left in the economy when commodity prices are high? Some would argue that, in a resource-dependent economy, there would not be enough domestic businesses to invest in, and thus people and companies would choose to take their increased incomes abroad. But even if that were the case, it is no different from what the government is doing through its sovereign fund anyway. Put simply, do people really need the government to manage their money? As abstract as these questions might seem during a period of low oil prices, they expose some important dilemmas concerning the role and scope of government in a resource economy.



Several economists have suggested that resource economies should distribute part of their natural resource revenues directly to their citizens.58 In the U.S. state of Alaska, that takes the form of a special oil dividend, known as the Permanent Fund Dividend, which has been paid to all residents of Alaska since 1983. In 2015 each citizen received $2,072. The dividend is paid once a year from the Alaska Permanent Fund, a sovereign entity that accumulates a share of government revenues from the oil industry. The fund has grown from an initial $734,000 in 1977 to $54.5 billion in market value of its assets in 2016.59



The idea of a citizen's dividend can be traced back to the pamphlet _Agrarian Justice_ written in 1795 by Thomas Paine, an influential political thinker during the American Revolution. Such an idea takes the common notion that natural resources in the ground ""belong to the people"" back to its actual meaning. If mineral wealth belongs to every citizen in the country, then one might argue that everyone has a claim to an equal share of that wealth. What share of export revenues the government should be allowed to retain is subject to a separate discussion, as is the way such a transfer would be administered. In practical terms, a special ""oil account"" could be opened for every citizen in an oil-producing country or perhaps merged with individual pension accounts. Although this idea may seem farfetched and has not yet gained broad support, it would be unfair to rule it out. In the future, with the increasing automation of even the intellectual workforce, a citizens' dividend might become more appealing.





  
The section looks at the institutional conditions for major innovations in extractive industries, such as the shale revolution and breakthroughs in the development of other unconventional resources. It then briefly summarizes the experience of four countrie — Australia, Canada, Chile, and Norway — and looks at particular policies that allowed them to achieve more rapid growth and higher levels of social development compared with peer countries with resource-based economies. Finally, this section looks at the experiences of oil-exporting countries that managed to maintain high growth rates during the crude price drop in the 1980s.



 **The Shale Revolution: Its Causes and Implications**  
Since July 2014 the rapid oil price decrease has prompted strong interest in the changing dynamics of the global hydrocarbon market, specifically how it is influenced by technological breakthroughs in developing unconventional hydrocarbons. Most observers believe that one of the main reasons for the drop in oil prices was the rapid increase of U.S. oil production, which in 2014 reached the level of the other two biggest producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia (and even surpassed it for several months). Greater reliance on domestic production decreases U.S. demand for imported oil and hence puts downward pressure on the oil price worldwide. In addition, the rapid increase in domestic shale gas production accompanied by a drop in domestic gas prices has increased the share of gas in the overall energy mix in the United States, thus further strengthening American energy independence.



All in all, the shale revolution in the United States is having a major effect on global energy markets. Consequently, many industry analysts have drawn their attention to the commercial, technological, institutional, and regulatory aspects of hydrocarbon production from shale deposits. As shale gas and oil technologies gradually spread worldwide, the likelihood of their having an even stronger effect on the global energy balance in the not so distant future increases.



One of the characteristics of shale deposits is the small size of their wells. Drilling expenses are significantly lower than those of big wells on traditional deposits. Simultaneously, the production cycle of shale wells is relatively short. When oil prices decrease below production costs, it is possible to quickly extract oil on the existing wells and stop drilling afterward until the prices rise again. The volume of production can then be increased just as quickly by drilling new wells. That increased rate of production is not accompanied by considerable capital expenses, which is a big advantage under conditions of price volatility.



That factor directly affects the structure of the shale industry. In one sense, what is happening with shale reserves is conceptually closer to the Silicon Valley model and venture capitalism than traditional oil and gas with its multibillion dollar projects, which only larger, vertically integrated companies can carry out. As a result, the shale revolution's main driving force comes from junior independent innovation companies, which fiercely compete with one another.



Extractive industries have seen growth and innovation in countries around the world, due in no small part to favorable economic policies. The shale revolution in the United States is one of the most powerful examples. It started with the economic success of the Barnett Shale play in Texas in 1997. In 2000 shale gas provided only 1 percent of U.S. natural gas production; by 2012, it reached over 25 percent. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that by 2035, 46 percent of the U.S. natural gas supply will come from shale gas. Furthermore, by 2017, the United States is expected to become a net exporter of natural gas because of growing shale gas production. The success of new hydrocarbon technology stretches beyond the United States. Innovation in shale oil and gas was accompanied by a breakthrough in heavy crude production from oil sands, specifically in Canada. As a result, in 2012, the United States and Canada accounted for 25 percent of global natural gas production and 14 percent of oil production.60



 **Figure 13. World Resources of Technically Recoverable Shale Gas, in Billions of Cubic Feet**  




As shown in Figure 13, the United States ranks fourth in world shale gas resources. At the same time, according to the BP Energy Outlook,61 virtually all current shale gas comes from the United States. Other regions are expected to start producing shale gas in the future, but the United States will still produce the bulk of it for quite some time (Figure 14). The shale revolution supports the hypothesis that the development of a certain commodity depends more on institutions than on physical resources in the ground.



 **Figure 14. Forecast of World Shale Gas Production, in Billions of Cubic Feet per Day**  




Other countries are catching up. China is estimated to have the largest shale gas reserves in the world and is expected to be the global center of shale gas development outside North America. By 2030, shale could account for 20 percent of total Chinese gas production. And visible progress is being made in developing other unconventional hydrocarbons, such as coalbed methane.



Breakthroughs in shale oil and shale gas technologies are having a strong influence on the broader global energy landscape. First, gas price formulas are increasingly delinked from oil prices. That is an important change in the gas market, reflecting the growing supply of unconventional gas. Second, such breakthroughs are having a strong influence on the geopolitics of global energy, as the balance of hydrocarbon production is shifting toward countries that were for a long time viewed as being dependent on foreign oil and gas.62



The emergence of new centers of production, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and potentially China, is seriously undermining the influence of OPEC as a global oil cartel, whereas traditional importers are becoming more energy independent. OPEC's weight in global energy is further undermined by the growing significance of gas as a global fuel. The International Energy Agency predicts that by 2030, a quarter of global energy will be produced from ga — the same share as oil.63



The consequences of those developments go beyond the energy sector itself. The increasing share of gas in fuel consumption is already having a profound effect on the environmental debate. The burning of natural gas emits half the greenhouse gases that coal does, and 30 percent less than oil. For those politicians and nongovernmental organization activists who have argued in favor of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, natural gas may become a game changer. Tellingly, as gas has partially replaced other fuels in the United States (which did not sign the Kyoto Protocol, to the dismay of many eco-campaigners), in 2012 U.S. carbon dioxide emissions dropped to their lowest level in 20 years, whereas European countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol are failing to meet their emissions targets. As a result, a growing number of environmentalists are fine-tuning their position from anti–fossil fuel to ""pro-gas.""



The BP Energy Outlook64 estimates that 200 trillion cubic meters of technically recoverable shale gas and 240 billion barrels of shale oil exist worldwide. By 2030, their development will account for over 20 percent of the increase in the world's hydrocarbon supply. What brought about such a significant shift in the global energy landscape? On a technical level, a breakthrough in three key technologies made it possible: horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and advances in seismic data collection and its digital interpretation.



Shale oil and gas are different from conventional resources only in the way they are trapped in the ground: they are diffuse rather than concentrated in isolated wells. Horizontal drilling is required to identify concentrations of shale oil and gas, and then the rock needs to be fractured with water to release the crude or gas so that it can flow to the surface. Most shale deposits had been identified long before their development became economically feasible. Technological progress allowed companies to book those deposits as commercial reserves and start production.



An important externality of the shale boom is that it helped undermine a common prejudice against extractive industries as being insufficiently innovative. Politicians who are eager to be viewed as ""cutting-edge"" have often repeated the idea that to modernize and enter the postindustrial era, a country needs to shift away from mineral production. That outdated attitude is quickly becoming history. The shale revolution is in essence a technological breakthrough of the highest caliber.



 **The Role of Strong Institutions and Competition in Extending the Frontiers of Exploration**  
One aspect of the shale revolution and breakthroughs in other unconventional hydrocarbons gets much less attention in the media than geopolitical, technical, or environmental issues: What were the conditions that allowed the technological innovation to happen? It is no coincidence that advances in unconventional hydrocarbons took place in countries that are in the top of the _Economic Freedom of the World_ rating. Those advances were also helped by other conditions, such as high gas prices in the 2000s. But the institutional component — the combination of secure property rights, a favorable tax regime, transparent and efficient regulation, and minimal red tape — was the decisive factor. The institutional conditions that allowed the shale revolution to happen should be carefully studied by policymakers in other countries, especially in resource economies.



It is also important to point out that the United States, Canada, and Australia have extractive sectors with multiple private companies, ranging from small exploration firms to vertically integrated multinationals. It was not one corporation alone, but several — including Chevron, Shell, Devon, Talisman Energy, Chesapeake, and Range Resource — that developed technologies for the commercial extraction of shale gas. They were all in tough competition for limited capital and human resources, which made them focus on the most efficient technologies. It is not surprising then that despite the world's largest shale gas reserves, the shale gas boom did not start in China, in which the sector is dominated by government oil and gas companies.



In December 2014, the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration's Centre for Resource Economics published the findings of its research into the role of institutions and companies' property structure in the shale gas revolution in the United States.65 The results of the econometric modeling demonstrate the following: institutional parameters, such as competition and private ownership, had a positive effect on the production of unconventional hydrocarbons, including shale gas. Because of extensive innovative development and strong institutions, the United States transitioned from almost exclusively conventional gas production to unconventional production.



In 2012 the United States had about 13,000 small oil companies, which accounted for more than 54 percent of hydrocarbon production. Small companies are currently providing much of the increase in U.S. hydrocarbon production. Most of them produce deep in the continent from hard-to-recover and residual reserves of marginal wells or small deposits. A strong positive dependence exists between shale oil and gas production and independent companies' investment in research and development.



It is a well-known fact that the United States is a leader in shale oil production today, but few people know that it is also a leader in oil production on the Arctic Shelf. As with shale oil, the key determinants for success in developing the Beaufort Sea deposits in U.S. Arctic waters are an effective and stable tax system, guarantees of property rights, and the absence of a state monopoly. Like the shale revolution, the biggest breakthroughs in Arctic offshore production are not correlated with amounts of resources but with institutional quality. Tellingly, the United States and Norway (two major countries that operate on the shelf beyond the Arctic Circle) are significantly ahead of Russia in production volumes. At the same time, according to estimates, Russia has 41 percent of all technically extractable global resources of Arctic oil and 70 percent of the gas.66



Although multiple comparisons demonstrate that private oil companies largely outperform government-owned companies, the latter vary significantly in their performance. Within the right policy framework, some state corporations achieve impressive results. What matters are the way a particular company is organized and the overall institutional environment. State-owned firms that rely on strong and lasting partnerships with international companies tend to perform much better than those that develop in autarchy. The best example is Malaysia's Petronas. Petronas is state owned and for decades has relied on alliances with foreign companies to effectively run the Malaysian oil and gas sector and rapidly grow its business both domestically and overseas.



The Malaysian model of the extractive industries could be described as a symbiosis between state and private companies. Although the government maintains 100 percent ownership of Petronas, the overall government share in oil and gas production is about 60 percent. The remainder is divided among various international and national oil companies, such as Shell, ExxonMobil, Murphy Oil, and Nippon Oil, all of which operate through production-sharing agreements with Petronas.



International alliances have allowed Malaysia to keep an edge in the global market by, for example, becoming a leading exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Malaysia's strategy could be viewed as ""clever"" diversification; instead of trying to run away from its resource base and its competitive advantage, the country fine-tuned its economy to developments in the global market. As oil reserves started to decline, Malaysia commercialized its natural gas resources by joining the LNG market and becoming one of the leading exporters of LNG.



Another stage of diversification started when Petronas went global. Petronas's overseas projects account for 36 percent of its total hydrocarbon production. Petronas operates in over 30 countries, producing oil from about 50 projects in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia, more than half of which it operates. Bringing about strong international opportunities allowed Petronas to effectively manage the lowering of its production levels in mature areas of Malaysia. Today, industry experts agree that Petronas is the most efficient national oil company.67 Currently, Malaysia is already one of the most prosperous countries in Asia, and it qualifies as a so-called newly industrialized economy (its performance over half a century relative to another Asian oil exporting economy, Vietnam, is shown in Figure 15). Although in recent years a major corruption scandal cast a shadow on the Malaysian system, in previous years many had seen it as a role model for other Asian economies. It is a notable example of relative success in a non-OECD country without a preexisting set of Western-style institutions.

 **Four Resource-Exporting Countries with High Levels of Economic and Social Development**  
This section compares experiences of four resource economies: Australia, Canada, Chile, and Norway. It provides a brief overview of particular policies that allowed them to achieve high levels of social and economic development. These overviews are based on situations that preceded the metal and oil price drops in recent years. Lately these four countries, like most mineral exporters, are going through radical adjustments. It remains to be seen how they adapt to the new situation in global commodity markets.



 **Australia**  
Following a series of economic reforms that started in the mid-1980s, Australia began a period of rapid growth that exceeded its peers in the OECD club. Before Paul Keating, then Australia's treasurer, launched those reforms, the country was viewed by many as gradually moving toward the periphery of the global economy. Some of the key reforms undertaken in Australia included new regulation of the labor market to increase its flexibility and lower taxes, as well as reform of the financial system to enable it to meet the financing needs of the economy and to make it more attractive to investors, both domestic and foreign. Importantly, the government liberalized the system of mineral licensing and permits, which boosted investment in greenfield mineral exploration.



Minerals account for 70 percent of the value of Australia's exports and about 12 percent of its GDP. An additional 9 percent of the economy consists of services that are linked to energy and mining.68 By our metrics, that qualifies Australia as a resource economy. Furthermore, until recently, the share of extractive industries had been growing. Before the drop in oil prices, industry analysts had expected Australia to triple its gas production by 2020 and to overtake Qatar as the world's largest LNG producer, as Australia's conventional and unconventional gas projects came to the production stage. Hydrocarbons aside, Australia is the world's second-largest producer of gold, nickel, and zinc, the third-largest producer of iron ore and uranium, and the world's fourth-largest producer and leading exporter of coal.



Contrary to the predictions one might make from the resource curse hypothesis, the 1997 Asian financial crisis did not drag Australia down. Neither did it go into a recession like most other industrialized nations during the financial meltdown of 2008–09. Consistent reforms, strong property rights, immigration-friendly policies, and low barriers to doing business allowed Australia to become one of the world's leaders in economic growth and social development.



Australia is also one of the world leaders in economic freedom. It ranks 12th in the _Economic Freedom of the World_ rating69 and 13th in World Bank's _Doing Business_ rating.70 It also has the 18th-highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the world.71 The country has a highly developed framework of economic, social, and political institutions, which has allowed it to maintain a highly diversified economy and avoid the pitfalls of the Dutch disease.



Its extractive industries are diverse and consist of various players from world supermajors like BHP Billiton to independent exploration companies. Australian companies have also established themselves as active global explorers, especially in the mining industry. The sector is fully competitive and completely private, with no state companies in either energy or mining. The property rights of mineral license holders are secure, and access to new exploration and production licenses is relatively transparent, uncomplicated, and free of red tape.



Australia has been a pioneer in many areas, including the world's first floating LNG facility (Prelude FLNG), which is under development in the North West Shelf area. It also became a leader in the production of coalbed methane. Australia's innovation is helped not least by a pragmatic immigration policy, which attracts talented and entrepreneurial people from all over the world. Australia's and Canada's immigration policies are often considered to be role models for other countries. Curiously, their immigration levels, around 20 percent of the general population, are higher than the OECD average and are also higher than in many countries where immigration causes much greater controversy and hostility than in either Canada or Australia.



 **Canada**  
Canada is often mentioned as a role model of economic growth and social development for other resource economies. Canada's resource reliance is somewhat less than that of Australia, but nonetheless Canada's economic growth has been to a large degree driven by its mineral sector, especially since the shale oil breakthrough. Canada's overall mineral exports account for 34 percent of the value of its overall exports and about 9 percent of its GDP.72 It's also one of the world leaders in economic freedom: Canada ranks 9th in the _Economic Freedom of the World_ rating73 and 14th in the World Bank's _Doing Business_ rating.74 Additionally, it has the 17th-highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the world.75 The country has a highly developed framework of economic, social, and political institutions.



According to the Canadian government, before the drop in oil prices, the energy sector was the greatest contributor to Canada's balance of trade and a major job creator, employing more than 550,000 people. In 2012 alone, domestic and international businesses invested $55 billion in Canadian hydrocarbon projects.76 Sufficient technological advances also enabled the commercial production of Canadian oil sands. Many of the oil sand deposits had been identified long before their development became economically feasible. Technological progress allowed companies to book those deposits as commercial reserves and to start production.



Canada's mining sector also served as a source of economic growth. Foreign direct investment into mining was between $50 billion and $70 billion annually in the second half of the 2000s.77 Mining output was not only growing domestically but also spilling over internationally through multiple Canadian firms' investments in mining projects in emerging markets. Remarkably, Canadian companies account for between 30 percent and 45 percent of total global exploration activity in the mining sector worldwide.



Canada's hydrocarbons are developed by a range of companies both domestic (e.g., Athabasca Oil Corporation and Canadian Natural Resources) and international (e.g., Shell and ConocoPhilips). Extractive industries are completely private, with no state companies in either energy or mining. The property rights of mineral license holders are secure, and access to new exploration and production licenses is transparent, uncomplicated, and free of red tape. Canada's mineral tax regime is profit based and is generally lower than in many other jurisdictions.



The country possesses the third-largest proven reserves of crude after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Canada benefits from its proximity to its biggest trading partner, the United States. Canada is currently the world's largest producer of heavy oil from oil sands and is at the forefront of technological innovation in unconventional hydrocarbons.



In addition, Canada is using sovereign funds to hedge government finances against commodity price volatility. The largest sovereign fund in Canada is the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund. Also, the Toronto Stock Exchange is the world's leader in extractive industries: more mining and oil companies are listed there than on any other exchange in the world. Canada's institutional strength has allowed it to become a worldwide financial hub for hundreds of mining companies, which list their shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.



 **Chile**  
Chile today is the largest producer of copper, natural nitrates, iodine, and lithium, as well as the 2nd-largest producer of molybdenum, the 5th-largest supplier of silver, and 13th-largest producer of gold. Chile ranks 10th in the _Economic Freedom of the World_ rating.78 It is the only country in South America that is a member of the OECD. The strength of Chile's institutions and its favorable investment climate have made it the most successful Latin American economy. Figure 16 shows Chile's performance over half a century relative to Venezuela, another South American country that relies on natural resources exports.



 **Figure 16. Real GDP per Capita (PPP) in Two South American Resource Economies Since 1962**  




It is remarkable how Chile's economy and public policy have reacted to global copper prices. In 1971 the government of Salvador Allende nationalized all copper mines in Chile, along with banks and various companies in the manufacturing sector. That change caused an exodus of foreign capital and a suppression of domestic investment. Despite a strong increase in copper prices in the early 1970s, real GDP declined during the Allende regime, and inflation was at 100 percent a year.79



A period of severe economic and political instability led to the overthrow of the Allende government in 1973. The military government instituted a decisive anti-inflation program and devalued the real exchange rate. Unlike Chile's first copper export boom, Chile's second, which occurred in 1979–80, was accompanied by substantial growth in real GDP. Even after the decline of copper prices in 1981, GDP grew by about 5 percent annually during the remainder of the 1980s, and the real exchange rate appreciated only modestly. Moreover, Chile's stable institutional and regulatory framework kept investors on board during Latin America's turbulent economic conditions in the 1990s, allowing the country to outperform its regional peers. The government retained export windfalls in a stabilization fund and prevented the nonmining tradable sector from being suppressed by the effects of the Dutch disease.



The mining sector reforms were crystallized in Chile's 1981 Constitutional Mining Law (note that the term ""constitutional"" makes the law as immutable as the constitution). The law is a one-stop legislative shop for potential investors, outlining the rights and obligations of concession holders. The Constitutional Mining Law treats a concession as private property and allows concession holders to develop a mine in accordance with their strategy and market conditions. It also provides strong protection against expropriations. Importantly, the existence and termination of the concession are in the hands of the judicial branch, not the legislative branch or the executive. The law was drafted by José Piñera, then Chile's secretary of mining.80



It is worth noting that Chile's mining sector has a mixed property structure. Because of political pressures, during mining sector reforms in the early 1980s, it was decided that the biggest copper mining company, Codelco, would remain majority state owned. But copper production, which rose fivefold in the 1980s and 1990s, grew fastest among private companies. As a result, government-owned Codelco controls less than a third of overall copper production in Chile today.81



Following the success of mining reforms in the 1990s, the private concession system was extended to the Chilean infrastructure sector (highways, airports, and ports), which had traditionally been deemed ""public works"" to be carried out by the state.



 **Norway**  
Norway's GDP per capita (PPP) is the sixth-highest in the world.82 Norway ranks 27th in the _Economic Freedom of the World_ rating,83 9th in World Bank's _Doing Business_ rating,84 and 1st on the UNDP Human Development Index.85 Its institutional system is considered to be one of the most reliable and developed in the world. Up to a quarter of national income is generated by oil and gas production — the largest in Europe. Despite its reliance on mineral exports, Norway managed to avoid economic overheating and successfully mitigated the effects of oil price volatility thanks to disciplined and efficient policies. Norway's policy framework for managing revenues from hydrocarbon exports, especially the Government Pension Fund, is used as a model by several resource economies. These policies are relatively new. Although oil was discovered in Norway in 1969, it was not until the early 1980s that crude production started to generate a positive income.



Until 1981, when a Conservative government replaced the Labor Party, Norway's economic policies had been predominantly state led and included subsidized industrialization, rationing, and price controls. Inflation was high and real income growth low. The new government introduced a degree of deregulation and limited economic liberalization, which played an important role in attracting investment into the hydrocarbon industry. Today, Norway continues to maintain a large welfare state, but the current model differs from the pre-1981 one in one critical aspect: it is based on fiscal responsibility and financial discipline. In short, Norway chose a model with a large government that it can actually afford. Such a welfare state model differs from many other Western countries, where welfare obligations are financed though government borrowing and the central bank's printing press.



Through the national companies Statoil and Petoro, the government controls about 60 percent of oil and gas production and about the same share of reserves in Norway. The remaining share is divided among various international companies, such as ExxonMobil, Total, Shell, and ConocoPhilips.



An important feature of Norway's model is prudent and strategic management of its natural resources. Following a decline in oil production due to depletion of mature fields, natural gas production has risen to reach 10 billion cubic feet a day, more than five times what it was 20 years ago. Furthermore, international operations of Statoil, Norway's majority state-owned oil company, allow Norway to leverage its operational expertise in other regions, while compensating for the decline in domestic oil production. All in all, Statoil participates in oil and gas projects in 15 countries.



 **Strong Institutions and Economic Growth during Periods of Low Oil Prices: The 1980s Experience**  
Soon after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, Iran started the second wave of nationalization of its oil industry, which led to a slump in production. That outcome caused panic in the oil market, which worsened with the beginning of the Iran–Iraq War in 1980 — Iran's oil production even came to a halt for some time. Those events led to a sharp rise in oil prices, a period that became known as the second oil crisis. The first oil crisis of 1973 was triggered by the Yom Kippur War and the oil embargo of the Arab countries against the West. All in all, those developments from 1973 through 1981 led to a twelvefold increase of the oil price (in nominal terms) from $3.22 to $38.85 per barrel. Real prices adjusted for inflation climbed 5.8 times from $18.09 per barrel to $105.48 per barrel.



By January 1981, it was evident that various conflicts in the Middle East would not greatly suppress global oil production: the fall in production in Iran and Iraq was compensated for by other exporters who managed to increase supply swiftly and consequently satisfied global demand. That realization resulted in the greatest price collapse in history: in nominal terms, prices declined 3.6 times 1981–86.86 In real term — adjusted for inflation — prices returned to the exact same level from which they started to skyrocket back in 1973. The oil cycle was thus complete.



From 1980 to 1986, the world saw one of the deepest and longest declines in oil price — they dropped by 72 percent throughout that period. Price movements of then and now have much in common. Hence, the economic lessons of the 1980s are quite relevant today, because they demonstrate possible scenarios for oil economies under the pressure of low oil prices. In the 1980s, many oil-exporting countries experienced a severe economic shock, from which some have not fully recovered to this day. Such an outcome seems logical. In this group of countries, a sharp fall in prices causes a drop in budget revenues and a suppressed inflow of money into the overall economy. As a consequence, the majority of oil-exporting countries were hit by an economic crisi — the rate of GDP per capita growth was negative. However, there were exceptions. In particular, five oil exporters witnessed positive growth exceeding 1 percent of GDP during the oil price collapse (see Figure 17). Those countries were Oman, Indonesia, Norway, Malaysia, and Canada.



 **Figure 17. Average GDP per Capita Annual Growth in Oil Economies for the Period 1981–86**  




The political systems of those five countries were vastly different from one another. For instance, only Canada and Norway were democracies. What made their cases similar were their high rankings or increases in their positions on the _Economic Freedom of the World_ index. Canada was continuously ranked among the top leaders of the index (it was fifth in 1980 and sixth in 1990). By rejecting the policy of import substitution and liberalizing its economy in the 1980s and 1990s, Malaysia also reached leading positions in the rankings, 13th and 15th, respectively. In 1981, the Norwegian Social Democrats were succeeded by a market-oriented government. As a result, Norway improved its position from 36th place in 1980 to 21st in 1990.



 **Figure 18. Average GDP per Capita Annual Growth in Oil Economies for the Period 1980–2000**  




Unlike those three countries (Norway, Canada, and Malaysia), Indonesia is not used as a case study of economic success in this paper. Indeed, Indonesia's experience has been mixed. Its development deteriorated significantly following the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, Indonesia was one of the regional leaders in economic growth. Following a partial economic liberalization under the ""New Order"" of President Suharto, Indonesia rose from 62nd to 37th place within a decade.



Because of the relatively small size of its economy, Oman also does not appear as a case study in this paper. Oman's achievements as an oil-exporting country are nevertheless quite significant. Because of economic reforms undertaken by Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who rose to the throne in 1970, Oman rapidly increased its income per capita and accompanied that growth with a leap in institutional improvements. In 1980 Oman was not listed on the _Economic Freedom of the World_ index, but by 1990 it was ranked 34th — above the majority of its neighbors from the Arab world.



An important condition for positive growth rates in an oil-exporting economy under low commodity prices is its ability to increase production. Such an increase may partially or fully compensate for the decline in revenues from lower unit prices for a barrel of oil. Four of the five examined countrie — Oman, Canada, Norway, and Malaysia — increased oil production in 1981–86. Oman, Norway, and Malaysia almost doubled it. Indonesia could not follow their example because it was the only country in this group that at that time was a member of OPEC and thus was forced to comply with the cartel's quotas (Indonesia subsequently left the organization). However, Indonesia managed to partially compensate for those losses by doubling its gas production. Malaysia and Oman also significantly increased their gas production in the covered period. In Norway, a gas boom began a bit later and became a locomotive of growth during low oil prices in the 1980s and 1990s.



Not all oil exporters have the ability to quickly increase their production. That requires advanced management and strategic production planning. In particular, companies need to invest in exploration ahead of time — before the period of low prices. They also need to boost efficiency by increasing oil recovery rates.



If we look at the longer period from 1980 to 2000, which was characterized by suppressed oil prices (see Figure 18), one thing stands out in the group of oil-exporting countries. The same five countries with stronger economic institutions are again among the growth leaders. The main conclusion is that strong institutions allow economies to achieve long-term growth despite unfavorable economic conditions, such as low oil prices. An institutional solution is essential for long-term growth. Strong institutions can allow increases in production and can prop up efficiency. Furthermore, they can also diversify the economy when investments in oil, gas, and metals generate a smaller return because of falling prices.





  
This paper argues that resource economies with better economic and political institutions manage their resource revenues better and can achieve superior results in economic growth and social development. Evidence presented here is at odds with the resource curse hypothesis and with the idea that mineral-exporting countries are doomed to stagnation. Instead of battling with various ""curses"" and ""diseases,"" governments might do a better job by looking inward and analyzing their own performance, along with the institutional conditions in the economies that they govern. It is the quality of institutions that essentially determines whether natural resource abundance is a blessing or a curse.



This paper reaches the following main conclusions:





  
For the purposes of this paper, a country is a resource economy if over 25 percent of its exports consist of natural resources and the ratio of resource exports to GDP exceeds or is close to 10 percent (I also add some countries whose share is slightly below 10 percent of GDP but that nonetheless have a very high share of natural resources in their exports). The former criterion is used by a number of authors and is consistent with the IMF definition of resource-dependent countries. The latter is added to ensure that countries with very low volumes of overall exports do not fall into that category. Below is a full list of countries that qualify, based on IMF and UNCTAD data.



Altogether, this paper examines 68 resource economies and 39 oil and gas economies. Below is a list of resource economies as well as groups of countries according to their scores in the following three indexes:

3\. The term ""natural resources"" here refers to what are known as ""point resources"" — essentially, raw and refined mineral commodities. A broader definition might include land, water basins, and other such natural resources that are not considered here. This paper's definition, however, is consistent with most studies on the subject and includes two broad categories of minerals: mineral nonfuels and fuels. The former comprises nonferrous metals, metalliferous ores, crude fertilizers, and other minerals, including precious and semiprecious stones. The latter category includes oil and oil products, natural gas, and coal. The precise list of commodities included in the definition is based on the Standard International Trade Classification and the database of merchandise exports developed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which has the most detailed statistical database on global merchandise trade.

40\. The _Economic Freedom of the World_ (EFW) report is published under the auspices of the Canadian Fraser Institute. Since the 1990s, the annual EFW report has provided data representing the various factors that make countries economically free. Today, the report covers 159 economies (95 percent of the world's population) for which relevant data are available. In its data, Fraser relies on a network of associated institutes from 85 countries that contribute to its research. The EFW index is one of the most broadly acknowledged measurements of the quality of institutions. A number of economists and organizations have used the EFW index as a benchmark of institutional development; the IMF's _World Economic Outlook_ , for instance. The EFW is possibly the most comprehensive of the indexes, as it incorporates some of the data from the other two ratings (the World Bank's _Doing Business_ and the _Global Competitiveness Report_ of the World Economic Forum) among dozens of other sources. The Appendix to the EFW publication contains explanatory notes and a full list of data sources. The Fraser Institute also publishes an annual Survey of Mining Companies, which examines the investment climate in mining economies, and a Global Petroleum Survey, an annual survey of petroleum executives regarding barriers to investment in oil- and gas-producing regions around the world.

The Hockey Schtick brings this to our attention. It seems Dr. Roy Spencer was prescient with his observation:

“The most obvious way for warming to be caused naturally is for small, natural fluctuations in the circulation patterns of the atmosphere and ocean to result in a 1% or 2% decrease in global cloud cover. Clouds are the Earth’s sunshade, and if cloud cover changes for any reason, you have global warming — or global cooling.”

This view of Earth’s horizon as the sun sets over the Pacific Ocean was taken by an Expedition 7 crew member onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Anvil tops of thunderclouds are also visible. The image is also part of the header at WUWT. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
Readers might also recall that evidence has been found for Spencer’s 1-2% cloud fluctuation. Even the National Science Foundation recognizes the role of clouds is uncertain: NSF Releases Online, Multimedia Package Titled, “Clouds: The Wild Card of Climate Change”
WUWT readers may recall the recent paper by Suckling and Smith covered at WUWT: New paper: climate models short on ‘physics required for realistic simulation of the Earth system’
In the Suckling and Smith paper it was concluded that the models they reviewed just don’t have the physical processes of the dynamic and complex Earth captured yet. This paper by de Szoeke et al. published in the Journal of Climate finds that climate models grossly underestimate cooling of the Earth’s surface due to clouds by approximately 50%

According to the authors, “Coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP3) simulations of the climate of the 20th century show 40±20 W m−2 too little net cloud radiative cooling at the surface. Simulated clouds have correct radiative forcing when present, but models have ~50% too few clouds.“
Let that 40 watts/ square meter sink in a moment.
The 40 watts/ square meter underestimate of cooling from clouds is more than 10 times the alleged warming from a doubling of CO2 concentrations, which is said to be 3.7 watts/square meter according to the IPCC (AR4 Section 2.3.1)
So the cloud error in models is an order of magnitude greater than the forcing effect of Co2 claimed by the IPCC. That’s no small potatoes. The de Szoeke et al. paper also speaks to what Willis Eschenbach has been saying about clouds in the tropics.
Here is the paper:

Observations of stratocumulus clouds and their effect on the eastern Pacific surface heat budget along 20°S
Simon P. de Szoeke, Sandra Yuter, David Mechem, Chris W. Fairall, Casey Burleyson, and Paquita Zuidema Journal of Climate 2012 doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00618.1
Abstract:
Widespread stratocumulus clouds were observed on 9 transects from 7 research cruises to the southeastern tropical Pacific Ocean along 20°S, 75°-85°W in October-November 2001-2008. The nine transects sample a unique combination of synoptic and interannual variability affecting the clouds; their ensemble diagnoses longitude-vertical sections of the atmosphere, diurnal cycles of cloud properties and drizzle statistics, and the effect of stratocumulus clouds on surface radiation. Mean cloud fraction was 0.88 and 67% of 10-minute overhead cloud fraction observations were overcast. Clouds cleared in the afternoon (15 h local) to a minimum of fraction of 0.7. Precipitation radar found strong drizzle with reflectivity above 40 dBZ.
Cloud base heights rise with longitude from 1.0 km at 75°W to 1.2 km at 85°W in the mean, but the slope varies from cruise to cruise. Cloud base-lifting condensation level (CB-LCL) displacement, a measure of decoupling, increases westward. At night CB-LCL is 0-200 m, and increases 400 m from dawn to 16 h local time, before collapsing in the evening.
Despite zonal gradients in boundary layer and cloud vertical structure, surface radiation and cloud radiative forcing are relatively uniform in longitude. When present, clouds reduce solar radiation by 160 W m−2 and radiate 70 W m−2 more downward longwave radiation than clear skies. Coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP3) simulations of the climate of the 20th century show 40±20 W m−2 too little net cloud radiative cooling at the surface. Simulated clouds have correct radiative forcing when present, but models have ~50% too few clouds.
===============================================================
Given this order of magnitude blunder on clouds, it seems like an opportune time to plug Dr. Spencer’s book where he pointed out the 1-2% cloud forcing issue. Click to review and/or buy at Amazon.

"Since the day Donald J. Trump began his presidential campaign, there were questions about how the Trump brand would be affected. Would his stream of insults hurt viewership of “The Apprentice” or sales of Ivanka Trump shoes? Or was all the attention good for business, a marketing adage President Trump could have learned during his time as a reality television star. The answer may surprise him. Major companies appear to be   their relationships with the Trump brand, which, in some instances, does not appear to have benefited from Mr. Trump’s presidency. Hinting at lackluster sales, Neiman Marcus confirmed on Friday that it had dropped Ivanka Trump’s jewelry line from its website. A day earlier, her brand had disappeared from Nordstrom. com, a move  reported by the fashion news site Racked. Not everyone was happy that retailers were distancing themselves from the Trump name. By Saturday, some Twitter users were posting #BoycottNordstrom. Companies also seem worried about how protests over the president’s actions, particularly his recent executive order on immigration, could hurt sales. On Friday, MillerCoors, a brewing company, contacted Shannon Coulter, a founder of GrabYourWallet. org, a campaign pushing for boycotts of Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and other businesses associated with the Trump name. “He wanted to talk about why they were on the list,” she said, adding, “I think all the companies are paying close attention. ” At a time when protests and boycotts can easily be organized online, brands face more pressure to respond to consumer demands. Chris Allieri, a marketing consultant with Mulberry  Astor, said, “Before he became president, I think that a lot of consumers were indifferent to the Trump brand. ” He added, “It’s going to be harder for people to ignore the connection. ” The MillerCoors name appeared on GrabYourWallet. org after Peter Coors, a board member of its parent company, Molson Coors, lent his name to a   for Mr. Trump in June. MillerCoors said it did not support candidates in presidential races but respected the rights of its workers to do so. “Boycotting our brands only harms   employees and their families and is counter to the positive progress that we should all be encouraging and delivering at a time when our nation seems so divided,” Marty Maloney, a spokesman, said. Mr. Trump and his daughter have stepped away from executive roles at the Trump Organization, which still earns money from golf courses, hotels and other properties around the world. (Ms. Trump has also stepped away as head of her brand.) Because Mr. Trump’s company is privately held, it is hard to know what impact his presidency has had on his businesses. But the merchandise side of the Trump licensing empire may be more vulnerable to negative attention. “Retailers around the country are going to say, do we need the aggravation or not,” said Wendy Liebmann, chief executive at WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting firm. “It’s hard to imagine that if a brand is really, really doing well, a retailer like a Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus would cut off their nose to spite their face. ” Rosemary K. Young, senior director of marketing for Ms. Trump’s brand, said in a statement that the company keep expanding and that it had “significant”    revenue growth in 2016. Representatives for Macy’s, which sells Ms. Trump’s clothing, handbags and shoes, did not respond to requests for comment. The retailer dropped Mr. Trump’s clothing line early in his campaign after he called Mexican immigrants “killers” and “rapists. ” Companies have also faced pressure to back away from “The Apprentice” franchise, of which Mr. Trump is an executive producer. Kawasaki said last month that it would pull its sponsorship, though the Japanese company seemed to backtrack somewhat within hours. Ms. Coulter said the Honest Company, whose products will appear in an episode of “The New Celebrity Apprentice,” had committed not to advertise for the rest of the season or next year. The brand confirmed that it had limited involvement with the show, which has not yet been renewed for 2018. In addition to possibly repelling some advertisers, Mr. Trump’s association with the show does not appear to have helped viewership much. On Thursday, he asked people  —   perhaps jokingly  —   to pray for the company’s ratings at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Mr. Allieri, who backed Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, said, “If you’re looking for a good opportunity to advertise, I would look beyond ‘The Apprentice,’ because there’s not going to be an upside. ” As the Trump name became politicized so have brands associated with it. Just days after #DeleteUber began trending on Twitter  —   a response to criticism that the   app had undercut protests of Mr. Trump’s immigration order  —   Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, resigned from a presidential economic advisory council. Nordstrom, which mainly sold Ivanka Trump shoes, said demand for Ms. Trump’s products had not been strong. The company still has some merchandise from previous orders that it plans to sell in stores. For the time being, the relationship appears to have ended. Neiman Marcus said it “continuously” assesses productivity to determine where its products are sold. Some jewelry will still be available in the stores. After apparel, Ms. Trump’s shoes account for the largest portion of her company’s revenue. Three years ago, the brand predicted that shoe sales would reach $35 million last year at wholesale, generating $2 million in royalty fees, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. Jewelry was predicted to reach $7. 5 million, or $300, 000 in fees. At the time, Ms. Trump seemed to be having more trouble with Mondani, which makes her handbags. “We think the handbags are terrible,” the documents said. “They don’t. ” A spokesman for Ms. Trump’s brand said, “We are fortunate to have dedicated and engaged partners on our handbags and all of our product categories. ” Representatives for Mondani did not respond to requests for comment."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere was a time when Germany’s power was mostly generated by the traditional sources of coal, nuclear, oil, natural gas and hydro. These sources were reliable and keeping the power grid under control was a routine matter. Germany’s power grid was among the most stable worldwide. But then came Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act, and with it the very volatile sources of sun and wind.
As a result, today’s German power grid has become a precarious balancing act, and keeping it from collapsing under the load of wild fluctuations has become a real challenge. At the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here, Dr. Klaus Peter Krause writes a piece titled: Always on the brink of a widespread blackouts, where he writes how and why Germany’s power grid has become extremely vulnerable:
Already 3500 emergency grid interventions per year – According to the TAB report of 2011: More than a couple days of blackout would be a national catastrophe – Germany sacrifices its uniquely reliable power supply for the ‘transition to renewable energy’.”
One example Krause cites is a recent incident at the Trimet aluminum plant in the industrial city of Essen:
In the last 12 months the German power grid barely averted a collapse twice by shutting down production. The Westfälische Rundschau (here) on 17 September quoted Trimet Chairman Martin Iffert: ‘We are prepared that something like that would happen as a consequence of the transition to renewable energy, however we were surprised that we had to slam on the brakes already two times.’ According to Iffert the power grid had been on the ‘brink of collapse’ shortly after a drop in wind energy.”
Krause writes that the frequency of emergency grid intervention by grid operators has skyrocketed since renewable energies started coming on line, see the chart here depicting the number of times emergency interventions in the German power grid have been taken each year. Before 2006 grid operators rarely had to take action to keep the grid stable. The number of interventions took off in 2008, and has since spiraled uncontrollably.
Krause writes:
Thus the power supply in Germany is no longer secure enough. It is even highly vulnerable. A blackout could occur on any given day. Up to now they have been successful at averting grid collapses by taking lightning speed action, but the number of emergencies has increased massively and is still rising.”
The instability of the German power grid was even confirmed by Jochen Homann, President of the Bundesnetzagentur, as quoted by German national daily FAZ on 25 June 2014:
Due to the shutdown of the nuclear power plants [in the wake of Fukushima] and the installation of renewable energy generation, the existing power grid is however under considerably more stress. The transmission network operators, who are responsible for the functioning grid operation, must intervene in the use of the grid far more often in order to ensure the stable operation of the grid.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Krause then explains that the power-consumer protection agency NAEB wrote in a recent member newsletter of volatile power, and how Germany had once acted as a pillar of stability for the overall European-wide power network. “This stability is being sacrificed for no urgent reason and irresponsibly for the sake of the transition to renewable energy, whereby the damage will impact even all of Europe.”
Just how serious the implications of Germany’s unstable power grid are is poignantly described by a German government-commissioned report (TAB, no. 17/5672) of 27 April 2011, where the chance of a massive blackout can no longer be excluded. The summary of the report writes:
Because of the complete proliferation of electrically powered devices in the living and working world, the consequences of a widespread and long-lasting power outage would accumulate to a level of damage of considerable quality. Impacted would be critical infrastructure, and a collapse of the entire society would hardly be preventable.“
Krause writes that just how precarious the situation has become is almost unknown to citizens, and so many are ill-prepared.
He adds that even a power outage of even several hours or a day would cause massive disruptions and paralyze the public transportation of persons and goods, stranding tens of thousands, and blocking fire and medical rescue services, especially in urban areas. Gas stations would be out of order and fuel would thus be lacking. And because of today’s just-in-time supply chains, food at supermarkets would disappear very quickly.
Granted, Krause writes, that the chances of a big blackout are small, but warns the chances are growing and becoming a real threat. “Because of the ‘increase in decentralized and stochiastic power feed-in’, the risk of a grid failure and higher outage rates in on the rise. Here wind and solar energy are meant“.
Moreover, experts say that the German power grid is more vulnerable than ever to storms, snow, ice, criminal activity, terrorism, or just plain human error. All the vulnerability is due to a recklessly applied disorganized renewable energy policy. Krause summarizes:
Germany, like all modern industrial countries is highly vulnerable to possible power outages. But with its energy policy, Germany’s leadership is increasing the risk, without any urgent reason, in a wanton irresponsible manner.”
Finally, Steffen Hentrich, of the Liberalen Institute of the Friedrich-Naumann Foundation for Liberty wrote one year ago (here):
It’s no longer a secret that the almost unbridled expansion of so-called renewable energies in the context of a technically and economically overloaded power grid will become a risk for the power supply stability in Germany, and increasingly for our European neighbors.”

"The twin goals of UK energy policy should be to ensure security of supply for households and businesses, and to ensure the electricity we use is affordable. Unfortunately, the current UK coalition government is failing on both fronts. In particular its flagship initiative, Electricity Market Reform, has led to a hiatus in energy investment. This is very bad news for England.  In effect we are now seeing a critical reduction in our spare energy capacity, which will eventually see electricity costs spiral out of control. For London this might well mean the lights going out post-2015.  As Scotland exports approximately one quarter of the electricity it generates, this is not such a problem for Edinburgh. In recent years this has been bolstered by a truly world class renewables industry.  Scotland now produces nearly the equivalent of 50% of its electricity from renewable energy sources such as onshore wind and hydro. This will increase to around 70% by 2017. I strongly reject Ed Davey’s announcement that if Scotland votes yes then Scottish electricity bills would increase. This can be seen in a comprehensive report that I published with colleagues from a number of universities from across the United Kingdom in December.   To summarise some very complex arguments, as a result of the coalition government’s decision to fund new nuclear build, we found that a Scottish government committed to no nuclear build would actually see reductions in consumer electricity bills compared to the rest of the United Kingdom. Scottish consumers would not be subsidising the hundreds of billions of pounds of investment that new English nuclear power stations require.   Already the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) spends £2.5 billion or 42% of its annual budget on existing nuclear legacy. Of that, £1.6bn is spent on managing the waste at Sellafield alone.  In its misguided aspirations the coalition government is now writing a blank cheque for new nuclear. At a time of unprecedented financial austerity this is somewhat astonishing. Under no scenario can I see electricity bills in an independent Scotland increasing along the lines outlined by Ed Davey. Even without an integrated electricity market, Scotland would be able to sell its electricity to England at commercial rates. England currently has to resource much of its electricity requirement from Scotland; there is no alternative source for the majority of it. It is pure fantasy on the part of Ed Davey to suggest otherwise. Scotland offers an excellent model of how to deliver a world-class energy policy. The coalition government could learn much from us. This piece is one of two that The Conversation has published on this subject today. The other can be be read here.  "
"PARIS  —   A man armed with two large knives and shouting “God is great” in Arabic lunged at a military patrol near an entrance to the Louvre on Friday, causing little harm, but rattling a city already on edge over terrorist attacks and casting another shadow over its international image. A soldier opened fire, hitting the attacker several times, but not before he slashed at one of the other soldiers, causing minor injuries. The Paris prosecutor, François Molins, said the attacker, who was 29 years old, was believed to be an Egyptian who arrived in France on Jan. 26 from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, on a visa he obtained last November. The intervention by soldiers from the 1er Régiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes, an airborne unit based in Pamiers, in southwestern France, “ended a terrorist attack and enabled the arrest of its perpetrator, who by all indications was very determined,” Mr. Molins said. The assault took place on a stairway leading down to the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall that lies between the subway station closest to the museum and one of the museum’s entrances. The attack was so close to the Louvre that it lit up social media networks. Within a couple hours of the assault, President Trump wrote on Twitter that the man was a “radical Islamic terrorist,” although the French authorities said it was too early to establish whether he had ties to any terrorist groups. Mr. Molins, who is known for sticking to the facts, refrained from saying anything about the man’s motivations, but said that his passport had two visas to Turkey, in 2015 and 2016, and that he also had a visa for Saudi Arabia. He had a residency document for the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Molins did not say where the man might have traveled in Turkey. Until recently, a stretch of the eastern Turkish border with Syria was highly porous, and many people slipped into territory held by the Islamic State in Syria’s northeast. The man was not known to the French security authorities, but he was identified through fingerprints and a photograph taken when he obtained his visa, Mr. Molins said. The suspect had rented an apartment for one week, paying about $1, 830, in a   neighborhood just four subway stops from the Louvre. Two days after arriving in Paris, he bought two     knives at an arms store in central Paris for about $730, according to the authorities. France has suffered more terrorist attacks and attempted attacks in recent years than any other country in Europe, and security officials believe that the country and especially its police and military forces, remain a target of choice for Islamic extremists. Some of those attacks involve knives and were carried out by people who say they were inspired by the example of the Islamic State even if they had never traveled to Syria or Iraq or sworn allegiance to the organization. Mr. Molins noted that Friday’s attack occurred exactly two years after a similar attack on soldiers in Nice. In just the past 13 months, there have been at least four attacks in France using knives, including one instance in which an   police officer and wife were stabbed to death by a man who then filmed himself claiming allegiance to the Islamic State, broadcasting the video on Facebook. In St.    a small town in Normandy, a    man slit the throat of an elderly priest as he was saying Mass last July. The young man and an accomplice, who were fatally shot by the police, had proclaimed allegiance to the Islamic State just before the murder. Then there were the shocking assaults that claimed many more lives. On July 14, a man driving a truck plowed into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in the southern city of Nice, killing 86 people. And on Nov. 13, 2015, three attacks carried out by 10 Islamic State terrorists in and around Paris took the lives of 130 people. Although the Louvre attack was swiftly contained and involved only one assailant, it was likely to add to the woes of the museum and the city, where the number of visitors declined significantly in 2016 because of successive terrorist attacks and attempted attacks. The number of visitors to the Louvre was down 15 percent from 2015, and the number of foreign visitors fell, notably from Russia, Japan, China and Brazil. Friday’s attack also coincided with the city’s final presentation of its bid for the 2024 Olympic Games, casting something of a pall over a day that Paris officials had hoped would not be associated with terrorism. Still, the quick response by the military was likely to ease criticism about the expense and efficacy of using soldiers alongside the police to fight terrorism. When terrorists carried out a massacre at the Bataclan concert hall during the November 2015 attacks, soldiers were nearby but were not under orders to act and were unable to aid the police, raising questions about their usefulness. While the situation on Friday was different  —   the soldiers were acting in    —   it was described repeatedly by politicians and senior government officials as a display of preparedness and “ . ” About 10, 000 soldiers are deployed throughout France, with 3, 500 in the Paris region alone. Many people were also impressed by the calm efficiency displayed by the staffs of both the museum and the Carrousel du Louvre. The museum had several rooms designated as secure places, and guards escorted visitors to those areas. Bastien Lopez, 21, an intern at the museum, said he was at work when “all of a sudden we saw a huge flow of people coming in the museum, and the people in charge of the security shut down the three main access doors. ” “Then they asked us to follow an itinerary that led us into a specific room,” he said, “where we stayed confined for two hours and a half. ” He stayed in one of the rooms of the department of Islamic art, in the museum’s basement, with a few hundred people. “It wasn’t a rush: Everything went very smoothly,” Mr. Lopez added. “We were not piled up we could all sit on the floor. Some people took a nap. ” “The tourists reacted super well. The security persons were given instructions that we translated in English and in Chinese. ” Thomas, a    who declined to give his surname, said he was doing maintenance work on electronic screens in the underground mall when he heard gunfire nearby. He suspected an attack, yet his first reaction was not fear, but a “survival instinct,” fueled by a “surge of adrenaline,” he recalled as he stood near a police cordon a few hours later. “I followed the protocol, which was to leave through the emergency exits, since we were in one of the stores,” he said. “I evacuated, and I took two people with me. ”"
"**The rapper and outspoken advocate for the LGBT community Kevin Fret has been shot dead in Puerto Rico aged 24.**
The musician, described as Latin Trap music's first openly gay artist, was killed in the capital San Juan on Thursday morning, police said.
Fret was shot at eight times while riding a motorbike in the street, and he was hit in the head and hip.
His death brings the number of murders in Puerto Rico this year to 22, police added.
Confirming his death, Fret's manager Eduardo Rodriguez said: ""There are no words that describe the feeling we have and the pain that causes us to know that a person with so many dreams has to go.
""We must all unite in these difficult times, and ask for much peace for our beloved Puerto Rico.""
Fret was out in the Santurce neighbourhood of San Juan at 5:30 local time (9:30 GMT) on Thursday when he was fatally shot.
He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead.
Police are now searching for another man on a motorcycle who was with Fret when he was found, but quickly fled the scene.
There is no immediate indication of a motive, and an investigation is under way.
Puerto Rico has seen a rise in street crime in recent weeks, which has been described by police on the Caribbean island as a ""crisis of violence"".
The Puerto Rican was a rising trap artist in the Latin trap scene, and his debut music video, Soy Asi (I'm Like This), has more than half a million views on YouTube.
Mr Rodriguez described the rapper as ""an artistic soul"" who had a passion for music. ""He still had a lot left to do.""
""I'm a person that doesn't care what anybody has to say,"" Fret told online magazine Paper last year.
""[Now I see] young gay guys or young lesbians that are looking at me now like a role model, like wow, if he did it, and he don't care what anybody else has to say, I can do it.""
However, Fret's rise to prominence was not without turbulence - while living in Miami last year, he was charged with battery after a fight, media reported.
He said he had been attacked because of his sexuality, and threw a metal bottle at the man.
Fret has also responded strongly to homophobic threats in the lyrics of a rival musician, making some of his supporters wonder whether his murder was motivated by hate.
Trap is a style of Southern hip hop, popularised in the late 90s and early 00s. It is characterised by its use of multilayered energetic and hard-hitting sounds, and overall dark atmosphere.
The word ""trap"" refers to where drug deals happen, and the lyrics, which are both sung and rapped, often reflect the poverty, violence and street life that artists have faced.
The Latin variant of the genre gained popularity in the Caribbean in the 2010s, and is typically sung in Spanish.
It mixes American trap, rhythm and blues and local sounds like Puerto Rican reggaeton.
Well-known Latin trap rappers like Bad Bunny, Messiah and Ozuna have collaborated with mainstream hip hop artists like Drake and Cardi B."

For years, skeptical Cassandras have warned that climate alarmism is a Trojan horse for a globalist wealth redistribution agenda. They’ve been sneered at by the great and good of the media-elite as right-wing paranoids. Paranoia is justified, though, when they really **are** out to get you (or your money, at least).



 **Especially when they’re straight-up telling us so.**



In Brussels (naturally) in 2015, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change, openly admitted that the UN’s focus was not ecological, but economic. “We are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution.” Although she didn’t explicitly name it, what economic model has reigned “for at least 150 years”? **Capitalism.**



Neither is the IMF shying away from stating their goal of global wealth redistribution.



According to the four authors, what we need is a global carbon tax. And not just a little carbon tax. For Australia — but bear in mind the report is not about Australia, despite some local reporting — a carbon tax of $US75 a tonne will be required, which at today’s exchange rate is $110. The report notes that the average carbon tax today is $US2.



The Gillard government’s carbon tax was just $US17. In its brief, unlamented time, it wreaked economic (and in Tasmania, environmental) havoc. **The IMF wants to impose a carbon tax three times as high.**



You can see this being a hit. Retail electricity prices would rise by between 70 per cent and 90 per cent from their already extremely high levels. And the price of petrol would increase by an estimated 10c a litre, although that sounds like a significant underestimate.



According to the IMF, countries such as China, which has no commitment to reduce emissions until after 2030, will need to impose a carbon tax of only $US25 ­because it’s a developing nation. We have heard that one before.



So, China, the world’s single biggest polluter, with one of the world’s highest GDPs, nuclear weapons and a space program, is a “developing” nation and thus entitled to lenient treatment? Could they make it any more blatant that this has nothing to do with reducing carbon dioxide emissions?



The IMF authors think voters won’t have a problem with a global carbon tax because governments will have all that new revenue to play with. “Options ­include cutting other kinds of taxes, supporting vulnerable households and communities, ­increasing investment in green energy, or simply returning the money to people as a dividend.”



Or what about this for a catchy idea? “Governments could compensate only the poorest 40 per cent of households — an approach that would leave three-quarters of the revenues for additional investment in green energy, innovation or to fund the Sustainable Development Goals”.



In other words, shift the world’s wealth away from the rich West.



As is the UN’s wont, this is bloviating, wannabe-socialist nonsense. But because it bears the imprimatur of a globalist institution, the sheep of the media-elite will bleat it out as holy writ. Just as they do the IPCC’s (”The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert” as Donna Laframboise puts it), summaries for policy makers, blatant political manifestos disguised as scientific reports.



The problem with these political, substandard reports is that they will be endlessly quoted — not so much for their contents but for their sheer release.



One only need look at the calibre of “expert” these globalist institutions are run by.



I also have been groaning over a study released by Harvard University’s Centre for International Development. Run by a former planning minister of the Venezuelan government…



Just like Qatar, Nigeria, Iraq and Afghanistan sitting on the UN Human Rights Council.

"BEIJING  —   President Trump may not be known for his diplomacy, but someone in his family appears to be picking up the slack. That would be Arabella, his    granddaughter. A video of her singing “Happy New Year” in Chinese has gone viral on social media in China. Arabella has been taking Chinese lessons. Arabella’s mother, Ivanka Trump, posted the song on her Instagram account on Thursday. “Arabella singing a song she learned for #ChineseNewYear. Wishing everyone an amazing year to come during these days of celebration,” Ms. Trump wrote on her account. Arabella appeared in a black cardigan with ornate pockets and skinny black pants, and she played with a Chinese marionette as she sang. On Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, more than 60, 000 people said they liked Arabella’s song. Some of them said they much preferred her to Mr. Trump, who has stirred the   relationship over Taiwan and the South China Sea, among other things. “The granddaughter is much more sensible,” said one. Another Weibo user noted, “Her Mandarin is perfect. ” Some people were more critical: “So you want to get the Chinese off your back with just this song?” However, this was not Arabella’s first diplomatic coup this week. On Wednesday evening, she and her mother turned up at a New Year’s reception at the Chinese Embassy in Washington. A beaming Chinese ambassador, Cui Tiankai, escorted the pair around the party, as Arabella, decked out in red dress with a big bow at her neck, played with Chinese traditional arts that were on display. China’s official broadcaster, CCTV, showed the    team at the reception on its   news broadcast on Thursday. The usually stern   newspaper Global Times almost gushed. “Her appearance at the Chinese Embassy, endowed with a certain political and diplomatic significance, could be invigorating to the  . S. relationship,” the paper said of Ms. Trump’s embassy visit, with Arabella in tow."
"**Puerto Rico has suffered an island-wide power outage nearly seven months after Hurricane Maria destroyed much of the island's infrastructure and power grid.**
The US territory's power authority, known as Prepa, said it was working to restore service to almost 3.4 million people within 24 to 36 hours.
Prepa said an excavator operated by a contractor in the southern region of the island caused the blackout.
It is the latest and largest disruption to hit the island's recovery efforts.
A Prepa spokesperson said it was prioritising returning power to hospitals, San Juan's airport, water pumping systems and financial systems.
The power authority, which has been in bankruptcy since last July, has struggled to stay out of the headlines since the island was hit in September by the worst storm in 90 years.
Residents have suffered multiple blackouts since Category 4 Maria, and 40,000 people were still without power at the time of Wednesday's blackout.
""Seven months after Maria, we are back where Maria left us,"" Cynthia Garcia Coll, a professor at Carlos Albizu University in San Juan, told CNN.
The US territory's first island-wide outage comes less than a week after a fallen tree knocked out service to 870,000 customers.
Hurricane Maria caused the largest blackout in US history, according to research consultancy the Rhodium Group."
"A majority of Australians surveyed in the latest Guardian Essential poll believe it is likely there will be a second wave of Covid-19 infections as a consequence of restrictions being eased, with only 13% of the sample dismissing that probability. With the rates of infection increasing around the world, and with Victoria now battling a new outbreak of infections and an uptick in community transmission, 63% of the sample of 1,079 respondents believe a second wave in Australia is either very or quite likely. Women were more likely than men to fear that prospect, and voters over the age of 34 were more likely to hold that view than younger voters.  Public health measures are now beginning to ease in most states, but Australians remain unconvinced that life will return to normal any time soon. More than 60% of the sample believe that international travel will take between one and two years, or possibly more than two years, to return without restrictions. Expectations about unemployment are similarly low, with 70% of the sample believing it will take between one and two years or longer for the joblessness rate to return to where it was before the pandemic hit, and more than 60% believing the negative impact on the housing market will be prolonged. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported last week that Australia lost a further 227,000 jobs between April and May, resulting in a total loss of 835,000 jobs in seasonally adjusted terms since March, and a 0.7% jump in unemployment to 7.1%. A spike in Covid-19 cases has prompted Daniel Andrews to extend the state of emergency in Victoria for at least four more weeks and intensify enforcement of the social distancing rules. After recording another 19 cases on Sunday, taking to 116 the number of new cases in the state over the past week, Victoria recorded 16 new cases of coronavirus on Monday. Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, was asked by reporters on Monday whether or not the current Victorian outbreak constituted a second wave of infections given the number of active cases in the state was the highest in two months. He said there was “no official definition”. “It’s a concept where the outbreak is such that you don’t think the public health measures can easily control it in the short term,” Murphy said. He said “at the moment, I have great confidence in the Victorian response”. Scott Morrison says governments were prepared for an increase in infections during the easing, and Australia has the public health infrastructure in place to manage outbreaks. The prime minister said it was understandable that the Andrews government would pause the easing of restrictions to help manage localised outbreaks, but he said governments needed to push on with opening the economy back up. More than 60% of voters surveyed this week believe a vaccine will be developed to combat the virus over the next few years, and 58% say they think the population will build up resistance to the illness by being exposed to it over the same time frame. Australians are divided about whether they feel positive or negative about the outlook over the next 12 months, with 45% of the sample saying they are very or somewhat positive and 33% of the group feeling very or somewhat negative. Some of the sample (20%) report feeling more connected to their community than before the pandemic, with 18% feeling less connected and 62% saying it has made no difference. Voters were asked about whether their attitudes to climate change had shifted over the past 12 months, which includes the period of catastrophic summer bushfires, with just under half the sample (46%) saying they were no more or less concerned than previously and a similar group (42%) reporting they were more concerned. But community concern has come off a peak recorded last November. In November 2019, 60% of the sample thought Australia was not doing enough, and that’s come down to 52%. Similarly, only 22% of the sample thought Australia was doing enough last November and that’s crept up to 25%. The margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 3%."
"**US sportswear giant Nike is withdrawing a new version of its classic Air Force 1 shoe after objections from an indigenous group in Panama.**
The limited edition model was described as a tribute to Puerto Rico but the Guna community of Panama said it used their traditional ""mola"" pattern.
The group accused Nike of ""pirating"" a protected traditional design.
Nike has apologised for the ""inaccurate representation"" of the shoe and said it would not be made available.
The Air Force 1 Low ""Puerto Rico"" model was due to have been launched in June.
The Guna people, known as Kuna until 2011, live mainly in low-lying Caribbean islands that make up the Guna Yala autonomous region and are one of seven indigenous groups in Panama. Environmentalists say they are under threat from rising sea levels caused by global warming.
Their traditional mola patterns feature colourful, swirling designs and geometric or figurative drawings to represent the Guna people's world view.
A lawyer for the group said on Tuesday they were not just seeking the shoe's withdrawal, but also compensation.
""There is already damage to our image, to our design, to our mola. We are not going to wait for it to be thrown away, we have to seek compensation,"" Aresio Valiente told a news conference in Panama City.
Traditional Guna leader Belisario LÃ³pez said in a statement that they were not against the mola being commercialised but were angered that it was ""being done without consulting us first"".
""They must recognise that the mola that appears on the Nike shoes is from the Guna people,"" he said.
Some supporters of the Guna also took to social media to criticise Nike's decision.
A statement from Nike said: ""We apologise for the inaccurate representation of the design origin for the Nike Air Force 1 'Puerto Rico' 2019. As a result, this product will no longer be available.""
Industry sources said the launch of the shoe had been designed to coincide with the Puerto Rican Day Parade on 9 June."
"**The last time a major tsunami hit the Caribbean region was in 1946, after an 8.1-magnitude earthquake struck the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola.**
At Playa RincÃ³n, the sea rushed 700m (2,300ft) inland, according to a man who clung to the top of an almond tree to survive. Waves were 5m high in places and 1,600 people died across the north-east coast. Small tsunami waves were also recorded in Puerto Rico, Bermuda and even New Jersey.
Since then, a handful of tsunamis have occurred - in Panama and Costa Rica in 1991 after an earthquake, and in Montserrat in 1997 after a landslide of volcanic debris. After the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, sub-sea landslides generated waves that killed three people.
Over the same period, populations have more than doubled and tourist numbers on Caribbean beaches have soared, passing 30 million in 2017. In most places, infrastructure is concentrated in coastal areas.
Experts warn that the region runs the risk of complacency over the tsunami threat.
""The potential for tsunamis is significant and has to be taken seriously,"" says Christa von Hillebrandt-Andrade, who oversees the Puerto Rico-based Caribbean Tsunami Warning Program under the US National Weather Service.
""Within the Caribbean and bordering the Caribbean, there are major fault structures and also volcanoes that could generate a tsunami at any time.""
Key areas are along the north-eastern and eastern boundaries of the Caribbean where the North American and South American plates interact with the Caribbean plate.
These boundaries include areas of subduction (where one plate is forced under another, as in the Indian Ocean in 2004) and strike-slip motion (where plates are side by side, like the San Andreas fault).
One area to watch is the subduction zone east of the Lesser Antilles, says Dr Robert Muir-Wood, chief research officer at RMS catastrophe risk modelling consultancy and the author of a 2015 report on mega-tsunamis. ""We strongly suspect this area is potentially prone to these really large earthquakes, which would be associated with a major regional tsunami.""
Another series of faults lie north of Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and includes the 8,400m-deep Puerto Rico Trench. While this area is not a straightforward subduction zone and there has not been a really significant earthquake along this boundary, there is evidence of massive submarine landslides into the trench and historical reports of local tsunamis, says Dr Muir-Wood.
Big earthquakes have also occurred off the Caribbean coast of Central America and Venezuela.
""The Caribbean is clearly a place where both [regional and local] types of tsunamis can be anticipated, and the key is that simply because an event hasn't happened in the last 300 years of history doesn't mean it can't happen,"" says Dr Muir-Wood.
Before 2004, Ms von Hillebrandt-Andrade says tsunami warning systems in the Caribbean were ""basically non-existent"". But the Indian Ocean disaster sparked action and a regional body on tsunami risk was established under Unesco in 2005.
Significant work has been done to increase the data flow to the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC), which provides alerts to the region.
""Every single country has opened up its seismic data and that has been absolutely critical,"" says Ms von Hillebrandt-Andrade.
Today there are 80 sea-level stations and 125 seismic stations sending information, up from five and 10 respectively in 2004. ""That has permitted us to reduce our lead time - the time it takes to issue the initial [tsunami warning] product - from 10-15 minutes to under 5 minutes.""
Once PTWC has issued an advisory, responsibility for local alerts devolves to national governments. At this level, Ms von Hillebrandt-Andrade says, capabilities ""vary greatly throughout the region"".
Some places, like Puerto Rico, have well-established protocols. Other places are less practised.
In January, when PTWC issued its first international tsunami threat message to the region after a 7.6 earthquake off Honduras, governments in the Cayman Islands and Jamaica, for example, faced questions over their response.
Some governments ""had a little bit more difficulty deciding what product they should issue, if they should issue a product, if there really was a real threat"", says Ms von Hillebrandt-Andrade. ""Strengths and weaknesses were identified.""
One early aim of the regional body was to establish a centre like PTWC in the Caribbean, but that has been sidelined in favour of improving education. Local tsunamis can potentially reach shore before an alert, and lives can be saved if residents know to seek high ground.
Central to this educational push is the annual tsunami exercise, Caribe Wave, and the Tsunami Ready programme, now adopted by Unesco, which sets out guidelines for communities to meet. So far Puerto Rico, Anguilla, St Kitts & Nevis and the Virgin Islands are certified as Tsunami Ready, while pilot projects have taken place in Haiti and Grenada.
In Grenada the area chosen was St Patrick's Parish, 8km (5 miles) south of rumbling submarine volcano Kick 'Em Jenny. Educational billboards, evacuation maps and signs have been posted and an awareness programme carried out.
""We had to get down on the ground and interact with all of the community groups, we worked with the churches, the schools, the fisherfolk, the farmers,"" says Senator Winston Garraway, minister of state with oversight of disaster management and information. ""From the senior people to the children, they have the information now and they know exactly what has to be done.""
The government wants the whole island to be Tsunami Ready by 2020, starting with a southern parish potentially vulnerable to a tsunami generated off Venezuela. Mr Garraway also wants to establish a nationwide siren system to complement alerts disseminated via radio and TV.
But resourcing is a major problem for small island nations like Grenada, which must also address twin challenges of hurricanes and the impact of climate change. ""Most of what we have to do, we do not have the ready resources,"" says Mr Garraway. ""Grant funding is extremely important for us at this time.""
Regionally, work remains to be done. Scientists still do not have the data needed to accurately size very large earthquakes and their type of movement quickly. Tsunami protocols for cruise ships are needed. Better understanding of bathymetry (water depth and shore height) would enable better scenario modelling, but some nations do not have that information.
""Every single country and territory in the region has room for improvement,"" says Ms von Hillebrandt-Andrade.
""Tsunamis don't occur that frequently, so it's very easy to become desensitised. But the reality is that a tsunami could kill many more people than any hurricane could."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs part of its Terra-X series, ZDF German television presented a two-part documentary on January 11  and 18 on climate and human history. Rather than pushing senseless alarmism, the ZDF series did an excellent job looking at the powerful natural factors that drive climate, and how they can do so abruptly.
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne.

In Part 1 “Climate makes history“, the documentary looks at how abrupt climate changes indeed occurred in the past and how they had profound impacts on the development of our civilization, thus dumping cold water on the naïve notion that climate used to be more or less steady before humans began industrialization. Part 1 looks at the period of the last ice age and through the events leading up to the Roman Empire 2000 years ago.
Part 1 begins by telling us that extreme cold, heat and prolonged droughts are nothing new and that life comes and goes with the sudden changes in climate. More than once did very early man face extinction, “especially during the last ice age,” says the documentary. It wasn’t until the world’s climate warmed up during the Holocene that the human species truly prospered.
At the 3.30 mark we see a planet deep into an ice age, with northern Europe covered in ice and sea level over 100 meters below today’s levels. The species best suited to take the cold during this period was the meat-eating Neanderthal.
At the 6:20 mark the documentary points out that the climate changes dramatically, and that the main driver of the ice ages is the sun, principally the Milankovitch cycles. But also the ocean currents play an important.
At the 8:00 mark the documentary explains how the history of the climate could be reconstructed from sediment cores. These cores, the documentary shows, tells us that there were extreme temperature changes some 60,000 years ago. According to Prof. Frank Sirocko of the University of Mainz at the 9:40 mark:
We see that there were very rapid changes in climate. The warm phases and the cold phases changed abruptly, and in just 10 years, it jumps here.”
At the 10:22 mark Sirocko continues:
At this time the Neanderthals lived in a forest type vegetation. And in 10 years they found themselves in the middle of open steppes and the wild animals they were accustomed to hunting were no longer there. Such extreme climate changes in just 10 years were a real challenge for their hunting-oriented society.”
As the Neanderthals migrated, they soon clashed with homo sapiens, who eventually emerged victorious with the last Neanderthal disappearing 24,000 years ago.
Some 17,000 years ago, the earth’s position relative to the sun led to a thawing, with warm and moist conditions taking hold, allowing civilization to eventually prosper, especially though the development of agriculture, which allowed humans to specialize. Ten thousand years ago the city of Jericho was founded (18:45).
But at about this time, a major catastrophic event was developing in North America. A huge sea on the continent created by melting ice sheets broke through a barrier of ice and flowed like a tidal wave into the Atlantic at about 6200 BC (19:35)…(see graphic at 20:05 mark). This event disrupted the North Atlantic current and caused yet again another major climate disruption. Europe plunged into any icy phase and the Middle East cooled and entered a protracted period of drought – causing Middle Eastern and North African societies to collapse and unleashing a wave of “climate refugees” to Europe and Asia.
At the 22:00 mark, ZDF makes the misleading claim that sea level rose by 120 meters as a result of this event, when in fact most of that rise had already taken place from about 18,000 BC to 8,000 BC, and not all at once around 6200 BC. Moreover Noah’s Ark was built because of rains lasting “40 days and 40 nights”, and not because of the sudden sea level rise. At the 23:30 mark the documentary shows the uncovering of ancient cities that today are located underwater.

At the 24.30 mark we see that at about 6000 BC the Sahara was green and human life flourished, as evidenced by paintings uncovered by archeologists. The Sahara, the documentary says, was a savannah rich with wildlife. At the 26:45 mark British scientist Mark Maslin tells that they found archeological finds throughout the Sahara indicating a green, life-rich Sahara.
All of that came to an end, however, because of “sudden” natural climate change about 7000 years ago – caused by a tilting back of the earth, the documentary says. At the 28:00 mark archeologists studying human remains dated the green Sahara downfall at 3500 BC. Drought and expanding deserts were not restricted to the Sahara, but they also expanded across the globe, the documentary tells us at the 28:40 mark (see yellow areas on the graphic at the 28:57 mark)…The documentary says it was “caused by a slight shift in the earth’s axis”. As a result once again history witnessed huge exoduses of “climate refugees”, especially to the Nile River region, where the technology of irrigation was eventually developed (30:30) and the great Egyptian civilization was born. Not only Egypt prospered during the Bronze Age (3000 – 2000 BC), but so did many other civilizations (33:40 mark).
By now the global warming skeptic viewer begins to sense where the ZDF is leading: “Minor changes can have huge impacts”.
So prosperous were the warm times of the Bronze Age that many societies worshipped the sun (34:45).
But the prosperity of the Bronze Age also crashed at about 1200 BC (35:25) as marauding armies pillaged and plundered wave after wave. What was the cause of the Bronze Age collapse and all the war? At the 36:15 mark the documentary looks at some scientific theories, showing that it may have all been sparked by a climate change. Clues are found in caves in Turkey (37:00). German researcher Dominik Fleitmann examines stalactites for clues telling us about the climate of the past, at the time of the Bronze Age.
Indeed an examination of a stalagmite shows that the Bronze Age coincided with a period of severe drought at 1200 BC. At this time the stalactite shows a significant reduced growth rate due to a lack of water (38:45). The documentary concludes:
That means that at 1200 BC, there was no longer any heavy precipitation in the Mediterranean region. A period of drought took hold over the entire region.”
Fleitmann summarizes: “All indication point out that it was dry and cold. A recipe for a disaster.” Massive climate change over to cold and dry conditions caused mass migration and destabilized the surrounding civilizations the documentary then explains.
At 40:39
Likely a climate anomaly was to blame. The world’s climate reached the coldest temperature since the end of the ice age. Precipitation dropped off massively.”
The cold period after the Bronze Age persisted for hundreds of years. The documentary tells how the cold eventually dissipated at about 350 BC, giving way to warm temperatures and more precipitation (41:00) and thus transforming the Middle East and North Africa into “a paradise of crops” – all culminating with the Roman Empire, which ZDF erroneously characterizes as a society where “every citizen enjoyed the same rights” when in fact half of Rome’s population were slaves.
But the ZDF got the last sentence of Part 1 right on why the Roman Empire prospered: “The climate was optimal“. It was warm – even warmer than today.
Overall Part 1 of this ZDF documentary is outstanding and should be presented in English. A rare hats off to the German ZDF television for this effort.
I’ll write something up about Part 2 tomorrow, which I surmise will be about the last 2000 years until today. We’ll see if Mann’s hockey stick gets confirmed or not.

Thank the Lord the ‘agricultural sector’ has been ‘taken out of play’ (it hasn’t) over the dopey [zero-carbon bill](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/audio-a-climate-denier-on-climate-misinformation/). It’s just a weasel political ploy, but it now means National must grow some and oppose this idiot legislation on the grounds for which it should be opposed: because it’s **economic sabotage.**



It’s for greens, dopes, mystics, the truly naive and dreamers (all the same thing), to pray to the great god known as plant-food and beg her not to change the weather or send seas crashing over our verandahs; it’s for grown-ups to say ‘settle down – draining our bank accounts will not drain the ocean’.



We simply do not have the extra quarter-trillion (yes, that’s right) dollars the dimwits want to deprive us of by 2050 to get to carbon-zero. Self-flagellation and world-ending doom-spruiking have always been the preserve of lunatics and lefties; and they’re welcome to it, but not to force their self-deprivation on the rest of us. Get off the grass, you bozos.



I think I despise the coalition (to paraphrase a personality often cited here). Come on National – this is your time to stand with the practicals and pragmatics, not with the numpties. Oppose this bill!

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
IPCC: On Friday, the IPCC released its Summary for Policymakers. The report was not yet complete, it referenced graphs that were not presented and will have to be inserted. Therefore, a side-by-side comparison of the NIPCC and the IPCC reports is premature. However, there are some disturbing omissions. As Roy Spencer points out, estimates of the sensitivity of the climate to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are missing. Yet, this is the entire political issue. Is the climate sensitive to human emissions of CO2 or not? Does an increase in the molecules of CO2 from 3 to 4 per 10,000 parts of air make a difference in climate?

Further, the report glosses over the fact that there has been no statistically significant rise in surface temperatures for over 16 years. Instead, it asserts a greater certainty in its work than prior reports. It reduced the uncertainty from 10% to 5%, with no empirical basis.
Richard Lindzen writes “The latest IPCC report has truly sunk to level of hilarious incoherence — It is quite amazing to see the contortions the IPCC has to go through in order to keep the international climate agenda going.”
Prior to issuance of the approved report, Steve McIntyre presented an overview on how the IPCC put itself in a mess, rather than properly addressing the hiatus in warming and the associated discrepancy between model projections and observations. He writes: “One cannot help but wonder whether WG1 [the physical science section] Chair Thomas Stocker might not have served the policy community better by spending more time ensuring that the discrepancy between models and observations was properly addressed in the IPCC draft reports, perhaps even highlighting research problems while there was time in the process, than figuring out how IPCC could evade FOI [Freedom of Information] requests.
The purpose of a physical science is to describe nature, and to understand how it works. It is becoming increasingly evident that IPCC science does not describe nature. Yet, the IPCC intensifies its certainty in its work? For these and other comments see Climategate Continued, IPCC Report, and http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/uploads/WGIAR5-SPM_Approved27Sep2013.pdf
*************
NIPCC: The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) was established analyze peer reviewed research on climate change and report the findings as objectively as possible. The latest reports, Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science and the Summary for Policymakers are available on the web and the full Physical Science report being printed. They are formatted to match as closely as possible the formatting of the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to allow policymakers to make side-by-side comparisons of the reports.
One of the great shortcomings of the IPCC is that it was not set-up to evaluate all the influences on climate, both natural and human. Instead, it was set-up to evaluate only the human influences. This shortcoming should be emphasized in the IPCC reports. However, it is often glossed over.
Often, when exploring business opportunities or new products, private corporations will form two research teams to pursue alternative approaches, say the green team and the red team. The corporations will staff both teams with highly qualified people and give both equal levels of funding. One can think of the IPCC as the green team and the NIPCC as the red team. However, funding levels are vastly different. According to published reports by the US government, the total Federal funding of climate change activities is greater than $150 Billion since Fiscal Year 1993. The small funding of NIPCC is from private contributors who have no influence on the product. The NIPCC reports can be found at: http://climatechangereconsidered.org/
*************
Support EPA? Although a side-by-side comparison of the two summaries will be presented later, one can examine how the two reports support the EPA’s finding that human greenhouse gas emissions, principally CO2, endanger public health and welfare. When announcing its finding on December 7, 2009, the EPA stated that the finding was based on three lines of scientific evidence, which followed the 2007 IPCC report and US government reports:
1. There is a distinct human fingerprint, “hot spot,” of a pronounced warming trend centered about 10 km (33,000 feet) above the tropics. EPA claims this to be the physical evidence that supports the theory than CO2 emissions are causing significant global warming.
2. Indirect evidence – the late 20th century warming was unusual – unprecedented and dangerous.
3. Climate models are reliable for policy analysis. All these models forecast significant future warming.
Based on the EPA’s finding, government agencies have undertaken calculating the future social costs of carbon dioxide emissions, are attempting to control land use by claiming future floods and dramatic sea level rise, and the EPA announced drastic measures for controlling construction of new power plants, which will effectively prohibit the construction of coal-fired power plants without very expensive, untested technology. Thus, it is important to investigate how solid is the EPA science in light of new, comprehensive, scientific reports on climate change.
1. Hot Spot:
IPCC: The IPCC summary does not discuss the “hot spot”, though it discusses atmospheric temperatures. This is a sharp departure from the 2007 report that discussed the hot spot.
NIPCC: The NIPCC summary specifically rejects the “hot spot” because no one can find it. “Observations from both weather balloon radiosonders and satellite MSU sensors show the opposite, with either flat or decreasing warming trends with increasing height in the atmosphere.” (p.7)
2. 20th Century Warming Was Unusual:
IPCC: The last 30 years is “likely to be the warmest 30-year period in Northern Hemisphere in 1400 years (medium confidence) (SPM-3). However, it also states: “Continental-scale surface temperature reconstructions show, with high confidence, multidecadal periods during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (year 950 to 1250) that were in some regions as warm as in the late 20th century. These regional warm periods did not occur as coherently across regions as the warming in the late 20th century (high confidence). {5.5} (SPM-4)” [The late 20th century global warming was not that unusual and largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere.]
NIPCC: “The glaciological and recent geological records contain numerous examples of ancient temperatures up to 3ºC [about 6ºF], or more, warmer than the peak reported at the end of the twentieth century.” (p.8)
3. Climate Models Are Reliable:
IPCC: “The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend (very high confidence). There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years (e.g., 1998 to 2012). {9.4, Box 9.2}” (SPM-10)
NIPCC: “Climate models project an atmospheric warming of at least 0.3 ºC over the past 15 years; in fact, temperature stasis or slight cooling has occurred.” (p.9)
“We conclude that current generation of GCMs [Global Climate Models] are unable to make accurate projections of climate even 10 years ahead, let alone the 100 year period that has been adopted by policy planners. The output of such models should therefore not be used to guide public policy formulation until they have been validated and shown to have predictive value.” (p.7) [boldface in original]
Conclusion:
The IPCC Summary fails to support the critical physical evidence the EPA claimed. It weakly supports the other two lines of evidence, ignoring the fact that surface temperatures have not increased in 16 years. The NIPCC Summary rejects all three lines of evidence the EPA offered.
It is sufficient to say that the EPA endangerment finding was premature, at best. At worst, it is completely wrong. The links to the two reports are provide above.
*************
MET Model: Independent scientist Nicolas Lewis and Andrew Montford are questioning a possible strong bias in the global climate model use by the UK MET Office. As described by the IPCC, in the climate models the warming influence of CO2 is off-set, in part, by aerosols, minute particles in the atmosphere, such as sulfur dioxide. Among other things, aerosols promote the formation of clouds. Climate alarmists claim that the failure of the atmosphere to warm with increasing CO2 is due to increases in aerosols. Thus, high climate sensitivity to CO2 is offset by high climate sensitivity to aerosols.
Nicolas Lewis examined the procedures used in running the MET models and concluded that the process does not permit the possibility of a low climate sensitivity to both CO2 and aerosols. The MET office has been alerted about the issue and is under review. If correct, then MET model and procedure have a significant built-in warming bias, which may apply to other climate models as well. Certainly, when comparing runs to observations for the tropics, the climate models greatly overestimate the warming. Please see links under Model Issues
*************
EPA: In Forbes, Larry Bell discusses the recent testimony of EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy before the US House Energy Committee. Repeatedly, she was asked about the 26 objective indicators EPA has on its web site for tracking climate change and how the new regulations on new coal-fired will affect these indicators. She evaded the questions and did not identify any discernible health and welfare benefits from the new regulations. Bell concludes: “the apparent goal of the EPA’s current and proposed greenhouse gas regulations is to persuade the international community, particularly China, India, and other developing nations, to follow the Obama administration’s U.S. leadership over an economic precipice.” See link under EPA and other Regulators on the March
*************
Secret Science: In Forbes, Geoffrey Kabat discusses EPA’s evasion of a House committee subpoena to produce data justifying EPA regulation of minute air particles (PM2.5, 2.5 micrometers). These regulations are based on two studies, the Harvard Six Cities Study (HSCS) and the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS II). Citing confidentiality, and other reasons, the EPA has refused to publish or allow public review of these studies. A separate study by Stanley Young and Jesse Xia of the National Institute for Statistical Sciences calls into question the validity of the two secret studies. There is no justification for basing regulations on secret studies, but such is science at the EPA. See links under EPA and other Regulators on the March
*************
Fred Singer: Although he is traveling in Europe promoting the new NIPCC report, two articles appeared featuring SEPP Chairman S. Fred Singer. One is by him on Washington’s war on coal and the absurdity it involves. The second is an interview of him by Larry Bell on simplistic notions behind the claims of unprecedented sea level rise. See Articles # 1 and #2.
*************
Heat Engine: Five-time IPCC expert reviewer has a basic tutorial on the climate system as a heat engine. Energy input is mainly short wave radiation from the sun. Energy output is mainly long wave radiation from every surface on the earth and from every level in the atmosphere, including clouds and aerosols. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy.
*************
Number of the Week: 0.065ºC. In an amusing display of mathematics, Luboš Motl calculates that if the atmospheric warming is hiding in the ocean in the layer between 0 to 2000 meters (0-6560 feet), then it would have increased temperatures by 0.065ºC (0.12 ºF) since the 1960s. He reports that the Argo web site has an estimate of 0.06 ºC since the 1960s, assuming the instruments can measure that precisely.
Commenting on the calculations, Judith Curry asks: “So, can anyone figure out why 0.06C is a big deal for the climate? Or how all that heat that is apparently well mixed in the ocean could somehow get into the atmosphere and influence weather/temperatures/rainfall on the land? Or is sequestering heat in the ocean a fortuitous ‘solution’ to the global (surface) warming problem?” See links under Changing Seas.

Roots of Norway Spruce Trees Growing in CO2-Enriched Air
Reference: Pokorny, R., Tomaskova, I. and Marek, M.V. 2013. Response of Norway spruce root system to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. Acta Physiologiae Plantarum 35: 1807-1816.
http://nipccreport.org/articles/2013/sep/24sep2013a4.html
As for the significance of their findings, Pokorny et al. write that “the finest roots showed the highest positive growth stimulation under elevated CO2 conditions,” and they note that this phenomenon leads to a “larger root absorbing area per tree,” which in turn leads to “better tree water supply under elevated CO2,” with its attendant “higher chance to survive dry periods.” And, of course, a larger root-absorbing area per tree also results in more nutrients being absorbed by the trees, which enables them to better cope under stressful environmental conditions.
Plastic Responses of a Marine Picoplankton to Ocean Acidification
Reference: Schaum, E., Rost, B., Millar, A.J. and Collins , S. 2013. Variation in plastic responses of a globally distributed picoplankton species to ocean acidification. Nature Climate Change 3: 298-302.
http://nipccreport.org/articles/2013/sep/25sep2013a3.html
The four scientists conclude their work by stating that “as CO2 levels increase, O. tauri will grow and photosynthesize faster, and have larger cells with a higher C/N ratio than contemporary cells,” with the result that “Ostreococcus, along with other green algae and cyanobacteria, are likely to increase in abundance in high-CO2 conditions” with concomitant benefits for the biosphere.

"**When a onetime beauty queen walks into a courtroom in Puerto Rico this week, it will bring to an end a long wait endured by relatives of her wealthy former husband, who was stabbed to death in the street.**
Ãurea VÃ¡zquez Rijos and Adam Joel Anhang's romance was short-lived and ill-starred.
Now, almost 13 years after Anhang's murder, a US federal court will finally decide whether the former beauty queen from Puerto Rico had her Canadian online gaming tycoon husband killed after just six months of marriage.
The trial, due to start on 21 August, only takes place after an extraordinary legal battle as Ms VÃ¡zquez fought extradition from both Italy and Spain.
It was the father of her late husband who used private detectives to track Ms VÃ¡zquez down in Italy after an innocent man had been jailed for the murder and later released.
""It took us five years and a lot of effort and energy to track her, since no sooner did we locate her, she got wind of it and moved on,"" Abe Anhang told the BBC from his home in Winnipeg, Canada.
Anhang, a 32-year-old real estate and gaming software multimillionaire, was brutally beaten and stabbed to death one September evening in 2005 on a street in the historical quarter of the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan.
At first glance, the attack appeared to be a robbery gone wrong in which Ms VÃ¡zquez Rijos was also injured by the male assailant.
But, according to prosecutors, Anhang was duped into believing that he was meeting his wife in a San Juan restaurant that evening to discuss the terms of their divorce, when in fact he was being lured into a fatal trap.
Ms VÃ¡zquez Rijos, the accusation holds, knew that divorce would deprive her of access to much of her husband's estate, estimated to be worth $24m (Â£19m), due to a pre-nuptial agreement the pair had signed.
Two years later, Jonathan RomÃ¡n Rivera, a kitchen worker from a nearby restaurant, was convicted of murdering Anhang in an opportunistic robbery.
That conviction was later overturned when a witness came forward, telling a US federal grand jury how she saw the killer hit Anhang with a street cobble stone and knife him several times.
He then spoke with Ms VÃ¡zquez briefly before striking her with moderate force, the witness added.
In 2008, a federal grand jury indicted Ms VÃ¡zquez on two murder-for-hire related counts after the man suspected of being the street assailant confessed to the killing.
In a statement read out before a court in San Juan, Alex ""El Loco"" PabÃ³n ColÃ³n said that Ms VÃ¡zquez had agreed to pay him $3m when they discussed her husband's killing at VÃ¡zquez's Pink Skirt nightclub and restaurant, a business bought for her as a wedding present by Anhang.
""Ãurea communicated with Alex to tell him to park his car in the San Justo street lot. Alex would do what he had to do,"" the signed confession reads.
But Ms VÃ¡zquez was no longer in US jurisdiction, having abandoned Puerto Rico some time in 2006, according to the prosecutors. She chose to settle in Italy, a country whose laws have sometimes been used by fugitives to make their extradition difficult.
Ms VÃ¡zquez met a Florence taxi driver and they had twin daughters together before he read about her being wanted in Puerto Rico in the newspaper Corriere della Sera. The couple separated and the Italian, eventually, gained custody of the two girls.
In the meantime, according to information supplied to Abe Anhang by private detectives he hired in Italy, Ms VÃ¡zquez had approached the Florentine Jewish community. ""She was embraced by the Jewish community as a widow with two children.""
Mr Anhang Sr explains that the prenuptial agreement his son and Ms VÃ¡zquez signed included a pledge by her to study and take up the Jewish faith within two years.
According to US prosecutors, Ms VÃ¡zquez was helped by her brother, Charbel VÃ¡zquez Rijos, her sister, Marcia and her mother, who provided false paperwork to successfully dupe the Firenzebraica Jewish organisation in Florence into certifying in June 2012 that Ãurea and her daughters were of Jewish descent, enabling her to move to Israel.
But, according to Mr Anhang Sr, Ms VÃ¡zquez did move around Europe, using ""false names and several ID cards"". His team of private detectives said they had traced her movements in Gibraltar, Spain, France and England.
According to prosecutors, in August 2012, Charbel VÃ¡zquez Rijos incorporated Glatt Kosher Traveller's Inc. in the Puerto Rico State Department, the plan apparently being to give his sister a means of earning money in Italy. But the travel company aimed at Jewish tourists was to prove Ms VÃ¡zquez's downfall.
The FBI and Spanish authorities set up a sting operation, inviting Ms VÃ¡zquez to Madrid to work as a guide to a fictitious tour group. She took the bait.
Arrested at Madrid's airport and imprisoned, Ms VÃ¡zquez began a new fight against extradition in Spain's courts.
Ms VÃ¡zquez became pregnant behind bars and had a baby. Spanish police sources have told the BBC that the father of the child was a small-time Italian crook, serving time in Spain for a drugs offence.
She was allowed to marry the father in jail, asking a Madrid judge not to extradite her as the mother of a Spanish citizen.
Finally, she was flown across the Atlantic in a private FBI jet in 2015, her month-old baby taken from her arms and sent into care after she landed in her native Puerto Rico.
Further legal delays and then Hurricane Maria led to several postponements of the trial, in which Ms VÃ¡zquez's brother, sister and the latter's partner will also face charges in the US federal court in San Juan.
Prosecutors have signed a sworn affidavit to Spanish authorities that they will not ask for the death sentence in the case, a condition of the final extradition agreement.
Mr Anhang Sr is optimistic that justice will finally be done for his son, but finds it ironic that his daughter-in-law's refusal to face trial may end up counting in her favour.
""Ãurea is likely to get the lightest sentence of all the accused because she fled and waited to be extradited from a country which placed conditions on her transfer back to the United States to face justice.
""In essence, she will be getting rewarded with the same sentence as if she were caught and sentenced in Spain. At the same time her co-accused will get longer sentences, despite having much less involvement in the crime.""
The BBC contacted Ms VÃ¡zquez's lawyer, Lydia Lizarribar, but she declined the invitation to comment on her client's defence strategy ahead of the trial."

If it’s not bad enough that globalist institutions like the UN are openly admitting that climate change alarmism is just leverage for imposing their wealth redistribution agenda, shiftless corporations are getting in on the act. Wherever there’re mounds of government money, you’ll always find rent-seekers with their hands out. Energy companies are some of the worst offenders: think Solyndra in the US, who pocketed hundreds of millions of US taxpayers’ money before going belly-up.



Similarly, climate spruiker Tim Flannery’s geothermal company, Geodynamics, trousered millions without ever delivering for the taxpayers it sponged off.



Yet still the rivers of government cash keep flowing to useless “renewable” projects – and the corporate mendicants are begging for more.



Power giant Origin Energy has warned against extending the life of coal plants without the government providing a ‘‘carbon signal’’ and urged an end to the decade-long energy war to help spur investment and shift the electricity grid towards renewables.



While coal stations face the prospect of being forced out of Australia’s power grid earlier than forecast by the rise of solar and wind generation, the nation’s largest energy retailer said governments should resist “picking winners” in the eventual path to a clean energy-dominated grid.



Unless it’s “winners” that are guaranteed to send electricity prices spiralling and siphon off the ever-growing river of government subsidies.



Origin chief [Frank Calabria] hinted at the need for a form of carbon pricing to allow the smoothest transition for the energy grid, but said policymakers seemed reluctant to consider such a move with ­Malcolm Turnbull’s strongly supported National Energy Guarantee dumped last year.



“The push for a market-based mechanism that deals with emissions and reliability seems to have fallen away.”



Of course it has. That would mean that energy corporation would have to gamble with their own money. Far easier to keep leeching off the taxpayer.



The Morrison government isn’t buying it.



Resources Minister Matt Canavan has slammed Origin Energy’s call for Australia to resist extending the life of coal plants, and blamed the power giant for helping to create an energy “mess” which it now profits from…



“I reckon we should do the opposite of what the big energy companies say because they are a big reason why we are in this mess. They have no interest in ending a mess that they make lots of money out of. So let’s build coal!,” Mr Canavan said on Twitter…



Origin could not have it both ways, Mr Canavan added.



“So Origin Energy reckons we shouldn’t pick ‘winners’ in energy but then in the same speech says we should pick anything but coal.”



Origin’s stance is at odds with its membership of the Business Council of Australia, according to green activist group Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility.



“Pretty rich from Frank Calabria who sits on the BCA’s Energy & Climate Committee,” ACCR’s Dan Gocher tweeted. “The BCA has repeatedly called for investment in existing coal-fired power stations. Which is it Origin Energy?”



The answer is simple: whichever will deliver them more of that sweet, sweet taxpayers’ money they’ve become addicted to.

Yesterday Alison Collins, Chief Science Advisor at the Ministry for the Environment, penned a doom-spruiking op-ed for the Dompost.



Our ‘Chief Science Advisor’ begins her piece, which is headlined “Oceans are like the planet’s heart, and they’re ailing”, with a fairy-tale (no, I’m not kidding): “In The Lion King Mufasa called it the ‘circle of life’…” and continues in similar vein, with more fairy-tales.



One tall-tale, though, wouldn’t make it past even the Brothers Grimm’s fact-checkers. They’d say it was too ridiculous to print because nobody would believe it. Here it is: 



“Our Marine Environment, 2019 reports that New Zealand coastal waters have, on average, warmed 0.2 degrees per decade since 1981.”



Crikey! 0.2 degrees per decade, you must be kidding me, that’s more than three times the supposed global average; how can this possibly be?



Just over two years ago we were assured that the entire era of satellite monitoring (since 1993) showed zero temperature increase: “ **No sea-surface temperature trend could be determined** for New Zealand’s oceanic, subtropical, and subantarctic waters and the Tasman Sea for 1993 to 2016. **Trends were assessed at the 95 percent confidence level**.” And here it is, in colour; Zero, Nothing, Niet:[ ](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dfd8f6ee5b150f3ef2f94205bcd32c22bda84317c0db07e958e4e6814d995356.png)



What happened? Oh, what a miracle! – Alison found data we don’t have and retrofitted them to the record to make her fairy-tale come true, in exactly the same way land-temperature records have been fiddled by continuously cooling the past records to ‘prove’ warming. Alison produces a nice bar-graph in her report, to which I added the trend-line:[ ](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/350da458c5d29793169625bfa1d62898be69c7e3ba85d88e7bd878e8f53d8cd4.png)



As you can see, all of Alison’s ‘warming’, all 0.65 degrees of it, occurs in a single decade (at ten times the global average), a period for which we simply **do not have** accurate satellite data.



Isn’t it amazing what Alison can do with data? Please sit up straight and pay attention, for Alison is a very settled ‘scientist’ and if she tells you fairy-tales, you jolly well better believe her.

We discussed the ISON ISOFF again nature of comet ISON in this WUWT thread, now it looks like ISOFF again.
From NASA’s Spaceweather.com (h/t Fernando): Comet ISON is fading fast as it recedes from the sun. Whatever piece of the comet survived the Thanksgiving flyby of the sun is now dissipating in a cloud of dust.  (animation follows)

(Note: The animation may take a minute or more to load, based on your Internet connection speed.) Click to view a 3-day movie centered on perihelion (closest approach to the sun):

This development makes it unlikely that Comet ISON will put on a good show after it exits the glare of the sun in early December. Experienced astro-photographers might be able to capture the comet’s fading “ghost” in the pre-dawn sky, but a naked-eye spectacle can be ruled out.
On Nov. 29th, pilot Brian Whittaker tried to catch a first glimpse of Comet ISON from Earth, post-perihelion, from a plane flying 36,000 feet over the Arctic Circle in northern Canada. No luck:

“Ideal viewing conditions from the Arctic revealed no Comet ISON,” reports Whittaker. “This negative report is to quench the thirst of other fellow dreamers under cloudy skies or further south. Later I could see that SOHO showed the comet dimming further.”
Despite Whittaker’s negative result, it is too soon to rule out observations from Earth as the twice-dead comet moves away from the glare of the sun. Meanwhile, NASA’s fleet of solar observatory will be tracking the remains.

Guest essay by Jim Steele, Director emeritus Sierra Nevada Field Campus, San Francisco State University.
On July 29, 2013 the BBC’s Hardtalk journalist Stephen Sackur wrote “The Alaskan village set to disappear under water in a decade.” He opened the story with “within a decade Kivalina is likely to be under water. Gone, forever. Remembered – if at all – as the birthplace of America’s first climate change refugees.” He then quotes a local who laments, “The US government imposed this Western lifestyle on us, gave us their burdens and now they expect us to pick everything up and move it ourselves. What kind of government does that?”


Given the context, such a statement sounds like the locals were feeling abandoned by global warming. But the tone also reminded me of the complaints by many native Arctic people who were relocated by the US, Canadian and Russian governments in a 20th century battle to secure claims to Arctic territory. Such a vulnerable location seemed odd for a permanent settlement.. Sure enough Wikipedia supported my suspicions Kitvalina. The original village was located at the north end of the Kivalina Lagoon but was relocated to its present location in about 1900. Reindeer were brought to the area and some people were trained as reindeer herders, suggesting there as a government attempt to force a permanent settlement. From the history I can glean on the internet “the people of Kivalina, like the Ipiutak before them, utilized the barrier reef only as seasonal hunting grounds, making camp there in warm-weather months.” Their recent plans to relocate due to erosion and an expanding population are opportunistically blamed on global warming.
The Arctic people have long been victimized by “southern people’s” politics. Relocation of indigenous families became a tactic employed by all the “polar bear countries” in an international chess match to stake claims on Arctic resources. In 1925, Denmark relocated families in Greenland to counter any Norwegian claims to the island. The following year the Soviet government moved a small Eskimo community to Wrangel Island in order to replace an occupation of Alaskan Eskimos that had been established there by American interests. The relocation of families was also a crucial cold-war tactic by Canada to insure their claims on the Arctic, but not just against any Russian threats, but more so from perceived encroachments by the United States.631
In 1944, Henry Larsen, a staff sergeant in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, became the first to navigate the Northwest Passage from the west to east and back again. This celebrated feat greatly strengthened Canada’s claims to Arctic lands, and offset any potential Scandinavian claims based on Norway’s Roald Amundsen’s successful crossing of Canada’s Northwest Passage in 1903-06. However the US military bases built during World War II were now perceived as a threatening foothold. So in the 1950s Larsen was put in charge of relocating several Inuit families to Grise Fiord and Resolute Bay in the far northern reaches of the Canadian Arctic. Grise Fiord is known by its Inuit name that means “the place that never thaws.” Although these were strategic places in ongoing international maneuverings, it was a region long abandoned by the Inuit’s ancestors. Government stories of an unspoiled land where hunting was more bountiful enticed Inuit families to leave the milder climates of their villages along the central Hudson Bay. Government officials sealed the deal by suggesting there was absolutely no risk and promised a swift return passage if the families found their new settlement unsatisfactory.
But it was a promise that Canadian officials never intended to keep. Ironically, the woman who played Nanook’s wife in the popular 1930s documentary “Nanook of the North” and her son (who was fathered by the documentary’s producer) were among the families relocated to Grise Ford. Although “Nanook of the North” had enthralled Americans and Europeans with a glamorized depiction of Inuit resilience and adaptability, their new settlements doled out such incredible hardships their resilience was severely tested. The struggles of those families have now been well documented in the book, The Long Exile: A Tale of Inuit Betrayal and Survival. It was the film producer’s granddaughter, daughter of his half-Inuit, half-Caucasian son, who finally forced the Canadian government to own up to their betrayal. The Canadian government finally made a public apology in 2008 and paid reparations to the offended families.
Sackur’s article continues the long tradition of half-truths. To indict climate change he wrote:

“Kivalina’s story is not unique. Temperature records show the Arctic region of Alaska is warming twice as fast as the rest of the United States.”
“Retreating ice, slowly rising sea levels and increased coastal erosion have left three Inuit settlements facing imminent destruction, and at least eight more at serious risk.”
“No longer does thick ice protect their shoreline from the destructive power of autumn and winter storms.”

However his story relies on zombie data. It was indeed true that Alaska had been warming twice as fast as elsewhere. In a 2012 paper climate scientists from Alaska Climate Research Center, University of Alaska reported, “a sudden temperature increase in Alaska was recorded starting in 1977, seemingly driven by the change in polarity of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) Index, which went from dominantly negative before 1977 to dominantly positive values after that year” However unlike Sackur they also reported for the 21st century ” The mean cooling of the average of all stations was 1.3°C for the decade”1 Alaska is now one the most rapidly cooling areas on earth.
Sackur’s reference to “slowly rising sea levels” are also questionable. Go to the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level website and view the 2 stations nearest to Kitvalina. At Nome Alaska the sea level is rising so slow it appears to be dropping over the last decade.
http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/rlr.monthly.plots/1800_high.png

Or look at Prudhoe Bay .

http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/rlr.monthly.plots/1857_high.png
Except for a brief surge for a few months in late 2013, Prudhoe Bay sea level has been dropping there as well. The shifting PDO is also known to change sea level across the Pacific Ocean.
Finally it is hard to understand Sackur’s claim, “No longer does thick ice protect their shoreline.” In 2012 the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported “ice extent in the Bering Sea was much greater than average, reaching the second-highest levels for January in the satellite record.” NASA’s Earth Observatory wrote, “For most of the winter of 2011–2012, the Bering Sea has been choking with sea ice… NSIDC data indicate that ice extent in the Bering Sea for most of this winter has been between 20 to 30 percent above the 1979 to 2000 average. February 2012 had the highest ice extent for the area since satellite records started.” And in 2013 Bering Sea ice was again above normal as seen in National Snow and Ice Data Center picture.

So why has the BBC published this story filled with references to zombie data and half-truths? The region’s temperatures are cooling, sea level is dropping and sea ice is above average. The story about Kivalina has been published many times before and residents sued Exxon six years ago. Are they trying to rekindle global fear in a time of paused global warming? Are they now tools of the IPCC? Climategate emails revealed Michael Mann’s distress at a BBC’s story that the PDO could delay global warming, and he told his fellow advocates he would have a talk with their “science” writers. Did Michael Mann and the fellow IPCC warming advocates successfully pressure the BBC to present such a biased and unsupported story that does not educate the public about the complexities of climate change but instead attempts to instill gloom and climate fear? I once saw the BBC as a trusted source, but count me as a climate war casualty. I will never again trust another BBC climate article.

We know that the MSM like to think that they run the political agenda but this is getting silly! I wonder if it is all that Climate Change lobbying that _Stuff_ does that secured their seats?



The other stuff up in that extract is the **“first democratic election since 2007”** bit. Were they a pack of totalitarian despots before 2007?

"PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   The news broke just as the fireworks began crackling over the grand estate’s manicured lawn, a festive backdrop for the guests sipping champagne around an ornamental pool: The White House had moved to appeal a court ruling that blocked President Trump’s sweeping immigration order. At airports around the world, the legal tug of war played out in starkly human terms, with travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries having to decide whether to board flights to the United States, unsure of whether they would be turned back once they landed. Yet here, in the cosseted confines of    those concerns seemed a million miles away. The guests had gathered for the 60th annual Red Cross ball, a staple of the Palm Beach social calendar, which this year carried the theme “From Vienna to Versailles. ” In keeping with the Hapsburg and Bourbon motif, the male staff members wore powdered wigs and breeches the women were costumed in flouncy gowns and   beehive wigs in the style of Marie Antoinette, the queen guillotined in the French Revolution. The disconnect between high society and huddled masses would have been complete if not for the fact that   ’s proprietor  —   the guest of honor that evening, though he had to stand in line with his wife to get into his own ballroom  —   was the very person who had signed the immigration order and had gone to court to preserve it: Mr. Trump. “We’ll win,” the president said to a reporter on   duty, who asked him whether he was confident of the government’s legal appeal. “For the safety of the country, we’ll win. ” When another reporter asked whether he would abide by the federal court’s ruling, Mr. Trump smiled thinly but did not answer, shifting from foot to foot, as the first lady, Melania Trump, resplendent in a pink evening gown and diamond and emerald earrings, stared serenely ahead. This is    in the first month of the Trump presidency, still making the transition from a   club for the tanned and surgically enhanced snowbirds of Florida’s Gold Coast to the “winter White House” that the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post always dreamed it would be after she built the   castle in the 1920s. Like his residence, Mr. Trump is also still in transition, caught between the demands of being president (a 5 p. m. phone call with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine) and the reassuring rituals of his old life (a round of golf at his club in nearby West Palm Beach). On his first weekend here since being inaugurated, the Red Cross ball fell into the   category. He had hosted the benefit several times over the past 20 years, said Dick Robinson, a friend and Palm Beach philanthropist, who stopped by to chat with the White House press corps, which now shows up alongside reporters from the local papers to chronicle events like this. The sight of Mr. Trump lining up with his guests was remarkable, given that presidents normally enter a room only after everyone else is seated, and then often to the strains of “Hail to the Chief. ” With his tuxedo jacket unbuttoned, clutching his wife’s hand, he looked more like the   who spent years greeting the guests at his club. And yet there were myriad other signs of how Mr. Trump’s life has changed, from the security checkpoint set up in an adjacent parking lot and the police boat that bobs in the Intracoastal Waterway to the Secret Service agents who peered into the crowd as he and Mrs. Trump shimmied to a band playing Bob Seger’s “Old Time Rock ’n’ Roll. ” Mr. Trump’s weekend also had that    vibe that most presidential getaways have. In addition to the call with Mr. Poroshenko, he spoke to Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy, Prime Minister Bill English of New Zealand and the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg  —   a conversation that could not have been relaxing, given Mr. Trump’s earlier assertions that the alliance is a Cold War relic. In its   summary of the Ukraine call, the White House described the exchange with Mr. Poroshenko as “very good” and quoted Mr. Trump as saying, “We will work with Ukraine, Russia and other parties to help them restore peace along the border”  —   a statement that did not take account of the fact that Russia unlawfully annexed Crimea. Mr. Trump brought along his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, which suggested that he was briefed regularly on the legal battle over his immigration order. Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon both stayed at    which has guest rooms. Even when Mr. Trump was off the clock, he appeared preoccupied by the world outside. On Saturday morning, he began a Twitter tirade against the Seattle judge who had blocked the immigration order. Though he went quiet during the four and a half hours he was at the Trump International Golf Club  —   the White House declined to confirm that he actually played golf or say who his partners were  —   the Twitter posts resumed when he got back to the house. Even as his guests were mingling during cocktails, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interest at heart. Bad people are very happy!” When Mr. Trump bought    at a   price in 1985, he was viewed by many in this uppity enclave as a parvenu who would cheapen the legacy of the estate. Those days are gone  —   especially now that he has the power to make his friends ambassadors to European capitals. But Mr. Trump still draws his share of catcalls  —   some subtle, others not. Across the street from his golf club, the Palm Beach County Library had a sign in the front door advertising an evening with Amy Sherman, a reporter from The Miami Herald and PolitiFact Florida, to discuss how to expose disingenuous political figures. “Pants on Fire: How to   Politicians,” it said. On Saturday, about 3, 000 demonstrators marched along Flagler Drive, carrying signs and chanting, “    Donald Trump has got to go. ” About 300 managed to walk across the bridge to Palm Beach, according to The Palm Beach Post, where they got within 25 yards of    before encountering an armored security vehicle. At 8 p. m. when the fireworks exploded above the estate, they cast a glow on the crowd, witnesses said, giving them a better view of the show than the one enjoyed by the guests inside Mr. Trump’s winter White House."
"**The cancellation of an annual Christmas market will cost a town's economy an estimated Â£2.7m, according to a study.**
Organisers say the event in Harrogate, normally held over four days in mid-November, attracts about 80,000 visitors to the town.
The financial loss to the area is based on how much each visitor would spend on food, drink and gifts during the event.
The market, which features up to 200 stallholders, was cancelled in August due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The event, which has been held annually since 2012, is organised by a team of volunteers led by Brian Dunsby.
He told the Local Democracy Reporting Service the market was vital to businesses in the town and the organisers were ""tremendously disappointed"" to have to cancel.
The study into the financial cost of the cancellation was conducted by Where the Trade Buys.
The commercial printing company supplies printed products and goods to small businesses, many of whom attend festive markets, and wanted to assess the wider impact.
Its analysis presumed each visitor to Harrogate's market would spend about Â£34.
The company said it was directly impacted by the cancellation of Christmas markets as it supplied a lot of small businesses with printed goods especially during the festive period.
The acting chair of Harrogate Business Improvement District, Sara Ferguson, said the report only counted the financial cost of cancelling the market.
She added: ""The bigger picture is far bleaker. November's lockdown has been particularly hard for the hospitality and retail sectors, at a time when they are usually experiencing some of theirÂ busiest weeks.""
Sandra Doherty, chief executive of the town's chamber of commerce, said: ""Bring into the equation the fact that the retail and leisure industry have been in lockdown for a whole month, I'd say the figure of Â£2.7m barely scratches the surface.""

Share this...FacebookTwitterAbout 10 days ago Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) put out a press release on global sea ice. In it AWI scientist Marcel Nicolaus and Lars Kaleschke of the Hamburg Cluster of Excellence for Climate Research (CliSAP) confirmed the “long-term downward trend in the Arctic.”
Somewhat annoyed by that conclusion, I sent the 2 scientists an e-mail asking them if they would bet $1000 on the mean 2017-2022 September sea ice will be less than the mean 2007-2012 September sea ice – just to see if they were ready to put their money where their mouth is. I even made my bet public here.
Unfortunately both Marcel Nicolaus and Lars Kaleschke have yet to reply. No surprise.
I also sent similar e-mails to other scientists at leading institutes all over the world, mainly those that actively claim that the Arctic is melting, asking if betting on less sea ice over the next 10 to 20 years was a safe bet. Some replies have come in. The results of which I will disclose soon in the future.
One excellent response I got was from Dr. Dirk Notz of the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) in Hamburg. I’m very thankful he took the time to send it. In fact he has been so kind to give me permission for me to post it. His reply (my emphasis):
===============================
Dear Pierre,
thanks for being in touch, and sorry for the slow reply. I was at a meeting with surprisingly little internet access.
Regarding the bet: I’d be very careful to place a bet in either direction, simply based on our understanding of the system from climate-model simulations. These basically say that on short time scales, such as from one decade to the next, internal variability can cause both an increase or a decrease of the ice coverage. To exemplify this, I’ve attached a slide that shows 30-year long trends from our climate-model simulations (Trends_for_talk3.pdf).

There you see 30-year long trends for different start dates in our simulations, which vary wildly. This would even more be the case for 10-year long trends. Hence, I wouldn’t put money on a further decrease of the ice cover in the years to come, nor on the opposite.
I’ve also attached a plot showing two of the simulations with our Earth-System Model, which suggest that there might be slightly less sea ice in the next decade, but other simulations show a slight increase on these short time scales.

//-->




Hence, on time scales such as one decade, the ice cover could well increase a bit (as you are suggesting), but it might also decrease. This depends in my opinion primarily on weather patterns in individual summers – nothing we can predict at the moment.
Having said this, however, one of the presentations at the meeting I’ve just been to by Andrey Proshutinsky went in the same direction as you’re suggesting, namely that because of ocean cycles there will be a recovery of sea ice in the years to come. However, I don’t believe this to be a very robust finding that I would put money on at the moment. It’s nevertheless certainly something that we’ll investigate more in the time to come.
I hope this helps you (and I also hope that it’ll save you from eventually having to pay $1000!).
Please let me know if any further questions should come up.
Best wishes,
Dirk
==============================
Dr. Notz is Head of the Research Group Sea ice in the Earth system, where they “use large-scale coupled climate models to better understand the evolution of sea ice in a changing climate”.
What I find interesting is that although he advises me against betting on growing sea ice, he also expressly advises against betting on less. He also drops hints that there are signs pointing to possible Arctic sea ice growth ahead.
Moreover Notz confirms above that Russian oceanographer Andrey Proshutinsky, a senior scientist in the Department of Physical Oceanography at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, suggests Arctic sea ice cover growth in the years ahead.
In a nutshell, while the AWI seems to have no qualms about (mis?)leading the public to believe Arctic sea ice is shrinking and that the trend will continue, other scientists clearly are no longer ready to go out on that limb.
More on this in the days ahead.

I had a tough time deciding if this should be “Quote of the Week” or “Climate Craziness of the Week”.  The quote is from 350.org’s founder Bill McKibben, who says:
I, as you can tell, am the furthest thing from an activist leader. I’m a writer.
One might believe that…. except for right above that statement is this photo and headline:

But now with his self image delusion in the face of his own actions, I think maybe he’s just in denial, perhaps even afflicted with some sort of personality disorder.

"**Thousands of rural families in Puerto Rico's rugged central mountains want to rebuild their traditional coffee economy after the devastation of Hurricane Maria. And one year on, they're betting on a dedicated group of millennials to get the job done, writes Tom Laffay.**
If they don't succeed, it could mark the end of coffee in Puerto Rico, forcing these last families to leave the island for good.
Puerto Rican coffee farmers lost an estimated 85% of their crops, or some 18 million coffee trees valued at $60m (Â£46m), and many have lost their homes in the wake of hurricanes Irma and MarÃ­a.
Not only an iconic part of Puerto Rican identity, coffee has been an economic engine that creates direct and indirect jobs in a US territory where so many young people leave because of a lack of jobs.
""I lost practically the whole farm due to MarÃ­a,"" says Luis ""Nardo"" Ramirez. But as soon as it cleared, we went back to work, and I found the workers to do it. The people were without their homes, without their roads, so there was a necessity to work.""
""Coffee is the best crop we produce, but due to the bad weather people have left it. In Las Indieras there used to be 80 big producers, now there are only five big farms left.""
On average, 80% of coffee trees were destroyed by Hurricane MarÃ­a.
""This is all that MarÃ­a left,"" says this worker as he loads coffee plants from a nursery subsidised by the government into a truck headed for a local farm.
""There are 21 municipalities in Puerto Rico whose economies are driven by the coffee industry. And if we permit the industry to disappear, this region is going to be even poorer than it already is,"" says Wilfredo ""Junny"" Ruiz Feliciano.
""It's not all San Juan, it's not all Guaynabo. MarÃ­a affected the people of the central region the most. We need a more aggressive plan to revitalize the industry and the region.""
Along with Junny's father, they are four generations of coffee farmers, including the youngest whom they hope will carry on their business one day.
After Hurricane MarÃ­a their staff was reduced from 20 employees to only four and they went from cultivating 32 hectares to only eight.
They call for an aggressive plan sponsored by the government to help farmers get back up and running and believe in the region's people to bring the coffee industry back.
ConPRometidos is an NGO run by millennials with a mission to create a stable, productive, and self-sufficient Puerto Rico, harnessing the energy, ideas and finances of the island's young diaspora.
It began its work about six years ago in tapping into the know-how of young exiles in order to help address some of the problems they had left behind.
The hurricanes presented a new challenge but the plight of the coffee farmers caught the group's eye. They are soliciting a $3m grant from the Unidos por Puerto Rico Foundation to fund a five-year, island-wide project that aims to provide much needed relief to the island's coffee sector.
The island can produce 240,000 quintales (100lb) of coffee but is only hitting 40,000, says the organisation's 30-year-old co-founder Isabel RullÃ¡n, which means it's importing coffee unnecessarily.
Increasing production could bring about $65m dollars to the poor mountain regions, she says.
""The coffee industry is the backbone of 22 municipalities of the island. That's what they do, they farm coffee. So really, we're talking about improving the quality of life for 2,000 families.""
After thousands of people were driven off the island by the hurricane, there is a movement to stem the flow of labour and encourage people to stay.
""I'm part of this rebirth of coffee here because I grew up in the coffee culture,"" says Krys Rodriguez, a retired Army sergeant major who runs a farm near the Maricao coffee fields where she grew up, called Hacienda DoÃ±a Patria.
""I was born on a coffee farm and I always wanted to have my own farm because I'm passionate about it. I always wanted my own brand of coffee.""
She is part of a group trying to educate local people in how to make a success of farming.
""I'm convinced that the coffee industry here has a future. But it has to return to the small family [farms], where you, your wife and your kids can harvest and maybe even your neighbour.""

Rush Limbaugh hasn’t made a lot of green friends over the years with his “environmental wacko” tirades, but, given what’s going on these days, perhaps his rhetoric has been too mild.



Exhibit No. 1 is the sleek and sexy Tesla Model S. If you want the one with the lowest chance of stranding you on I-95, it will set you back over $100,000. You’ll be refunded $7,500 from the federal government, several thousand more (in most states) from state taxpayers, plus various other credits that governments bestow upon ostentatious and cheap virtue, like putting a special plug in your garage. Somehow, Tesla is still losing money.





The green world is stark, raving mad.



You might have read otherwise. The company’s stock price doubled — to about $110 a share — after it reported a profit last month. Along the way, its genius founder, Elon Musk, hit upon the clever notion of paying off hundreds of million dollars in federal loans by issuing a jillion more shares of TSLA stock.



Supply and demand usually dictates that when the number of shares in a company is dramatically increased, the price goes down, but this is not the case with TSLA. By announcing a phony profit, TSLA made its stock kite to the point that issuing even more of it generated enough dough to retire its massive federal debt.



By “phony” I mean this: Conservatively speaking, Tesla lost about $11,000 for every car that rolled out the door last quarter. But they covered that by selling $68 million in “credits” to their competitors.



These competitors had chosen not to enter the obviously limited market for cars with an average real‐​world range of around 200 miles. We know the market is limited thanks to the paltry sales (averaging around 2,000 per year) of the Honda Civic GX, a natural‐​gas‐​powered version with about that range. But the State of California punishes car companies that won’t go along with this craziness, making them buy “credits” to not produce what no sane company would, from the only one that does: Tesla.



Honda (“The Power of Dreams”) thinks it’s a perilous business model to depend upon evanescent global‐​warming shakedowns and subsidies. They are reading the recent scientific literature in which climate scientists are clumsily trying to thread the needle between backing off their forecasts of the end of the world and maintaining a shred of credibility.



Exhibit No. 2 is the increasing clear‐​cutting of the jungle‐​like dense vegetation of the southeastern U.S. to fight global warming. Say _what_?



Remember all that caterwauling that cutting down the world’s forests is a bad idea because it results in increasing carbon dioxide emissions as the felled trees are burned? As Mikhail Gorbachev says, “that’s old thinking.” The EU has now decided that forests are “renewable,” and that their wood is a renewable fuel, disregarding their previous concerns about carbon emissions. But they won’t cut their own forests, because they have laws against clear‐​cutting, or mowing down the entire woods.



So we cut down ours. The 100‐​year‐​old trees of Northampton County, N.C., that are being bulldozed, pelletized, and shipped to Europe to be combusted in (previously) coal‐​fired power plants indeed are renewed — after 101 years. In the meantime, global concentrations of carbon dioxide increase, but the Euros meet their 2020 target.



The green pashas of the EU have finally come to the realization that their previous favorite “renewable” technologies — solar energy and windmills — aren’t going to get them even close to their silly commitment to reduce their emissions of dreaded carbon dioxide by 20 percent below 1990 levels a mere 6.5 years from today.



Maybe that’s because solar is guaranteed not to work whenever there’s insufficient solar radiation — about 50 percent of the time, or “night” — and Europe’s high latitude means there is little insolation except during the summer. And maybe it’s because the “load factor” for wind is even worse, running around 15 percent. There is no way anyone would invest in such insanity if it weren’t paid for with other people’s money.



The Euros _could_ reduce emissions the way the good old U.S.A. is doing, by hydraulically fracturing deep shale for natural gas. That increases supply to the point that it displaces coal for electrical generation, which results in cheaper power and half the carbon dioxide emissions. They _could_ , but the same nutsos who think that reducing their emissions will have a detectable effect on global temperature also think shale gas is yucky.



Why won’t they go our way? Because the green world is stark, raving mad.



Destroying the forest for the good of the environment is insane, right? So is shaking down auto companies that produce profits by selling cars rather than indulgences, and so is giving folks who buy $100,000 cars an average of $10,000 of taxpayer largesse.



Rush was right: Wackos.

"Marches have been the theme of the past couple weekends. There was the women’s march in Washington and around the world two weekends ago. And last weekend there was the March for Life, an annual protest against abortion. The Times called the people who marched in the latter march, “  marchers” in two headlines, to the ire of several readers. On the home page, the link to the briefing of the story read: “Pence Addresses March for Abortion Foes. ” We went to Phil Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, for his reply. Last weekend there were also protests in response to President Trump’s executive order to ban refugees. The headline for The Times’s first story initially read: “Trump Bars Syrian Refugees Indefinitely to Keep Terrorists Out. ” It was then changed, 30 minutes later, to: “Trump Bars Refugees and Citizens of 7 Muslim Countries. ” We asked Peter Blair, a copy desk supervisor, for a reply. The public editor’s take: A clear, straightforward reply from the copy desk. (More on how the machinery of editing works in my Sunday column.) In describing Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s remarkable new role on the National Security Council, The Times used a word that a reader felt was gratuitous. We went back to Corbett on this point. The public editor’s take: I think the standards editor describes well the challenges of finding the right phrases and avoiding the wrong ones. And I think for the most part editors and reporters work hard to do that. In the case of “hatch,” though, I think it does carry a negative tone, not just of secrecy but something rather sinister too.  Last October, the public editor’s column addressed The Times’s purchase of a website called The Wirecutter and its sister site The Sweethome, which are in the business of recommending products to customers and making money when customers purchase those products through “affiliate links” like, say, Amazon. com. Through its purchase of these websites, The Times hopes to tap a new source of revenue as print advertising rapidly declines. The column argued that this model could be of value to The Times, but urged the paper to proceed carefully. “I hope The Times will move cautiously, not merely assuming readers will view this as a useful new service but actually asking them whether they do,” it said. “The Times has a lot to gain. And also to lose. ” This week, our office received our first email as the new arrangement began to make itself seen on The Times’s site. We asked Sam Sifton, the food editor, for his response. The public editor’s take: Hopefully, Sifton’s answer helps explain the arrangement to readers and answers concerns about potential conflicts. My earlier post gives my thoughts, but as this is more fully implemented, I will be watching closely, and I welcome comments from readers. Since November, several dozen readers have asked us if there is any way they could contribute extra money to The New York Times, in addition to purchasing a subscription. Friday The Times announced a new program for doing just this: Subscribers, and others who are interested, can now sponsor subscriptions for students in public schools. Those interested can find more information here. Finally, some readers, understandably, are feeling overwhelmed by the amount of news the past few weeks. The Times’s Christopher Mele tried to tackle this growing issue in a story this week. “If all else fails, and you still feel bouts of news fatigue,” he concluded, “you can turn to Twitter for photos of cute animals. ” That’s what we’re doing."
"WASHINGTON  —   The Trump White House appears to have backed off for now on its consideration of reopening overseas “black site” prisons, where the C. I. A. once tortured terrorism suspects, after a leaked draft executive order prompted bipartisan pushback from Congress and cabinet officials. On Thursday, the White House circulated among National Security Council staff members a revised version of the draft order on detainees that deleted language contemplating a revival of the C. I. A. prisons, according to several officials familiar with its contents. The draft order retains other parts of the original that focus on making greater use of the military’s Guantánamo Bay prison, which the Obama administration had tried to close. Those sections, reflecting repeated vows from President Trump, include a call to bring newly captured terrorism detainees there and to freeze plans for any more transfers. After news outlets reported details of the original draft on Jan. 25, lawmakers erupted in outrage, and both the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, and the C. I. A. director, Mike Pompeo, disavowed any prior knowledge of the contemplated order. Elisa Massimino, the president of Human Rights First, who had been among those who criticized the original draft, praised the revisions. “It sounds like a smart reaction to the reaction to the leaked draft,” she said. “Transparency is a good corrective to overreach, and it provides the opportunity for more careful consideration of the broader implications of an order like this. ” In addition to the change on C. I. A. prisons, the revised draft, unlike the original, would not revive a 2007 executive order issued by President George W. Bush, and later rescinded by President Barack Obama, that laid out a limited understanding of which torture techniques count as war crimes under the Geneva Conventions. Such a move would reduce the legal risk to interrogators who employ harsh tactics not on that list, like prolonged sleep deprivation. The revised draft would also not revoke two executive orders governing detainees that Mr. Obama issued in January 2009, as the original would have. The first bars the C. I. A. from operating prisons and requires all interrogators to adhere to techniques approved in the Army Field Manual. The other was Mr. Obama’s   directive to close the Guantánamo prison within a year. However, the revised draft is said to have a provision asserting that all contradictory sections of previous orders are revoked, which would implicitly repeal the part of Mr. Obama’s Guantánamo order that declared an intention to close the prison by the   deadline. The revised draft was circulated inside the National Security Council on Thursday, with a deadline for concurring or providing comment by Friday, one official said. The official said the draft had been held much more closely than the original one had been, apparently to prevent further leaks. The White House had distributed its original draft executive order on detainees in an email to council staff members at 8:41 a. m. on Jan. 24, giving them until 10 that morning to provide any comment. It was one of at least five significant draft orders distributed to them at the same time and with the same quick deadline, two of which Mr. Trump signed in the next few days. The staff members urged the White House to slow down and get input from affected agencies and departments. They forwarded the email with the draft executive order on detainees to other officials in the government, who provided it to still other people, until it was leaked. The text of the original draft was first reported by The New York Times on Jan. 25. In response to the news reports, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, falsely said that the draft was not a “White House document. ” After The Times then reported details about when and how the White House had circulated it, Mr. Spicer said that it had not been “derived from White House sources” and suggested that its origins traced to input provided to the Trump transition effort. As BuzzFeed reported, the Trump draft order had lifted verbatim sections from a draft order written in 2012 by policy advisers to the Mitt Romney campaign. But the language in the Trump White House version had been revised, including to take account of subsequent legal and geopolitical developments and to substitute terms like “fight against radical Islamism” for “global war on terrorism. ” By Jan. 27, Mr. Trump foreshadowed that his flirtation with reviving a C. I. A. interrogation program had come to an end, at least for the time being. At a news conference, Mr. Trump said that while he personally supported waterboarding and thought torture worked, Mr. Mattis, who opposes torture, “will override because I’m giving him that power. ”"
"WASHINGTON  —   The number of people who signed up for health insurance in the federal marketplace that serves most states dipped this year to 9. 2 million, the Trump administration said Friday, as consumers struggled with confusion over the future of the Affordable Care Act. That represents a decline of more than 4 percent from the total of 9. 63 million people who signed up through HealthCare. gov at this time last year. The numbers do not include activity in the 11 states that run their own online marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. State reports suggest that they have signed up about three million people. Veterans of the Obama administration said President Trump’s opposition to the health law and his efforts to undermine it had taken a toll. People may also have been influenced by signals from Congress that the law would soon be repealed. And some consumers may have been put off by the termination of their health plans, which was caused by an exodus of major insurers from the market in many states. Just before leaving office, the Obama administration reported that   through HealthCare. gov were running slightly ahead of the number at the same time last year, with 8. 8 million as of Jan. 14. “Trump’s sabotage worked,” said Ben Wakana, who was a spokesman for Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services under Mr. Obama. “We were on track to exceed last year’s total. We expected a million people to sign up on the federal exchange in the final week of the open enrollment period. ” Still, the numbers present a challenge to Republicans who are struggling to repeal the law that allowed those millions to purchase insurance plans  —   and who have promised not to displace anyone covered by it. The fourth annual open enrollment season began Nov. 1 and ended Tuesday, 11 days after Mr. Trump took office. The Trump administration scaled back publicity and advertising in the final days of the open enrollment period. Mr. Trump also issued a broadly worded executive order that directed federal officials to waive or delay any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose “a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals. ” The order, issued within hours of Mr. Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, did not specify what actions would be taken. But lawyers and health policy experts read it as an indication that the government might not enforce the federal requirement for people to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Mr. Trump has described the Affordable Care Act as “a complete and total disaster” and has said he wants to replace it with better, cheaper coverage “for everybody,” but he has not offered a plan to achieve that goal. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, who is trying to draft a replacement for the law, said that “today’s numbers failed to keep pace with last year’s. ” In addition, he suggested, some people who signed up will not pay their premiums and will therefore not have coverage this year. “Either way,” Mr. Hatch said, “enrollment numbers are down, and costs are up. ” That response was predicted by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader and an architect of the law. “Now, Republicans will cynically point to the dip in enrollment they caused, declare the Affordable Care Act broken and move to steal the affordable health coverage of every American,” she said. “Meanwhile, in states committed to delivering affordable health coverage to their residents, enrollment in the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces has surged. ” “Democrats will continue to stand our ground to ensure that every American has access to affordable health coverage,” she added. Enrollment reports from the Obama administration were invariably upbeat, saying the numbers showed that people needed and wanted insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The first report from the Trump administration struck a different tone. “Obamacare has failed the American people, with one broken promise after another,” Matt Lloyd, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday. “Premiums in the A. C. A. marketplace have increased 25 percent while the number of insurers has declined 28 percent over the past year. ” Of the 9. 2 million people who signed up through HealthCare. gov,   were new to the federal marketplace, and   were returning customers. The individual insurance market is in constant flux. With changes in income and employment, consumers may gain or lose coverage from Medicaid, employers and other sources of insurance. The Obama administration predicted in October that 13. 8 million people would sign up for coverage in the enrollment period that ended this week. The total appears likely to fall short of that goal. Leslie Dach, a former Obama administration official who is trying to preserve the health law as a leader of the Protect Our Care Coalition, said, “Enrollment was a success, and it would have been even higher without the Trump administration’s efforts to suppress enrollment. ” Despite those efforts, he said, “Americans continued to enroll in the final weeks, proving that there is considerable demand for quality and affordable coverage. ” Several states that run their own insurance exchanges appear to have done better than the federal marketplace. In New York, 908, 200 people signed up through the state marketplace for either a qualified health plan or the “basic health program” authorized by the Affordable Care Act for   people. That represents an increase of 39 percent. Under the Obama administration, enrollment in marketplace insurance plans was consistently lower than the levels originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office, in part because consumers were more likely to get and keep   insurance."

The collective freak‐​out over President Trump’s first foreign trip and its aftermath continues. The president was typically upbeat: “Trip was a great success for America. Hard work but big results!” he tweeted to his followers on Sunday morning. But the foreign‐​policy “blob” begs to differ.



Leave aside the bizarre spectacle of sword dances and glowing orbs in the medieval kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Ignore the hugs and handshakes in Israel and Vatican City. What truly matters, as far as the foreign‐​policy establishment is concerned, is the state of the transatlantic relationship. And since our European allies are none too happy with Donald Trump, the inside‐​the‐​Beltway crowd isn’t either.



The _Washington Post_ ’s Anne Applebaum, for example, declared: “As a result of this trip, American influence, always exercised in Europe through mutually beneficial trade and military alliances, is at its rockiest in recent memory.” “The Russian government,” she continued, “which has long sought to expel the United States from the continent, is overjoyed.”



The reaction to Angela Merkel’s comment on Sunday, during a campaign event in Bavaria, is particularly illuminating. The German Chancellor stressed the importance of maintaining friendly relations with the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia, but added, “We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands.” Alluding to the fact that Americans elected a man demonstrably unfit for the presidency, and the British public’s decision to exit the European Union, Merkel explained: “the times in which we can fully count on others are somewhat over.”



Europeans have counted on NATO for nearly seven decades. Lord Ismay, NATO’s first secretary general, explained that the purpose of the alliance was “to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.” “Now, Merkel is suggesting that the Americans aren’t really in, and, by extension, Germany and Europe are likely to take on a much more substantial and independent role than they have in the past 70 years,” George Washington University professor Henry Farrell said.



Farrell continues:



Merkel’s temperament is the polar opposite of Trump’s. She is highly cautious. This speech is not an impulsive move. Instead, Merkel is starting to make the case for a different E.U., one that is stronger, more self‐​reliant and disinclined to look to the United States for leadership. If she wins the upcoming German election decisively and is able to secure enough agreement from other European states to isolate the naysayers, she may set in motion a substantial long‐​term shift in the E.U.-U.S. relationship.



Yet while those inside the Washington Beltway tremble at that thought, Americans living outside the bubble are likely to greet the potential for such change with a sigh of relief, and perhaps gentle applause.



These were the people who responded to Donald Trump’s campaign rhetoric. He beat the drum about freeloading allies during his successful campaign, and it resonated. His supporters were surely pleased when he reiterated at the NATO summit last week that NATO members must pay their fair share and meet their pledge to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense. (Trump also implied that the NATO allies actually owe money to U.S. taxpayers. They don’t).



Pollsters have noted the dramatic disconnect between the public and the elites for some time, and nowhere is this gap larger than on the question of whether our wealthy allies should do more to defend themselves and their interests. Earlier this year, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs published the latest of its regular surveys that track the differences between the public at large, and U.S. foreign‐​policy opinion leaders. The report cover claimed “Americans are generally closer to ‘The Blob’ ” than conventional wisdom suggests, but that is not entirely accurate. In certain cases, members of “The Blob” have more in common with each other than they do with the rank‐​and‐​file voters that they purport to lead.



The elite‐​public divide was particularly pronounced with respect to U.S. alliance commitments. The council presented a list of possible foreign‐​policy goals, and asked respondents to identify those that should be “very important,” “somewhat important” and “not important at all.”



Among the public at large, just 35 percent identified “Defending our allies’ security” as a very important goal. That placed it thirteenth out of thirteen, below “limiting climate change” and “promoting the full participation of women and girls in their societies around the world.” By contrast, among the elites, 71 percent of Republicans, 64 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of Independent leaders ranked defending U.S. allies as “very important”— the fifth most important foreign‐​policy goal for each.



It’s too soon to say whether Merkel will follow through on her threat/​promise. But if she does, we should expect many Americans to cheer her on.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading IPCC scientist Prof Mojib Latif extends the climate warming pause to 2025. Will it ever end?
From Sebastian Lüning’s and Fritz Vahrenholt’s “Die kalte Sonne” site here (translated by P Gosselin):
======================================
Not a week goes by without Mojib Latif appearing in the media. On September 29, 2014 the climate preacher appeared in α-Forum at Bavarian Radio. The pdf of the show is here. Interestingly in the interview Latif extends the warming pause to 2020 and even 2025. That’s another 11 years, which will easily take him well into retirement. Latif is a clever one. What follows is an excerpt from the interview:
BR: Curiously it is indeed despite the rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and also in the seas – we’ll talk more about this in more detail later – the global temperature has not risen lately. How does one explain this?

Latif: Well, this is really nothing unusual. That does not surprise climate scientists like me at all, as for us this is completely normal. When one takes a look at the development since 1900, that is the last 110 years, then we see that it has not always gone up. Rather it has progressed in waves. This is why it is necessary to look at long time periods. If we look at the entire time period, then it is impossible to miss seeing the rise. In 2008 in the journal “Nature” I myself predicted the pause: Back then it created a huge echo in the global media. I’m wondering why all of this seems to have been forgotten in the meantime.
BR: The reaction was also that some said that the thing with climate change indeed could not be so bad if the annual mean temperature also dropped again..

Latif: The reaction went in every direction. The reaction was, as you just formulated: ‘Everything can’t be so bad!’ But there was also great amazement that the temperature rise is not continuing even though greenhouse gases keep rising. In this study I expressly said that it does not mean that it’s all over, but that the temperature increase will rise even faster – starting in 2020, 2025.”
===========================
Latif claims that the pause “does not surprise” climate scientists like himself at all. Yet, 2025 would mean the pause lasting almost 30 years. It’s strange that not a single climate model predicted a 30-year pause. Latif is not surprised that 100% of the models will have been all wrong?

As we endure the bratty antics of scowling ignoramus Greta Thunberg and her idiot parade of “climate-striking” infants, it’s easy to be fooled into thinking that the younger generation is going to hell in a handcart. That’s nothing new: oldies have been grumbling about the “youth of today” ever since Plato got his toga in a twist about the feckless Athenian delinquents of his day.



But, there are a few signs that not all is lost. A recent [“teens react” YouTube video](https://youtu.be/CauSPiYZ7_E) showed that some teenagers still believe in free speech. An essay by a recent high school graduate, Melbourne’s Joanne Tran, shows that not all youngsters are falling for the millenarian campaign of eco-catastrophe, either.



I graduated high school recently from what has been an insane year of engaging in political shenanigans. I’ve come to realise that my classmates’ decision to skip school to join the climate strike and their disgust and shock at this year’s federal election results, are symptoms of a wider phenomenon — that of deep pessimism and anxiety my generation has about our future, despite evidence proving otherwise.



It’s painfully obvious, listening to them, just how little these little league misanthropes actually **know**. Almost every utterance is a parroted phrase. Pressed to actually explain themselves, they invariably dig deeper into their stock of platitudes before, as often as not, simply walking away.



It is evident that the unprecedented levels of hysteria about our future are being projected by the media, certain groups and schools. This is reflected in encouragement to skip a day of our education to “save the planet”, to filling our heads with the repetition of stock-standard platitudes such as “the system is broken and we need the government to save us” and “you are living worse off than your parents’ generation”.



Sadly, it seems that the division of hysteria sells, but ­optimism and facts do not.



As Bjorn Lomborg’s _The Skeptical Environmentalist_ showed, almost every talking-point of what he calls “the litany” is either grossly exaggerated or is outright fabricated. Things aren’t perfect (and they never will be), but many of them are better than they have been in a very long time; some of them better than ever before in history.



Objectively, the world is getting better, not worse. The World Bank has reported that over the last 25 years, more than a billion people have lifted themselves out of extreme poverty and that global poverty rates have never been lower in ­recorded history.



Access to education has never been greater as global literacy rates continue to increase with more women and children being given the right to an education.



Modern medicine has also never been more advanced with mortality rates from preventable illnesses at an all-time low, and many diseases largely ­eradicated due to technological advancement.



All of this should be celebrated as the greatest human achievement of our time. These facts should also reassure younger generations that the current institutions in place are working, contrary to the doom and gloom they’ve been indoctrinated with.



Capitalism, after all, has been the only system in history to have provided successful outcomes that allow individuals the freedom to innovate.



But almost every institution, from the media to the education hierarchy, has been white-anted by people wedded to Marxist, anti-capitalist dogma. Facts be damned.



The mantra being sold to my ­generation…is false, and can simply be used by governments and groups to cater to their own agendas as we have seen in history, the most extreme ones being under the communist societies of Kim’s North Korea and Stalin’s Russia where a centralised drive for the perfect utopia by any means necessary, through gross resource allocations, resulted in the deaths of untold millions […]



My parents and grandparents’ lives were marked by various world wars and conflicts with the collapse of the Soviet Union being the main one […]My generation’s pessimism now risks turning this backwards.



If saner young voices like Joanne’s are allowed to prevail, hopefully not.

"**The family of a toddler who died after falling 11 storeys from an open window on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship has blamed the company for the accident.**
Chloe Wiegand fell after her grandfather put her on the railing of a children's play area, believing there was glass there, the family claims.
Royal Caribbean said it was ""deeply saddened"" but would not comment further to respect the family's privacy.
The family's lawyer said there should have been a warning sign on the window.
The one-year-old died from the fall on Sunday while the ship was docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Attorney Michael Winkleman, of the Miami-based law firm Lipcon, Margulies, Alsina & Winkleman, told the BBC in a statement that Chloe's grandfather did not drop her, but she fell from an open pane that should have been closed securely.
Chloe and her grandfather were playing in a water zone for children on the ship, Mr Winkleman said.
""Chloe wanted to bang on the glass"" as she did during her brother's hockey games when she fell out of the window.
He said ""her grandfather thought there was glass just like everywhere else, but there was not, and she was gone in an instant"".
""The family needs answers as to why there would be an open window in a wall full of fixed windows in a kids' play area? Why would you have the danger without any warning, sign, or notice?""
Mr Winkleman has told US media that he felt there was ""significant blame on the cruise line"" as he thought it appeared to be a case of negligence.
The Wiegand family has remained in Puerto Rico as Chloe's grandfather, Salvatore Anello, is under investigation.
During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Winkleman said there are many measures to prevent children from falling out of windows, like screens, and questioned why there was ever an open window in an area designed for children to play in.
Mr Winkleman told reporters the family felt ""terrible"", and that Mr Anello was ""crying hysterically"" when they spoke.
Royal Caribbean's statement to US media noted that the company has made a ""Care Team available to assist the family with any resources they need"". The company is co-operating with local authorities in the investigation.
Chloe's parents are Kimberly and Alan Wiegand. Mr Wiegand is a South Bend, Indiana, police officer.
Pete Buttigieg, South Bend's mayor and a 2020 presidential hopeful, tweeted his condolences on Tuesday.
Puerto Rican police earlier told The Associated Press that Chloe had slipped from her grandfather's arms while she was held outside of the window, but this report has been disputed by the family and Indiana police."

Donald Trump, Nobel laureate? It is a jarring vision, but one that inched a little closer to reality after the seemingly amiable meeting between the U.S. president and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un on Tuesday morning in Singapore. South Korean President Moon Jae‐​in had already proposed Trump for the prize following the Panmunjom talks between North and South Korea that preceded the summit.



Some of Trump’s fans gave him credit for achieving peace in our time even before the summit, chanting “Nobel, Nobel, Nobel” at a rally in late April. But the truth is that if there is a trip to Norway in the offing, Moon himself will be a far more deserving winner than Trump, even if his modesty — or cunning — means giving Trump the credit. And much as we might dislike it, Kim probably belongs on the stage too.



Talk of the peace prize is obviously premature. Trump’s meeting with Kim had great visuals, but there was no real deal struck and certainly no pledge of denuclearization from the North. And this isn’t the first summit to cause hopes to soar for inter‐​Korean reconciliation.





The blusterer‐​in‐​chief might blunder into a good deal with North Korea. But that won’t happen without the actions of several worthier candidates.



Still, definitive pessimism is overdone. In important ways, Kim appears different from his father and grandfather — more interested in economic development, more comfortable on the international stage, and perhaps even serious about a deal, though one that won’t come cheap.



But let’s optimistically assume that the deal does make substantial progress — if not toward the “full and speedy denuclearization” the Trump administration insists upon, then at least toward a formal peace on the peninsula and a serious thaw in relations between North and South.



Denuclearization is desirable but not essential for American security, because a nuclear North Korea could be deterred. Thus, understandings short of full nuclear disarmament still could leave the peninsula more stable. A freeze on missile and nuclear development, especially if backed by inspections, could promote peninsular and regional peace and stability. Conventional forces and deployments also could be adjusted to make war less likely. Regular communication could be established. Any of these would represent significant progress in a region where hostilities have flared for decades.



If so, should Trump be standing on the stage in Oslo?



The theory is that by trading insult for insult and threatening to blow up Northeast Asia, the president frightened North Korea into coming to the table. That might seem plausible, but Kim seems like a man confident in his power, not scared. North Koreans I spoke with last year seemed befuddled by the administration, not afraid of it. Most U.S. analysts view a U.S. attack as a wild gamble. And despite his bluster, so far, Trump has avoided any actions that would actually prompt serious conflict.



If Washington’s confrontational behavior forced anything, it likely was a change in strategy rather than objective. Kim told a high‐​level Korean Workers’ Party meeting earlier this year that the regime had finished the nuclear prong of its _byungjin_ , or parallel development policy, so Pyongyang now would concentrate on economics. He did not suggest that his government completed the program only to give it away. To the contrary, in his New Year’s address this year, Kim proclaimed that North Korea now possessed “a powerful and reliable war deterrent, which no force and nothing can reverse.”



But continuing to formally resist denuclearization would ensure continued confrontation with the United States. That may explain Pyongyang’s feint toward South Korea. The latter creates the possibility of deals short of full denuclearization, while making U.S. military action less likely. This is not a strategy of desperation, but one of patience. So much for the president taking credit.



Another possible Nobel nominee is Chinese President Xi Jinping, for applying economic pressure on North Korea. But did Trump force China’s leader to do America’s bidding?



Probably not. Although U.S. pressure may have accelerated the China’s move up the sanctions ladder, the Xi government’s patience already was running thin. Beijing was tightening sanctions and enforcement every time North Korea conducted another missile or nuclear test. Xi also refused to meet Kim, despite having regular contact with South Korea’s president, until the crisis seemed to be reaching a breaking point.



The sanctions caused the North’s economy significant pain, but hardship isn’t new for North Koreans: a half‐​million or more people died of starvation in the late 1990s, and the North Korean economy kept growing throughout the sanctions. There is no reason to assume that Kim would sacrifice geopolitical ends in order to improve his people’s lives.



Moreover, Kim’s summit gambit generated leverage with China. By engineering a bilateral meeting with the United States, Pyongyang isolated Beijing. Rumors that the North would no longer insist on withdrawal of U.S. military forces from the South may have been a signal to China that North Korea was not going to protect the former’s interests. Anyway, Xi invited Kim to visit. Beijing may have made additional concessions to ensure its involvement in upcoming negotiations. So, Xi doesn’t appear to be the prime mover behind the North’s pirouette.



Give credit to Kim Jong Un. He set off the present process with his New Year’s address, in which he suggested that “the south Korean authorities should respond positively to our sincere efforts for a detente” and “a climate favorable for national reconciliation and reunification should be established.” He even “earnestly wish[ed] the Olympic Games a success” and offered “to dispatch our delegation and adopt other necessary measures.”



This was not Kim’s first expression of interest in diplomacy. In the _Washington Post_ , David Ignatius pointed to North Korean statements five years ago indicating a desire for better relations with the United States. After “completing” the North’s nuclear deterrent, Kim probably believed he was negotiating from a position of strength, not the weakness Trump hoped he could prey on.



Kim’s New Year’s offer was particularly potent because it responded to South Korean fears that the North would attempt to disrupt the latest Olympics, like the one three decades before. Kim followed up by offering to meet Trump and take a number of conciliatory steps. If the latter prove to be ploys, as many believe, there will be no Nobel for anyone. However, if peace and stability advance, Kim will be the one taking his nation into a brighter future.



But one of the best candidates may be Moon himself. Shortly after taking office, the South Korean president announced that he planned to sit in the “driver’s seat” when it came to North Korea.



His pacific nature made the apparent breakthrough possible. Moon was elected last year more in spite of than because of his commitment to reconciliation with the North, and he tempered his policy in response to a skeptical public and a hostile Trump. Nevertheless, Moon — who cut his teeth in high‐​level politics as one of the architects of the old Sunshine Policy — made outreach to North Korea a priority after his inauguration last May. Most important, he ran through the opening made by Kim. The Olympics cooperation led to the inter‐​Korean summit, with the official slogan “Peace, a new start,” and plans for the Kim‐​Trump meeting.



If Kim and Trump reach a real agreement, they will owe their success to Moon’s persistence. The progress made by the two Korean leaders might even survive a Trump tantrum if North Korea kicks back against his claims of nuclear compliance. South Koreans have an obvious reason to resist U.S. threats of war. Given images of a seemingly reasonable Kim meeting leaders of both South Korea and the United States, even Americans might not be convinced that there is an urgent need for military action that could lead to full‐​scale war. And after his fulsome praise for Kim at the summit, the president’s madman shtick can no longer seem as plausible.



Who gets the Nobel for Korean peacemaking? We’ll have to wait and see if there is a peace to reward. In any case, there are better candidates than Donald Trump. The blusterer‐​in‐​chief might blunder into a good deal with North Korea. But that won’t happen without the actions of several worthier candidates.

"BEIJING  —   China reacted with strong displeasure on Saturday to a promise by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that the United States would defend two uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that Japan controls but China also claims as its own. Mr. Mattis, the first member of President Trump’s cabinet to visit East Asia, had told Japanese officials earlier Saturday that America’s defense obligations to Japan extended to the disputed rocky outposts, known in China as the Diaoyu and in Japan as the Senkaku. The chief spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, accused Mr. Mattis of putting regional stability at risk and urged him to forgo what he called a Cold War mentality. “We urge the U. S. side to take a responsible attitude, stop making wrong remarks on the issue involving the Diaoyu islands’ sovereignty, and avoid making the issue more complicated and bringing instability to the regional situation,” Mr. Lu said in a statement posted on the ministry’s website. He described the 1960 defense treaty between the United States and Japan, which Mr. Mattis cited in pledging to defend the islands, as a “product of the Cold War, which should not impair China’s territorial sovereignty and legitimate rights. ” Mr. Mattis was not staking out a new American position while in office, President Barack Obama said that the United States would defend the islands. But the defense secretary’s words were reassuring to Japanese officials, who had been unnerved by Mr. Trump’s remarks as a presidential candidate suggesting that he might reduce America’s military commitments to its Asian allies. The disputed islands have been among a number of potential points of contention as China builds up its presence in the East and South China Seas. Chinese and Japanese vessels regularly maneuver at close quarters in the waters as China tries to challenge Japan’s control of the islands. Last year, China sent a warship to within 24 miles of the islands. President Xi Jinping of China declared much of the East China Sea to be a Chinese air defense zone in 2013, and since then China has regularly sent fighter jets to patrol the area. At a news conference in Tokyo, Mr. Mattis cited Article 5 of the United   treaty, which commits the United States to defend Japan or territories that it administers against attack. “I made clear that our longstanding policy on the Senkaku Islands stands  —   the U. S. will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands,” Mr. Mattis said. “And as such, Article 5 of the U. S.  security treaty applies. ” Before going to Japan, Mr. Mattis went to South Korea to offer assurances to that ally about defense commitments, and China’s reaction was similar. Mr. Lu struck a strident tone on Friday in expressing China’s opposition to American plans to deploy a missile defense system in South Korea, one that Mr. Mattis said was intended to protect the country from North Korea’s nuclear threat. “We firmly oppose” the deployment, Mr. Lu said at a regular news briefing. “This will not change and has not changed. ” The system, which China says is an American attempt to interfere with China’s nuclear deterrent, “will undermine the strategic balance,” he said. China has threatened South Korea with economic consequences if it agrees to the deployment of the system, known as Thaad, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. With the South Korean government in disarray and a presidential election coming there, the Chinese government has been wooing the opposition Minjoo Party, which opposes the Thaad deployment. Officials of that   party have visited Beijing twice in recent months, offering reassurances that they oppose the system. While Mr. Mattis was in Tokyo on Friday, China’s top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, spoke by telephone with Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, the Foreign Ministry said Saturday. The conversation, which the ministry said was initiated by the White House, appeared to be a preparatory step for a call between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump. The ministry’s account of the conversation was upbeat. Mr. Flynn said the United States was committed to “developing strong and powerful U. S.  relations” and “properly managing the sensitive issues,” the ministry said. For his part, Mr. Yang emphasized the two countries’ “broad common interests and great cooperation potential,” according to the ministry. Mr. Trump criticized China on a variety of fronts during the presidential transition, but the White House has had little to say about the country during the president’s first two weeks in office. And although Mr. Trump has held phone conversations from the Oval Office, several of them stormy, with a variety of world leaders, Mr. Xi has not been among them. There has been speculation among diplomats in Beijing and among American business groups in Washington that the two leaders would talk by phone in the coming days. Mr. Yang and Mr. Flynn last spoke in New York, a month after the presidential election, and from Mr. Yang’s point of view the meeting was not helpful. Just two days later, Mr. Trump astounded the Chinese government by asserting that the One China policy, under which the United States recognizes the government of Beijing and not Taiwan, was far from sacrosanct. “I don’t know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,” Mr. Trump said on Fox News. Although there was no indication that Mr. Trump was reacting to anything Mr. Yang had said to Mr. Flynn, the episode was embarrassing for the Chinese official so soon after their meeting. Earlier in December, Mr. Trump upended decades of American diplomatic practice by speaking with Taiwan’s president by telephone. The Chinese have since stressed on several occasions that the One China policy is not negotiable. The Foreign Ministry’s statement on the conversation on Friday between Mr. Yang and Mr. Flynn did not say whether the two had discussed Taiwan, only that they had discussed regional affairs."

"With tensions running high in Ukraine and the release of the third part of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, energy security and climate change are on governments’ agendas. Specifically, how to reduce carbon emissions without compromising energy security. In the recently released 2030 climate/energy package, EU chiefs write that they believe it is possible to spur “progress towards a low-carbon economy” and improve “the security of the EU’s energy supplies” by increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix, improving energy efficiency, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. These goals may or may not improve the energy security situation which, as the war of words in Ukraine tips over into shots fired, becomes an ever-more pressing issue. It will depend on how and where these measures are implemented. Tackling emissions from the largest economies is most important for achieving climate targets, but the most important countries for improving European energy security are the smallest and most vulnerable. Not only that, but the top short-term priorities for improving security of gas supply (including more gas storage and wider diversification of supply) would have little impact on these long term climate/energy targets. Tackling climate change is all about the global energy system; it doesn’t matter where emissions come from. So improving the situation in Europe, which accounts for more than 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions, makes a lot of sense. But energy systems in Europe still largely correspond to national boundaries and some of these energy systems are more vulnerable then others. If Europe wants to meet its self-imposed goal of a 40% reduction in emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2030, the priority countries are the biggest emitters: Germany, the UK, France and Spain together account for over 50% of Europe’s emissions. What goes on in the Baltic states or Bulgaria has very little impact on Europe’s total emissions – but from the point of view of energy security it does. Despite increasing energy imports, Western Europe’s energy security has risen over the past ten years due to diversification of natural gas suppliers and supply routes, including those from North Africa, the Caucasus, Scandinavia and Russia. But in the former Soviet states in Eastern Europe there has been very little supply diversification, and the historic infrastructure is centred around connections to Russia rather than to the European energy grid.  To make matters worse, many of the these countries have, like Ukraine, heating and electricity systems dominated by imported Russian gas. In fact, heating in the city of Budapest is 96% dependent on natural gas. It’s no surprise that Hungary is investing in gas storage equivalent to over two-months of peak demand given the lack of heating alternatives. Increasing gas storage and supply route options, including the construction of the Baltic’s first floating liquid natural gas terminal, at Klaipėda in Lithuania, could help ease gas insecurity in the former Eastern Bloc. But these strategies will have no impact on Europe’s climate/energy goals, other then diverting investment which could go toward the “greener” ends of spending on renewables and improving energy efficiency.  Over the long term, the Baltic and Eastern European states will all need to invest in  interconnections carrying gas and electricity to other Eastern European and Western European countries. Greater connections between European states would improve the energy system’s flexibility and, in terms of electricity, would be key to aiding the penetration of renewables. By connecting states to both the abundant wind energy in northern Europe and the abundant solar power in the south, consumers could buy solar power when the wind isn’t blowing and vice versa. Energy security is affected by where we choose to reduce emissions, and in which sector. From the perspective of climate change it doesn’t matter whether emissions drop due to less coal, gas or oil use. But from an energy security perspective it matters a great deal. Cutting coal use in Europe may actually lead to greater energy dependence by increasing the need for imported gas. Cutting emissions from oil and gas would do the opposite.  So while in some ways climate change and energy security are complementary, the priorities for achieving each are not. If Europe is serious about taking steps to lessen its impact on the climate it should focus its efforts on a continent-wide project in emissions reductions – with the big emitters at the top of the list. But improving European energy security will require much more effort focused on building the resilience of the former Eastern Bloc through closer integration of energy infrastructure and energy markets. Only by acknowledging this dichotomy can governments hope to make progress on both fronts. And in the meantime, it doesn’t make sense to speak of “European” energy security due to the vastly different energy security vulnerabilities facing each member state. "
"The rapidly accelerating climate crisis threatens the future of major sports events around the world, according to a report that also says the global sporting industry is failing to tackle its own emissions. The study found that in the coming years nearly all sports – from cricket to American football, tennis to athletics, surfing to golf – will face serious disruption from heatwaves, fires, floods and rising sea levels.  It also estimated that globally, sports’ own carbon emissions are equal to that of a medium-sized country, adding that sport administrators and stars had an important role to play in global efforts to tackle climate breakdown. Andrew Simms, the co-ordinator of the Rapid Transition Alliance, which published the report, said: “Sport provides some of society’s most influential role models. If sport can change how it operates to act at the speed and scale necessary to halt the climate emergency, others will follow.” The report found that in the next three decades a quarter of English league football grounds will be at risk of flooding every season, one in three British golf courses will be damaged by rising sea levels and the Winter Olympics will be increasingly difficult to stage because of rising temperatures. It also highlighted how the climate crisis was already having an impact on major sports events. Last year’s Rugby World Cup was hit by a huge typhoon, while this year’s Australian Tennis open was disrupted by toxic smoke from the country’s devastating bush fires.  Commenting on the findings, Rosie Rogers, the head of Green Recovery at Greenpeace, said: “From flooding to sweltering heat, even sport can’t escape the climate emergency. But it’s also clear that the sector is playing a part in fuelling it.” As it re-emerged from the Covid-19 lockdown the industry had a chance to think about how to do things differently and what a “sporting green recovery” would look like, she said. “Whether that’s switching planes for trains, ditching single use plastic or cutting fossil fuel sponsorship, sport can show it’s on the winning side as we take the climate crisis head on.” The study found that of hundreds of governing bodies, only five have a zero carbon pledge, with World Athletics, Formula 1 motor racing and the All England Lawn Tennis Club, which runs Wimbledon, having pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030. The report’s author, David Goldblatt, said sport should be doing much more. “Few human practices offer such an extraordinarily large, global, and socially diverse constituency as those playing and following sport. Making a carbon-zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics.” Jens Sejer Andersen, the international director of Play the Game, the global organisation for good governance in sport, said the report underlined the need for the industry to take a lead in the fight against climate breakdown. “We must be ready to revise the ways we organise our events and tasks … But we won’t stop here. Climate action must be an essential part of sports governance.” He said the climate crisis would be a central topic at the organisation’s next international conference in 2021. “We’ll do our best to engage our global network of reporters, sport leaders, athletes and officials in raising their game.”"

Very few have shaped the climate science debate and forced the unwanted discussion on climate change like Prof. S. Fred Singer has. Photo: Heartland Instiute
One of the differences I’ve noticed between the USA and Germany is how birthdays are regarded and celebrated, especially the “round ones” ending with a zero, mostly beginning at age 40 (I’ve had a couple myself). They really are a big deal out here and big parties are always in order. The “round ones” are sort of seen as real lifetime milestones.
Today one of the giants of climate science rationality and realism is celebrating his 90th birthday: S. Fred Singer.
Without his leadership and wisdom, the global warming skepticism we see today no doubt would have been very different. It certainly would have been nowhere near as strong and nor feared by alarmists as it is today. We owe him a huge thanks for that.
It would take days or even weeks to write about all his accomplishments. To get an idea you can click here here or here. In 1990 he founded the Science & Environmental Policy Project.
He has authored or co-authored books on global warming, one of which was key in forming my own positions on the subject: Unstoppable Global Warming Every 1500 Years. German Geologist Sebastian Lüning even credited Dr. Singer for playing a an important role in shaping his positions. It goes without saying that the same can be said for thousands of others.
So NoTricksZone wishes Dr. Singer a wonderful and happy 90th birthday, and I’m sure readers, friend and foe alike, will also join me in wishing him many more years participating and playing an instrumental role in the exciting climate science discussion.
So, heart-felt congratulations to one of my heroes!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days ago I wrote a piece aimed at encouraging readers to consider a diet change to improve their health for the coming new year, and to ignore the consensus high-carb/lowfat diet. My own health has improved dramatically since I stopped listening to the preventive maintenance advice peddled by the boys at the expensive repair and spare parts shop, advice that always seemed to land me on their workbenches. Go figure.
I also used it as an opportunity to illustrate the absurdity and the extreme danger of consensus-driven science, using Andrew Revkin’s stroke to highlight this.
In the example I suggested that his stroke was perhaps root-caused by the high-carb/low fat diet – the very one advocated as healthy by the consensus of America’s major health and medical institutes and associations. The one that we are finding out has been a catastrophe. I just assumed that Andrew followed their advice because, as we all know, he is a big believer in science by the consensus of leading experts – especially when critical issues are at stake. In effect I suggested that Mr. Revkin had been probably (and ironically) a victim of the very consensus he so dearly endorses, like he does in climatology.
Mr. Revkin reacted, denying that his brush with death had anything to do with (consensus) nutrition at all. I expected that. He wrote:
Hmm. You must not have read much of my article or related blog posts. http://j.mp/dotstroke I experienced what’s called a ‘spontaneous dissection’ of the left internal carotid artery (which is not in the brain). Resulting clots traveled to the brain. Such strokes are not a function of diet at all. My arteries were (and are) clear. These strokes are mainly triggered by physical injury to the carotid – everything from some yoga and chiropractic moves to tipping your head back in certain ways painting a ceiling, even getting a shampoo at the beauty parlor. The video, created by a medical illustration team for someone with a very similar stroke, is informative: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrNJ-Byuwm4“
Here he claims his type of stroke was caused by “‘spontaneous dissection’ of the left internal carotid artery.”, which is like blaming a bridge collapse on “spontaneous beam rupture”. Well, bridge beams and rivets just don’t rupture for nothing when hardly loaded, do they? They do so because of rust from poor maintenance, or perhaps ignored fatigue-cracking as it ages. Andrew’s medical issues are personal and I don’t want to dwell into them in particular. But here he insists his arteries are healthy and suggests that “spontaneous dissection” in arteries in general is just something natural, a bit of bad luck (even though medical science shows that arterial health is in fact very closely related to nutrition). This is amazing.

It is truly stunning that some people can infer a possible connection between a single storm in New Jersey and SUV emissions in California, yet are not able to see the clear connection between diet and strokes in middle-aged men.
Ultimately it doesn’t matter if Mr. Revkin’s own stroke was nutrition-related or not. It’s not our business. What matters is that for many people who have suffered the same, or have had a heart attack, or who struggle with Type 2 diabetes, etc., it is very often diet-related and the direct result of the consensus-driven nutritional guidelines, which today are proving to have been underpinned by fraudulent and bogus science, read here.
Today the scientific literature tell us that Andrew’s condition, once very rare, has become more commonplace over the past decades. Strokes in middle age men are not natural incidents resulting from bad luck, but rather they are, as is the case with the explosion of cardiovascular disease and diabetes sweeping across the western world, a direct result of the catastrophic, junk-science-based medical and nutrition consensus of the past decades.
Thus it would be nice if people like Andrew Revkin would concede that the notion of consensus-driven science is dangerous, that it always needs to be vigorously questioned and that skeptics are essential.
I have a lot of respect for Mr. Revkin and he deserves much credit for bringing the much needed attention to the stroke issue. I just have serious issues about how he selectively applies science from field to field, whatever suits him best.

Kamala Harris is not really known for her views on trade policy, but over the course of the Democratic primary campaign and her career in the Senate she has weighed in a number of times on trade issues. Some of her statements are quite good from a free trader’s perspective. Others are not as good. Here’s a brief run down.



Let me start with a few positive, trade‐​friendly things she has said. At a primary debate in September 2019, she said:



I am not a protectionist Democrat. Look, we need to sell our stuff. And that means we need to sell it to people overseas. That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen.



She has also been very critical of Trump’s trade strategy and tariffs. For example, there was this:



We’ve got a guy in the White House who has been erratic on trade policy. He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly born out of his fragile ego. It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soybeans rotting in bins, looking at bankruptcy.



And also this:



Because of this so called trade policy that this president has that has been nothing more than the Trump trade tax that has resulted in American families spending as much as $1.4 billion more on everything from shampoo to washing machines.



And along the same lines, this:



I have a couple of thoughts. One is that this President continues to push forward what I call the Trump trade tax. This is about taxing American consumers. People are going to have to pay more for washing machines, pay more for clothing, pay more for shampoo. When we look at the trade policy he is conducting in terms of China, now with Mexico, it’s going to result in people here paying billions of dollars more a year for consumer products.



At the same time, she does sometimes use rhetoric that is more like those of economic nationalists, like this:



my trade policy, under a Harris administration, is always going to be about saying, we need to export American products, not American jobs. And to do that, we have to have a meaningful trade policy.



On trade agreements, her views are a little hard to follow. For example, she said this about NAFTA:



I would not have voted for NAFTA, because I believe that we can do a better job to protect American workers.



And this about USMCA (the renegotiated NAFTA):



after careful study and consultation with environmental and conservation leaders, I have concluded that the USMCA’s environmental provisions are insufficient—and by not addressing climate change, the USMCA fails to meet the crises of this moment. Californians know that the climate crisis is already here. Communities across our state have experienced exacerbated fires, storms, floods, and drought, and the devastation will only get worse if we fail to take bold and immediate action to address it. This agreement will set the standards for decades, and I believe Californians and all Americans deserve better and more immediate action. For these reasons, I oppose this deal.



And there was this about the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP):



As I’ve long said, I will oppose any trade deal that doesn’t look out for the best interests of American workers and raise environmental standards, and unfortunately the TPP didn’t pass either test. I also raised concerns at the time about the lack of transparency in the process.



In my administration, labor and civil society groups will always have a seat at the table to ensure that trade agreements do achieve these important objectives. And I think that’s exactly what we need – pro‐​labor, pro‐​environment trade deals – because it’s clear Donald Trump’s protectionist approach has been a disaster. His trade war is crushing American farmers, killing American jobs, and punishing American consumers. I would work with our allies in Europe and Asia to confront China on its troubling trade practices, not perpetuate Trump’s failing tariff war that is being paid for by hard‐​working Americans.



Where does all of that leave us? She does not seem to be an economic nationalist or isolationist, and she makes clear that she believes the United States should engage with the world economically. At the same time, though, the terms of that engagement are a bit uncertain. What exactly would she want to see in a trade agreement before she would sign on to it? She clearly wants more labor and environment provisions in trade agreements, although USMCA had quite a lot and she still voted against it, arguing that climate change should be covered as well.



Maybe the answer is simply that she wants to change the scope of trade agreements, so that they still promote trade liberalization, but at the same time continue their expansion towards general global governance of non‐​trade issues. Vice presidents sometimes take on specific issue areas in which to play an active role. If Biden wins and Harris as VP has trade in her portfolio, we will find out more.

"The German energy giant RWE has begun to “reverse flow” supplies of gas from Europe back to Ukraine via Poland, a process first arranged in 2012, with an agreement to deliver up to 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year. The question for the Ukrainian interim government and state-owned energy firm Naftogaz is how this gas will be delivered, how soon, and whether it will be enough. Hungary has the capacity to deliver 5.5 bcm, Poland could deliver 1.5 bcm, and Romania could potentially provide 1.8 bcm capacity, but not before 2016-17 at the earliest. Talks between Ukraine and Slovakia have renewed in an effort to tap into its capacity to deliver 9 bcm of gas, but the Slovak government and pipeline operator, Eustream, are anxious to ensure that feeding gas back to Ukraine does not breach its contracts with Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Given that Ukraine imports around half of its annual 55 bcm of gas consumption, even with these new suppliers it will remain dependent on Russian gas. The current situation comes as Kiev faces price hikes from US$285 to US$485 per thousand cubic metres of Russian gas, after Gazprom cancelled discounts offered in April 2010 and December 2013. The new price is significantly higher than, for example, the price of US$399 paid for Russian gas at the German border.  Naftogaz has struggled to pay for its Russian gas imports since late 2013, and now owes Gazprom more than US$2 billion. The combination of Naftogaz’s debts and unwillingness to pay the higher price means that many in Europe fear a suspension of Russian gas supplies to Ukraine – which, as it travels through the same pipelines, would also interrupt Russia’s gas exports destined for Western Europe. This is not the first time that Russia and Ukraine have clashed over gas prices. For more than a decade following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine benefited from Russian gas import prices far lower than those in Western Europe. Attempts by Gazprom to raise gas prices for Ukraine resulted in disputes and suspensions of gas supplies to Ukraine in January 2006 and January 2009. With Gazprom delivering 140 bcm to the EU in 2013 – more than a quarter of the EU’s total gas consumption – this has left many countries scrambling to find alternative ways to meet their needs. Russian gas is delivered to the EU via several routes, of which the Ukraine pipelines are the most important, accounting for 55-60%. Around 25-30% travels through Belarus, and the remainder comes through the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea directly from Russia to Germany. Opened in late 2011, Nord Stream is 51% owned by Gazprom, with the remaining shares owned by European energy companies (BASF Wintershall, E.On, Gasunie, and Gaz de France). The pipeline’s capacity can reach 55 bcm per year, but due to regulatory problems in Germany is currently operating at half capacity. Gazprom is also planning the South Stream pipeline, another joint-stock partnership between Gazprom and local energy companies in each of the states it travels through. This would link Russia to Bulgaria under the Black Sea, through Serbia, Hungary, and Slovenia to northeast Italy. If built, the 63 bcm per year capacity of South Stream and the 55 bcm capacity of Nord Stream combined could reduce Russia’s dependence on the Ukraine pipelines to almost nothing, if Gazprom’s current export levels of gas to Europe remain stable. Ukraine’s efforts to find alternative sources of gas imports have led to protests from Gazprom. The gas that would be exported from the European market to Ukraine would actually be Russian gas, being re-exported at a profit by European energy companies. Gazprom claims such a scheme could be illegal, but has not clarified on what grounds. Re-exporting imported gas was previously forbidden in Gazprom’s contracts with European energy companies, under the “destination clause”. But by 2006, these clauses had been removed on the grounds that they infringed Article 81 of the European Community Treaty (restrictive business practices). So any European energy company – theoretically, at least – now has the right to re-export gas, regardless of its source or destination. The legality of re-exporting Russian gas from Europe to Ukraine may hinge on Gazprom’s gas transit contracts with Naftogaz and Eustream. These contracts effectively “reserve” the pipeline for delivering gas from east to west. Should Naftogaz and Eustream reverse the flow of their pipelines without Gazprom’s agreement, they could be in breach of contract. This condition applies even if those pipelines are not being used at full capacity, as is currently the case, and even if Naftogaz and Eustream are still able to fulfil their commitments to deliver Russian gas from east to west. They key aspect of this situation is the extent to which all parties depend on each other. While the EU sources more than 25% of its gas consumption from Russia, around 60% of Russia’s gas exports are to the EU. Almost 60% of Russian gas exports to the EU are delivered via Ukraine, which is itself also almost entirely dependent on Russia for its gas imports (imports account for just over half of Ukraine’s gas consumption). Occasionally the European media refer to Russia’s gas as an “energy weapon”, or to the possibility that Russia may “turn off the taps” as leverage in a political dispute with the EU. But this is simply not credible: both Russia and EU member states and their energy companies have a vested interest in maintaining good trading relations. For Europe, the disintegrating Gazprom-Naftogaz relationship is the greater worry. Both sides have in the past failed to use arbitration and dispute resolution to resolve their disagreements, and the ongoing arguments and two complete gas suspensions were the result. Given the recent statements by Russian and Ukrainian officials, another suspension of Russian gas supplies to Ukraine cannot be ruled out."

Public transit cost federal, state and local taxpayers more than $50 billion in 2016 — nearly $5 in subsidies every time someone boarded a transit vehicle. Yet transit ridership has been declining since 2014, and although some might attribute this to telework or a general decline in the reliability of transit services, it’s thanks in large part to the success of competitors such as Uber, Lyft and Chariot.



This has led many to wring their hands over the future of public transit. In fact, we should be happy to see it go as it is obsolete, needlessly expensive and provides no significant environmental or social benefits.



A little over 50 years ago, urban transit was mostly private and mostly profitable. But in 1964, in the face of declining ridership and concerns about the industry’s long‐​term financial viability, Congress offered federal subsidies to cities and states that took over private transit companies. Within a decade, all but a handful of transit companies had been “municipalized.”





It’s obsolete and costs taxpayers billions, yet its ridership and productivity continue to decline.



Those subsidies, along with those provided by states and local governments, failed to boost ridership or stabilize the industry. What followed instead was a dramatic decline in transit’s productivity by any measure. The number of annual riders carried per transit employee has dropped by more than 50 percent, according to data from the American Public Transit Association. Operating and capital costs have grown more than twice as fast as fare revenues.



Adjusted for inflation, the same data show that subsidies to transit by all levels of government have totaled well over $1.1 trillion since 1964, but these subsidies haven’t benefitted either cities or transit riders. In 1964, the average urban resident took more than 60 transit trips a year. Preliminary data for 2017 indicate that this has fallen to 37 trips per year, the lowest level in recorded history.



Subsidy supporters say transit helps low‐​income people get to work, but census data show that only about 4 percent of American workers live in households that lack cars, and a majority of them don’t commute by transit. Nor are claims that transit saves energy and reduces pollution true. In 2016, transit used about 10 percent more energy per passenger mile than the average car and only slightly less than the average light truck. Both transit and cars emit about the same amount of greenhouse gases per passenger mile. People who care about energy or climate change would do better to drive a plug‐​in hybrid than to take transit.



The latest argument for transit is that it promotes economic development. While some studies have found that heavily used transit lines can influence property values, research published by the Federal Transit Administration has shown that this is a zero‐​sum game: Higher property values in one part of a city are balanced by lower values elsewhere. Not only does transit not promote overall economic growth, the high taxes required to subsidize transit may actually slow growth down. Data from more than 300 urban areas show that the regions that grew fastest in the 2000s were ones that had spent the least on transit in the 1990s, while the regions that spent the most on transit in the 1990s were among those that grew the slowest in the 2000s.



Now that ride hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft and private bus companies such as Chariot are providing increasingly affordable alternatives to public transit, it is time to think about phasing out the subsidies. That means, first, that transit agencies should stop spending money on new rail transit lines that few people will ride.



Rail transit was rendered obsolete more than 80 years ago when manufacturers had perfected buses that were less expensive to buy, operate and maintain than rail cars. Contrary to claims that light rail is “high‐​capacity transit,” buses have much higher potential capacities: The New York‐​New Jersey Lincoln Tunnel Exclusive Bus Lane, for example, moves more people per hour than almost any rail line in the world, and far more than any light‐​rail line.



Next, transit agencies should pay down the debts they incurred building previous rail lines, as well as their unfunded pension and retiree health‐​care obligations. Finally, they should offer transit franchises to private companies, as the United Kingdom has done. At least until driverless cars make buses obsolete, private companies can provide bus services at a profit in many urban areas. A private company might also be able to operate the New York subway at a profit, but most other rail lines should be scrapped.



To be fair, we should end subsidies to highways as well, though those subsidies are much smaller — 1.5 cents per passenger mile vs. nearly 90 cents for transit. Subsidies make transportation providers, whether public or private, more responsive to politicians than to transportation users. Politicians are likely to build bridges to nowhere or expensive, low‐​capacity rail lines, while user‐​fee‐​driven agencies will focus on maintenance and cost‐​effective congestion relief to keep customers happy.



The great experiment of socializing public transit has failed. Instead of trying to rescue transit, we should stop subsidizing it, saving taxpayers’ tens of billions of dollars a year. There are better ways to improve urban transportation.

The policy lesson from the case of Mozilla’s Brendan Eich, who was forced out as CEO of the tech giant he co‐​founded as a result of his support for Proposition 8—California’s ballot initiative that defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman—has nothing to do with either gay rights or tolerance for unpopular viewpoints. Instead, this episode showed the very real costs that donation‐​disclosure requirements inflict on civil society.





Election laws exist so that the governed can monitor the government, not the other way around.



That is, the only reason Eich resigned is because his $1,000 contribution to the Prop 8 campaign became public. Or rather he was outed, so to speak, by activists—whom liberal satirist Bill Maher called the “gay mafia”—who scour the publicly accessible donor database in search of high‐​profile targets with “incorrect” views. Eich is only the most recent victim of such targeting, but he’s unlikely to be the last.



Even low‐​profile Prop 8 supporters—ones who didn’t create the JavaScript programming language or head major companies—have been subject to intimidation, vandalism, and other personal and financial hardships. All committed by individuals complaining about intolerance and demanding acceptance of diverse lifestyles.



I point all this out as someone who supports marriage equality and recognizes that there may have been a valid business reason for Mozilla’s board to demand Eich’s resignation once his views became known. Just as business owners ought not be forced to provide services to a same‐​sex wedding, a private company can have whatever litmus tests it likes. The issue isn’t equality under the law or First Amendment rights—there’s no government action or coercion here—but haggling over what kind of personal opinions disqualify a CEO.



Surely we can all agree that a neo‐​Nazi Holocaust denier—or a Klan member, or a Stalinist, or a Satan worshipper—can’t run a large company. The trust won’t be there, either internally or externally. On the other hand, most people seem not to have liked last week’s _How I Met Your Mother_ finale, but surely disagreeing with that view (as I do) isn’t a disqualifier.



So the question that has consumed discussions of the Eich affair is whether someone who’s against gay marriage—or at least donates to that cause—is on the wrong side of the Satan‐​Scherbatsky line.* Not because that person is equivalent to a Nazi or Communist but because there’s a line somewhere.



It’s unfortunate that holding a position that President Obama himself shared until recently got Eich in trouble, but Mozilla’s decision was understandable if it read its economic climate correctly. Silicon Valley apparently doesn’t countenance opposition to gay marriage to such an extent that a business leader who holds that view can’t be effective even if his personal views in no way affect company policy. (That’s one reason why opposition to Arizona’s SB 1062 was misplaced; most businesses that refused to serve gays would take severe financial hits—regardless of whether courts upheld their religious objections.)



But lamenting the cultural dynamic that led to such hypocrisy is beside the public‐​policy point. The whole imbroglio could’ve been avoided with a tweak of disclosure rules.



Currently, the identity of anyone making a contribution of more than $200 to a federal political campaign—name, home address, employer—has to be disclosed to the government, which puts that information online. In California, the threshold is $100. The reason for collecting and disseminating this information is rather thin: to prevent corruption and enhance the perceived integrity of the democratic process. Yet small donors hardly corrupt the candidates they support—Barack Obama spent over $1 billion on his reelection—and how do you corrupt a ballot initiative?



Imagine that you had to notify a government official each time you attended a rally, or made campaign phone calls, or posted to a blog, or even talked politics with friends. Now imagine that this information would be made public by the government. Would your activities and conversations change? The question answers itself.



Brendan Eich’s position thus became untenable not because he made a politically awkward contribution but because election laws revealed that sensitive information to people whose interest had nothing to do with clean elections or corporate governance. But election laws exist so that the governed can monitor the government, not the other way around.



Thesolution is obvious: Require disclosures, if at all, only for those who give so much money that the interest in preventing the hypothetical appearance of corruption outweighs the very real potential for harassment—which amount would be far greater than the current per‐​candidate maximum of $2,600. Then the big boys will have to put their reputations on the line—as they do already; see Harry Reid’s crusade against Charles and David Koch (who are Cato CATO -1.56% donors)—while the average citizen won’t be exposed to retaliation.



Let the voters decide what a donation from this or that plutocrat means to them, rather than enabling vigilantes to police the Satan‐​Scherbatsky line.



* Robin Scherbatsky is a character on _How I Met Your Mother_ , and her last name is the most euphonic/​memorable of the major characters.

A short comment by Nils-Axel Mörner
UPDATE: See the follow up post here: The Most Important Sea Level Graph
This is the sea level graph (from Kwajalein) recently being circulated and claimed to show an alarming acceleration of a proposed general sea level rise.
Yes, this curve rises fairly rapidly from 1990 to 2012. But for what reason and with what regional message?

This is a sea level graph (from Majuro) and is shows a general sea level stability from 1992 to 2010. 
No traces of any acceleration!

(Note from Anthony: see more on Majuro here: http://www.gloss-sealevel.org/publications/documents/pacificcountryreport_mi.pdf )
It looks like Kwajalein is affected by a local subsidence induced by building construction (or some sea level “correction” in order to have it going up).
The Majuro records, for sure, contradicts and acceleration claim; even a general “rise”.
In conclusion, don’t “hang your hat” on the Kwajalein graph. Look around and observe!
