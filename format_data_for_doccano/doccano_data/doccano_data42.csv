Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve mentioned at least a couple of times at this blog how the German public school system is pounding the climate protection religion in school classrooms.
For example former minister of environment Sigmar Gabriel of the SPD socialist party was so impressed by Al Gore’s Inconvenient Truth propaganda film that he procured 6000 copies and had them distributed to Germany’s upper secondary schools for viewing by university-bound students.
Environmental groups like Germanwatch make the rounds through schools to spread panic by grossly exaggerating climate change scenarios (German port cities will be under water).
Greenpeace is even petitioning the German government to have Climate Protection” adopted in its Constititution:
‘Climate change is the most dangerous threat to our natural existence, yet it is neither mentioned in the Constitution nor in the UN Charter. The German Parliament must therefore anchor this as one of the most important duties of the state,’ says Stefan Krug, leader of the political representation of Greenpeace in Berlin.
But that doesn’t go far enough. Let’s take a page out of the Pyongyang playbook and start early – real early.  The German education system has assigned itself another new function beside education – environmental indoctrination. Germany’s sceptic site Readers Edition here has a piece today on the latest indoctrination program at schools called: klima on… s’cooltour 2009, again delivered by alarmist organization Germanwatch.
This program is initiated by the manufacturers of energy saving lights, like Philips – see video (in German).
These big greedy corporations are behind scaring kids in order to boost the sales of their poisonous, mercury-laden lights.

As the film shows, all kids are in uniform, dressed in “s’cool tour” T-shirts. and fed the junk science and environmental propaganda of rescuing the planet. First the kids are explained in simple terms “why the earth has a fever”, and, using an inverted glass jar, shown how heated air turns into storms.
And of course, they are taught that energy saving lights will rescue the polar bears in the Arctic.
The clip says: “thanks to the program, kids now better understand why storms are caused and that each person can make an “enormous contribution in reducing the earth’s fever”.  Indeed. In fact, Germany cutting its CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050 will lead to the enormous temperature reduction of 0.0072°C.
Says Lena Haller:
We are trying to change the behaviour of the kids and thus improve it.
It doesn’t matter what the science turns up. The enviro-brainwashers aren’t interested in it. They are into changing behaviour – getting everybody to believe their phoney doomsday scenarios and have them behave in fear accordingly. It hardly can get worse. Their target with the little ones is to turn them into greenshirts – like this:

Share this...FacebookTwitter“I’m a climate pig” – so confesses a climate sinner in a satirical new video clip produced by German public television ZDF. It is a spoof on the whole climate change movement, a parody on the climate religion, and this by an icon of politically correct media, ZDF, no less!
The video is also quite hip – thus targeting the young.
Are the German media now starting to take a satirical view of the whole climate-saving movement? That certainly would be a change of course. But let’s not get our hopes up too much.
The video pokes fun at the feelings of guilt that many people struggle with daily because of their self-perceived CO2 sins, which are simply impossible to avoid in modern living. We all do our best to avoid emitting the climate-killing stuff, but it just can’t be helped! The video starts with a person confessing his climate sins. Dear Father:
– Boiling water: 36 kg of CO2.
– Surfing in the Internet: 391 kg.
– Driving the car: 2 tons!
– Living in an old apartment in Berlin: 3.6 tons
– Holiday flight to New York: 4 tons!
Using this online climate calculator, I reach a total of more than 18 tons per year. But the scientists say I should emit no more than 2 tons per year!
Oh my God, what can I do? Cutting CO2 emissions that drastically would be totally painful. The guilt that’s felt is just unbearable.
But it’s got to be done. There’s no choice, at least so says Regine Günther, Director of Climate Protection and Energy WWF:
If we don’t, then we will be changed, and that in the form of traumatic climate change. And the consequences for people will be much much more painful then you could ever imagine.
Gulp! That’s pretty painful. I myself can imagine some pretty painful things – like root canal treatment without Novocaine. So climate change will be 10 times, no, a thousand times more painful than that? Then we better hurry up and make the brutal sacrifices today. ZDF asks how on earth are we supposed to do get down to just two tons?

Deliver our e-mails by bicycle?
Turn off the heat?
Dear Father, what am I to do? No matter what I do, I commit CO2 sins. Help me!
Norbert Bolz, media theorist, says everywhere there are feelings of guilt, people doing penance by performing acts of offsetting. “People are now praying to Mother Nature, who has taken over for God.”
The clip sarcastically points out that the average person causes 1.24 tons of emissions annually just by default existing, before even taking a breath, and that through government administration, autobahns, and taxation. ZDF asks: “Is there even a chance for me to live a climate-friendly life?”
The movement has become religious and is now even filled with rituals, explains Bolz, citing Germany’s obsession with separating it’s household garbage as a way of being a “good person” and doing penance for our environmental transgressions.
But don’t despair, now private industry allows you to buy offsets, thus allowing you to perform acts without having to feel so guilty. Now that’s service. Pay a little extra for that flight ticket, and bam! Everything is rosy again. Fly guilt-free! A good conscience in exchange for money. ZDF adds satirically:
For singles at COOL.de, there’s also the climate-neutral complete package for only 10 euros a month!” Is that the solution?
Not for WWF High Priest Regine Günther, who warns offsets are not enough:
The only good emissions are the ones that don’t happen. And for the ones that do occur, you have to try to avoid them. And if that isn’t possible, then you have to offset them. But that’s only possible over a transitionary period.”
So only for a little while? All this offset stuff is just temporary, and will have to go before too long. After that it’s going to be all cold cold turkey, and big time. ZDF on Günther’s warning:
I was afraid of that. First I was a waste sinner, and now I’m a climate sinner. Our Father, give me my daily CO2. Forgive me for my trespasses, and deliver me from climate change. Yours is the state, nature and the CO2 budget for eternity. Amen.
I’ll say Amen to that too.

Page 2 story in Bild today! The first of a series.

“THE CO2 LIES … pure fear-mongering … should we blindly trust the experts?”

That’s what Germany’s leading daily Bild (see photo) wrote in its print and online editions today, on the very day that renowned publisher Hoffmann & Campe officially released a skeptic book – one written by a prominent socialist and environmental figure.
This is huge. More than I ever could have possibly imagined. And more is coming in the days ahead! The Bild piece was just the first of a series.
Mark this as the date that Germany’s global warming movement took a massive body blow.
Today, not one, but two of Germany’s most widely read news media published comprehensive skeptical climate science articles in their print and online editions, coinciding with the release of a major climate skeptical book, Die kalte Sonne (The Cold Sun).
Germany has now plunged into raucus discord on the heated topic of climate change
What has set it all off? One of the fathers of Germany’s modern green movement, Professor Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, a social democrat and green activist, decided to author a climate science skeptical book together with geologist/paleontologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning. Vahrenholt’s skepticism started when he was asked to review an IPCC report on renewable energy. He found hundreds of errors. When he pointed them out, IPCC officials simply brushed them aside. Stunned, he asked himself, “Is this the way they approached the climate assessment reports?”
Vahrenholt decided to do some digging. His colleague Dr. Lüning also gave him a copy of Andrew Montford’s The Hockey Stick Illusion. He was horrified by the sloppiness and deception he found. Persuaded by Hoffmann & Campe, he and Lüning decided to write the book. Die kalte Sonne cites 800 sources and has over 80 charts and figures. It examines and summarizes the latest science.
Conclusion: climate catastrophe is called off
The science was hyped. The book started hitting the bookshops today and has already hit no. 1 on the Amazon.de list for environment books. Indications show that it will climb very high in the overall bestseller charts. It’s published by a renowned publishing house and is now sending shock waves through the German climate science establishment. The first printing will produce 20,000 copies. I expect they will sell out rather quickly.
Today Germany’s national tabloid Bild (which has a whopping circulation of 16 million) devoted half of page 2 on an article called:
THE CO2 LIE
Renowned team of scientists claim the climate catastrophe is fear-mongering by politics“

The widely read Bild will follow with the rest of the series in the days ahead. In part I today Bild presents “What the IPCC of the UN doesn’t tell you.” Bild asks “what if the IPCC is wrong? Can we really blindly trust these experts? Are they really independent?”
Bild then writes:
The phenomenal prognoses of heat from the IPCC are pure fear-mongering.”
The Bild series is sure to cause radical environmentalists to seethe and lash out. Expect an all-out assault in the days and weeks ahead. Already the reaction from activists has been swift and virulent – though they have yet to read the book.
They never wanted the debate – and now the dam has broken
And the floods of skepticism are sweeping over the country. Worse, Germany’s flagship weekly news magazine Der Spiegel today also featured a 4-page exclusive interview with Vahrenholt, where he repeated that the IPCC has ignored a large part of climate science and that IPCC scientists exaggerated the impact of CO2 on climate. Vahrenholt said that by extending the known natural cycles of the past into the future, and taking CO2’s real impact into effect, we should expect a few tenths of a degree of cooling.
At a press conference today in Berlin, Vahrenholt, Lüning and publisher Hoffmann & Campe introduced the book and answered reporters’ questions. When asked why Hoffmann & Campe decided to publish “such a book”, the spokesman simply answered that the time is right – and there’s a real audience for the book. Even the weather timing was right! Germany is now experiencing it’s worst cold snap in 26 years. That makes it hard to deny lack of warming.
It needs to be pointed out Vahrenholt and Lüning are not skeptics; they are lukewarmers who have not been able to find any evidence of a coming climate catastrophe. They believe that man should switch to renewables, but do so in a rational manner: “Work fast, but don’t hurry.”
Skeptic readers should not think that the book will fortify their existing skepticism of CO2 causing warming. The authors agree it does. but have major qualms about the assumed positive CO2-related feed-backs and believe the sun plays a far greater role in the whole scheme of things.
The book cites more than 800 sources – including the latest peer-reviewed literature. It includes more than 80 graphics that clearly illustrate that all is not well with the claims made by alarmist science. It is written so that laymen can easily digest the material and it provides a comprehensive overview of the science and where it stands today.
The book has also infuriated the AGW leadership in Germany. For example, academia. University of Osnabrück took the step of dis-inviting Professor Vahrenholt who was scheduled to give a speech on February 8. The University claimed that Vahrenholt’s skeptical views were “provocative”. Also the centre-left SPD party, where Vahrenholt is a member, has been deafeningly silent.
This cat is out of the bag – and it’s not going back in.
The authors have set up a website for Die kalte Sonne here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreen Radio of the Umweltbundesamt – UBA – (German Federal Department of the Environment) recently had a radio interview with Henrik Kirchhof, some climate expert for the UBA I guess. Topic: Why has there been no warming in 15 years? 
The German government finally concedes.
The host of the interview starts by telling the audience that “climate scientists have come under pressure because the average temperature indeed has not risen in 15 years“. Kirchhof:
In the years leading up to the year 2000, the temperature curve rose very sharply. But since then it isn’t rising so, in fact it’s not rising at all, the curve. The average temperature has stagnated at a very high level – we sort of have a plateau, and that during a time when CO2 emissions have risen considerably.”
Kirchhof then claims the 15-year period of stagnation is indeed relatively short, and, to add authority to this, Prof. Jochem Marotzke of the warmist Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg provides an audio comment:
What we are seeing here is a relatively short-term fluctuation, If one really wants to know how CO2 and global temperature are related, then you have to look at a longer time period.”
Marotzke refuses to say how long, though. We do know that CO2 was at about 280 ppm for 1000 years before the Industrial Revolution, and that during this time the global temperature fluctuated more than 1°C (in sync with solar activity). Of course Marotzke only wants to go back to 1900, as beyond that there is no correlation with CO2.
Kirchhof then adds (my emphasis):
…there is no doubt about the greenhouse effect, but even so this warming pause is remarkable because the climate scientists with all their models did not expect this.”
At this point Kirchhof of Green radio of the German Federal Department of the Environment are finally admitting that there are suddenly many more unknowns than they first thought, that the warmist scientists are indeed baffled, and that the science is not settled after all.
At the 2-minute mark, a somewhat surprised host is forced to ask how can it be that the temperature has not risen even though more CO2 is being emitted into the atmosphere. Here Kirchhof, in summary, admits they don’t know why:
Yeah, that’s the big question. The scientists here are not completely sure. But there are many possible explanations.”
Many possible explanations? That means they don’t have freaking clue! When it comes to complex systems like climate, it takes years and years of analyses and observation to untangle it all. Kirchhof (my emphasis):
A big role may be played by the oceans, which possibly are absorbing more heat, and so the additional heat is no longer being taken up by the atmosphere but instead is moving into the water. This can be measured. However if these surface water temperatures increased sharply until 15 years ago but now have stagnated, then it means that the ocean is absorbing more heat than it did before. You can suspect this, it’s very plausible, but you cannot prove it because of methodology reasons, says Jochem Marotzke.”
Marotzke:
The problem is, although it is plausible, and it is in principle in agreement with model calculations, the problem is that we do not have enough good measurements from the past to say: ‘Ah, back then the deep oceans absorbed less heat and today it is taking in more heat. These observations are simply missing.”
It makes us wonder with so much missing data and so many unknowns, how could they even have dared to think the science was settled a few years ago? Suddenly they tell us they don’t know squat, that they are completely baffled, and that they are scrambling for explanations!

The host then asks Kirchhof if there are other possible explanations. Kirchhof:
Yes. For example they have measured that the stratosphere has gotten drier. And when there is less water vapor up there in the stratosphere, then less heat is radiated back down. However, the scientists who have found this out have themselves said this effect is too small and only accounts for a quarter of the stopped warming.”
They can’t find the heat. Unknowns, mysteries, surprises…such is the life of a closed-minded climate scientist. But apart from all that, they are sure of the science.
The host then asks about the remaining three quarters of the heat. Kirchhof plays the aerosol card, which the IPCC loves to play whenever cooling isn’t supposed to happen, like from 1945 to 1975:
Yes. there’s also a third theory that sounds plausible for laypeople, namely that more dust particles, ‘dirt’ in everyday terms, is high up in the atmosphere. As a result, less solar radiation reaches the Earth and so as a whole it gets cooler.”
Kirchhof then goes on to say that Chinese and Indian power plants may be to blame for this, and says that polluting the atmosphere is not the way to solve climate change.
The host then brings up the excellent question of how long a pause in warming is necessary before climate scientists really have to rethink their science. Kirchhof:
There are in fact prognoses that this plateau could go on another five years, and if that indeed occurs, and meteorologist Jochem Marotzke also says the same, then there is something seriously wrong with the models, also when certain fluctuations cannot be precisely forecast.”
Five more years and all their arguments will disappear. And in ten years the climate scientists are going to be left standing there looking like total asses – because it’s not going to get warmer for another 30 years. The PDO, AMO and sun are all now beginning their cold phases simultaneously. One only needs to look at the past winters to see the first indications. If one major volcano blows then we are very likely back to the Little Ice Age conditions of the 17th century.
========================================
UPDATE: Meteorologist Joe Bastardi just tweeted: “IF THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE 1950S THEY WOULD SEE THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR
THEIR BLUNDER”
========================================
The models would have had much better results had the scientists taken the ocean cycles into account. But they refused to consider them because the warming that occurred from 1980 to 2000 would have had to be assigned in part to the warm phase of the ocean cycles, and correspondingly less so for CO2. The scientists were too obsessed with blaming every warming on CO2. Result: the climate scientists are left standing on the verge of humiliation today. All this is explained in detail by Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning in their book: Die kalte Sonne.
It should therefore come as no surprise that the only model that is correct today so far is the one proposed by Lüning and Vahrenholt, who took ocean and solar cycles into account. The UBA would do the German taxpayers a huge favor by reading this book.
Also crackpot scientists out there should really think twice before opening up their big, alarmist mouths in the near future. Us skeptics aren’t going to let you off the hook by any means in 5 years time. Whether you get tarred and feathered in 2020 depends on what you say today. Do you really want to become the David Viners and Mojib Latifs of the future?
Amazingly, the alarmist scientists are looking at everything except what’s really obvious: the sun. Solar activity during the 20th century was at it’s highest level in 500 or more years, but today it is at its lowest level in some 200 years. Gee, you think that could matter? The data clearly show that it did in the past.
To sum it up, it is amusing to see the UBA all baffled, surprised, and now scurrying for explanations. My feeling is that unless certain people smarten up real quick, there is going to be a lot to laugh about in the years ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAngela Merkel and the German government once declared the lofty aim of putting one million electric cars on German streets in a bid on how to show the world how to be environmentally responsible.

One for the history books. Electric cars cannot compete in Germany – even 108 years later.
But today they admit they will not even come close to reaching this target. In fact experts say Germany faces a new challenge: how to ensure a basic supply of electricity to its homes and businesses this winter, forget about powering a million cars with electricity in addition!
Not long ago, Germany’s energy generation and distribution system globally was second to none when it came to reliability, price and stability, making the country an attractive location for energy-intensive, high-tech industry. Germany was even a net exporter of power.
But then the government and media, having succumbed to mass climate and nuclear hysteria, made a rash, blind leap into alternative energies, particularly sun and wind. Electricity prices have been skyrocketing ever since and the supply of power has become unstable and expensive.
Larger companies are now moving out.
Germany’s power generation and distribution infrastructure has taken a massive hit because of the conversion to renewable energies. In just a few short years electricity has become one of the most expensive in the world and experts are now placing even bets that the grid will not be able to avert a blackout this winter. So far and so fast have the mighty fallen.
The Local quotes the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung:
The hype is over. The high expectations for electric cars, which have no carbon dioxide emissions, has been replaced by huge disappointment, the paper wrote.”

The proposed 270 billion per year plan (€10.8 trillion total by 2050) for Europe to reach its target of becoming a low-carbon economy and society presented by Climate Commissar Connie Hedegaard yesterday has received a cool reception.
While the industry says not no fast – it’s too expensive, the environmentalists are complaining that it is not fast enough and does not allow them to take over Europe as its dictators.
The plan presented yesterday in Brussels is widely known as the EU Commission Low Carbon Roadmap, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 percent of 1990 levels by 2050. Interim targets have also been set: 25% by 2020, and 40% by 2030.
Europe’s emissions have gone down by 16% over the past two decades and the EU economy has grown by 40%. But much of that CO2 reduction came from shutting down the old communist mismanaged industry of former Warsaw Pact countries after the Berlin Wall fell in late 1989.
Ridiculous argument
The EU climate commissars are encouraging Europe to take more action, some even resorting to ludicrous logic, like Connie Hedegaard – quoted by Environment News Service:
We need to start the transition towards a competitive low carbon economy now. The longer we wait, the higher the cost will be. As oil prices keep rising, Europe is paying more every year for its energy bill and becoming more vulnerable to price shocks. So starting the transition now will pay off.”
She’s saying: let’s switch over to expensive alternatives right away and really pay through the nose right now. That way we won’t have to worry about paying for higher-priced oil in the future!

And this low carbon-living isn’t going to make Europe more competitive, either. To be competitive energy has to be affordable and its supply steady. It’s not for nothing many countries are cutting back subsidies to wind and solar.
Non-binding
The EU Commission’s Low Carbon Roadmap outlines a vast number of criteria for meeting the the targets: smart meters, renovation of buildings, thermal insulation, energy efficient machines, expansion of solar and wind energy, etc. But environmental groups were disappointed by the plan as a whole. Klimaretter blogsite writes (emphasis added):
The proposals of the Commissar were “unacceptable” said WWF energy expert Regine Günther: ‘The Commission views an emissions reduction of 25% as possible’, but did not make it binding, says Günther. “Without any clear ambitious target requirements, the European economy will lose the competitive leadership in markets for energy efficiency and renewable energy in the near future.’ “
What’s bad news for the eco-dictators is of course good news for EU citizens. Sorry, but many of us don’t think that spending €10.8 trillion for a few tenths of a degree Celsius is worth it. Besides, whatever CO2 Europe saves in the decades ahead will be wiped out by China and India CO2 growth in just a few months.
Meanwhile others are biting off their fingers. Environment News Service:
Friends of the Earth’s Head of Climate Change Mike Childs said, ‘If these plans go ahead, European governments are effectively abandoning any realistic hope of keeping global temperatures rises below two degrees, locking us into catastrophic climate change.’ ”
‘If the EU is serious about tackling climate change it must slash its emissions by 40 percent by 2020, without buying carbon credits from abroad,’ said Childs.”
Words of an eco-dictator.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo days ago I wrote here about how a scheduled presentation by Professor Dr Fritz Vahrenholt had been cancelled by the University of Osnabrück because of his controversial climate catastrophe skeptical book, Die kalte Sonne, which will be released next week by renowned publisher Hoffmann & Campe of Hamburg.The original public announcement of Vahrenholt’s presentation read: “In the series of presentations ‘University Speeches’ of the University of Osnabrück, Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt – RWE Innogy, Essen will hold a speech titled ‘The Climate Catastrophe is not Taking Place’.”
However, since the book and controversy have been making waves in Germany, the University of Osnabrück suddenly deemed such climate science skepticism as too “provocative”, and therefore refused to allow the presentation to be made unless a “counter-speaker” and a “competent moderator” were present. But because there was not enough time to organize it, the University cancelled Vahrenholt’s presentation at the last minute.
In the cancellation notification released by Professors Asholt and Altendorf, they claimed they had actually requested the topic of “Options for the Future Energy Supply of Germany”, and that Vahrenholt “surprised” them with the provocative title: “The Climate Catastrophe Is Not taking Place” just 3 weeks before the scheduled presentation.”
BS of course. The U of Osnabrück had known about the real topic long before, and not just 3 weeks ago. And so in an e-mail sent to NTZ, Prof Vahrenholt wishes to set the record straight. He wrote the following to Asholt and Altendorf:
Last year you happily accepted our topic of choice: ‘The Climate Catastrophe Is Not Taking Place’ and we agreed on a date for the presentation. You then informed my assistant just a few days ago, because of pressure from the University management, that I would only be allowed to speak under the condition that I accept a counter-position to be presented at the event, e.g. by Mr. Schellnhuber.”
Also in the cancellation Professors Asholt and Altendorf suggested Vahrenholt had agreed to a new date for the event. Vahrenholt writes that too is false:
We specifically informed you that I would not be available for such an event. And now that I was dis-invited by the University just 7 days before the event was scheduled to take place, I am no longer available for any other event. The entire matter is already bad enough. Hence I request that I no longer be misused as camouflage for the real motive behind my dis-invitation.”
Obviously The University of Osnabrück was less than truthful about the motives behind its dis-invitation. When University professors start distorting stories and camouflaging real motives, then indeed Prof Vahrenholt’s decision to no longer have anything more to do with them is more than warranted.
Makes you wonder if you can believe anything that comes from the two U of Osnabrück’s professors.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago, biofuels were vigorously pushed with great enthusiasm and urgency by environmentalist groups, for example Greenpeace here:
Instead of cutting tax on fuels that wreck the climate, Gordon Brown should use this week’s budget to boost genuine green fuels like biodiesel, hydrogen and green electricity.
And Greenpeace here:
Although the plant-based fuel is not pollution-free, it is significantly cleaner than its petro equivalent and causes just half the damage to the climate.
Or take a look at this April 2007 Greenpeace Fact Sheet here. And so it was with many environmental groups.
And as a result, governments, pressured by the enviro-groups, and ever so eager to rescue the planet from the imminent climate catastrophe, went hog wild implementing programs and subsidies to launch the biofuels boom. The targets were ambitious.
By 2020 9.5% of Europe’s demand for fuel by its transportation sector would be supplied by biofuels made from climate-friendly sources like oilseed, palm oil, sugar cane or sugar beet. It became a boom for Europe’s agriculture. Thousands of farmers have since invested heavily in new agricultural machinery.
The race to be the greenest in Europe, and the whole world, was on.  The science of global warming was settled after all, and biofuels were a big part of the answer. Europe would lead the way in the planet’s rescue and be the hero.
Things have since gone terribly wrong.

Now, it turns out, according to the newest study (by the very groups that spurred the madness on to begin with), Europe’s targets are going to have the opposite effect on the planet. Fulfilling its biofuels plan will mean converting 69,000 square km of forests into agricultural land – that’s an area twice the size of Belgium.
Not surprisingly, few bothered to question the science behind global warming and the possible impacts biofuels would have on the earth’s ecosystems and food markets. Those  who did, were vilified and slapped down. Us sceptics are all too familiar with that.
Today the German online Mananger Magazine reports here:
According to a new study, the planned expansion of agricultural land for biolfuel will damage the climate more than the fossil energies they are supposed to replace. Millions of tonnes more CO2 have been released as a result.
Manager Magazine writes that nine major environmental organisations have commented on a new study put out by the London-based Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) saying biofuels will produce far more CO2 instead of less.
The growing use of biofuels in Europe will lead to an increase in climate damaging CO2 emissions because huge tracts of land will have to be transformed into agricultural crop fields worldwide to supply the needed biofuel.
IEEP researchers studied the official renewable energy plans of the 23 EU member countries up to 2020. Germany will be mixing 5.5 million tonnes of biofuel with its gasoline and diesel fuel.
As a result this means that annually up to 56 million tonnes of CO2 will emitted. That equals an additional 12 to 26 million cars on Europe’s streets.
A far more damning commentary appears here at the European Voice:
The next time Europe comes up with an idea to save the planet – run!!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe 5th Arctic Frontiers Conference in Tromsø, Norway recently took place with about 1000 scientists attending from all over the world (another big footprint). But except for a few fringe media outlets, no one listened. So I thought I’d lend these poor desperate alarmist scientists a favour and help them get their message out.
This year’s motto for the conference was dubbed: “Tipping Points”. The German online, leftist TAZ daily wrote a piece called:
The Blind Spots Of Climate Scientists
The article of course is another spread-the-panic piece that claims the climate could reach a tipping point at a certain temperature, this according to “leading scientists”. This is so shocking that Norway’s foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre was compelled to say:
 “The scientists are warning us that we are approaching a condition where the Arctic ecological system is about to collapse.”
Scientists warn that the tipping point is rapidly approaching because a number of “tipping components” are already in action, namely the melting of sea ice, which reduces albedo and leads to warming of the ocean. There’s also the thawing of the permafrost, which leads to the release of methane gas, which…and so on. And TAZ reminds us of the Greenland ice pack:
“If the ice on Greenland disappeared, oceans would rise seven meters globally – but that would take thousands of years, because the ice in the middle is 2 km thick.”
I thought Greenland’s ice was three km thick. Has 1 km already melted away? Oceanographer Carlos M. Duarte of the Spanish research centre Imedia says:

With a melting of Arctic sea ice, the ‘tipping point’ would already be exceeded. Beginning in the year 2020, an Arctic in the summer months that is practically without ice most likely cannot be averted.
Perhaps Mr Duarte is not aware, but the Arctic core has gained 2000 CUBIC KILOMETERS of ice since 2007. That would be 4 million sq km of equivalent additional ice half a meter thick. Add that to the current sea ice area!
Greenland melts with another 0.4°C of warming
Wherever alarmism and end of the world scenarios are fantasised, one can expect to find Stefan Rahmstorf of Germany’s alarmist Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research. TAZ quotes Rahmstorf:
New research could yield that the targeted limitation of global warming to 2°C will not be enough, says oceanographer Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research: It’s possible that Greenland’s ice already could melt irrevocably with a rise of 1.3 to 2.3°C, which is what still unpublished research indicates. In its 2007 report, the IPCC spoke of 1,9 to 4.6°C. Already now the global temperatures have risen on average 0.8 to 0.9°C .
So as TAZ reports it, Rahmstorf is claiming that Greenland could melt with just another 0.4°C of warming. TAZ mentions “still unpublished research”. Perhaps this is new research from Rahmstorf that’s designed to salvage his already discredited claims of 1.8 metres of sea level rise by 2100. Does that mean we should expect another piece of panic science from Rahmstorf to appear in an upcoming Nature issue.
What is needed is an early warning system for a climate tipping, say the scientists. But TAZ reports  that the scientific basis is still missng for such a system – there are so called blind spots. Oran R. Young, Professor at the University of Santa Barbara:
Our problem is not that we have too little data. We have to find out which data is relevant. We need just a few but decisive indicators.”
Blind spots? I’d say dead zones would be more accurate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother of Germany’s leading dailies, DIE WELT, has a skeptical piece (for a change) on global warming – written by Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch. Read here. It starts:
The claim that man was causing global warming has long been said to be irrefutable. But this is contradicted by renown scientists but also by the latest data.”
My how the times have changed. Remember how just a few years ago the debate was over and the science was settled? Die Welt reminds us:
In the middle of the last decade, former UN Secretary Kofi Annan handed down the final verdict: ‘The few skeptics who are left and trying to sow the seeds of doubt should be seen for what they are: out of touch, depleted of arguments and washed up.’ Since then, much has changed“
But today, once written off skeptical scientists are now re-emerging. Maxeiner and Miersch write:
Svensmark, whose research in this field had long been ignored, is now causing people to change their minds. Those who are convinced of anthropogenic climate change have suddenly gotten much more careful. And those who kept their doubts hidden, have suddenly become braver.”
Take Professor Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning, for example. DIE WELT is just the latest major media outlet to put controversial, new skeptical book Die kalte Sonne in the public focus, following right on the heels of FOCUS magazine and DIE ZEIT. This early media attention is likely just a preview of what is to come in the days and weeks ahead.
For many establishments this is all going to cause some major indigestion, like the University of Osanbrück, for example.  Maxeiner & Miersch write:

This politically correct field of science still has not gotten used to the new situation. When the University of Osnabrück found out that Vahrenholt wanted to speak about his book at his scheduled speech, he was promptly dis-invited. The reason: It was necessary to first organize a the counter-speech by a climate scientist.
Just one problem. One couldn’t be found.”
Maxeiner and Miersch should have mentioned that the University of Osnabrück also deemed skepticism of the climate catastrophe as “provocative”.
The book comes out next week. I’m quite excited about how the greenheads and alarmist kooks are going to react.
Chronic insistence of the “climate catastrophe” is not really normal
Normally the book ought to be good news. It’s a powerful argument that the climate catastrophe is not coming and that the science underpinning the theory of a coming climate catastrophe is pathetically weak, crappy, and so cannot be taken seriously at all.
But oddly, from a psychological point of view, the chronic alarmists appear obsessed with the end of the world, and actually seem to hope that it will come. And it’s as if it couldn’t come soon enough for them. If I were like that, I’d seek professional help and counseling. That’s just not healthy.
This reminds me of all the elite kooks now down in Antarctica claiming the ice there is melting faster than ever. Yet, the data shows the contrary – ice growth trending up over ther last 30 years!

Der Spiegel reports on the growling-ever-louder Indonesian Merapi volcano in an article titled: Geologists Warning of Mega-Eruption of Merapi. Hat-tip to reader Ike.

The Merapi eruptions are becoming more violent – and the big bang could be just ahead. The Indonesian volcano has been spewing 800°C ash clouds for days.

According to Der Spiegel, 122 people have been killed, most on Friday. “Merapi is among the most dangerous volcanoes,” says geo-scientist Volker Steinbach of the German Federal Administration for Geoscience and Raw Materials (BGR). Der Spiegel adds:
Friday’s eruption is its worst this decade, says the chief geologist of the Energy Administration, Raden Sukhyiar, in the “Jakarta Post”. The biggest known eruptions occurred in 1006, 1369, 1786, 1822, 1872 – destroying a large number of villages – and 1930 when 1300 people perished.
Investigations of the volcano have revealed that an unprecedented Magma reservoir lurks underneath it, says Birger Lühr, a volcano researcher at the GFZ in Potsdam, Germany.
A rough estimate indicates that there is three times more magma than what was ejected by the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815 – the biggest eruption in the last 10,000 years, which led to a cooling of the climate globally.
Geoscientists aren’t sure what to make of this huge magma reservoir. As Der Spiegel reports, they are hesitant to make predictions of catastrophe (That’s only done in climate science, even though the odds are far less).

Word of a ‘mega-eruption’ is making the rounds among scientists. But apparently they are avoiding the use of the word to avoid being labelled preachers of disasters. ‘We can only speculate what the volcano will do,’ says Birger Lühr. Merapi is hardly predictable.

History shows, however, that volcanoes in Indonesia have a worrisome potential for catastrophic eruptions. Nature cannot be controlled. It can only be coped with.

I’ve decided to be generous and to move his comment and make it a post. Maybe other readers here can help him (her) out.
Comment by reader JC Smith:
Yes…..global cooling.  Wouldn’t that be nice.  Let’s just ignore the facts, and click our shoes together and tell ourselves that global cooling is in.
For anyone curious about FACTS, you can look at this link at NOAA:  http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/records/
For the last 365 days in the US, the daily high temp records have exceeded the daily minimum temp records by a ratio of 3.3 to 1.0 (29,298 to 8,968 as of 02/03 in the morning).  If you look at just the LAST MONTH…it is even worse.

Over the last 30 days, there have been 2,949 new daily high records (ie highs for a specific day) while there have only been 160 new daily low records.  The ratio is almost 20 to 1, new high records to new low records.
Aberdeen, South Dakota set a new record high for January 5th of 63 degrees which beat the old record or 46 degrees by 17 degrees.  Phillip, South Dakota set a new record high 74 degrees which beat the old record of 46 degrees by 28 DEGREES.  Think about that for a minute.  A new record high which was 28 degrees HIGHER than the old record high for January 5th (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/plains-bask-in-historic-record-warm-weather/2012/01/06/gIQAZleBfP_blog.html).
Global warming has been happening for at least the last 120 years.  For the last 30 years, it has gotten worse.  The last 30 days are “off the charts” as far as record high temperatures go.
So, please show me some FACTS with LINKS, that show me that global cooling is taking place.  I look forward to seeing them.”
Quite the powerful evidence you present here, JC. Even the most talented of defense attorneys surely would be trembling in their shoes just from its sheer caliber.
You’ll get your facts and links. The question is: are you even going to listen?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe widespread frigid cold gripping Asia and Europe is illustrated by the following chart (Source here) .
Media outlets have reported that this is the worst February cold wave to hit Europe and western Russia in 25 years. Dozens have frozen to death over the last few days.
So it goes without saying that the warmists at their websites are truly desperate for an explanation – any explanation will do. It turns out that all the cold is caused by global warming, the warmist sites and one institute are now claiming. And, the global warming is going to cause winters to get even colder in the future, they say.
Their level of desperation is clearly illustrated by their most recent absurd claims to explain the cold. The reason for all the cold, writes warmist site klimaretter.de (climate rescuer) emphasis added:
It’s going to get much colder. So far 70 people have frozen to death in Central Europe, but this is only the start of the effects of global warming: The less summertime  ice coverage there is in the Arctic, the higher the probability is for Arctic cold in the following winter in Munich, Dresden, Potsdam, Warsaw or Kiev. That’s the result of a study from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Sciences.”
The same rubbish is also being spewed by warmist site Klima der Gerechtigkeit (Climate of Justice). Both of these hard-up sites are referring to an Alfred Wegener Institute paper I mentioned a few days ago here.

Altered States
So how does a little local Arctic summertime warming freeze half the globe? The Alfred Wegener Institute says that in the summertime the warming melts the Arctic ice, which leads to a more exposed Arctic Ocean, which in turn then can release heat into the atmosphere. This heated atmosphere then triggers altered atmospheric dynamics that morph into massive widespread frigid cold waves sweeping down all over the northern hemisphere 6 months later.
You see, the situation was reversed back in the 1960s and 70s when all the extra summertime Arctic ice coverage led to all them warm Eurasian winters – you know – the ones with all the snow and cold in Europe?
Altered atmospheric dynamics where a little warm triggers massively amplified cold?
I’d say the Alfred Wegener Institute has become that weird little laboratory in that early 1980s film Altered States. Climate science trips, sensory deprivation, hallucinations, dormant genes – it’s all there folks!

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeo Hickman of the Guardian’s Environment blog Friday had a frustration-filled, teeth-gnashing screed where he expressed his disdain over so many skeptic blogs being nominated for the best Science & Technology Category of the Weblog Awards 0f 2013.

Source: Weblog Awards site.
He accuses the climate skeptics of “gaming” the competition because they’ve succeeded in generating so much enthusiasm.
It was tough not to gloat reading that piece. It’s indeed a good look at a sour grapes display by the increasingly defeated looking alarmist side, now that they see they have got no chance of winning. Of the five finalists, four are skeptic blogs. The sole remaining alarmist blog, Skeptical Science, has dropped out.
On the long list of 17, thirteen were climate science skeptics (including NoTricksZone).

If anything, the Weblog Awards results tell us one thing: the alarmist blogs have a very, very serious problem. The problem (for them) is that nobody is listening to their message any more. And, except for themselves, nobody else even has an inkling of enthusiasm left to nominate them, let alone to vote. They’re rapidly sinking into irrelevance.
The problem boils down to credibility. You can only cry wolf so many times before people ignore you totally and think you’ve completely lost your marbles. The hysterical shrieks of a world-ending climate collapse are looking more ridiculous today than ever, and many are finding it simply too embarrassing to be associated with.
The Guardian laments that it didn’t even know who some of the blogs on the long list were. Well, whose fault is it for that ignorance? Should we be surprised to hear this from a media outlet that appears ignorant of hundreds of peer-reviewed papers showing that CO2 is way over-hyped? If the Guardian had done its homework, it wouldn’t be standing there appearing so clueless. Reporting means getting both sides of the story, and not just the part you agree with and ignoring all the rest.
The skeptics on the other hand are energized, enthusiastic, and their numbers are growing by the day. Little wonder they are mopping up at the Weblog Awards. If a blog can generate that type on enthusiasm among readers, well, then it deserves to win. It gets down to having the ability to capture and engage an educated audience, and to do so without resorting to spectacular tabloidish claims of a dramatic global meltdown.
The alarmist/hysterical climate blogs have been so out-classed that those left (Skeptical Science) are now hightailing it out of the ring. Like when it comes to debating climate science in public, they are willing to step into the ring only if the fight is rigged in a way that ensures they’ll win – quality and science be damned.
PS: Thanks to readers for having nominated NoTricksZone. Being on the list of the top 17 is already a great success.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman national daily Die Welt here reports on the desolate state of Germany’s renewable energies, particularly solar and biofuel, written by Daniel Wetzel.
Once believed to hold the key to future jobs and prosperity, renewable energies in Germany are now emerging as a complete flop and a national embarrassment.
Coming on the heels of the solar industry collapse, now comes the end of the bio-fuel industry, so reports Die Welt.

For years the transition to renewable energies was sold as an industrial political project: In the sector of renewable energy hundreds of thousands of jobs would be created, they claimed. […] It’s time to put the visionary exuberance under a reality check. The number of jobs in the sector of renewable energy is again shrinking.”

“$130 billion solar flash in the pan”
Germany’s green industry collapse is happening faster than anyone could have ever anticipated, and has caught the media by surprise. Die Welt writes:

The German solar industry is dissolving faster than you can even see. One third of all companies disappeared from the market within one year. Solar power subsidies of more than 100 billion euros [$130 billion] over 20 years have led to only a mere flash in the pan. According to the official numbers, today there are barely 6000 employees in the German solar cell and module production.”

$130 billion for 6000 jobs? That works out to be over $20 million a job!

The cause of the solar energy collapse is in part due to the recent cuts in government subsidies (they’ve realized that it’s too expensive after all) and cheap imports from China.
Such is the miserable state of the solar industry in Germany. Wetzel then writes that also Germany’s highly subsidized bio-fuel industry is on the verge of collapse. In the link, Die Welt writes: “Biofuel production in Germany will likely completely collapse in just a few years.” and that leading German biofuel manufacturer Verbio AG in Saxony Anhalt “is deeply in the red for the first three quarters of its fiscal year” and that the company is reporting “a loss of 143 million euros since July 2012.”
Die Welt now telling readers “to critically question”
What’s especially peculiar is that Die Welt, once (and still is) a big believer of man-made climate change and green energies, seems to have developed sudden amnesia concerning it’s earlier positions on the issue. In the past the leading national daily often wrote highly supportive articles of the green movement, and aimed harsh words at climate science skeptics and green energy critics. Apparently, at least in its latest article, Die Welt now thinks it can lecture readers on the virtues of critical thnking:

The fall of both sectors is a reason to critically question whether it’s possible to usher in high-tech industries and employment miracles by using subsidies.”

My, how profound. Such amazing words of wisdom….and all coming after a mere 20 years and € 100 billion having been squandered.
We all I recall many reports from Die Welt warning of the coming climate apocalypse, and cheerleading for alternative energies like sun and biofuel. Now the once-green conservative daily wants us to “critically question”? Sorry Die Welt but you’re about a decade late, and so you can take a seat in the back.
I’m not blaming Wetzel here, who surely has written some critical pieces. My criticism is aimed at Die Welt’s naive editors. Hopefully they’ve woken up to reality and will soon stop believing the climate fairy tales spread by the PIK and other activist institutes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis has to be a short post as it’s 1 a.m. and I’m beat. The conference today ended at 9.30 and then I met up with some other German bloggers at the bar for a couple of drinks and good discussion.
The first day went very well with a slate of very interesting speakers. I feel it’s beginning to crumble, and I’m getting signals that some media outlets are beginning to shift gears. It only takes one domino to fall to get the rest of it going. The recent FOCUS feature was a sign.
None of the mainstream media outlets bothered to show up. But that’s okay becuase I scanned the headlines of all the big German newspapers while at the train station this morning, and they had nothing about Cancun! Summary: climate has lost its signficance – completely.
I’d say there were around 150 people attending today, with a good number of young faces, and so I was surprised by the turnout. Many of the talks today were about the cosmic radiation.cloud correlation. Scientists Henrik Borchert:
The German Weather Service has to start looking at their own data.”
One highlight was a live video feed of Lord Monckton and Roy Spencer from Cancun, who gave us a progress report there and we were able to ask questions directly.
I wanted to post a photo but I have to convert the photo and it’s too late. I’ll post more tomorrow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s little wonder that the German public is beginning an uprising against the mandatory fees that every citizen is forced to pay in order to fund the country’s vast public radio and television. Every year the widely hated GEZ shakes €8 billion from Germans. For German readers, here’s a stinging commentary on just how unbelievably arrogant the German public media has become.
But not only are listeners and viewers fed up with the burgeoning arrogance of the public media, but also by their outright deceit and political propaganda, which they feel is necessary to properly up bring citizens.
One reader provides us yet another example of this. Deutsche Welle (German Broadcasting) here provides its readers with the latest “news” on Fukushima. The elitists in the German public media feel it is one of their solemn duties to tell audiences that nuclear energy is evil, kills thousands, and that we are all supposed to hate it.
From the report we see Japan is waking up to the fact that providing power without nuclear plants is not an easy thing after all, and so the country is contemplating a U-turn and returning to nuclear power, less than 2 years after the Fukushima disaster.
Ministerpräsident Shinzo Abe, who took office just a few days ago, says Japan simply cannot afford to stop using nuclear power.
The DW report, whose source is the German Press Agency (DPA) among others, pretty much provides background information on the Abe’s decision. But it’s the last sentence in the DW report that raises eyebrows:
Through the devastating earthquake and subsequent tsunami, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Northeastern Japan was seriously damaged. There were meltdowns in three reactor blocks; thousands of people died. It was the worst nuclear catastrophe since the Chernobyl accident in 1986.”
Thousands of people died? Really?
Sadly, editors could not be bothered to check if that spectacular number could be right. One place to start a simple fact-check would be Wikipedia, which is known for political correctness. It turns out that the “thousands of people died” claim is totally bogus – deceit fabricated and now being spread by various European media outlets.

Wikipedia writes that of what few deaths did occur, 2 deaths were caused by “sustained multiple external injuries and were believed to have died from blood loss”, and a Japanese research company found that “other deaths were due to the disruption of hospital operations, exacerbation of pre-existing health problems and the stress of dramatic changes in life” and that “the vast majority of people who died during evacuation were elderly. 45 patients were reported dead after the evacuation of a hospital in Futaba due to lack of food, water and medical care as evacuation was delayed by three days.”
Wikipedia then goes on to write about some people being over-exposed to radiation, but nowhere does the report mention “thousands of people died”. In fact, the Wikipedia report writes (my emphasis):
As of September 2012, there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures.”
It appears that any radiation deaths show up only in models:
According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Jacobson, the radiation released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimater being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan.”
Quite surprisngly, Wikipedia then writes that nuclear power actually saves and extends lives – commenting on the numbers of people who died or may die from radiation exposure (emphasis added):

These numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.”

So the next time you pick up or hear any report coming from Germany’s elitist, forced publicly-funded media, don’t believe a damn word of it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow about just appeasing the gods with human sacrifices? That could work too.I just heard an interview on German NDR Info public radio with Mojib Latif, of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. Of course he was brought on to say that the “monster” Yasi “killer” cyclone hitting Australia and the “mega-blizzard” pounding the US and Canada are due to global warming.
The adjectives I use here are what the media today are using. Normally I just let this rubbish go, but he made a couple of points I feel are worth discussing and are indicative of the sad state to which the climate science field has devolved today.
The radio moderator asked him what’s behind these weather extremes? To me, Latif’s answer makes no sense. Maybe much of the audience is not familiar ENSO’s and so maybe that’s why Latif and the media keep getting away with it every time. His answer in a nutshell:
The mega storms can be traced back to the current La Nina, which is a cold surface temperature phenomena in the equatorial Pacific region. But behind that, is global warming.
That’s what he claimed. The weather extremes are caused by cool Pacific waters, which are consistent with global warming. He also reiterated the theory that global warming leads to more extreme storms, even though there is no data to support this. Call it the missing storms. They’re somewhere, and that they can’t be found is a travesty.
Actually, those who are not ignorant in the field know that the opposite is occuring – there are fewer storms today. What’s drastically higher is the media strom hype.
Accumulated Cyclone Energy is near a 30-year low. Where are the missing storms?
The second point I found amazing is Latif’s recommendation when asked if adaptation to climate change would work as a way to cope with extreme weather events. I haven’t yet found an audio link to the radio interview, so I’ll provide what he said in a nutshell:
Adaptation in the end will not work. It will be necessary for man to limit the earth’s temperature rise.”
And how does man regulate Mother Nature? By reducing CO2 emissions of course. That’s the rain dance that will appease the weather gods and make the big storms go away.
Hard to believe this guy is a scientist.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn reader comments yesterday, there was a little discussion about Peter Heller’s recap of the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy, here (German), which took place in Berlin last weekend.
Heller exposed a spy who had been sent over to check up on what was going down at the denier pow-wow on the other side of the Climate Science Iron Curtain. Heller writes:
In any case, by coincidence, I happened to sit down at lunch with a young lady, who outed herself as an employee of Hans Joachim Schellnhuber [PIK], completely forthright and without any reservation. She expressed her wonder at the political emphasis of the conference. She had obviously expected something esoteric and anti-science, probably, which would later allow her institute to gripe endlessly about. However, the conference offered none of that.”

For readers not familiar with PIK, it is the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which is directed by Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, and is the workplace for Stefan Rahmstorf and Wealth Redistributor Ottmar Edenhofer. It is, unfortunately, the primary scientific institute advising Angela Merkel on climate policy.
Obviously Schellnhuber didn’t want to be caught slumming it by being seen at such an event (or maybe he felt the risk of being caught peering through 2 holes cut in a copy of the Süddeutsche Zeitung was too high). So instead he opted to issue an underling an Ausreisegenehmigung (travel permit) to Denierland – with the mission to observe the capitalistically funded conference.
As a visiting blogger, I’m a little intrigued by all this. I’m told Greenpeace activists were sent over last year. This year we got a young spy. I view that as progress. The level of sophistication in dealing with skeptics is indeed climbing.
I can only speculate what may have gone through this young lady’s head as she listened to the speakers.
First of all, it must have made an impression on her that on the skeptic side of the Climate Iron Curtain people are much more positive and optimistic about the future, and not all mired in the doom, gloom and pessimism of the sort one finds at the PIK, where scientists constantly fret and wring their hands over the ever faster approaching climate catastrophe.
And working at the PIK, where a certain science dogma is rigidly enforced and nothing else is tolerated, she had to have appreciated the intellectual freedom that the skeptics enjoy, where everyone is free to think and express any view, and do so without fear of having to do time in a science gulag.
At RealClimate, how many scientists have had their comments deleted? How often do we hear Rahmstorf complain about newspapers openly expressing views he does not agree with? How many hours does Rahmstorf spend surfing the Internet in search of “denier” articles and rebutting them, smearing scientists as he does so?
Peter Heller writes that the political and economic emphasis at the conference appeared to confuse the young lady:
This seemed to be an aspect that she perceived as surprising. From our short discussion at the lunch table, she expected more a debate about climatic model certainty and the possibilities for their improvement. Instead, she was shown the risks that today’s climate protection policies entail, and the risks that politicians are willing to take and what their motives are. She did not want to accept the fact that climate policy in Germany is labelled with PIK, and carries the tags of Schellnhuber, Rahmstorf and Edenhofer, and that we certainly oppose these also with political arguments. Who, I ask myself, suffers here from cognitive dissonance?
It’s obviously all too much for the young lady, who by now has surely returned back to the PIK where she finds all the comforts that dogma and restricted intellectual freedom have to offer.

He also commented on the topic of global warming, see below.H/t: Benny Peiser, who starts with:
In a now disclosed Speech at the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has cast the integrity and credibility of the IPCC deeply into doubt and has called for an independent, scientific investigation of questionable practices.”
It goes without saying that the 92-year old chain-smoking Schmidt will say what is on his mind and couldn’t care less about any political retaliation or critique at this stage of his life, and so is free to speak openly. He starts by reminding us that the predictions made by Thomas Robert Malthus more than 200 years ago were false, and that many more people are being fed today than Malthus could have ever imagined.
Here it is clear that Schmidt’s focus is not on a climate that may occur in 100 years, but on today’s problems of over-crowded cities, sprawling urbanization and the threatof conflict if supply does not meet the needs. Schmidt also speaks about the challenges and “the total failure of bank supervision, supervisory boards, accountants, etc. with respect to the obscene practices of some banks, shadow banks, mortgage institutes and insurance companies.”
He then focuses on another challenge that mankind is claimed to be confronting: climate change. Schmidt says that the earth has gone through natural cycles of ice ages and warm periods, i.e. climate change is natural. He then says that nobody knows exactly what man’s contribution to warming really is, and then adds (emphasis added):
The documentation delivered so far by the international group of scientists (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) has been met with skepticism, particularly that some of the involved scientists have proven to be frauds. In any case the targets publically set by some of the governments have turned out to be less based on science. and based much more on politics. 
In my view it is time for one of our leading scientific elite organisations to take a hard critical and realistic look at the work of the IPCC, and thus explain in a clear manner the yielded conclusions to the public.”

I wonder if the scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)  are listening. Here Schmidt is clearly calling for a real, COMPETENT investigation by an independent expert body, and not a small group of corrupt hacks.
Schmidt points out that the development of new alternative energy is indeed a real challenge for science and research, as conventional supplies are not unlimited.
Here fundamental research is challenged to make regenerative energy sources as suitable alternatives.”
This statement is open to interpretation. Here he uses the adjective “suitable”. For me these energies first have to be made appropriate and reasonable for use. Committing economic suicide is not what I’d call “suitable”. More research on alternatives to make them affordable ? Yes! Forcing down half-baked expensive technologies with the false claim they are going to save the planet? No!
Schmidt also looks into the future and expresses his views on what to expect in the future:
–  there is not going to be an end to economic growth – technonological growth is unavoidable.
– there is not going to be any global food problems as growing crops and animals will continue to be successful, as gene technology will aid this.”
The full text of Schmidt’s speech can be found here (in German).

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m just the messenger, so don’t beat the crap out of me! Blame global warming for all the cold that’s in the pipeline.
Here are the temperature forecasts for the next 16 days for most continents and regions. Many are forecast to be below normal. As you click on each link below, you’re going to be seeing blue (except for Canada). But in the period 10-18 January, Canada too is going to cool down from a dark red to a pink.
East Asia will shiver in January. See link below. 
Now I am going out on a limb by saying these temperature conditions will extend through much of the month of January and February, with zones shifting here and there, thanks to La Nina.
All in all I heard Joe Bastardi forecast here December global temps to drop to about +0.15 to 0.20 above the normal. I say expect a similar drop for January, meaning we’ll be in negative territory. Same goes for February. There just seems to be lots of cold out there.
Here are the color-coded temperature forecasts for much of the land mass on the globe.
1. United States is projected to be well below normal from 2-9 January. And 10-18 January will be even colder. COLD!
2. Canada is projected to be well above normal from 2-9 January, But many regions will get closer to normal from 10-18 January. Sea ice will expand much. WARM!
3. Europe on the whole will be around average from 2-9 January. But the next cold wave is forecast to hit in another week to 10 days. That means Europe too will be well below normal from 10-18 January. COLD!
4. East Asia: Look at all the blue from from 2-9 January – well below normal. And it doesn’t get better from 10-18 January. COLD!
5. South Asia is projected to be well below normal from 2-9 January, and not much change from 10-18 January. COLD!

6. Central Asia is projected to be well below normal from 2-9 January in western China and north above it. The Middle east and Turkey will be normal to warm, and not much change from 10-18 January. COOL!
7. Middle East will be in general cool from 2-9 January with some warming from 10-18 January. NORMAL!
8. Africa will be generally cool from 2-9 January with some warming from 10-18 January. NORMAL!
9. South America is projected to be below normal from 2-9 January. And 10-18 January will be even colder. COLD!
10. Australia is projected to be normal from 2-9 January. But 10-18 January will be cooler. COOL!
11. Antarctica has been COOL too.
Total it up: 5 cold, 3 cool, 2 normal and only 1 warm. Let’s see Tricky Jim Hansen fudge this. It’ll be interesting to see the satellite numbers in the months ahead.
The Danish Meteorological Institute also shows a cold Arctic.
Interestingly, Joe Bastardi’s forecast of a cold winter in Turkey looks to be elusive. Yesterday it looked like he would be right, but the latest computer outputs appear to confirm Piers Corbyn’s latest forecast of another winter grip steamrolling over northern and central Europe instead.
Of course we should not forget the oceans. Lots of blue there too. All that barking about global warming and 2010 being so hot that we’ve been hearing is about to get muzzled. Enjoy the silence.

This is the real deal, with speakers like Fred Singer, Nir Shaviv and Henrik Svensmark on the roster.
More information here: 3rd International Energy and Climate Conference.
This conference is taking place concurrently with the United Nations Conference of Climate in Cancún. But in Berlin, leading international scientists in the fields of climate and energy will present the latest science and findings on climate and energy, and not the usual worn-out scare stories and dread.
This year will also include aspects of climate policy and their impacts. The conference thus covers a wide spectrum of natural science topics and the social-political impacts of energy policy.

Fred Singer 
I hope some readers here in Germany can still find a way to attend. I think it’ll be a highly worthwhile and interesting conference. Berlin is also lovely during Christmas-time – though it might be a good idea to leave the high-spending spouses home :).

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s bad enough that the environment is taking a hit from millions of acres of land being converted to a vast monoculture of maize to supply biogas plants and ethanol producers that are supposed to rescue the environment.

Food for saving the climate. Consumers get stuck with contaminated leftovers. Photo credit: Bill Whittaker, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
And it is morally questionable that today thousands of tonnes of maize are being taken off the plates of the world’s hungry in order to rescue them from a computer-modelled climate change in 2100.
If that wasn’t bad enough, now the maize that’s left for consumers in Germany is contaminated with cancer-causing Alfatoxin fungus. Bottom line: The good stuff gets burned, and we en up eating the toxic crap that’s left!
As maize farmers in Germany sell their harvests of top quality maize to subsidized biogas plants next door for conversion to biogas fuel, animal feed producers and food processing companies can no longer pay the high local prices and thus have to source the maize they need from foreign countries with low standards and dubious agricultural practices. Result: garbage winds up in the human food chain.
Today, all the major German media outlets are reporting on the discovery of thousands of tons of animal-feed contaminated with Alfatoxin fungus. These animals are for future meat and dairy products consumption.

News magazine Spiegel writes:
In Lower Saxony at least 10,000 tonnes of toxic maize feed are now in the feed chain. The goods originate from Serbia, and according to the Minister of Agriculture they are contaminated with the carcinogenic Aflatoxin fungus.”

The question many are now asking is: What is all this dangerous-grade maize feed from Serbia doing in Germany when so much of it is grown here locally? Europeans are burning the high quality maize and poisoning themselves to protect the climate!
Spiegel reports that up to 3500 beef livestock farms may be affected, supplied by 13 feedmills in Lower Saxony. Overall, up to 45,000 tonnes of feed may be involved.
Spiegel writes that Aflatoxin B1 “is one of the most carcinogenic substances in nature” and that the shipment from Serbia had a concentration that was 10 times higher than the allowable limit. The substance was first detected in contaminated milk.
Authorities claim that there is a little danger to consumers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterItaly is about to join the growing list of European countries cutting back subsidies to solar and wind energy, so reports the online Berlin TAZ.
A complete stop to solar energy and deep cuts in wind energy: Italy’s government passed a decree that could spell an abrupt end in the recently started renewable energy boom.”
This comes at the heels of a number of countries cutting back on solar subsidies throughout Europe – mainly due to their high costs to consumers and technical problems integrating these sources into the existing infrastructure.
Economics Minister Paolo Romani says that Italian citizens have had to pay 6 billion euros in subsidies so far. The solar subsidies were originally planned for the period from 2011 to 2013, but now will remain in effect only for systems installed before June 1, 2011. The law also stops solar plants with a capacity of over 1 MW from being built in the open countryside due to “landscape protection issues”.
Other countries like Spain have also implemented similar stops to the overly expensive renewable energy sources.
Italian subsidies had guaranteed operators of small-scale systems €0.47/kwh and large scale systems €0.34 /kwh for feeding the energy into the grid. Italy will also reduce subsidies paid to wind power. The leftist TAZ writes:
Here subsidies will be cut by 22%, and done so retroactively and thus apply to systems that are also in operation. This would deal a fatal blow. When the government redefines the subsidy rates whenever and however it feels, it makes reliable investment plans impossible.”
Good riddance to the eyesores that have only drained the pockets of consumers. More reading:

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I mentioned here how Stefan Rahmstorf spends more time organising PR campaigns than he does doing science (understandable I guess, as crystal ball gazing takes only a few minutes per day).
It took less than a day for him to confirm this observation.
EIKE posted here yesterday that ZDF television did a Frontal drive-by-shooting on the climate skeptics, particularly EIKE, and the Berlin Climate Conference, which took place last weekend. Of course, as is the case with all such attack reports of this kind, there’s always the same unhappy and increasingly nervous person behind it: Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research.
I was wondering what German readers think of the following ZDF clip:

Keep in mind that while almost all serious scientists say the sea level will rise around 30 cm over the next 90 years, Rahmstorf is one of the few oddballs who’s way out in left field, with a couple of other kooks like Al Gore, claiming sea levels will rise 1.4 meters or more.
Unfortunately for him, Jason/Topex shows a clear deceleration of sea level rise over the last years.
I’m wondering what the German readers think of the Frontal report.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately desperate global warming-obsessed scientists have been claiming that the recent cold winters are more evidence of global warming. Cold is caused by warming, they now insist.

Source: www.woodfortrees.org/trend
Well, why stop at just the last few winters? Let’s look at the whole planet over the whole year, and do so for the last 10 years. Doing so, I’ve found solid proof of global warming!
The plotted anomaly goes from .47 to .38°C over 10 years. That’s a drop of 0.09°C, which translates to about 1°C of cooling per century. That means the year 2100 will be back to Little Ice Age conditions. The warming is worse than we thought.
Of course, crackpot warmists will say that 10 years is not enough, that is unless the trend is the other way. Heck, for them one single storm is already enough for proof, let alone a few winters.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPhysicist Dr. Rainer Link brings our attention to the EU’s new 20/20/20 climate scheme designed to inflict intense pain on citizens with literally zero benefits, read it here at his German blog RL Rational (in German).
This 20/20/20 program aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020, and to increase the share of renewable energy to 20% – all to satisfy the needs of those suffering from rescue-the-planet delusions.
The questions of course are: How much is this EU scheme going to cost? And what are we going to gain from it?
The answers are respectively: a fortune and nothing. Next week Connie Heedegard, EU Climate Commissar, will release more on the costs. But this is no big secret. Last week I posted on this here: 15 Trillion Dollar Self Flagellation.
The $15 trillion dollars is of course will incur only if the madness goes uninterrupted until 2050. But until 2020, Dr. Link writes on how accenture and BARCLAYS Bank introduced a study called: Carbon Capital, Financing The Low Carbon Economy, which details the necessary expected costs needed to reach the 20/20/20 target.
Dr. Link then puts together a cost/benefit analysis of the 20/20/20 EU Climate Requirements and comes up with the numbers, read details here (in German).

Total cost of the reductions up to the year 2020: €2.9 trillion
Total CO2 emissions reduction by 2020: 2.2 billion tonnes
That comes to about €6400 per EU citizen. Dr. Link says although that may sound impressive when taken alone, the sheer stupidity and frivolity of it all becomes clear when you compare it to the CO2 emissions growth from developing countries and the rest of the world: Link writes of the 2.2 biilion tonne reduction:
During this time period it compares to a total global emissions of 320 billion tonnes. The global increase in CO2 emissions of 0.5 billion tonnes per year will wipe out the EU CO2 reduction (which will cost 2.9 trillion euros) in just four years.
Dr. Link then calculates how much of a global theoretical temperature reduction this will lead to. Answer:
0.002°C
It would be much cheaper if the EU just bought everyone an air conditioner. That 0.002°C can neither be measured by a standard home thermometer nor perceived by human senses. All because of two fairy tales: 1) CO2 is leading to climate catastrophe, and 2) Europe can save the planet.
Is there any politican left out there who’s got the spine to stand up to this madness?

Share this...FacebookTwitterNote there is no mention at all of “man-made” here.In the coming weeks Russian scientists plan to publish the results of their work on their investigation on the cause of the extremely hot 2010 Russian summer. This was reported yesterday in the German edition of Ria Novosti here.
The study was conducted by the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control (Rosgidromet), headed by Alexander Frolow, and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Both organizations analyzed the summer weather anomaly.
Ria Novosti writes:
According to Frolow, the situation was influenced by a group of causes, among them a stubborn high pressure area and an unfavorable combination of ocean temperature anomalies. The situation in the European part of Russia was worsened by dry winds coming from other regions.
According to estimates by the scientists, this weather  anomaly was caused 20% by global climate change.
Note there is no mention in the Ria Novosti report of “man-made climate change” – only “climate change”. Since climate is always changing naturally, in sync with other cycles like ocean and solar cycles, evidence of a human greenhouse gas fingerprint as the cause would seem to be impossible to discern.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHat tip Ron de HaanSo far it’s been a really cold winter for much of Europe, and so you’d think we’d be due for a little relief. Think again!
Although western Europe will enjoy some milder temps this weekend, it isn’t going to last long. Already next week the bitter cold will be back. This is just the kind of winter weather that not only paralyzes economic activity, but also wreaks havoc on streets and highways – freeze-thaw-freeze cycles that rip asphalt surfaces apart. Expect major damage this winter and huge potholes later on.
Joe Bastardi’s latest video Europe Gets Hit by Extreme Cold is not good news. By Tuesday night the cold will spread over Central and Western Europe. Bastardi:
By the time we get to the latter part of next week and on into the Christmas week, this is a severe event, no question about it.
We’re looking at a top 5 or 10 cold December.
I feel we should warn you, things are going to be real nasty in the next 2 weeks, and perhaps 3 weeks.”
To me this is okay. All them warmist representatives thinking they were going to enjoy sun, beach and warmth in Cancun found themselves shivering there in 100-year record cold. And now they can come back and disembark from their planes and into the cold reality in Europe, and wonder where all the warming is.
Hint: it’s in the models and your dumb heads, and nowhere else.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote here and here on how the junior partner (the FDP) of Angela Merkel’s coalition government has moved to block the re-appointment of Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber as the Chairman of the WBGU advisory council for another 4-year term.

WBGU advisory committee: Left to right: Nebojsa Nakicenovic, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber (Chairman), Inge Paulini (General Secretary), Claus Leggewie, Sabine Schlacke, Stefan Rahmstorf, Renate Schubert, Jürgen Schmid, Reinhold Leinfelder, Dirk Messner (Vice Chairman). Source: wbgu.de/beirat/.
The WBGU directly advises Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government on matters concerning environment and climate. It has ten members – all of them leading professors from various fields.
The FDP party, coalition partner of Merkel’s government, is growing increasingly dissatisfied with the direction and views of the influential WBGU advisory council, and apparently has decided that a major overhaul is long overdue. As Spiegel wrote yesterday, read here, the WBGU has become only a circle of Schellnhuber’s friends where debate on climate issues is unwelcome. The members of the WBGU are alarmists and are demanding that the government take drastic steps to curb CO2 – advice that the business friendly FDP classic liberal party finds inappropriate and increasingly off the wall. The FDP controls the Ministry of Economics, and it is that very Ministry that refuses to approve the re-appointment of the current board. The FDP party is seeking an overhaul, demanding fresh faces and ideas.
The approaching demise of the Schellnhuber and the current WBGU may have been in the works for a long time. The advisory council seemed to meander off from reality, and advocated naive plans that made no economic or scientific sense.
Over the years, Schellnhuber and his WBGU began showing a clear pattern of activism, dogmatism and a lost sense of reality.
In 2008 Professor Schellnhuber, who is also director of the climate-catastrophe-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in a video with somber tones that the Earth would explode if the world population reached 9 billion, read here. In 2009 he claimed that unless the world heeded his message, “the Earth’s population would be devastated“, adding that “the carrying capacity of the planet is below 1 billion people.”
In Schellhnhuber’s and the WBGU’s mind, the climate science was settled and CO2 was going to warm the planet some 6°C by 2100 unless their plan for drastic reductions was implemented. To curb CO2 emissions, Schellnhuber and the WBGU introduced in April 2011 its “Masterplan” for “The Great Transformation” of global society, read here, which called for a more authoritarian global government, watered-down democracy, and the marginalization of climate science dissidents and skeptics. Prof. Hans von Storch called this sort of arrangement where citizens and society have no say and are expected to just sit there and listen to clever scientists explain how the situation is, and what policy has to be implemented, as “almost a Medieval political understanding”, read here. He even went on to say that some of the PIK scientists seemed to have “taken on the role of prophets“.
Schellnhuber even once repeated in a video the preposterous claim that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035.

Frustrated by the slow progress Germany seemed to be making in leading the world to a carbon-free society, Spiegel wrote that Schellnhuber publicly criticised Angela Merkel, read here. Some may argue that this incident showed the growing rift between Merkel and her climate advisor.
In recent years, it became clear that Germany’s transition to renewable energy was causing severe energy inflation for consumers and hurting German industry. But rather than slowing down the pace to a green energy economy to alleviate the pain consumers were feeling, Schellnhuber and his WBGU insisted that the government defy the laws of economics and push the green agenda even harder – consumers be damned. The advisory council seemed to have lost its sense of reality.
Then, in what for many appeared as totally bizarre, the WBGU recently published a 140-page comic book (for the indoctrination of children) where Schellnhuber and his WBGU colleagues are portrayed as heroes rescuing the planet from greenhouse gases, read here. The comic book even portrayed carbon emitters as villains that had to be stopped.

The WBGU clearly had forgotten its original mission, and lost its reality bearings. The combination of their comic book, their denial of economic reality, and criticism of Merkel last year probably led to the events of the last weeks. Now it appears FDP party chief Philipp Rösler has no problems dealing with the WBGU and giving Schellnhuber the heave ho.
Criticism of Schellnhuber’s brand of science came to head early this year as Professor Hans von Storch published a stingingly critical book that aimed harsh criticism at activist science, particularly at Schellnhuber’s Potsdam Institute. The book carries the subtitle: “The dangerous proximity of politics and climate science“. Hans von Storch accuses them of having oversold the science.
Yesterday Spiegel named a number of former scientists who have also become highly critical of the WBGU, read here.
Reaction to the news of Schellnhuber’s blocked appointment was met by jubilation on the skeptic side, and outrage on the warmist side. Some called the block the move “outrageous“, with one former green minister describing it as a “mass mobbing“. But one Dutch scientist, a longtime critic of the IPCC and the PIK, sent me an e-mail and called the news “sensational”.
Whether Schellnhuber ends up staying or not, expect new faces to join the WBGU, and thus the end of the advisory board as we know it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBoy I’ll tell you-  climate science is getting more and more convincing with every passing day.
Remember how we were always told that climate change would impact poor Africa the most…and negatively? The German language Die Presse has an online report called:
Warming: Will Africa starve or flourish?
It’s about the PNAS 28.2 paper just out, which came to the astonishing conclusion that climate change will either have positive impacts on agriculture in Africa, or it will have negative impacts. Not only that, agriculture there will have to adapt to these changes.
How brilliant! It took leading earth-systems scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to figure that out.
First, recall that the 2007 IPCC Report claimed that crop yields in some countries could get reduced by 50% and that access to food could be put at risk – all because of climate change.
These were the dire projections made just a few years ago. But then came Climategate and the discovery of a series of errors in the IPCC report, and its heavy use of grey literature. Scientists began to doubt. So to get more certainty on the subject, projections were re-evaluated and are now being revamped. The PNAS presents the new certainty.
The new results are out and were produced by a group led by Christoph Müller of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and appear in the PNAS 28.2. The group assessed 20 scientific studies on Africa and its agriculture since 2007. Unfortunately the latest results show everything but consensus and certainty. Die Presse writes:
Müller’s group found that some studies predict agricultural production in Africa will collapse to almost nothing while other studies see blooming agriculture like never before – with crop yields up by as much as 168%.”

Does anyone think these results are going to be of any use for African policy makers? The PNAS 28.2 abstract says:
Despite large uncertainty, there are several robust conclusions from published literature for policy makers and research agendas: agriculture everywhere in Africa runs some risk to be negatively affected by climate change; existing cropping systems and infrastructure will have to change to meet future demand. With respect to growing population and the threat of negative climate change impacts, science will now have to show if and how agricultural production in Africa can be significantly improved.”
Say what?
– Robust conclusions?
– Agriculture everywhere runs some risk?
– Cropping systems and infrastructure will have to change to meet future demand?
– Science will have to show how agricultural production can be improved?
No kidding! Really? Folks, what a pile of scientific crap this is! This report says nothing except confirm that they don’t have a clue about what will happen in Africa and its agriculture. They know less than ever before. Die Presse sums up the rubbish beautifully, describing this paper with an old German saying that is often used for such results:
Wenn der Hahn kräht auf dem Mist
Ändert sich das Wetter
Oder es belibt wie es ist
In English, roughly (doesn’t quite rhyme):
When the cock crows on a pile of shit
Either the weather will change
or it’ll stay as it is.
This means this PNAS paper says nothing. But this is kind of the crap that gets published by “prestigious scientific journals” nowadays. And so Die Presse writes:
The very science that cannot even project what will come in the future is now supposed to tell us ‘if and how’ agricultural production in Africa should adapt and how agricultural yields can be ‘significantly improved’ under the unknown new conditions.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterDo you recall Lockwood’s paper?
Central Europeans right now are scratching their heads, wondering how on Earth they are still shoveling snow past Easter. March in Germany, according to the German Weather Service DWD, was the 6th coldest since measurements began in 1881. Britain has just seen it’s coldest March in 100 years. In fact over the last few winters hundreds of cold and snowfall records have been shattered.
Lockwood wasn’t alone in suspecting that climate is profoundly impacted by the sun. Now is a good time to recall these findings from scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research working with Lockwood, from a little less than 3 years ago in 2010. 3Sat television quoted MPI scientist Sami Solanki in 2010:
There hasn’t been sunspots and thus no activity on the sun for three years. Solar activity is on the increase, but it is completely unclear if the sun will reach the same level of activity we saw over the last decades. If it does, then it is improbable we will again have extreme cold winters, if our statistical analysis proves right. If it doesn’t, then everything is open.”
Lockwood and the Max-Planck Institute scientists had examined weather and solar data going back all the way to 1659. Statistically they found a correlation that CO2 proponents could only dream of. When solar activity was low, the climate in Great Britain was 0.5°C cooler. And when solar activity was high, the climate was warmer.
The reason, the scientists explain, is that low solar activity could lead to changes to the winds in the troposphere. The researchers assume that when the stratosphere above it heats up only weakly, the mild strong winds from the Atlantic break off in the troposphere. Great Britain and Central Europe are then exposed to the influence of cold winds from the North East instead. The exact mechanism is still unclear, however.

3Sat (2010) then added:
Whether the coming winter will also be bitter cold, the Max Planck scientists don’t know. Their results are purely statistical. They only indicate a trend.”
Well, three critical winters have since joined the data set: How were these 3 winters?  Not just one bitter cold winter followed, but three more in a row! Right now it’s April and Central Europeans are still shoveling snow!
With 350 years of data, we can safely assume that there is very likely much more behind solar activity and the global climate, and that many CO2 alarmist scientists know it too. That’s why months later they concocted the ludicrous quackery that missing Arctic sea ice in September refrigerates the entire northern hemisphere months later in the wintertime.
Some will claim it’s only a regional phenomenon! Wrong. The link between solar activity and climate has been shown to be profound not just in Europe but at every corner of the globe, and that by dozens, if not hundreds, of peer-reviewed studies.

The schadenfreude here can hardly be contained, I have to admit. In Great Britain citizens are being told not to expect a steady supply of power in the future. Now German leaders, also insisting we make due with less, have gotten a taste of it. Elevators, toilets, etc. ceased to function.
So what is the reaction from Green Parliamentarains over this unscheduled bout of climate protection and energy use reduction?

Eco-radical and Green Party Faction leader Jürgen Trittin, who, according to DIE WELT, was outraged:
It is impossible that when Vattenfall screws up once again, the German Pariliament has no emergency back up supply of electricity.”
Vattenfall is the Sweden-based power company that operates some of Germany’s power plants, and probably has nothing to do with the outage that Trittin and Ott find so damn inconvenient.
I say leave the power off and let them use candles and portable toilets.
You can use a wad of grass when you’re “done”. (Just be sure to take it with you and dispose of it properly).

Steffen Hentrich of the Liberal Institute of the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundtaion for Freedom
Steffen Hentrich of the Liberal Institute at the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation for Liberty blasted the 10:10 No Pressure clip, calling it a manual for climate terrorism. Read here in German.
Here the term “Liberal” is the so-called “classic liberal, and not to be confused with the kind one finds in the USA.
He warns that the windmills turning in the wind and shiny solar panels on roofs are the harmless stage for a not-to-be excluded eco-dictatorship that would have zero respect for humanity.
Here are some excerpts of his comments I translated in English:
What do we do with people who do not wish to join in the climate protection movement propagated upon us by environmental activists and politicians? You just blow them up and justify it by claiming these few non-conformists are nothing when compared to the 300,000 people who have supposedly already died because of climate change so far. For this number there is no scientific basis, just climate models.

Just 65 years after the end of National Socialism, under whose dehumanizing ideology millions of human beings were murdered in the most brutal manner, and 21 years after the fall of communism, where its collective Weltanschauung claimed just as many lives, and only 9 years since the attacks on the WTC, which claimed thousands of lives because of religious fanaticism, a radical environmental movement today does not even bother to hide how it would like to deal with people who do not agree with its end of the world scenarios and prefer to opt out of its simplistic world rescue program.
Unfortunately the German mainstream media, big cheerleaders of the climate protection madness, have been completely silent thus far. Surely they are shocked by the clip’s content but are keeping a low profile. They’ve had three days now. Shame shame.
Where is that model of democracy and human rights which Germany has been since the end of WWII? Tragically many have been just too caught up in the eco-zealotry.
Steffen Hentrich in one of the few who has stood up and publicly denounced the clip and its message in Germany.
(He is also a regular contributor to the online Freie Welt daily.)

UPDATE: You can contact the media outlets below and politely ask why they are so silent. I think you may get some creative answers, (I did, see below):
Der Spiegel
Stern
Die Welt
Focus
FAZ
For example I just called and spoke to a gentleman at Der Spiegel. The man I spoke to claimed he was not aware of the story. I actually had to spell “10:10 No Pressure” to him. “Is it written with numbers or letters?” he asked. In general he was not very friendly acted completely bored and arrogant about it. Indeed, a very touchy subject at Der Spiegel.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEnergy rationing begins. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
This is serious. A new law has been passed by the German government, quietly and almost unnoticed. Soon in the future, the government will tell its citizens how much energy they can consume. 
If the German State can pass this, then it can pretty much do whatever the hell it damn well pleases.
Gone are the days of a government that is there to serve its citizens. Here to stay is a group of elitists who are going to boss the citizens around and tell them how to live.
But of course it’s all in the name of saving planet from climate catastrophe. Never mind what Edenhofer of the PIK said awhile back, read here. They are moving quickly now, and Germany is now lost. Although climate scepticism is rising, it’s too late.
America – the last hope
I pray that the few remaining freedom-loving lawmakers in America are taking notice of this eco-martial law movement now sweeping across Europe. The greenshirts are already getting out of their cars in front of your homes (think EPA). Are you going to let them kick your doors down too? They are only waiting for the green light from Ms Lisa Jackson.
Germany’s first step in declaring eco-martial law
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) reports on the new German Energy Efficiency Law that was quietly passed on the 4th of November 2010 with nary a press report and under the noses of its citizens -passed under the guise of “necessary-to-implement EU Directives” to increase energy efficiency. The name of the law in German:
Gesetz über Energiedienstleistungen und andere Energieeffizienzmaßnahmen vom 4. November 2010 (BGBl. I S. 1483)
In English:
Law on Energy Services and other Energy Efficiency Measures dated 4 November 2010 (BGBl. I S. 1483)
Just call it the Energy Tyranny Act. Michael Limburg of EIKE has looked at this in detail and writes:
With this law, the free market is going to be abolished, carefully converted with efforts to…“remove existing market obstacles and deficiencies.“ 
Of course the law provides for the creation of a new bureaucracy to implement its provisions – with the state taking over authority. Limburg writes about what the Energy Tyranny Act means:
That means citizens will have to be and can be forced to make comprehensive energy savings in a very short time. And to make sure that functions:
Power companies, grid operators and energy retail companies are especially required to carry out special obligations in order to create the conditions for the development and promotion of a market for energy service companies and for creating other measures for improving energy efficiency for the consumer. Included in this are especially information, promotion and assurance obligations. These companies are also obligated to maintain infomational billing of energy consumption.

//-->




In plain English: Power and energy companies will be required to collect consumption data on each and every citizen and provide the means to meet energy efficiency targets.
Enforcement by the state
All this will have to be monitored of course – by a new powerful bureaucracy, which will have powers to run lives. Paragraph 9 of the law stipulates which government body will observe our energy consumption. The Federal Office for Economics and Export Control will take on the duties of the Federal Office for Energy Efficiency.
Some of these duties include the calculation of energy saving target values and monitoring the progress savings are made by the consumers. And if savings are not achieved quickly enough, Limburg writes:
In the event that the forces of the newly abolished free market are not sufficient, which of course will certainly turn out to be the case, they will be able to draw up proposals for forcing the citizens, and to sanction if necessary, to reach the ambitious targets.
EIKE reader Stefan Steger writes:
Maybe I’ve seen too much science fiction, but it appears the Orwellian surveillance society is becoming a reality; you could call it East Germany 2.0 . The whole thing has a system to it:
1. Implementation of smart grids.
2. Outsourcing of meter reading by public utilities.
3. State control of meter reading.
4. Regulating the energy consumption per person/ household etc.
5. Limiting of energy use by using intelligent meters and automatic shut-off  switches.
6. And liquidators will be sent to violating households.
Mike Limburg ends by quoting Kurt Tucholsky:
If people could change the course of politics through elections, then elections would have been banned long ago.”
That is indeed a sad but true commentary on the state of German democracy (what’s left of it) today.
The Great Menace – how far can this go?
This is just the start of the so-called “The Great Transformation” envisioned by extremists like Edenhofer, Schellnhuber and host of other social engineering zealots. It begins with rationing energy, but where does it end? What’s next?
Our water consumption? Our meat consumption? Our internet access? Our mobility? Our lights? Our weight?  How about sugar intake? The right to our organs? Our life span (death panels)? Our property and money we earn? Our freedom to speak?
They can do what they want and there is nothing now to stop them. Today there is no political opposition to this coming green tyranny – all parties in Germany, from right to left, are for it. They are only fighting each other to see who gets to have the fun of carrying out this dangerous experiment. They are all racing to see who can be Erich Honecker 2.0 first!
Urgently needed is an opposition…and maybe another D-Day.
=========================================================
UPDATE: http://www.greattransformation.e
Democratic regimes are not well prepared for the level of participation that is required: Can free democratic societies cope with the effects of grave changes in the global climate, or might authoritarian regimes possibly be better placed to enforce the necessary measures?”

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore major media covering mavericks Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’ new skeptical book. Influential daily DIE WELT jumps in, see below!
First, part 2 of the 3-day special series called “The CO2 Lies” appearing in the 16-million circulation German daily Bild is out today. Its title:
There Hasn’t Been Any Global Warming In 12 Years!”
This part was authored by Vahrenholt and Lüning themselves, who remind us that CO2 is not that potent of a gas, and that a doubling would lead to only a 1.1°C temperature increase. But the IPCC fudges the models so that they produce a much higher increase because of the assumed water-vapor amplifier. Vahrenholt and Lüning remind readers:
But the amplification process is far from being understood and that the whole assumption is a really on shaky ground.”
But don’t tell that to the climate-catastrophe addicts. Without their daily fix of impending doom and catastrophe, they’re likely to start bouncing off the walls. Any good news about the catastrophe getting called off is the last thing these catastrophe-crackheads ever want to hear.
Bild reminds us that very few people are aware of the fact that global temperatures have stagnated over the last 10+ years. Thanks Bild, for finally telling us! Hopefully Bild will keep reminding us in the future.
Bild wonders why the IPCC never predicted that and asks: “How could the IPCC have erred? Here Vahrenholt bring up the ocean cycles and the sun, which the IPCC has a chronic habit of forgetting them in its summary reports. They write:
If the sun and PDO play a role, then it means CO2’s role is even less. And it’s precisely this that the IPCC refuses to acknowledge.”
Vahrenholt and Lüning then remind us that soot also is a major contributor and that a recent study shows that it was seriously underestimated just a few years ago. It all means that the IPCC models are completely out of whack. How do the IPCC lead scientists react to this? Bild tells us:
“…the IPCC decision-makers are fighting tooth and nail against accepting the roles of the oceans, sun, and soot.”

When assigning the amount of forcing to various factors, Vahrenholt and Lüning conclude:
“The facts need to be discussed sensibly and scientifically, without first deciding on the results.”
Full page interview with DIE WELT
Meanwhile flagship daily DIE WELT featured a full page interview with Professor Vahrenholt in its print edition…no restrictions, no omissions. Finally a good interview by a warmist paper.
In the interview, Vahrenholt explains why he grew skeptical of the IPCC. One problem was that the IPCC had the habit of filtering out important scientific findings so that they never appear in the summary reports. By examining past temperature fluctuations, Vahrenholt and Lüning believe that the sun is a greater factor than CO2.
Vahrenholt gives three reasons why he expects it to get cooler in the future: 1) we are or soon will be beginning on the downward flank of the Gleissberg and Suess cycles, 2) the ocean cycles will be in their negative phases over the next decades, and 3) we currently find ourselves in the weakest phase of solar activity in 80 years, and the next solar cycle could be a very weak one.
German Minister of Environment Röttgen “clueless”
Then the DIE WELT interview focuses on energy policy in Germany. According to Vahrenholt, Germany has a solar capacity of 25,000 megawatts and a wind capacity of 29,000 megawatts, which are very volatile sources. Conventional power plants are going to be needed to balance out the supply.
At the end of the interview, because of Germany’s now volatile power supply, DIE WELT asks Vahrenholt to estimate the current chances of power blackouts:
The outgoing President of the Federal Power Grid Agency says that we are dancing on a razor’s edge. A cold wave like the one we are now experiencing means Alarm Level Red. The French and the Czechs, from whom we import, need the power for themselves – for heating. Currently we are supplying our needs with power from an Austrian oil-fired power plant. We hope that things will not go astray over the coming 2 weeks. When Mr. Röttgen [Minister of Environment} says that solar energy reduces the probability of blackouts, it shows how clueless this man is. The greatest demand for power occurs in the evening in the wintertime – just when solar energy is zero.”
All these major media reports started appearing just when Vahrendorf’s and Lüning’s book was released. Skepticism is firing up in Germany. But the real battle is coming. Expect the catastrophe-crack-heads to go into violent seizures of protest.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe junior partner of Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU center-right government, the business-friendly FDP Liberal Democrats under Philipp Rösler, have made an astonishing and bold move.

The Süddeutsche Zeitung here reports:
FDP blocks climate expert Schellnhuber
He is one of the world’s most famous climate scientists. But that does not seem to impress the liberal democrats at all: The Economics Ministry under Philipp Rösler refuses to reappoint physicist Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber as director of the Environmental Advisory Board. His colleagues are outraged and are now speculating on what’s behind it.”
Hat-Tip: Roger Pielke Jr. at Twitter.
That WBGU board, filled mostly with German academics, is the famous WBGU that not long ago produced a whacko “masterplan” dubbed “The Great Transformation”, which would lead to a coercive global decarbonization of the global economy by 2050 and the civil marginalization of climate science skeptics and dissidents.
If you can credit the FDP for anything, it’s Courage. This takes really massive reproductive spheres to attempt this.
Merkel’s junior coalition partner, headed by Rösler, now we must expect the full fury and hellfire of Germany’s mainstream media to rain down upon their FDP party. In today’s modern Germany, Climatism has taken over as the country’s official religion and Schellnhuber is deemed its infallible pope.

This is a real hornets’ nest. Challenging Schellnhuber is challenging the very core of the world’s environmental movement. I hope they know what they are doing.
To know what could be behind the move, look no further than here. Schellnhuber is the main scientific force driving the green energy debacle that has pushed Germany’s energy industry and economy to the brink.
The green-leftist Süddeutsche Zeitung in its article extols Schellnhuber’s numerous achievements and awards. In there minds, he is Prof. Climate Authority.
The Süddeutsche also writes:
Now from Germany, the physicist, top climate advisor to the German Chancellor, is facing resistance. More precisely said: from the Federal Ministry of Economics. The house of Minister Philipp Rösler (FDP) is resisting with all its might the reappointment of Schellnhuber as director of the WBGU.”
Schellnhuber’s appointment would be for another 4 years, and it normally should proceed as a mere formality. But now there appears to be growing, real resistance among Angela Merkel’s government – the process of appointing Schellnhuber has been blocked for weeks now. The Süddeutsche writes: “Formally the WBGU has not been in existence for two months.”



     Also the director of the infamously green Wuppertal Institute, economist Uwe Schneidewind is facing resistance. The Süddeutsche reports that Rösler’s Economics Ministry is suggesting two alternatives to Schellnhuber and Schneidewind: Professor Axel Ockenfels of Cologne and Joachim Weimann of Magdeburg.

Schellnhuber has not commented on the stalled re-appointemnt. But the Süddeutsche writes that “the outrage among his council colleagues is big.”



This is an immense development. A junior coalition partner does not block such a key position or take such a stance without first closely consulting with its senior coalition partner, in this case Angela Merkel and her CDU/CSU party. This indicates that dissatisfaction with Schellnhuber and the WBGU has long been festering within the ruling government, and that Merkel has probably had enough of Schellnhuber’s doom and gloom scenarios, global transformation fantasies and social engineering designs. Time to get back to reality.
I repeat, expect a very very messy and ugly attack campaign against the FDP and Rösler from the media and Germany’s climate Vatican in the weeks and months ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’ve been hearing stories that the UK government may have put the lives of its citizens at risk by keeping a forecast of cold winter secret from the public in a cynical attempt to mislead them. 
If this is true, then this government has squandered its public trust and is not fit to serve its citizens. Who needs a government that deceives the people it is entrusted to serve?
Benny Peiser has assembled 19 questions for the Government to answer, see his press release here.
 Here is Dr. Peiser’s letter to Louise Ellman, MP and Chair, Transport Select Committee:
————————————————————————–
Louise Ellman, MP
Chair, Transport Select Committee
House of Commons
London SW1A 0AA
5 January 2011
Dear Mrs Ellman
Transport System’s Winter Fiasco
I am writing to you on behalf of the Global Warming Policy Foundation regarding the transport system’s ill-preparedness in face of this year’s record cold winter.
The GWPF is calling on the Transport Committee to set up a parliamentary inquiry into the winter advice the Government received by the Met Office and the renewed failure of both the Government and local authorities to prepare the UK transport system for the third severe winter in a row.
This year’s winter fiasco has severely damaged the British economy – and its international reputation – as a result of the country’s ill-preparedness.
It would appear that the Met Office provided the government with contradictory winter advice and we need to find out what went wrong. Lessons have to be learned well in advance of the start of next year’s winter so that we are much better prepared if it is severe again.
Last summer, the Department of Transport carried out a study of the resilience of Britain’s transport infrastructure in the light of the two previous severe winters.
When the Quarmby Report (The Resilience of England’s Transport Systems in Winter) was published in late October, it entirely relied on the Met Office’s assurance that the chance of a severe winter and heavy snow would be relatively small and that the effect of climate change had further reduced the probability of severe winters in the UK; see also Transport chaos not an annual issue, say official report. Investment in more equipment may not be economical given rarity of British snow, says RAC Foundation chairman <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/dec/21/transport-met-office>
In recent days, the Met Office has stated that it apparently changed its original advice in October and actually warned the Cabinet Office that the start of winter would be exceptionally cold. It would appear that the Met Office’s cold warning was kept secret from the public.
According to media reports, the Cabinet Office has been unwilling to confirm whether or not it failed to pass on the Met Office warning to local and road authorities, airports and water companies.
Not only is the lack of Government preparedness a cause for concern, but we wonder whether there may be another reason for keeping the cold warning under wraps, a motive that the Met Office and the Cabinet Office may have shared: Not to undermine the then forthcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun.
Throughout October and November, the Met Office repeatedly pushed and published their key message in the run-up to the UN climate summit – that 2010 would probably turn out to be the hottest year on record, culminating in these Cancun-timed media reports: Cancun climate change summit: 2010 was hottest year on record <http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/weather/8175591/Cancun-climate-change-summit-2010-was-hottest-year-on-record.html>
The Met Office was represented at the UN Climate Summit in Cancun by key scientists who briefed news media about their key message; see Scientific evidence is Met Office focus at Cancun <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2010/pr20101126b.html>
It will be important to establish whether the Met Office consulted with government officials about the UK’s Cancun strategy and what effect this may have had on the handling of the ‘secret’ cold winter warning.
The transport minister Philip Hammond has asked the government’s chief scientific adviser whether the last three cold winters may signal a ‘step change’ in weather in the UK.
The Met Office appears to deny this possibility. In its submission to the Quarmby Report, the Met Office claims that the chances of a harsh winter are receding steadily. Yet, the Met Office models were contradicted by Sir David King, the former government’s chief scientific adviser, who has publicly warned that the government should plan for more cold winters in the next few years.
It is evident that Sir David King has serious doubts about the reliability of the Met Office’s computer models. This manifest contradiction is further undermining the credibility of the Met Office which makes it all the more important to properly investigate the underlying problem of its erroneous winter projections and government advice over the last three years.
In light of the renewed failure to prepare the UK and its transport system for a prolonged and harsh winter, the following questions need to be addressed in order to avoid future debacles:

1. Why did the Met Office publish on its website estimates in late October showing a 60 per cent to 80 per cent chance of warmer-than-average temperatures this winter? What was the scientific basis of this probabilistic estimate?
2. Why did the Met Office provide the government with a secret forecast about a exceptionally cold start of the winter, at the same time it was publishing an opposite forecast to the public?
3. Did the government conspire to keep the Met Office forecast secret in the run-up to the Cancun climate summit?
4. Did the Cabinet Office fail to take appropriate action in response to the forecast and inform the relevant authorities to prepare the country, to keep the highways clear, to prepare airports?
5. Why did the government let its Winter Fuel Allowance budget be used up with only a fraction of the winter gone?
6. On what scientific basis did the Met Office tell the Cabinet Office that there were early indications of an exceptionally cold start to winter?
7. Why did the Met Office confirm to the news media on 27 October that its probability map showed significant warming in the months ahead?
8. Has the late October prediction by the Met Office that this winter would be mild affected planning for this winter? If so, what is the best estimate of how much this has cost the country?
9. In 2009, the Met Office predicted a 65% chance that the winter of 2009/10 would be milder than normal. Has the Met Office subsequently explained what went wrong with its computer modelling?
10. What is the statistical and scientific basis for the Met Office’s estimate of a 1-in-20 chance of a severe winter?
11. Has the Met Office changed its view, or its calculations, following the harsh winters of 2008, 2009 and 2010?
12. Is the Met Office right to be confident that the severe winters of the last three years are not related?
13. Which severe weather alerts were issued by the Met Office and when?
14. Although the Met Office stopped sending its 3-month forecasts to the media, it would appear that this service is still available to paying customers, the Government and Local Authorities for winter planning. What was their advice, in September/October, for the start of winter 2010?
15. Has the Met Office been the subject of any complaints from its paying customers regarding the quality of its advice?
16. Is it appropriate that the chairman of the Met Office is a member, or a former member of climate pressure groups or carbon trading groups?
17. Should senior Met Office staff (technically employed by the MoD) make public comments advocating political action they see necessary to tackle climate change?
18. Has the government evaluated different meteorological service providers and has it ensured that it is using the most accurate forecaster?
19. What plans has the government to privatise the Met Office?
In view of the high level of public interest in this matter, we shall be releasing the text of this letter to the press. I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Dr Benny Peiser

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German press and politicians are writing off this conference, already. It’s over, and nobody sings “Time to say goodbye” better than Europe does. Sit back and enjoy this lovely tribute to Cancun (pre-recorded).

Lovely! Isn’t this supposed to be a sad song? For me it’s a happy one.
When the media in Germany are this pessimistic about Cancun and are already rehearsing this beautiful tune, then you know it’s over.
Even German centre-left daily Die Zeit has the headline today: Germany Dampens Cancun Expectations.
Germany, led by Angela Merkel, is a leading proponent of a global climate treaty, actually believing it is possible to regulate the globe’s temperature. Japan, Canada and Russia are demanding a treaty that also commits China to limiting greenhouse gas emissions, which is a sure way to kill it. Die Zeit writes:
Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen (CDU) does not expect a breakthrough in Cancun.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) is not even taking part in the conference.

Even the UNEP Director, Achim Steiner, is dampening expectations: ‘Cancun is certainly not the summit that is going to bring about a breakthrough’, he said.”
If Germany has given up, then you can be 99.9999999999999% sure this thing is dead as a doornail.
To save face, countries of course will agree on token measures like protecting forests and signing pledges to continue efforts – next year. Of course, all the finger pointing is being directed at the USA and China. No blame for those that conjured up the idiotic idea that was nuts to begin with.
Die Zeit ends its piece with:
The Chairman of Environment and Nature Protection Germany, Hubert Weiger, calls on Röttgen to continue fighting together with Europe for a continuation of the Kyoto  Protocol. But observers see little chance for a breakthrough in the talks.”
Perhaps Europe ought to wake up and realise that the rest of the world is not interested in being constantly nagged and told what to do. Take care of your own problems. Nobody is listening to you.
And here’s another for Cancun (with well-deserved standing ovation)

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat do the intellectually challenged do when they’re out-matched in debate and fully exhausted of arguments?
You do what the University of Osnabrück has done: you prevent the opponent from entering the debating arena. You call it off and closed-mindedly insist you’re right.
Hat-tip: Die Achse Des Guten
This is what is happening today with the University of Osnabrück and Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, who had been invited by the university to give a speech on February 8.
It’s a vivid look into the cowardice of today’s German academia and it’s intellectual depletion.
The problem is that Vahrenholt has just written a controversial climate skeptical book (Die kalte Sonne) together with geologist Dr Sebastian Lüning – a book that is politically incorrect because it doubts the climate catastrophe fairy tale. The book is already near or at the number 1 position in Amazon.de bestseller list for environment and ecology books, and is thus causing the warmists to scurry in panic. The sense of alarm and fear that have gripped the climate establishment is so strong that the University of Osnabrück decided it would be improper to have Vahrenholt as a speaker.
Vahrenholt got his dis-invitation 2 days ago. Openly questioning the dogma of catastrophic global warming is not welcome. The University prefers to stay in the Dark Ages.
Here’s the public invitation:
In the series of presentations “University Speeches” of the University of Osnabrück, Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt – RWE Innogy, Essen will hold a speech titled “The Climate Catastrophe is not Taking Place”.
The IPCC is wrong. The climate debate has to be restarted. In contradiction to prognoses, there has been no global warming in over 10 years. Even with rising CO2 emissions the warming for this century will not exceed 2°C. The warming effect of CO2 is over-estimated. The latest findings show that ocean cycles and the sun, which recently entered a longer-term period of quite activity, has played a greater role in the course of climate than previously assumed.

Date: 08 February 2012
Time: 18.00 h
Location: Schlossaula (Osnabrück)”
Here is the incredible letter of cancellation:
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
When we invited Prof. Vahrenholt in May, 2011, it was done with regards to a very good speech he had given in Greifswald (Greifswald Speeches – a Foundation of the Alfried Krupp College Greifswald) on the topic of “Options for the Future Energy Supply of Germany”. This topic and the speaker also were accepted by the Osnabrück University Professorium.
When we invited him, we suggested this topic, which he did not object. When we asked him to provide us with the exact title of his speech 3 weeks before it was scheduled to take place, he surprised us with the provocative title ‘The Climate Catastrophe Is Not taking Place’. The reactions to this announcement range from positive to critical, and to negative. Independent of these reactions, we have become convinced that such an assertion requires ‘a counter speech’ from a climate scientist and that the subsequent discussion be led by a competent moderator. Because it is not possible to organize this before February 8, we will search another date in 2012, in agreement with Prof Vahrenholt and the 2 yet-to-be-named individuals. We will inform you on a timely basis.
Yours sincerely,
Prof. Dr. Karlheinz Altendorf
Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Asholt”
So unhindered, free dissent and questioning are unwelcome. Not believing that the world is on the road to catastrophe is “provocative”. Sorry, but this is the kind of insecure behaviour ones sees from dictatorial regimes. It’s intellectual insolvency.
Things really are that bad in Germany’s academia today – at least at the University of Osnabrück.
Two questions to professors Altendorf and Asholt: What are you afraid of? Does a movement steeped in fear and insecurity have any chance of victory? Your letter is as clear an admission one could get that the answer is “definitely no”.
Your decision is as about as remote as one can get from the true spirit of academia.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEurope’s winter refuses to let up as large areas saw a white Easter accompanied by record lows and snowfall amounts. Media outlets are warning that this year could the year without a spring. Germany’s number 1 daily by circulation Bild writes here that the cold weather may be around even until Pentecost (mid-May)!
The German Weather Service (DWD) reports that March, 2013 was the 6th coldest in 132 years of measurements. The forecast for Germany calls for the cold weather to persist through the rest of the week. Nighttime temperatures will plummet to -10°C.
Some people think that the chances for a hot, sunny summer are higher after going through a long, cold winter. But meteorologist Karsten Brandt says this is not so. Bild writes:
Brandt is skeptical: ‘I can imagine brief, hot phases, but in many years  when the winters were cold, the summers were also not better.’“
If that’s the case this year, then Germany could wind up putting 2013 in the books as one of the coolest on record.
The situation is a disaster in Eastern Europe: “At least 100,000 people in Poland without power due to heavy snows…up to 30 centimeters of new snow. … Also in the Czech Republic and Slovakia up to 40 centimeters of new snow fell in 24 hours. … In Moscow a new snow record was set for the date…65 centimeters on the ground.”
German Weather Service: “Global warming is increasing”
Bild then asks ideologically warmist German Weather Service (DWD) meteorologist Christoph Hartmann if the cold winters mean global warming has stopped.

Bild: And what’s with global warming? Snow and frost in April. Is it now an ice age instead of global warming?”
Hartmann: No, it remains warming; global warming is increasing. One cold winter does not refute it. What happens in Germany or Europe has no significance for world climate.
Bild: Apparently climate warming is taking a break in Germany.
Hartmann: Between 1985 and 1995 the temperature rose continuously. But since then not much has happened. However, worldwide new high temperature values are measured every year.
Very sloppy terminology by Hartmann and poor reporting by Bild aside, we have to ask what impression the reader ends up getting here. “Global warming is increasing,” says Hartman. Warming means increasing temperature, and so increasing increasing temperature means accelerating temperature. Have the meteorologist at the DWD looked at any global data lately, say the last 15 years?
 
Where’s the accelerating temperature? (Source woodfortrees.org).
Not only does Hartmann use sloppy terminology, but his facts are completely wrong. Where are the “new high temperature values measured” every year? The trend is actually downwards over the last 10 years. Quality at the DWD has deteriorated to comic levels.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI wasn’t really following this get-together in Lisbon, but Der Spiegel has just come out with a report about the subject tilted: The Climate War Can Continue, and there are a few interesting points. You could call it the German view. Of course, Der Spiegel used the opportunity to take some cheap shots at the sceptics – calling them conspiracy theorists and grumblers. But nothing we aren’t used to.
Yet, at least Der Spiegel admits that there are indeed “alarmists” on the other side, and that there is no consensus. So the real story here is that the sceptics are presented as a force equal to the warmists, and that it is not 98 – 2.
The fronts are deeply entrenched, pouring oil into the fire
The goal of the conference was to get both sides to take a step or two towards reconciliation. But as Der Spiegel writes, the prospects of that happening are very slim. Some participants in Lisbon even poured more oil into the already hot fire. Der Spiegel quotes Jerome Ravetz:
 The fronts in climate research are fully entrenched, says Ravetz’s diagnosis. The result is a huge credibility problem.'”
Some examples of oil in the fire, quoting Hans von Storch:
‘The sceptic side is comprised of everything from academics to confused grumblers.’ “
That didn’t go over too well with some sceptics. I don’t know if von Storch is the right guy to say such things, as he’s been doing his share of grumbling himself. Der Spiegel also wrote how comments by Steve McInytre also provoked the warmists, Spiegel provides quotes by McIntyre:
“Climate scientists have to be obligated, just like investment bankers, to make the information that support their projections public.’ “
Or else face sanctions:
‘The managers of Enron didn’t go to prison because they blew billions of dollars, but because they deceived investors by withholding information.’ “
Judith Curry on models and consensus:

‘The uncertainties in models are completely inadequately researched, and the established research is trying to hide this from the public.’ “
So the complaints, or provocations as Der Spiegel calls them, continue to be the same: the hiding of data and the inadequacy of models.
Gavin Schmidt chickens out
On Gavin Schmidt, Der Spiegel wtites: “He was invited but he declined to show up, which was probably because Steve McIntyre said he would attend.” Der Spiegel then focused in on McIntyre, recognising his important role in the climate debate and mentions his Climateaudit.org blog and how he found errors in Mann’s hockey stick. Der Spiegel took no cheap shots at McIntyre.
Von Storch on public opinion and ignoring sceptics
As sceptics have known for a long time that opinion and the science is all moving to the state of non-alarmism. Hans von Storch is quoted by Der Spiegel:
‘As knowledge increases, the percentage of people who believe that change is dangerous gets smaller.'”
And of course, the warmists and the alarmists would like nothing better than for the sceptics to go away. Or at least that they be ignored. Hans von Storch had the following to say about that strategy:
We simply cannot ignore the sceptics and think they will eventually go away. We have to discuss with them.’ “
Conference is sponsored by the EU
I wasn’t aware of this, but according to Der Spiegel, the Climate Debate Reconcilaition Conference was also sponsored by the European Commission, which has the official target of limiting global warming to 2°C, an endeavour that has been a favourite target of attack among sceptics.
In conclusion, the two sides were unable to agree on a mutual statement. And so the warmists will continue hoping that the sceptics will go away, or at least be ignored. Unfortunately for the warmists, the sceptics are going to do just the opposite, as surveys have shown. More and more are going to come, and they are going to get a lot louder. So much so that it will be impossible to ignore them.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel reports here on the latest ideas from climate activists to revitalize the stalled climate movement, which has run aground over the last year – thanks to Climategate and gross errors in the 2007 IPCC report. Hat-tip oekowatch.org.
Yawn – a “loser topic”
Surveys have found that the population is bored by the issue as a whole, and show that a majority of the public is not even interested in climate change. The topic is too technical, too dry and something that’s 100 years out into the future.
Der Spiegel writes that just one third of Dutch people are concerned about climate change, even though the country is highly vulnerable to rising sea levels! Der Spiegel writes:
Earlier, the telephone rang off the hook whenever we had extreme weather, recalls Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Now hardly anyone calls anymore. Climate has become a ‘loser topic’, he told a ‘Tagesspiegel’ editor on the German TV news program ‘Panorama’.”
Calls for the use of shock, emotion, sex and advocacy journalism
So what do you do to revitalise a dud issue? You repackage the product and re-market it. Der Spiegel piece presents the ideas that activists want to use to get the issue back into the headlines and in people’s minds.

According to the report, some activists want to use emotion, sex, critical debate, improved communication and a new scientific language to better communicate with the public. These are some of the less spectacular methods. Others are calling for more controversial methods, such as advocacy journalism. Der Spiegel writes:
Climate activists are currently financing million dollar training programs for environmental journalists. The target is to promote journalism that is interest-related.”
But experts warn this could backfire as the line between science and advertising becomes blurred. This could make the science even less credible than it is now (as impossible as that may seem).
A climate Martin Luther King /  and where’s Al Gore?
One particularly odd strategy activists are pushing for is the search for a charismatic Messiah. Der Spiegel writes:
A Messiah is needed: Like Martin Luther King spurred the black movement, we now need a climate-Messiah, so believes environmemtal scientist Andreas Ernst of the University of Kassel. The message could be something like: “I have a nightmare“. Al Gore, who for awhile played the role and won a Nobel Prize for his moving film, is hardly ever seen anymore.”
A Climate Messiah?  “I have a nightmare”?  Al Gore?
Folks, it’s over. What they need is Brünnhilde in Götterdämmerung.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Die Welt reports here (surprise! surprise!) that huge costs will be coming due because of the needed extra electrical infrastructure for feeding in green power from offshore wind farms and solar panels into the existing power grid. The current power grid is far too inadequate and has to be massively expanded.
Europe’s target is to provide 20% of its energy with alternative energy by 2020. Germany wants to produce 80% of its energy through alternatives by 2050. These extra costs, says Die Welt, will be “huge”.
The EU wants to have consumers contribute to the cost of the green electrical power offensive. The expansion of the power grid is going to be really expensive.
The energy offensive dubbed Energy Action Plan 2020 by the European Commission, wants to involve all 27 member countries in paying the grid expansion costs. EU Energy Commissar Günther Oettinger says:
Bringing offshore power from the North Sea to Cologne or Stuttgart costs money that we have to pay. We only have God and the citizens, and God doesn’t pay.
In Europe when consumers are expected by politicians “to contribute”, it means of course paying all of it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow far off have climate scientists been in projecting the future of our climate – winter in particular? They and their “models” couldn’t have gotten it more wrong!
Ten years ago they were telling us to forget seeing snow in the wintertime in the future. Now we are seeing tons of the stuff in the wintertime – and spring as well!
Reader and contributor “Jimbo” sent me a link to a report out of Saudi Arabia, a country famous for its heat and desert (my emphasis):
Saudi city covered with snow following unrelenting weather
Saudi Arabia’s northwestern city of Hael was covered with snow Sunday after almost three days of unrelenting weather conditions, according to Al Arabiya correspondents.
A number of provinces in the kingdom have been hit with floods and hailstones as temperatures dropped dramatically.
People have posted pictures on Twitter and other social networking sites showing snow allegedly taken in Saudi Arabia’s Hael.”
Unfortunately, the western climatically-correct media are just too embarrassed to bring us these news because they totally believed the global warming hoax. For years they told us that the whole world, and even the polar regions, could turn into a giant Saudi Arabia. Now, Saudi Arabia has turned polar instead (at least for a couple of days)! You just couldn’t possibly get it any wronger.
In the US, there are lots of news about snow falling across the Midwest, with some parts getting a foot or more of the stuff children weren’t ever supposed to know about.

Jimbo also provides us with a link to snow in Spain:
26 regions in Spain are under snow following an unprecedented snowfall over the weekend, reported Voice of Russia. Roads have been closed to traffic as snow thickness reaches 20 centimeters in some areas.”
A stunned reporter writes:
Also unbelievable sight are beaches under snow.”
Gee, kids won’t know what sand at the beach is anymore. A few days ago there were also reports of snow falling in Germany as well.
Isn’t it amazing how far off climate models can be? We weren’t supposed to see snow anymore, not even in the dead of winter, and now we are seeing it in late spring! Even the most sketpical among us could never have imagined the models botching it this badly. Just goes to show who is in control of the weather: Mother Nature! (and not some obscure gas molecule).
The “climate scientists” have to be beginning to feel like total idiots by now.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBreaking!
It’s late, and so hopefully there won’t be too many misspellings. It seems the global warming regime is imploding in Germany.
A short time ago a report at the online Spiegel, authored by Axel Bojanowski, appeared concerning the blocked Schellnhuber-appointment as director of the WBGU. More details are surfacing. The once influential WBGU council appears to be in for a major overhaul. A major shake-up would spell the end.
The WBGU is the advisory council for the German government on environmental issues, and it is one of the oldest councils in Germany, existing since 1992.
Spiegel writes that “an ominous dispute has obstructed the start of the advisory council” and that “it has been reshuffled. The situation is curious“. The legislative period for the WBGU actually ended in late October last year, and it is now awaiting approval by the government in order to resume its work. However, the German Ministry of Economics, headed by FDP chief Philipp Rösler, refuses to give its stamp of approval.
Bojanowski writes:

According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, four of the council members are to be replaced; the nine WBGU-members are all considered to be environmentally oriented professors.”

It appears Merkel’s junior coalition partner the FDP is pushing to replace some members with others who have economic expertise – in order to create a council that is more balanced and to give it a completely new orientation. The four professors that are aimed to be replaced are: Ellen Matthies, environmental psychologist; Frauke Kraas, geographer; Uwe Schneidewind, economist; Peter Lemke, polar/ocean scientist.
Spiegel adds:

Especially in the Ministry of Economics there are reservations against Schellnhuber, the WBGU Chairman. He would be ‘retired professor in the middle of his term and by then will have been a member of the WBGU for a quarter of a century’ – this is the stated reason given to SPIEGEL ONLINE from circles within the Ministry. In order ‘to revitalise the debate’, they have proposed two economists as alternatives.”

The FDP part of the government is obviously fed up with the climate dogmatism that has blinded the WBGU and the general arrogance that has taken over.

Clearly Merkel, and especially the opposition Greens and environmental activists, want to keep a lid on the turmoil that has erupted. The last thing the environmentalists want is a public debate to erupt and to rage on for weeks. Now with Spiegel focusing on the issue, keeping the lid on will be increasingly difficult to do.
Spiegel writes that over the years the WBGU has become a circle of Schellnhuber’s friends.

‘The voice of economic reason’ is missing says a council member from the 1990s. The WBGU has become a sort of a circle of friends of the years-long Chairman, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber.”

Spiegel writes that the WBGU’s latest report drew harsh criticism. “The council renewed its demand for a ‘Great Transformation’ of civilization.” Critics even labelled the council an “eco-dictatorship”.

The ‘ideological pamphlet’ damaged the WBGU, former colleagues of Schellnhuber griped. It confirmed the fear that Schellnhuber lacked counterparts in the council. In the 1990s the WBGU was occupied completely by ‘neo-liberal economic scientists”, the old colleagues disparagingly call them today.

As Spiegel online describes it, the WBGU is due for a major overhaul. The target is to produce a council of debate, and not one filled with people who nod yes every time Pope Schellnhuber says something.
According to political scientist Susanne Cassel of the “Econwatch”, Spiegel writes, “councils like the WBGU always kept their discussions confidential in order to be able to present only their consensus.” Openness was only on the surface.
Near the end of its article Spiegel tells us that the WBGU’s influence was not that great after all.
Also former Saxony President Kurt Biedenkopf regards the impact of the assessment reports as very limited: ‘Ongoing councils are for the most part ineffective,’ he said. Sometimes the assessments gave the politicians a bad conscience. However, only very few proposals were ever implemented.”
It looks more and more like Germany’s FDP Party is about to knock down a major domino. This may be the tipping point we’ve been waiting for.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe media today in Germany are filled with the news of the ethanol debacle. 
The government has mandated that super grade gasoline be sold with a minimum content of 10% ethanol in Germany, so-called E10 gasoline. But as always, when the wishes of the government clash with the wishes of the markets and citizens, then you get chaos. That’s the case today in Germany.
Never mind that burning ethanol is an environmental debacle that leads to the destruction of forests and food shortages that lead to higher prices and more hunger worldwide, but it also burns less efficiently and causes damage to many cars. It is yet another well-intentioned program that is making things only worse. Nobody in Germany wants the stuff – neither the drivers nor the environmentalists.
WDR public TV has a report here (in German), which interviews an expert from the environmental group Bundesumwelt- und Naturschutz, Werner Reh, who calls the whole program “stupidity”:
Laws are passed where ethanol percentage requirements are mandated without even knowing where the quantities are going to come from. They have to be certified. A 35% reduction of CO2 has to be shown. Yet the indirect impacts on landuse are not even included in the calculation, and if you do that, then the entire CO2 reduction is wiped out completely.”
But German consumers are not avoiding ethanol for those reasons. Many are simply afraid that the 10% ethanol content will damage their auto engines. So what is the result? They aren’t buying the fuel blend and are opting for the more expensive super premium gasoline instead, paying about €0.40 per US gallon more.

Petrol stations aren’t selling the unwanted ethanol blended fuel. So with unsold E10 gasoline piling up, refineries will soon find themselves scaling back production and will incur additional costs, which eventually the consumer will have to bear.
Gas stations that are still offering the fuel will continue to do so. But the rest are refusing to order it. Holger Krawinkel, energy expert of the Federal Association of Consumer Centres (that’s the best translation I can come up with) offers a brilliant observation, read here:
With biofuels, the costs of CO2 savings are very high.”
Unfortunately that’s the case with almost all renewable energy forms, and not just with biofuels. And we should again ask ourselves what are these high costs for?
A couple of tenths of a degree less warming over 100 years.

Trash washes up in Tanzania. (Photo credit: Loranchet / Wikipedia)
We’ve heard about a giant patch of garbage supposedly floating out in the Pacific, yet another unmistakable sign of the scourge that man is to the planet. Read NatGeo here and The Independent here and NPR here, just to name a few.
It turns out that it’s all a huge exaggeration.
Caught red-handed again! Who can believe these media organizations any longer? Sadly this is routine procedure when reporting on climate change and evironment.
Wikipedia here calls it the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and describes it as the Pacific Trash Vortex, which is estimated to be an area the size of the state of Texas to one larger than the continental United States.
There’s just one problem, though. Wikipedia writes: 
Despite its size and density, the patch is not visible from satellite photography.”
Hmmm. Well, there’s a good reason for that. One reason is likely because it’s a heck of a lot smaller than what we have been led to believe. Today Jürgen Schönstein has a piece at science blogs titled The garbage patch is smaller than feared. Schönstein writes that marine biologist Assistant Professor Angel White of Oregon State University has come to the conclusion that the size and growth of the patch is “grossly exaggerated by the media”:

The amount of plastic out there isn’t trivial. But using the highest concentrations ever reported by scientists produces a patch that is a small fraction of the state of Texas, not twice the size.”
You can read the Oregon State Univsersity press release here. Well, you might say, Texas is a big place and even a small fraction is a lot. The press release writes:
The studies have shown is that if you look at the actual area of the plastic itself, rather than the entire North Pacific subtropical gyre, the hypothetically “cohesive” plastic patch is actually less than 1 percent of the geographic size of Texas.”
Simple mathematics tells us that the media exaggerated the patch size by a factor of more than 200. I’m not saying there isn’t problem with marine pollution. It’s just nowhere near as bad as we are told, like many other things – climate to name one.
In the end, pick up your trash and dispose of it properly. Don’t litter! White says:
If there is a takeaway message, it’s that we should consider it good news that the ‘garbage patch’ doesn’t seem to be as bad as advertised,” White said, “but since it would be prohibitively costly to remove the plastic, we need to focus our efforts on preventing more trash from fouling our oceans in the first place.”
One final note: Have you ever compared the aftermath of a Tea Party demonstration to the aftermath of a save-the-planet type of demonstration in terms of garbage left behind? That pretty much tells you who the real big slobs are. The same can be pretty much said about their carbon footprints too, i.e. think Gore, Hollywood, UN bureaucrats, “climate scientists” and activists flying all over the globe and living high on the hog.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooks like Lewandowsky has bungled again.
At Klimazwiebel Dennis Bray reacts to a poorly thought-out attack by Lewandowsky.
Bray writes:
Lewandowsky, in reference to the 2003 Survey of Climate Scientists, accuses me of violating ‘all internet survey methodological standards by not recording dates, times, and IP numbers of respondents’.  [….] So please, for all of the conspiracy theory (of any persuasion) critics of the surveys of climate scientists, try to know a little of what you speak before you speak. Apparently Lewandowsky complained that there was ‘no way to check or verify the integrity of the data’ and therefore the data was probably ‘useless’. Lewandowsky said that the study should not have been published ‘without the authors demonstrating the integrity of their data’.  Steve McIntrye goes on to point out that the work of Lewandowsky is not without blemish.”
Lewandowsky and his kind must be more desperate than we thought. When you finally stoop to going after fellow scientists in the way that Lewandowsky has, it represents a “push-comes-to-shove” mode – a last, desperate Hail Mary attempt to salvage the endeavor. Seems Lewandowsky has reached that phase.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Guardian frets that Obama’s schemes to curb “greenhouse” gases in the USA are dead, as “a slew of new climate change deniers” enter Congress. Read here Barack Obama’s green agenda crushed at the ballot box.
The whining and moaning by the Guardian is something to cherish and a must read.
Hopefully these new climate deniers joining Congress will slap USA lawmakers back awake to reality and get the government to focus on the real problems that demand immediate attention, like run-away deficits and  unemployment.
Even Obama now sees Crap & Trade as a useless venture.  The Guardian writes:
Obama in his post-election press conference indicated he was giving up on the idea of sweeping climate and energy legislation in the remaining two years of his term. He said he hoped to find compromise with Republicans on areas like fuel efficiency or electric cars. ‘Cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way,” he told reporters at the White House “I’m going to be looking for other means to address this problem.’
A little hope and change for Obama? Recall the change in direction by Bill Clinton in 1994. And here’s the part I like:
The new crop of Republican leaders in the house are way ahead of Palin, with plans for sweeping investigations of climate science and of Obama administration officials such as Lisa Jackson, who heads the EPA.
As far as the leaders are concerned, the science of climate change is far from settled. “We’re going to want to have a do-over,” Darrell Issa, a favourite to head the house oversight and investigations committee, told a recent interviewer.
Rep. Issa, let’s get it all out on the table where everyone can see it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe belief that humans are destroying the climate and that we can prevent “the catastrophe” simply by committing green acts is alive and well – especially in Hamburg, Germany. With a little brainwashing quality education, everything is possible. (Hat-tip Bernd Felsche).

The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here tells us how the German city of Hamburg has instituted a climate-education program dubbed: Climate Protection At Schools with the slogan: “Climate – we’re acting!“.
In Hamburg schools of every level are encouraged (er, pressured) to implement their own “climate protection plan”. And by doing so, they can get the official “climate school seal of approval”. For example, here you’ll find the list of schools that have officially become “Climate Schools” for 2012/13.
Criteria for getting the climate school seal of approval include: “drawing up a climate protection plan” along with “deciding on concrete pedagogical targets and CO2 saving goals” and these “targets must be short, mid and long term” and they have to “be backed up by measures, deadlines and responsibilities“, to name a few.
And schools can get the full support from city “advisers” for an entire range of climate protection aspects such as “energy saving, project and team assistance, seminars on climate protection and energy, or curriculum design for elementary schools“.
Sadly, as one plainly sees, climate in Germany is hardly a science, but an increasingly fanatic religion where everyone believes they have a solemn duty to rescue the climate. The masses, which now include very young children, are coerced by a powerful forces that use subtle but effective tactics: play along, or you’ll be marginalized, or worse.

In general children are taught that “being green” is being superior, and thus allows you to lecture the rest of the world. Green supremacy.
In fact, comparing a true climate protection believer to a skeptic in Germany is like comparing a saint to a miscreant. That’s what the green movement is aiming at.
Is it any wonder we recently saw a professor at the University of Graz calling for climate skeptics to be executed?
My, what a tolerant, enlightened and open-minded movement climate change has become. And what a wonderful education for our children.
Now for you children in Hamburg, Germany, be sure to do something for the climate today…just like they do in Britain…no pressure, really:

For first-time viewers of that sick little clip above, please be aware that it was produced by green activists 2 years ago, with the full enthusiasm of green groups all in an effort to coerce people to be green and to prevent the end of the world, as predicted by the PIK Mayan calendar.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is a story on how some good ol boys are pushing extreme scenarios to make big money.
Fiduciary duty is getting thrown overboard by banks, insurance companies and investment houses as they race to capitalize on carbon schemes and the “green economy” – all under the guise of “saving the planet”. 
When large financial institutions like banks, insurance companies or investment houses invite leading catastrophists to give speeches for the purpose of spreading fear among clients, and ignore the vast volume of science that indicates the contrary, then they are breaching their fiduciary duty to these clients.
Has bank-sponsored climate-fear-mongering become the new way of exercising fiduciary duty to clients? Seems so.
The OLB invites a climate extremist to speak to clients
A short time ago I got a brochure in the mail from my house bank, the Oldenburgische Landesbank (OLB). The brochure features distinguished speakers from media, politics, industry and science who are slated to give speeches during the year, all part of the OLB Forum. Being both a private and business clientof the OLB, I got this brochure too.
When I looked at the brochure I was dismayed to learn that one of the speakers this year is none other than the Merchant of Doom himself – Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research. He is scheduled by the OLB Forum to give a speech in Osnabrück on October 12:
Die Klmakrise (The Climate Crisis) 
Wednesday, 12 October 2011, Osnabrück, 19:00 h
Speech by Prof. Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, Director of the Earth Systems Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, on the state of the science on climate change.
Needless to say, I was not pleased to learn that my house-bank is getting into end-of-the world scenarios and working with such science salesmen. Banks pushing end-of-the-world scenarios, chronic pessimism and fear-mongering are not in my best interest, and certainly not in the best interest of many other businesses.
“What’s going on?” I thought.  Either the OLB is very naive, or is in the scam to make big money. Gee, I wonder which?
My call to the OLB
So I picked up the phone and reached a middle manager (little customers don’t reach the top brass) and expressed my displeasure over their invitation of Rahmstorf. I asked the OLB lady on the phone if the bank was aware of his extreme positions and his scientific intolerance. She said the bank was not aware of anything unusual and that they simply thought the distinguished Professor Rahmstorf would be interesting to have as a speaker. All very innocent sounding.
I explained to her how extreme Rahmstorf views are, but this all seemed foreign to her – after all she’s a banker, and not trained in science. I also sent a few reports and suggestions for alternative speakers that I think ought to appear to balance things out, but got no feedback. Overall I was a dissatisfied with the OLB’s response, attitude and dismissiveness. They just don’t want to be bothered by it. That’s why I decided to do a little research and write this post.
Surely the OLB top management is fully aware of Rahmstorf’s extreme scientific views. His invitation is no accident; it’s by design. Banks are salivating over the prospects of making the big profits that the green movement promises, clients be damned. Let them meet Rahmstorf and get to know the fury of man-made climate change up close and personal.
OLB is 64.3% owned by insurance giant Allianz 
Who really stands to gain from the climate crisis scenario and cutting carbon emissions? Overwhelmingly the answer is: investment banks, re-insurers and financial institutions, among others. They are all maneuvering to cash in big time at the expense of many small businesses and the working class, who will have to pay through the nose. Banks are focused on their interests first and then on the interests of its clients.  That’s the reality. There’s a saying about bankers:
When the sun shines, they give you an umbrella. And when it rains, they take it away.”
The OLB invited Rahmstorf because his horror scenarios help to herd investors in a certain investment direction and mindset. Considering the vast array of investment instruments that the low carbon-economy presents for some, there’s a real incentive to spread doom and gloom over the future of the climate.
The OLB purposely got Rahmstorf for the task of performing his magic with OLB corporate clients. Looking deeper into the OLB, one finds that the staid, conservative bank is majority-owned by insurance and financial powerhouse Allianz. And Allianz’s reinsurance arm Allianz SE Reinsurance stands to profit handsomely from higher insurance premiums based on Rahmstorf’s future climate threats.
But aren’t insurance institutions, banks, etc. obligated to inform their potential clients about the other side of the science, and thus the risks of green investments? Not if they want to make tons of money doing so. They’ll be more than happy to watch clients panic and buy up the green investments, carbon credits and accept higher insurance premiums. So tell the clients only what they really need to know, i.e. the world will end unless you pay green.
Rahmstorf: hired merchant of doom for re-insurers
Stefan Rahmstorf, distinguished professor of climate science of the renown Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research will give them the latest on the state of the climate (crisis).

He’ll instill the fear of catastrophic climate change that’s needed to generate acceptance. Surely they’ll believe him and do what is necessary to save the planet. The problem is that Rahmstorf fancies himself as a prophet who is not to be questioned. And who is going to? And as long as large institutions stand to profit from it all, questions aren’t likely to be raised.
And whenever one sees promotional literature from the world’s largest reinsurer, Munich Re, Rahmstorf’s name appears. He’s the European bank and reinsurer industry’s top man – their salesman for gloomy scenarios. Read klimaskeptiker (German).
With this in the backdrop, the Munich Re has a special fondness for the PIK climatologists. The klimaskeptiker writes:
The climatologists produce the most wonderful horror scenarios, which appear to be indisputable proof and prognoses that man is faced with many more and much worse natural catastrophes in the future. With this seemingly unavoidable and fast approaching catastrophe, politics can be driven and customers can be duped into thinking that higher insurance premiums are essential because the damage will be much higher in the future.”
Also read here a paper written by Rahmstorf for Munich Re called: Abrupt Climate Change (in German).
Surprise! Allianz is trading in carbon too
Moreover, Allianz is heavy into carbon trading. Its website writes:
Carbon markets have grown rapidly in the past few years and play a central role in global activities involving climate change today. In 2008, the volume of traded certificates totaled four billion tons of CO2. The global carbon market will also continue to experience strong growth far beyond the boundaries of the European Union over the coming years.”
Of course banks and financial institutions are allowed to pursue profits and their interests, but must do so while fulfilling their fiduciary duty to clients, and act in the best interest of society. Indeed the OLB, and surely a huge number of other banks with it, are going down a questionable path, especially when one takes a look at the complete body of climate science, and not only the extreme science of Stefan Rahmstorf. For now they are claiming to be working for the good of society by claiming it’s to protect the climate. Of course this is based on dubious science, and they refuse to look at any science that shows the contrary.
OLB and corporate misogyny?
And probing a little deeper into the OLB, one sees they are also neglecting more than just their fiduciary duties to clients, but that they’ve also abandoned their social responsibility to half of the German population (women). It’s indeed quite the good ol boys club. Misogyny is probably too strong a word of course, but when one looks at the top management of the OLB, one can only conclude that top managenment is no place for a lady.
There is not a single molecule of estrogen to be found there. On its Board of Directors, 0 of 5 are women. Its Supervisory Board  is not any better: 0 of 13 are women. And here’s the page with its notable employees, the movers and shakers in the bank: a whopping 0 of 24 are women!
You mean to tell me there is not a single German woman out there that can do the job? No corporation in Scandinavia, North America and in many other European countries would ever get away with this level of chauvinism.
I know of a lot of women’s groups who might not be too impressed by these figures.
It has to be pointed out that the Oldenburg region is a very traditional and conservative area. But we are also living in the year 2011 and not in the Dark Ages. Hard to believe that this absence has gone unnoticed.
The OLB also has an advisory council: here of 61 members only 6 are women. So we’ve got a good ol boys’ club here. After all, they are only helping to rescue the climate. They got Rahmstorf on board to certify the science.
Final comments
Don’t get me wrong. My family has been served very well as clients by the OLB for over 15 years, and we want to continue doing business with the bank. But it is becoming increasingly obvious that the OLB has to change its way of running things. The OLB is not alone here. I’m sure the situation is hardly better at the other German banks. So I’m not advocating clients to boycott. We just want to see BALANCE.
I preregistered to see Rahmstorf’s climate spook-show. If any NTZ readers in the area are OLB customers, do sign up. Who knows, maybe they’ll be a few skeptics there to balance the discussion.

Dr Judith Lean, as many of us know, is a scientist in the field of solar physics. I bet many of you were not aware of her athletic talents. During her studies at the Australian National University she was a world class swimmer on the university swim team, competing in the 50, 100 and 200-metre freestyles.
Swimsuit Judy
Turns out someone posted quite the collection of glossy peep-reviewed photos of Judy during her swimming days, at award ceremonies, in training, competition, etc.  The link that follows shows Judy in her (at times not so) full athletic uniform (Warning: hot!):

See photo gallery here

According to this site here:
Dr. Lean received a B.Sc. (Hons), Physics in 1974 from the Australian National University, Australia, where she was awarded the Priscilla Fairfield Bok Prize as the university’s best female student in the field of science. In 1980, she completed a Ph.D. in atmospheric physics from the University of Adelaide, Australia. She currently serves as the NTZ April Fools prank of 2011.”
Sorry guys. You really ought to check the calendar before believing every thing you read. Happy First of April Day!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA shot just before the conference started
Just got back, and here’s a recap of the conference, which I wrote on the train.
Yesterday’s first speaker was Vincent Courtillot, who spoke  about consensus. As soon as debate is abandoned, he says, then science stops. Overall he says the debate has to open up, and that it is surely poisoned by politics. I thought he gave an excellent speech.
Next, because Fred Singer couldn’t attend, we heard a 10 minute audio-message he had recorded earlier, where in it he said that there is no evidence of man made global warming, and that sea level rise for the next 90 years will rise around 18 cm, and not 1.5 m as the Propaganda Institute for Klima (PIK) claims. Singer also said he sees waning political will. He thinks the climate issue will be settled in five years. I think he’ll be right.
Prof Nir Shaviv 
Nir Shaviv then explained solar activity and climate, showing that the link between solar activity, cosmic rays and cloud formation is pretty much in the bag. CERN will be soon releasing results on this, too. Oceanic warming is not due to CO2, but to solar radiation. In fact, sea level rise rate correlates with the solar cycles, which I found interesting. Yet, in all presentations, the scientists cautioned against confusing correlation with causation. In summary, Shaviv theorises that the sun modulates the oceans, which in turn modulate the atmosphere (climate). The lag between solar activity and impact on climate was said to be about 3 years. Thus we ought to start seeing the impacts of the current low solar activity that has set in since about 2008.
Looking out the window, I’d say it’s about right!
The next presentation by Henrik Borchert complimented Shaviv’s presentation, supporting the solar link, which I think is the obvious place to look if you are going to look for what really drives climate. During many of these presentations, the CO2-driver theory was shown to have no merit, and was discarded every time. No wonder they don’t want to debate it.
Bob Carter
Bob Carter gave one of the most interesting talks, where he put the current warming in geological context. Conclusion: Nothing unnatural with today’s changes is detetctable. A later mathematical presentation by Horst-Joachim Lüdecke confirmed the same.
One point I found interesting was that most of today’s animals have their orgins from about 5 million years ago, meaning they’ve survived the wide climate variations of the ice ages, which means all the scare talk about biodiversity not surviving one or two degrees of temperature change is pure bunk. The only ones with a problem with a degree or two are the whiny warmists. They rest of the planet will be fine with it.
Lots of focus on proxies
Günter Ederer 
One of the most entertaining and interesting speeches came from veteran German journalist Günter Ederer, who has lots of contacts and thus has excellent insights as to what is going on. If you have the chance to hear him speak – don’t pass it up. He mentioned during the break that he will be coming out with a new book, and for sure it will be an interesting one. For Ederer: “The IPCC is not interested in science.” Indeed Ederer makes it clear where this is all taking us – some place really ugly.
Jan Veizer focused on sun evapo-transpiration and produced data and charts clearly showing that CO2 is not the driver. Also the claim that there is no correlation between solar irradiance and temperature over the last years was fabricated, and thus the solar theory cannot be discarded. They adjusted the solar irradiance data with no justification. Veizer presented a number of correlations showing the sun is the driver.
Why would that be difficult to believe?

I liked his analogy where he compared to CO2 to Lichtenstein. If warmists were economists, they would try to boost the entire European economy by stimulating the economy of tiny Lichtenstein. That’s pretty much how they want to control the climate.
Meteorologist Klaus-Eckhardt Puls, 3rd from left.
One presentation I enjoyed, and one that throws in lots more uncertainty, was by Ian Pilmer, a geologist. Fascinating was the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of volcanoes below the sea level and many under Antarctica, and not a bit of data has been collected on any of these. These emit huge amounts of CO2.
The best one! The most interesting presentation was made by meteorologist Klaus-Eckhart Puls. His lively, fast-paced presentation drove nails into the coffin of the AGW notion. First he showed that North Sea sea levels have been rising at the same rate for four hundred years now. NO SIGN OF ACCELERATED SEA LEVEL RISE! He also showed that the Sahara is shrinking as plant life is encroaching more and more. 300,000 sq km of trees were added over the last 20 years (as recently reported in FOCUS). He also debunked all the hyped up media claims of more storms and stronger this or that. His presentation had a good dose of humour and will be really worth watching when EIKE posts it.
During the break
The conference then ended with presentations by Dieter Ameling, Lutz Peters and Michael Limburg. Regrettably I couldn’t stay for the closing speech because trains don’t wait.
From a political and economic standpoint, the consensus is that the German government’s environmental and green economy policies are going to take Germany to hell in a hand basket – and quickly. But, being a guest here, I’ll refrain from commenting.
One speaker did point out that in communist times, you couldn’t say anything because they were always listening. But today, you can say anything you want, because they’ve stopped listening!
Now the big disappointment
I went there with high expectations because I kept hearing from the real climate scientists, who claim absolute knowledge, that the sceptics are funded by Big Oil. So I was hoping to go to Berlin Denier Conference and get some of that Big Oil money too.
But much to my dismay, the oil executives weren’t even there, and so I wasn’t able to close a disinformation for funding agreement. What crap! So I spoke to the gents at Science Sceptical, a German blog, and they also have to go without. So my dream of getting millions for doing this blog have completely vanished. All this blogging has been for nothing – fooled again by the warmists. When will I ever learn not to trust them?
Anyway, if there are any oil executives out there reading this blog, please note that I’m now seriously considering changing sides – and going where the big money is :).
Finally, my apologies for any misspelled names.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI thought this kind of stuff didn’t happen way down there in the tropical Caribbean. All that global-warming-caused cold seems to be spreading everywhere.
The German online Die Zeit today has a video clip here, and writes:
According to meteorologists, it was the coldest December on the Carribean island in 50 years. In some regions the temperature fell to 1.9°C.”
In the clip one man is quoted as saying that 15°C is already cold for Cuba. The Head Cuban Meteorologist says “the weather is going to get more extreme and that hurricanes will be stronger”. Yeah yeah. The clip then adds:
Most Cubans can’t recall ever having such cold weather.”

Last winter was also a harsh one in Cuba. Last January, 26 patients at a psychiatric hospital in Havana died as a result of cold weather, so reports the M&C News here. But we can’t really blame climate change for that, now can we? There are accusations that the hospital was too poorly equipped to care for the patients. M&C reports:
Cuba provides free universal health care. The communist state admits that its system is in a poor state, but blames the US trade embargo, which makes it difficult to import medical supplies and equipment.
Sure – blame warming for all the cold, and so let’s blame US capitalism for failed socialism too. You Canadians may want to go elsewhere for your holidays this winter.
Cold In India
It’s also has been very cold in India too. The Swiss 20 min reports of “extreme cold”.  20min writes:
Alone in the state of Uttar Pradesh 24 people have died over the last days, reports the newspaper the «Times of India» on Monday. There were three additioonal deaths in the Indian part of Kaschmir, where temperatures on -23°C were measured over the weekend. According to forecasts by meteorologists.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome bloggers do a yearly wrap up, and so I thought I’d do a monthly and annual summary today.
2010 – the humble start of NTZ
This blog all started with me reading climate science skeptic sites like WUWT, IceCap, CA, Bishop Hill and many others since 2007. In March 2010 I happened to be at Donna Laframboise’s No Frakking Consensus and volunteered to be a citizen auditor for her IPCC 2007 audit of the literature cited in the report, which we found out was quite gray.
So through all this I got the invitation from WordPress to start my own blog. I thought: “Hey – why not!,” and started on April 1st. My humble target was to write a couple of posts per week and to reach a 1000 page-views by the end of the month.
When you start blogging, everything feeds on itself. You get your first reader comment, and it’s a thrill. And so you write more. I ended up writing much more of course, at least one post a day. And the visitors came gradually, 40 – 50 page-views a day at first. One day I had 179 – a post about the first Earth Day.
The big break
The big break came on April 23 when I came across a story at the German-language Ria Novosti which had a piece called Global Cooling Will Make Arctic Natural Resources Inaccessible – Scientist about a Russian scientist who warned of cooling. That story led me to write the post: Russian Scientist: Expect Cooling – Pols Sitting On The Wrong Horse. It was Friday afternoon I remember, and not much happened…until Marc Morano put it up as the big headline at Climate Depot a day later on Saturday. And the rest is history. That day, April 24, NTZ went from 50 page-views – to the thousands. NoTricksZone was born. I’ve been hopelessly addicted ever since. At the end of April I had over 8000 page views – well over the original target of 1000.
Thank you readers
I don’t like to give out numbers, but I am happy to say that in November NTZ went over the 150,000 page views plateau for that month, far beyond anything I ever imagined. Thank you readers!
I’ve made all the mistakes new bloggers could make. You find out what works and what doesn’t. I tend to rush things out too quickly, and need to be more patient. It really is best to post it in the morning after a night’s sleep. I’ve blown my top a couple of times, too. Hopefully there are no hard feelings out there.
It is important to stay on the good side of your fellow bloggers, as readers get referred back and forth and all. The sites I get the most traffic from (in random order!) are Tom Nelson, WUWT, Climate Depot and Bishop Hill. There are many others. But it’s not about getting traffic. To me it’s all about having fun doing it. If you have fun, then things naturally fall into place all by themselves.
December NTZ summary
December 3-4: The Climate Conference in Berlin where I got the chance to meet some of the other German bloggers and have even agreed to cooperate with them in an effort to get the German stories out to the world. That’s right, the spotlight is now on you German warmist scientists from now on – so behave yourselves.

December 7: The newest list of climate-gates was released: List of gates balloons to 129/. But I think that will be the last. There are just too many scandals out there to keep track of.
December 13: The failure of Cancun – Cancun complete travesty and rout/. The media and bureaucrats made it look like a success, but it was a failure throughout. But they sure did have a grand ol time down there (in the record cold)!

December 17: Der Spiegel’s 1974 article on a coming ice age was examined. Read here. It’s a bit hilarious that the chances of warming back then were pegged at 1 in 10,000 – at best!
December 18: And what would December 2010 be without all the news of the cold and snow that was supposed to be rare in Europe. Read here and here.
December 23: And the PIK trying to blame it all on warming.  PIK says expect warmer colder winters.
December 27: We also heard a German professor come out on German radio and slam all the global warming science put out by the warmists: German climate professor slams climate religion.
December 28: Matti Vooro’s research showed that there is a growing number of international scientists who, like Joe Bastardi, feel cooling is in the future. Cooling over the next 1 to 3 decades/.
Grand year for the skeptics
All in all, 2010 was a grand year for the skeptics, and a nightmare for the warmists, who were kept barely alive by an El Nino. But that baby won’t be there in 2011! By 2015, AGW will be relegated to a footnote in history and remain popular only among a few die-hard fringe kooks like fraudsters James Hansen and Michael Mann. Their days are numbered – start counting them off. I feel more optimistic than ever.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote here about an expedition that included a Canadian meteorologist/journalist Jocelyne Blouin whose documentary tried to convince us that a single receding glacier at a single location in Greenland over the last 10 years was “direct proof “of climate change and so was justification to “act now”. The target of the documentary of course was to spread panic and heighten the level of urgency.
Wondering just what might be going on up there in that part of Greenland, I decided to check the weather out records of stations located around Kangerlussuaq (3)67.0°N, 50°40’W.  The following is a map of Greenland with the locations I looked at. Kangerlussuaq where Blouin’s film was made, is no. 3.
Given the fact that Kangerlussuaq has a sizable airport, one would think it would have a weather station and weather records. But GISS appears not use it as a station. Therefore I checked the GISS temperature records of locations near Kangerlussuaq.
First I checked Jakobshavn (1), which is further north. We see that the GISS series stopped in 1980. Note how the temperature follows the AMO, and that temperature rose  from 1900 to 1940, but then cooled!

Next is Angmagssalik (2) in Southeastern Greenland. Here we have a complete temperature record and see rapid warming from 1900 to 1940 as well, and then followed by cooling, and then warming over the last 30 years. The temperature trend is in sync with the AMO. Hardly looks like a continuous steady rise to me. Smoothing would show that it was a tad warmer in the 1930s and 40s.

Next is Egedesminde (4) The temperature chart starts only at 1950, where a cooling trend continues until about 1990. Suddenly the temperature spikes upwards. Looking at Google maps, this station seems to have a lot of new buildings and asphalt in the vicinity. I haven’t been able to locate the station or Stevenson screen, which is likely near the airport.

The next station near Kangerlussuaq is Godthab Nuuk (5), which is a little south and bit more west. Except for a warm 2010, the overall trend is cooling. Rapid warming has occurred since 1995. Again, looking at the airport, where perhaps the station is placed, one sees a lot of asphalt, buildings and other potential heat sources. Overall, though, the chart shows no man made global warming.

The next temperature record is Ivigut Greenland (6), which is a ways down south. Unfortunately this series ends back around 1968. But again we see the warming from 1900 to 1940, and then the start of cooling – all in sync with the AMO.

Summary
All surrounding stations show a warm time back around 1940, and a warming trend beginning around 1980 or 90, which may be due to station siting issues. All stations seem to be heavily impacted by the AMO. The claim that there is a CO2 cause, as Blouin asserts, and that the warming is unusual has no merit. Also ice cores show that Greenland was very warm 900 years ago, during the MWP.  In short: Madame Blouin est plein merde.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s Sunday and this report here at The Local has parallels that I just couldn’t help but notice.
For us skeptics we should never be so naive to think that we are going to convince the world of natural climate change in our lifetime. As history shows us, those who are right often have to wait a very long time before getting the credit or apology they deserve. Hey, it’s the price of far-sightedness.
In climate science we are indeed dealing in large part with religious, fanatic zealots – all drugged up in their CO2 global warming paranoia. Today every weather anomaly even gets blamed on the wicked ways of CO2 emitters, who, we are told, have a pact with the Big Oil devil.
Today, skeptic scientists, bloggers and a few journalists are being singled out and a guilty verdict is being sought for them in the court of public opinion. Some nut-cases are even calling for Nuremberg-type trials.
The Local here writes about skeptics and dissidents (witches!) of the past, how they were blamed for natural catastrophes. Take Katharina Henot –
Germany’s most notorious ‘witch’ – stood accused of having entered into a pact with the devil, conjured up a plague of caterpillars, sown strife and encouraged sexual deviancy. In 1627 she was sentenced to death by torture by the Cologne Court. 385 years later, in a symbolic gesture by the Cologne City Council, Henot and 37 other “witches” executed by local authorities are to be pardoned and rehabilitated, wrote Die Welt newspaper on Saturday.”
So you see, the path back to sanity can indeed be a very long one. Those with the truth at times are put to death as “criminals”.
As the climate catastrophe-obsessed mob decends deeper into madness, us skeptics must always keep in mind that we could very well end up being burned at the stake (of public opinion) and not be rehabilitated until the next phase of the solar millenial cycle when the Earth enters its next cold period – 500 years from now.

101 in Ukraine — 24 in Romania  — 17 in Czech Republic — 11 in Slovakia — 64 in Russia – no end in sight! — Read here (German)
===============================================
Germany’s no. 1 daily Bild (by circulation numbers) reports on the Killer Cold now paralyzing Europe and Asia, and calls it the worst in 25 years. The cold has hit Eastern Europe especially hard, with temperatures plummeting to -30°C throughout the Ukraine and Poland. So far the cold has claimed 139 lives, with 3 in Germany.
Europe's temperatures are forecast to remain 10°C or colder below normal - worst cold in 25 years.
Source: http://wxmaps.org/pix/temp4.html
Bild reports that in Rome, Italy, school was called off today because of the intense cold and the city expects 15 cm of snow overnight.
In Serbia, over 6 feet of snow have fallen over the last few weeks. In Turkey heavy snows have have blanketed much of the country, with 50cm falling in Istanbul on Wednesday.
At Atatürk-Flughafen in Istanbul 180 flights were cancelled.

According to the BBC: “In Italy, weather experts say it is the coldest week for 27 years.”
In the Urals and Siberia, the temperature fell to -40C while in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana, a forecaster told Interfax-Kazakhstan news agency the wind-chill factor meant the real temperature was down to -52C, even though the air temperature was -35C.”
Gas and electricitry supply have collapsed in some areas, leaving many to shiver.
-39°C in Finland
Bild reported Thursday that a new cold record had been set in Finland: minus 39°C was recorded in Northern Finland.
In Eastern Germany, temperatures are forecast to plummet to minus 20°C in the days ahead. According to Helmut Malewski of the German Weather Service: “No warm-up is in sight for the coming 8 days.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother “abnormal” baby is born.
Heike M. was born this morning at St. Peters hospital and weighed in at 3850 grams and was 57 cm long. Doctors said that she was heavier and longer than normal. The normal weight for a baby girl in Germany is 3250 grams and 51 cm long. Though bigger than normal babies can occur, their increasing frequency is a sign that size at birth is going up, experts say. If the trends continue, babies will outweigh their mothers by the year 3700.  
Also Heike’s hair was more reddish than normal, and not the blond we used to see more often, say 100 years ago. Moreover, Heike’s skin colour was too pale. Though German babies tend to be on the pale side, it is abnormal for a baby to be as pale as Heike. The last baby that was that pale was 2 and half years ago. Doctors report that St. Peters hospital has not seen a normal baby in about 15 years.
Last week Sven was born. He weighed in at 2850 grams and was 49 cm long. Doctors said that although smaller babies are not unusual, and will also occur in the future, Sven’s smaller size, they say, is attributable to “natural variability”. Mothers, they say, will however have to fear oversized abnormal babies in the future.
Maybe some readers by now are wondering what all this is supposed to mean. I’m merely using this baby example to demonstrate the absurdity of taking the statistic of a single random event and attaching too much significance to its deviation from the mean. This unfortunately has become standard practice in weather analysis and climate.

At the end of each month in weather, the statistics get tallied up and compared to a 30-year mean that is arbitrarily chosen. Nowadays if there is a single weather deviation from the mean, we are told that something is wrong and that something significant is happening. But as the above baby example shows, this is a ridiculous practice and we need to get away from it.
The German Weather Service (DWD) just released its statistics for March, 2012 (for Germany) and they tell us that the month was “too warm, too sunny, and too dry”, i.e. that once again the month was not normal. It appears that the German Weather Service, and especially the media, have forgotten that weather is never normal.
Indeed things are getting so bad that the media and desperate warmists are now fretting over half months, or even claiming that single weather events are climatically significant. It seems that deviations are no longer supposed to occur. More often than not we now hear in Germany claims like: “The first half of this month was 4°C warmer than normal”, or “the last 10 days of this month were the wettest in 33 years”, or “the winds in Hamburg in yesterday’s storm were the strongest in 6 years.” The public is supposed to believe that something is wrong with every deviation that occurs in a chaotic system.
We have to return back to reality and remember that with weather, anomaly is normal, and normal is anomaly. Weather anomalies are not climate trends. Anyone claiming otherwise is either a charlatan or a plain fool.
Note: The above baby characteristic statistics are arbitrary and selected only for the purpose of demonstrating a point. I don’t know what an average baby is.

===================================
How Much Power Should We Consume?
By Ed Caryl
There have been many suggestions here on this blog, and elsewhere, that the aim of the CAGW hoax is population control.
It is obvious that the poor people of the world produce more babies; witness Africa with a birth rate much higher than the rest of the world but a very low GDP. The Africans would seem to be the model for what the Greens want the world to be: a low carbon footprint. But with their high birth rate and low production, most of Africa teeters on the brink of famine. Unable to afford energy and sanitation, many burn forests and dump their waste untreated into the environment. This would suggest that the “low carbon footprint” model is only a recipe for disaster.
On the other hand, countries with well developed economies have low birth rates but high carbon footprints. If we are to reach a stable population, one that can be sustained far into the future, a world-wide well developed economy will be required.
A well developed economy requires energy. Producing food, goods, keeping people warm or cool, assuring hygiene, and providing transportation for people, food, and products, require energy.
What are the relationships between population growth, energy consumption, and production? First, here’s a chart of electricity consumed versus GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per person for 202 countries. (Source for all the numbers in these charts is the CIA World Factbook.) Electrical power consumption can be considered a proxy for all energy consumption.

Figure 1: Per person GDP as a function of electricity use.
It is clear from Figure 1 that to have a well developed economy with a high GDP, energy consumption must also be high. A rough trend can be seen: each KW hour produces about $10 GDP per person. The average GDP per kilowatt-hour for all countries is $8.31. The ten highest electrical power users per person are: Iceland, Norway, Kuwait, Canada, Finland, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, Luxembourg, United States, and Australia. Oil production in Africa and the Middle East distort some of the GDP numbers.
What does a high GDP do to birth rate?

Figure 2: As per capita GDP rises, fertility rates (children per woman) fall.

In Figure 2, a fertility rate of 2 is the replacement level. Fertility rates below 2 indicate a declining population. Above 2 there is an increasing population. As you can see, most of Africa is poor and pregnant. African countries that are not poor are oil producers like Libya and Nigeria. Most European populations are in decline. The exceptions are Andorra and Gibraltar. Asian countries with thriving economies are below the replacement value. Singapore is the bottom point on fertility with a rate of 0.78 children per woman. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau are just above that number.
There is a third leg to our stool: the relationship between fertility rate and electrical power. The next chart shows that relationship.

 Figure 3. The more power people consume, the less children they have.
Again, most of Africa, and some of Asia, is pregnant and powerless. It should be clear by now that there is an optimum electrical power and GDP necessary to result in a sustainable, stable population. Those numbers would appear to be about 3,000 KW hours and a GDP of about $30,000 annually per person. The total population is about seven billion. Therefore:
7 billion X 3,000 KWh = 21 trillion KWh.
21 trillion kilowatt-hours would seem to be a reasonable target. The world currently produces 19 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity. It appears that about 10% more electrical energy, with the accompanying improvement in GDP, primarily in Africa and some parts of Asia, would go a long way toward improving the quality of life and stabilizing population in those areas.
Energy drives civilization. This fundamental should be obvious to all, but apparently has not penetrated the consciousness of Greens, Progressives, and warmist zealots. Man builds cities to concentrate people, jobs, markets, and energy use into more efficient areas. Energy allows more efficient production, including food, technology, housing, and transportation. Cities and energy encourage creativity and innovation. More energy means a higher Gross Domestic Product.

Figure 4: GDP as a function of electrical power usage, for Europe and the Americas.
Figure 4 shows a clear relationship between GDP and electrical power consumption. If less electricity is generated, the cost of electricity will go up (due to the economic law of supply and demand), less will be used, and GDP will go down. The converse is, of course, more desirable: more power and reducing the cost, will result in a higher GDP. High priced wind and solar is not the answer. Let the market decide how to generate more power efficiently.
For those that are screaming “what about carbon footprint!”, the market will very soon take care of that non-problem. We are currently passing the “peak oil” point. Fossil fuels, in the long term, will be a declining portion of our power production. Barring governmental stupidity, nuclear power will be an increasing percentage of energy production.
Due to the fact that carbon dioxide is a vital plant food, as well as a minor greenhouse gas, sometime in the not too distant future we will be developing schemes to keep the atmospheric CO2 level above 400 ppm or higher.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s the headline at the online Die Welt. This according to former German Green Party member Rezzo Schlauch.
And when a Green party member says that, you know it’s going to be really costly – especially for the German state of Baden Württemberg, where the Greens swept into power in last Sunday’s state elections and are set to rapidly shut down the state’s nuclear power.
This is going to be fun to watch, but will be painful for the taxpayers.
Rezzo Schlauch was a German Parliamentarian from from 1994 to 2005, and Green Party Faction Chief from 1998 to 2002 in the Bundestag (Federal Parliament). In the year 2000 Gerhard Schroeder’s SPD/Green coalition government pushed through a law that mandated the winding down of nuclear power.
After Fukushima, everybody wants to shut down the nuclear power plants rapidly, especially the southern German state of  Baden Württemberg. But the hitch is that the Baden Württemberg owns a 45% stake of energy giant EnBW. Shutting down EnBW’s nuclear power plants is going to hurt the state – big time. Why is it these things never get communicated before all these fuzzy warm green save-the-planet schemes get put into action?

According Die Welt: 
In an interview with the internet portal Entermagazin Schlauch said: ‘When you are a shareholder of a company that is up to 50% dependent on nuclear power, and the nuclear power is radically stopped, which is the goal, and must be the goal – then you are destroying capital’.”
Economics learned the hard way. Baden Württemberg ‘s state elections of last Sunday will put a Green Party governor in the capital of Stuttgart – Winfried Kretschmann, who is adamant about shutting down all the nuclear power plants as quickly as possible. Baden Württemberg is Germany’s largest producer of nuclear power.
Schlauch says that the state now faces huge challenges. They have to make up the huge atomic power shortfall quickly, and that is going to be expensive. No problem though. Where there is a state, there are also taxpayers. Schlauch warned:
Of course this is going to cost money that is going to have to be paid by the taxpayer.”
Really? I always thought the sun didn’t send power bills and that money was blowing in the wind. Looks like lots of money is going to get blown. Dear citizens, you voted for this – now live with it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Mitteldeutsche Zeitung (Central German Newspaper) reports on Europe’s extended brutal winter. In today’s online article, it reminds us that the cold is not only a phenomenon that is isolated in Central Europe, but one that is widespread and extends all the way across Russia to Siberia.
The article writes that there’s lots of data showing that March, 2013, was a record cold month, citing German meteorologist Dominik Jung
In northeast Germany, March 2013 was even the coldest March in 130 years. However, not only Germany and wide areas of Europe suffered from the cold wave reports Dominik Jung: ‘Quite to the contrary, the dramatic negative temperature deviations from the 1981 -2010 longterm mean were widespread across western, central, eastern Europe, all the way to Siberia.‘  Moreover, there were many regions in North and South America where it was very cold. … the cold in Germany was no single isolated case here.”
I never knew global warming could cause such widespread cold.  I thought it was supposed to make things warmer.

I ventured into the French websites and found this jewel of meteorological ignorance at the French sceptic site rechauffement mediatique.org. See video here Radio Canada (broadcast in October).
Featured in the piece is veteran Quebec meteorologist Jocelyne Blouin at Radio-Canada.
Last September (er, late summer) Blouin joined a Dutch expedition to southwest Greenland with journalists, tourists and meteorologists in order to observe firsthand the devastating impacts of “climate change” on Greenland. The video report of this expedition in French, with parts in English, just couldn’t be funnier. You think AIT was bad science?
Day 1
The expedition begins in southwest Greenland at Kangerlussuaq and takes the team 40 km inland to the Russel Glacier, where they set up camp 660 m above sea level. Ms Blouin comments:
It’s weird. It’s not even cold with temperatures near 0°C even though it’s the start of winter.
Last I heard, mid September is still late summer, and so it shouldn’t be a surprise that “it’s not even cold” and that they only have to wear parkas, mittens and ski hats. And isn’t it strange how these journalists only venture out to such places at times the ice is at a minimum?
Day 2
The team walks to a moulin where the ice is 200 to 300 m thick, and they act surprised that in late summer water is flowing down into it. Also someone explains that volcanic soot and pollution aerosols trapped in the ice serve to accelerate melting. Blouin adds:
The ice is filled with crevices – a sure sign that the ice is moving a lot. It’s incredible.
Then Blouin again mentions the melt. Remember – it’s late summer in Southern Greenland! Blouin laments:
The whole time you hear running water. You can even hear it running in the crevices. There’s way too much water.
Later in the day they return to camp “full of emotion”.
Day 3

The guide explains (in English) how the glacier works like a bulldozer and how the spot they are standing on was covered with ice 10 years earlier.
Again, at the end of summer, they are surprised that water is running. Moreover, they are astonished to see pieces of the leading edge of the glacier breaking off and falling into the lake. Just a week earlier the lake was much higher. But because ice blocking the outlet had melted (in the summertime), much of it emptied out. Blouin describes what she sees:
Everywhere the glacier is retreating.
You can hear it groaning and cracking. Water is running non-stop. It’s too hot. At this time of the year water is supposed to freeze. The glaciers are supposed to be sleeping. Yet you hear it moving – cracking.
Day 4
Back on terra firma, the team is in discussion.
– You can discuss it for years and years, but that won’t solve the problem!
– We just want to stop the discussion and do something! Act!
Blouin adds:
The others want to convince the sceptics. Everyone agrees. Global warming is causing damage and here in Greenland, we have the direct proof.
The guide adds:
This summer is probably the warmest in Greenland ever recorded. It’s the beginning of what’s to come.
And later makes an emotional plea:
That’s all you need to know, indeed. Look at the glaciers! they can tell you what will happen. And what these glaciers are telling me and the public is that you can’t deny global warming. It’s impossible!
Sorry dear Mr Guide and Ms Meteorologist Blouin,  it’s not all we need to know. There’s a lot more to it. You could start by finding out why they call it “Greenland” in the first place.

Share this...FacebookTwitterParts of Europe are being gripped by unusual cold, even though the calendar says it’s meteorological summer. Now children in Sweden are finding out what snow is like – in June! Strangest warming I’ve ever seen.

Winter pounds Sweden – and it’s summer!
The English language The Local here writes that “Stockholm broke an 84-year-old cold record on Saturday, as the capital’s temperature only reached 6 degrees Celsius, the lowest June maximum daily temperature the city has seen since 1928.”
Indeed, you could be excused for thinking that the current chill is more like winter than summer. It was actually colder in the capital yesterday than on Christmas Eve. ‘The temperature was a degree lower than it was at Christmas in Stockholm, so it is colder. And it’s windier, too,’ said SMHI’s meteorologist Lisa Frost to newspaper Dagens Nyheter.”
Just two days ago The Local here reported that snow blanketed northern parts.
Residents in northern Sweden were forced to grab shovels rather than sun lotion on what was supposed to be the first day of summer, as much of the region was left covered in a thick blanket of snow on Friday. As much as 20 centimetres of thick, wet snow fell in parts of Västerbotten County, giving residents quite a shock when they woke up Friday morning.”
The mercury also dropped to minus 6 degrees Celsius in one town, making it the coldest June Sweden recording in 20 years. The Local adds:
The weather agency forecasts that the first weekend in June will feel more like the start of winter than the start of summer.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe losing side will have to pay up to $5000 to a children's charity,
Warmist and NTZ observer “Robhon” has daringly entered a bet for US $5000 with NTZ and NTZ  readers that the next decade 2011 – 2020 will be warmer on average than the previous 2001 – 2010 decade.
Last update click here.
NTZ and NTZ readers say it will be cooler, or the same.
The loser of the bet will have to pay the amount to a charity for children in dire need, such as Children Hospice International.
The charity orgnaisation will have to be international, support children in dire need and at the same time have low overhead costs.
We want to thank Robhon for accepting this sporting challenge, which is for a good cause. Win or lose – everyone wins.
So far NTZ and readers have pledged about $300.00 (5 Jan 2011), betting that the earth will be cooler or at the same temperature on average over the next 10 years. We would like to get that amount up to the maximum of $5000 that Robhon has committed. Robhon also mentioned that he may find others willing to put their money where their mouths are.
The bet 
If the decade of 2011 – 2020 is cooler or the same on average globally than the decade of 2001 – 2010, then warmist Robhon will pay to charity the total amount this pledged by NTZ and readers until February 1, 2011. The target is $5K.
If the average global temperature for the decade 2011 – 2020 is warmer than the average of 2001 – 2010, then NTZ and readers will pay everything we pledged to the charity.
Which dataset?
It has been agreed to use both a composite of RSS and UAH lower troposphere temperature – close to the earth’s surface. The result will be accepted without quibbling, as it is agreed that it’s the best we’ve got.
How and when to pay?
Payment will be made when the bet is settled, i.e. 2021, or possibly earlier if it’s clear who the winner will be, but only with mutual agreement.
Right now I am only gathering the pledges and putting your username, e-mail address and amount pledged on a list. So if us coolists win, then we will not have to pay. Robhon on the other hand will have to pay an amount that equals the total that us coolists pledged – up to 5000 (five thousand) dollars. If us coolists lose, then each person will have to pay directly to the chosen charity organisation. Even if us coolists lost, I would still make the contribution anyway, simply because I think it’s for a good cause.

You will be asked to pay when the bet is settled, i.e. 2021.
Where, when and how do I make my pledge?
You can pledge by leaving a comment. I will put your username and email address and amount on a list. I will post the list from time to time (without e-mail address of course). Please make your pledges before March 1, 2011.
WHICH CHARITY GETS THE MONEY?
As mentioned above, the charity organisation will be (1) one that both sides agree on, (2) helps children in dire need (3) have low overhead costs so the money really helps and (4) be international.
What happens if the loser doesn’t pay?
If the loser of the bet refuses to pay, then he will be forever regarded as a useless deadbeat loudmouth scumbag with no honour. Ed and Juraj have the bucket of tar and a sack of feathers ready. They will not hesitate to tar and feather anyone – warmist or coolist!
How will we control if someone pays?
I have a list, and somehow we will get a statement from the charity organisation confirming that payment was indeed made.
What if something happens to me and I can’t pay?
Not your fault. You’ll be simply taken off the list and you will be remembered as a generous and honourable person.
So please pledge a nominal amount!
I hope that more readers here will pledge some money for this bet. Again it would be nice to have Robhon pay the full $5000 he has committed, and so I need to get as many pledges as possible. Minimum is $10.
So what is it going to be? Cooler, or warmer?
The bet is on!

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to a new paper published by the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestial Physics, it appears the cause behind global warming is a lot more complicated than a few molecules of CO2.
The paper titled Geomagnetic South Atlantic Anomaly and global sea level rise: a direct connection? authored by De Santis et al recently has uncovered an “intriguing and to date unreported relationship between the surface area of the South Atlantic Anomaly of the geomagnetic field and the current trend in sea level rise”.
The abstract starts:
These two geophysical variables have been growing coherently during the last three centuries, thus strongly suggesting a causal relationship supported by some statistical tests.”
According to the paper, the first quantitative evidence of a relationship between the geomagnetic field, external field activities and weather or climate change was given by Wollin et al (1971) and by Bucha (1976, 1978).
The anomaly at an altitude of approximately 560 kilometers, 2007 (Source: NASA).
The abstract states:
The monotonic increase of the SAA surface area since 1600 may have been associated with an increased inflow of radiation energy through the inner Van Allen belt with a consequent warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and finally global sea level rise.”
The good news for the IPCC is that there is little understanding of the connection between the SAA and warming, thus giving them reason enough to just completely ignore it in its next assessment report.

The paper’s abstract:
Although we cannot establish a clear connection between SAA dynamics and global warming, the strong correlation between the former and global sea level supports the idea that global warming may be at least partly controlled by deep Earth processes triggering geomagnetic phenomena, such as the South Atlantic Anomaly, on a century timescale.”
The paper then states that the geomagentic field can modulate charged particles reaching the earth and that the average field strength has decreased substantially over the last 150 years. The paper adds:
This reduction of the field strength may imply an enhanced effect on some climatic parameters, if in fact the energy flux associated with the incoming particles has an effective impact on climate.”
Could this all be just a coincidence? The authors quantified the correlation with two robust tests, and write in their conclusion:
The agreement between global sea level rise and SAA area is spectacular […] a mere coincidence is highly unlikely.”
There you have it. Yet another phenomenon that likely impacts the climate without CO2. Now you understand why in my last post I wrote the IPCC and its 2007 AR4 report are totally obsolete and divergent from reality. The IPCC models are Stone Age. With its focus welded solely on CO2, the IPCC is out to lunch, out of the ballpark – and on a different planet.

Share this...FacebookTwitterActually, who’s counting? It seems a major solar company goes bust every other day.

Odersun – the latest German ghost town. Failed solar company lays off 260 employees.
The latest to bite the dust and add to the rapidly rising sea level of red ink is Odersun (sorry, but even their website is no longer operating)  in eastern Germany, near the border to Poland.
According to Klimaretter (Climate Rescuers) website:
Frankfurt/Oder headquartered solar company must stop operations on June 1. As the dpa press agecny reports, 260 employees were laid off already last week because the company was unable to pay wages. Negotiations with Staatsholding Rusnano as an investor crumbled over the last week.”
Not even the Russians are interested in German state-subsidized industry or companies.

Odersun is just the latest in a long string of spectacular green failures sweeping across Germany, thus vaporising the fantasy of economic revitalization in the former communist East Germany.
Just months ago politicians from every party were promising high-tech jobs and heady times ahead, thanks to the green revolution they boasted to have ushered in. However, very few people expected bitter reality to replace blissful fantasy so quickly. Politicians, once falling all over themselves to be on camera standing in front of humming state-subsidized solar module production lines, are now bolting for the exits, leaving a landscape littered with shuttered factories.
A money abyss
According to the online Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten:
State of Brandenburg poured tax money to the tune of millions into solar module manufacturer Odersun. The company is now being shut down and its 260 employees will be laid off on June 1. The bankruptcy had sparked a heated debate on the politics of subsidies by the state and especially criticism of economic minister Ralf Christoffers (Left Party) . For years Odersun had been generously supported – with subsidies of more than 10 million euros, a guarantee of 8 million euros, and finally just when bankruptcy appeared inevitable, an emergency funding of 3.2 million euros approved by Christoffers.”
Count it up – well over 20 million euros!
Now that the pigs have thoroughly gorged themselves and left the trough, I wonder who is left to pick up the tab.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt Der Spiegel Axel Bojanowski writes a story about a study appearing in the journal Climate Change:  A 101 year record of windstorms in the Netherlands.
The results of the study are revealing. Let us recall that in Germany and within many circles of “experts” the prevailing wisdom is that man-made global warming is leading to more frequent and more severe storms. However, this new study shows that this is a myth. The study’s abstract concludes:
The Netherlands is currently experiencing the minimum aggregate storm damage of the past 100 years, though only slightly lower than a quiet period of 50 years ago.”
And Der Spiegel writes:
Prognosticated climate warming produced fears of more frequent storm surges and flooding. Especially the Netherlands was threatened. Because much of the country is below sea level – higher dikes would be needed to protect the country. However these worries are shown to be baseless a new study in the journal ‘Climate Change’ shows: According to the statistics, the Netherlands is experiencing fewer and fewer storm surges.”
Since systematic records have been kept starting 101 years ago, never have there been fewer storms than in the last 15 years, reports Stephen Cusack of the private research institute ‘Risk Management Solutions’ in London. Not only storms as a whole, but also storms with heavy damages have greatly reduced.”

Now those are results that completely contradict everything special interests like the re-insurance industry have been telling us.
Solar or ocean related?
The abstract provides another interesting observation (my emphasis):
The resulting windstorm loss time-series for the Netherlands contains some interesting features. Annual losses are stable over the whole period and have a dominant cycle with a period of about 50 years.”
The study also says that weak storms were more frequent during the previous lull 50 years ago and that the current lull is somewhat different in character. The journal suspects that this may be due to “a different mix of climate forcing mechanisms in modern times compared to 50 years ago.”
This ought not be a surprise, though. Weather is chaotic and it would be indeed foolish to assume that weather duplicates itself. Change is a natural process. It only proves that climate changes – like it’s supposed to!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Carbon Cycle – Nature or Nurture?
By Ed Caryl
We know, from ice measurements, measurements at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, Barrow Alaska, and the South Pole, that atmospheric carbon dioxide has been increasing in our atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial age. We also know that temperatures have been increasing in that same time interval, as the earth warms up from the “Little Ice Age.” The proponents of the theory that man’s production of CO2 has resulted in this temperature increase, use that idea to predict future temperature increases based on our continuing to use fossil fuels and continuing to force an increase in atmospheric CO2. But, is the increase in CO2 due to man; or is the increase in CO2 natural, due to rising temperatures caused by natural means?
The natural CO2 flux to and from oceans and land plants amounts to approximately 210 gigatons of carbon annually. Man currently causes about 8 gigatons of carbon to be injected into the atmosphere, about 4% of the natural annual flux. There are estimates that about half of man’s emissions are taken up by nature. But is that true? Are there variations in the natural flux? Could those explain the CO2 increase?

Figure 1: From NOAA and the IPCC, here.
In June, 2011, Dr. Murry Salby gave a presentation at a IUGG meeting in Melbourne, Australia. This presentation was mentioned later on Judith Curry’s blog, and some others. DirkH brought this presentation to my attention recently in comments on NTZ, and I tracked down the YouTube version. In that presentation, Dr. Salby plotted the changes in CO2 and changes in global temperature and soil moisture. The soil moisture data is behind a paywall, but the monthly global temperature and sea surface temperature sets are easily and freely available from WoodForTrees. The annual carbon fossil carbon release figures are also available, covering nearly the same period as the Mauna Loa CO2 numbers.
The differential changes in CO2 are calculated on a two-year centered average of the monthly figures, then taking the monthly differential on that average. This gives a somewhat smoothed number, removing the annual cycles, yet preserving the timing.

Figure 2: Monthly change in CO2 at three measuring stations.

Figure 3: Magnified view of Figure 2.
Figure 3 is a magnified view of Figure 2, the interval from 1990 to 2000, showing the effect of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in June 1992 and the El Niños of 1995 and 1998. The sharp cooling from the volcanic eruption appears before June 1992 because of the centered averaging to remove the noise and the annual variation.
Changes in CO2 seem muted at the South Pole, and the Barrow station is noisy as well as having a somewhat short record. Effects at the equator appear delayed at the stations closer to the poles. For those reasons, we will use the Mauna Loa record. It seems evident from Figures 2 and 3 that temperature influences CO2. But is it the global land and ocean temperature, or just the sea-surface temperature that is most important? Figure 4 is a plot of global surface temperature and monthly CO2 change:

Figure 4: Global surface temperature and monthly CO2 change.
The plots in Figure 4 look very similar; the question is how similar?

Here is the scatter diagram:

Figure 5: Scatter diagram of the data in Figure 4. Note the R2 value is 0.47636.
Here is the same comparison using sea surface temperature (HADSST2).

Figure 6: Plot of the monthly sea surface anomaly and monthly CO2 change.

Figure 7: Corresponding scatter plot showing an R2 value of 0.5528.
Sea surface temperature seems to be driving atmospheric CO2 changes. This makes sense because CO2 solubility in seawater is temperature dependent.
But what of man’s CO2 additions to the atmosphere? The data for carbon release is annual data, so the graphs are much coarser in appearance, and the change in CO2 must be annualized.

Figure 8: Annual change in fossil carbon use and the annual change in CO2.
 
Figure 9: Scatter diagram of carbon emissions change vs atmospheric CO2 change. Note that the R2 value is 0.05386, less than a tenth of the value of SST vs CO2.
It is ten times as likely that atmospheric CO2 is coming from natural sources, namely the warming ocean surface, as it is likely that it is coming from anthropogenic sources. The changes in CO2 track ocean surface temperature, not global carbon emissions. Burning fossil fuels is not increasing atmospheric CO2. Recovery from the Little Ice Age, driven by the sun, is causing the oceans to release CO2. It is temperature driving CO2 release, not the other way around. Just as it has always been.
As the sun gets quiet in the next few years, sea surface temperature will begin to fall, and the rise in CO2 will cease. If the sun stays quiet for 30 or 40 years, ocean surface temperatures will fall far enough to reverse the CO2 rise, the globe will enter a new little ice age, and things will get really interesting.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe ever excellent Achse Des Guten (Axis of the Good) has what is probably one of the most stinging criticisms of the solar industry I’ve read to date (and I’ve read some awfully harsh ones up to now). The latest is authored by Dr. Wolfram Weimer, a leading German publisher of news and economics magazines.

Wolfram Weimer calls Germany’s solar subsidies “a capital destroyer of historic dimensions”. Photo credit: Reto Klar, FOCUS, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
His latest piece is titled: Das sozialistische Solar-Desaster (The Socialist Solar Disaster). German solar energy and the EEG renewable feed-in act, once hailed as examples for the rest of the world to follow, are described by Weimer as a sure road to economic ruin.
Any country or state leader considering following the path of Germany may want to contact Weimer first. It may save you billions.
Over the past two years, dozens of German solar manufacturers have been shuttered, among them big ones like Solon, Q-Cells, Solar Millenium and Conergy. Recently electrical engineering giant Bosch announced that its solar operations had lost 1 billion euros, read here.
Recently German solar leader Solarworld reported it was on the brink of insolvency, drowning in billions of red ink, and that its high-flying CEO Frank Asbeck was begging the country of Qatar for a bailout.
The overall result under the bottom line for the German solar industry, despite all the massive subsidies, is devatstation. Weimar writes (my emphasis):
More than 100 billion euros in solar power subsidies have been wasted, and not a single target of the transition to solar energy has been reached. […}

A chain reaction of insolvencies and bankruptcies litters the landscape, more than 30,000 jobs have been lost. […] The German solar industry has in the meantime become a capital destroyer of historic dimensions. […]
The existing solar socialism shows where this is all headed – to a world of bankruptcies, rising electricity rates and panhandling trips to Qatar.”
Weimer writes that subsidizing industries is the sure way to ruin them.
In many fields of machine building, Germany is the global leader. And it is precisely in the fields where billions in forced payments are mobilized does one become a loser.
The solar ruin did not happen despite the subsidies, but it was because of them that it turned into a disaster. It is the very combination of eco-ideology and central planning methods that assured the collapse.
The state robs the market of the possibility to develop cheaper and more competitive power generation. Instead green bureaucrats decide what share each different type of energy is to have. Like in the five-year plans of the Soviets, quotas, targets, and amounts are prescribed inside central ministries. This ecological central planning and its subsidy monopoly continuously erodes away the market price mechanisms.”
For readers who are interested in finding out more about the total  failures of subsidzed renewable energy, you’ll find dozens of posts I’ve written over the last couple of years in the right side bar under: Categories – Alternative Energies.
Meanwhile leaders from 35 nations are now meeting in Petersberger in Berlin in order to find ways to get the whole world to embark on the “road to ruin”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to climate models of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Potsdam Germany, the recent cold winters in Europe  are caused by low sea ice extent (due to AGW) in the Barents and Kara Seas. Juraj Vanovcan now has an essay that shows the opposite seems to be true. 
Debunking PIK’s Low Barents/Kara Sea Ice – Cold Winters Claim
By guest writer Juraj Vanovcan
In dealing with three consecutive cold winters in NW Europe, orthodox climatology is now doing all it can to avoid mentioning the changing trends in NAO/AO and the cooling Atlantic. Instead, various bizarre theories have been floated out – from the Big Oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico slowing down the Gulf Stream, to tremendous melting of Greenland ice sheets having the same effect. They all ignore the fact that the Gulf Stream is powered by tropical trade winds.
Fig 1 Selected areas for investigating the low ice extent – cold winter hypothesis
Another tactic that warmists have used for damage control is claiming that low sea ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea may cause changes in air circulation, thus allowing cold Arctic air to pour down to the mid-latitudes. But this theory is dubious, as we shall see. It is the prevailing direction of air circulation and not the “increased greenhouse effect” that rules the European winters.
Such attempts to tie the cold with warm elsewhere, here the alleged decrease of ice cover in a part of the Arctic, reminds us of Kevin Trenberth’s search for the “missing heat”.
Climate data are freely available via KNMI Climate Explorer, so let’s investigate the PIK claim.
Figure 1 shows the area of Barents and Kara Sea (65-80N, 10-100E), and North-West Europe (45-70N, 10W-15E), where it is being claimed low winter ice extent there is causing low winter temperatures and snow in Europe.
Figure 2 shows winter (D-J-F) ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea, combined with winter temperature anomalies over the Northwest Europe.

Figure 2  Barents/Kara winter sea extent and NW Europe winters, 1979-2010.

Eyeballing the relation between those two curves, there is a relation, but the opposite of what is claimed by PIK! For example, low winter sea ice extent in 2007 and 2008 were tied with mild European winters. Also cold winters in the mid-1980s happened despite rather high ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea. Figure 3 as follows shows the two parameters in direct relation:

Figure 3  Relation between Barents/Kara winter sea ice extent and NW European winters, 1979-2010.
Mathematicians could argue about the statistical significance of observed trend, but the trend itself is rather logical: Cold Barents/Kara Sea with more ice means cold winters in Northwest Europe. One does not know yet, where the 2010/2011 winter plot will appear on the graph above, but even if it is an outlier it will not change the overall trend.
The claim that cold European winters are caused by low ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea is therefore not supported by observed data.
Since the Arctic ice extent depends mainly on North Atlantic SST, as presented elsewhere, there is a good chance that in near future we will see remarkable growth. Figure 4 shows the North Pacific and North Atlantic SST monthly anomalies, based on Reynolds OI.v2 dataset.

Figure 4:  Monthly SST anomalies for North Pacific and North Atlantic since 1982.
There seems to be a 1-year lag between the two plots, with the Atlantic trailing the Pacific SST trend. Warm SST peak in Atlantic, observed in 2010, seems to mimic similar event in North Pacific in 2009. But Pacific SST have since dropped to levels seen only in the 80s. If the Atlantic follows, then 2011 summer sea ice extent may see a considerable gain.
Future attempts to explain increasing Arctic ice cover with warming somewhere else will no doubt raise more amusement and doubts about the ”scientific consensus”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate science studies know no bounds. I’m not making this up.
The Austrian online Der Standard reports here that Spanish scientists at the University Almeria have determined that the average European emits 2 tonnes of CO2 annually just though eating habits and excretion, this in a study appearing in the International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment.
The lead author of the study Amadeo Fernandez-Alba writes:
The entire food cycle has an impact on the climate. The treatment of sewage water contributes to this and thus must be taken into account.
According to Der Standard:
He urges consumers to not only think about health and pleasure when buying food, but also to pay attention to the environment.
The researchers studied the entire food cycle of an average Spanish man and the CO2 produced. The result was two tons per person, which is 20% of the average European’s total output. The worst for the climate are meat and milk products. Most of the greenhouse gases are emitted during the food production process – especially agriculture.

Dr Fernandez Alba says that fruits and vegetbles are the best . but they too can be problematic. The researchers say:
Consumers orient themselves less and less on seasonal production. Instead they increasingly want their strawberries and asparagus year-round. In addition, an increasing amount of tropical fruit is being consumed. That increases Co2 emissions from transport immensely.
Human excrement taken into account for the first time
For the first time, the researchers also studied greenhouse gases produced by human excrement. It turns out that this by-product is in second place not that far behind food production in GHG emissions. The scientists say:
The culprits here are mainly nitrogen and phosphorous amounts, and also gases that are produced by sewage treatment plants.
Expect Europe to start regulating our eating habits and inspecting what goes through the toilet – soon. Poor Europe has got nothing better to do.

Back when I was a boy in the 1960s and 70s, northern New England was as conservative as could be. My home state of Vermont (which is French for “green mountain”) was George Aiken and Winston Prouty country. Back then the revolutionary Yankee-spirit of Ethan Allen, fighter for freedom, was alive – but rapidly dying.
Vermont has long since been overrun by the politically-correct from New York, Massachussetts, New Jersey and other deep blue areas, and has been turned into a socialist cesspool with one of the highest property tax rates in the country and socialist Senator Bernie Sanders.

This all makes the latest news from sister state New Hampshire (home of the White Mountains) all the more encouraging. New Hampshire was also once very conservative – so much so that it’s official motto is still “Live free or die“. Its governor from 1973 to 1979 was Republican “Ax-the-Tax” Medrim Thomson. But New Hampshire too succumbed the same political fate as Vermont, turning deep blue.
But who knows! Maybe the “live free or die” spirit is making a comeback. Let’s hope so. The latest news seem to indicate so. Fox News writes in a piece called:
One Giant Leap Forward -New Hampshire has smacked down Cap & Trade”
The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly — 246 to 104 – to become the first state to move to repeal an already up-and-running global warming cap-and-trade energy tax scheme.
The Granite State’s repeal appears headed for a similarly veto-proof repeal in the State Senate that will make Governor John Lynch powerless to stop it.”
Emphasis added. Big things often start in New Hampshire – especially presidential things. Let’s hope the Senate makes it something big there, too. New Hampshire’s cap & trade scam is known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which originated in New Jersey. Its stunning defeat in New Hampshire was led by conservative House Speaker William O’Brien, who, according to Fox News, said (emphasis added):
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has always been a backdoor tax increase on the citizens of New Hampshire. RGGI is a perfect example of the cost of regulation to the public. Rarely has a program been as transparent in its attempts at income redistribution.”
The big beneficiaries of RGGI are politically correct corporations and special interest groups. The big losers are consumers. The rejection of cap & trade in New Hampshire sends a strong signal nationally. Fox News writes:

At the national level, it cements the extremely strong opposition to cap-and-trade in New Hampshire and therefore colors how the issue will play in the Republican presidential primaries. In 2008, both parties nominated pro-cap-and-trade candidates for president, and again this year there are a number of pro-cap-and-trade Republicans vying for the nomination. They will have a difficult time explaining to voters why a program that has failed and been overwhelmingly rejected at the state level should be taken national.”
Don’t you love the smell of climate-napalm? Cap & trade gets crushed.
This should lead us to recall how Newt Gingrich cozied up on a couch with Nancy Pelosi in support of regulating carbon. There have been reports about naughty Newt launching a presidential campaign for 2012. Sorry Newt, but you belong on the scrap heap along with Pelosi. You’re not getting my vote.
New Hampshire is a lovely state, especially the northern part with its Presidential Range, which includes Mt. Washington – where the world’s highest ever wind velocity on the planet, 231 miles per hour, was recorded – a climate extreme back in the 1930s when CO2 was only about 320 ppm. New Hampshire is really worth a visit. Vermont is also a beautiful state, but visiting there means you’ll be leaving your money into the wasteful hands of greenie-socialists. Go to New Hampshire instead.

First off, I want to thank the readers who have joined in on the CLIMATE BET whereby the winnings will be donated to a charity for children in dire need, yet to be decided.
So far us 11 coolists have bet $300 in total that 2011 – 2020 will be cooler than the last decade.
It seems that our warmist opponent “Robhon” has mustered the courage and revealed his name: Rob Honeycutt. I ask myself where could all that cockiness and confidence come from?
Turns out he’s a regular at the warmist blogs, like Skeptical Science. Anyone that spends time with such sources of “information” undoubtedly will develop the beliefs that he now holds. In fact I found a post Honeycutt wrote himself at Skeptical Science called:
Kung fu climate.
He really believes in that hockey stick. I wonder if he really knows what he is getting himself into with this bet – he has committed $5000! I have no reason to doubt that he is serious about it and that he will pay if he loses. But that’s a lotta money. Either you have to be very rich, or cock-sure you’re gonna win.
The next decade is likely going to teach him a lot about climate science. We’ll see how cocky he’ll be in 10 years. It could be that it will get warmer. But if it does, it will not be because of a few molecules more of a trace gas. No, the odds are that it’s going to cool. As we have seen, more and more scientists are expecting cooling. The ocean cycles have reversed, and so the climate has begun to do the same in tow. The sun is sleepy too.
My bet with a similar warmist five years ago

Exactly five years ago I also made a bet with a warmist who also was cock-sure it was going to get warmer. Like Rob, this person was convinced that man was heating up the planet. But I told him it was mostly due to natural causes, and that we’d see cooling in the years ahead. So we bet as follows:
If the average temperature for the next five years (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010) is warmer than the average of 2005, then I lose the bet. But if the average of 2005 is warmer then the next five years, then I win the bet.
The amount: If it cooled, then he would pay me 6 bottles of red, dry wine. If it warmed, then I would have to give him 6 bottles of Scottish whiskey (I like a fair bet).
Back then we did not stipulate which dataset to use to decide the winner. But I think using the average of all four, i.e. UAH MSU, RSS, GISS, and HadCrut, would be the way to go.
I haven’t run through the calculations in detail, but I see a slight downward trend. The 2010 El Nino made it really close, but was not enough in the end. As you can see the 2007/2008 El Nino ruined the warming trend (damn models didn’t see that).
Some people have to learn the hard way. Glass of red wine anyone?
—————————————————————-
UPDATE: I don’t want to give the impression that Rob Honeycutt is impolite or anything. He has a view and he rightfully asserts it. So far he has been very polite and cordial here. As I mentioned, I’m just impressed by his confidence.
UPDATE  2: The warmist has conceded defeat (2005 was warmer than the 2006-2010 average) and I have  gotten my bottles of wine. I expect a similar outcome in 2021.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany the news from the NOAA that the Barrow, Alaska station has recorded a CO2 concentration at 400 ppm “for the first time” is sweeping through the media – along with fresh warnings of impending climate doom.

“The northern sites in our monitoring network tell us what is coming soon to the globe as a whole,” said Pieter Tans , an atmospheric scientist with NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) in Boulder, Colo. “We will likely see global average CO2 concentrations reach 400 ppm about 2016.”
Average global levels of CO2 were 390.4 ppm in 2011, according to NOAA measurements.
The NOAA press release also writes that the concentration of the greenhouse gas has increased every year since 1959. “In the early 1960s, it rose about 0.7 ppm per year. For the last decade, it has been rising at about 2 ppm per year. That observed increase, independent of the seasonal ups and downs described above, is due to the accelerating pace of emissions from human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels.”

What impact has that had on temperature over the last decade?
Spiegel online tells us:
The data, however, have not shown any warming  for 13 years.
At the same time the question of whther the CO2 increase will warm the climate is still always disputed. The strength of the warming depends mostly on how much water evaporates; water vapour enhances the greenhouse effect considerably more than CO2. Estimates on the water vapour effect diverge greatly. Thousands of scientists are working on that question.
Global temperatures just aren’t listening to the climate models. And so much for consensus.

Reports of the Australian flood have been in the airwaves and print media here in Germany too. Of course, according to this media, it was once again all predicted by “scientists”. Today all inconvenient weather events are man-made.
Weather extremes are nothing new. Flooding in Pittsburgh in 1936. (Credit: Wikipedia)
German ZDF public television (Germany’s BBC you could say) had this piece of propaganda where the anchorman tells his viewers:
For years they had a drought that made the land infertile and brought water-intensive agriculture to an end. Back then they prayed for rain, and now they’ve gotten it – and exactly how climate scientists had predicted it. Not as a relief, but as a new catastrophe.”
Well, it’s not unusual for that region to cycle between drought and flooding, which is all mainly caused by ocean cycles (not CO2). According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) ENSO report dated Dec. 22, 2010:
La Niña periods are generally associated with above normal winter, spring and summer rainfall, particularly over eastern and northern Australia. Night-time temperatures during La Niña periods are historically warmer than average and Tropical Cyclone occurrence for northern Australia is typically higher than normal during the cyclone season (November-April).”
Certainly the ZDF was not referring to these scientists. Floods are not new to the region. They’ve happened before. Read it all here.
NTZ reader Matti Vooro quotes the BOM here (after researching BOM records):
Flooding, unlike drought, is often quite localized, and therefore not as closely tied to broad-scale controls like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. However the La Niña years of 1916, 1917, 1950, 1954 through 1956, and 1973 through 1975, were accompanied by some of the worst and most widespread flooding this century. It can safely be said that, over much of Australia, flooding is more likely than usual during La Niña years, and less likely in El Niño years, though heavy rain and flooding often accompany the breakdown of El Niño in late summer or autumn.”
The graphic below shows that major Australian flood episodes are a function of the Southern Oscillation Index:

The BOM writes:
Extended periods of high SOI in 1916/17, the mid-1950s, and the early to mid-1970s, were periods of widespread, frequent flooding.”
Take the great Roper river flood of 1940, for example. The BOM writes:
This event was all the more remarkable because preceding conditions over the Roper River catchment had been very dry; in fact the river had stopped running for the first time in living memory during December 1939.”
The BOM writes that a tropical depression formed and dumped as much as 700mm of rain in six days.
Another example is The Big Wet – January 1974. BOM:
The year 1973 was one of the wettest known over much of Australia, and in keeping with the strong La Niña event that prevailed, the 1973/74 northern wet season started early. By the end of 1973 large areas of the country were saturated. Then came January 1974, which featured probably the biggest continent-wide drenching since European settlement, inundating vast areas of the country.”
Also take a look at the Katherine Flood of 1998. Tropical cyclone Les dumped 400-500mm of rain on areas of the Katherine, Roper and Daly River catchments. The BOM writes:
Such rainfall amounts falling over catchments already saturated from heavy rain earlier in the month had a dramatic impact. By the 27th the Katherine River had risen to more than 20 metres – the largest flood in Katherine’s history, eclipsing the previous record (set in 1957) by 0.7 metres.
You can go back in history and find floods that have been far worse. What what you won’t find was a media that ran around blaming it all on the sins of man to the extent done done today.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBenny Peiser alerts us to this excellent feature story brought to you by the UK Spectator on the wildlife devastation being wrought by “climate-friendly wind turbines”. Hats off to the Spectator for this one.
The story just goes to show you how little the environmentalist thought these things out:
1. Wind turbines don’t produce that much electricity.
2. They run on average only at about 20% of their rated capacity.
3. Their lifetimes are turning out to be only half of what was promised.
4. They are turning the landscape into a panoramic eyesore.
5. Now, we see they are killing birds and bats by the millions.
Recall how environmentalists like to think they are intellectually superior to everyone else, and that they rarely make mistakes. At worst, they only have to “adjust” their ideas at times. This assumed intellectual superiority is what drives them.
Well, it now looks like they got some major adjusting to do with their thinking. But I suppose this windmill carnage will be too much for them to cope with, and so they’ll go on denying it and act like they’re rescuing the climate.
How can we expect them to understand the complexities of climate when they can’t even think more than one step ahead?
We saw the same pattern of behaviour with the communists and their economics. Did they change course? Except for China, they all obstinately stayed in acute denial until everything around them collapsed. Expect the same from the kook-green, drugged-up-on-climate-protectionism European governments and media.

Clive Hambler writes (emphasis added):
Though I started out neutral on renewable energy, I’ve since seen the havoc wreaked on wildlife by wind power, hydro power, biofuels and tidal barrages. The environmentalists who support such projects do so for ideological reasons. What few of them have in their heads, though, is the consolation of science.”
One has to wonder which species is more intelligent: birds or environmentalist kooks?
I’ve heard it suggested that birds will soon adapt to avoid turbine blades. But your ability to learn something when you’ve been whacked on the head by an object travelling at 200 mph is limited.”
I seriously doubt that green-kooks are any more capable of learning.

Example green kook in denial, Bill McKibben. Hopelessly clinging to the climate obsession. Good thing he first washed the bird-blood off his hands before speaking to his gullible audience at RIT. Photo source: Hotshot977, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license

CO2 being the primary cause of global warming is disappearing – fast. Now a new UNEP-sponsored study says.
Half of the temperature increase in the Arctic can be traced to black exhaust dust (soot).
We’ve always known that CO2’s greenhouse impact on global warming was inflated, maybe 10-fold. The T-Online News here presents a summary of a recent UNEP study written by a German alliance of environmental organisations called Russfrei Fürs Klima, in English: “Soot-Free for the Climate”. T-Online writes:
Because of these new findings, the so-called German Environment Aid group (DUH) is now calling for diesel filters for heavy construction machinery.”
Ed Caryl wrote about black soot’s impacts on glaciers some time back, read Glaciers – The Dark Side.
Okay – the UNEP study says “half the Arctic warming” and not half of the “global warming”. But recall that scientists have long said that global temperature rise would be most apparent in the Arctic. Now that we know half of it is caused by black soot, then it indicates the problem over the rest of the globe is nowhere near as bad.
T-Online News writes:

‘The black carbon settles on snow and ice,’ explains Dietmar Oeliger, transportation expert of the Nature Protection Alliance Germany (NABU). ‘It leads to more absorption of solar heat by ice and snow, and thus melt more quickly.”
and (emphasis added):
‘The UNEP study is so important because it has finally offcially identified soot particles as a climate driver,’ said Axel Friedrich, international transportation consultant. “The detrimental effects of CO2 on climate have been discussed for a long time, while the topic of soot was always ridiculed.’ “
 Soot deposits in glaciers
Of course these concerned environmentalists would like to have us believe that soot is equally as harmful as CO2. But all they have done is convinced me that CO2 is much less a problem then they’ve been claiming.
And another important factor in warming from 1980 – 1998 (there has been no warming since 1998) are the oceanic oscillations, which were in their warm phase from 1980 – 1998. That doesn’t leave much room left for CO2. Call it the incredible shrinking CO2 warming effect.
I think the call for exhaust filters is a reasonable proposal and I’d support it. I’m in favour of less soot in the air that I breathe. Filters wouldn’t be that expensive, and would have a real impact – if the study’s results are true.
Frankly, I think the study is a bit odd in that it places most of the blame on construction equipment. Maybe the environmental groups are trying to shake down the construction equipment manufacturers for money. Factory production and the earlier, very dirty burning of coal by power plants certainly had an impact that was equally great, if not much greater.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe photo montage could have been better, I know – but you get the idea.
Funny how Britain’s propaganda unit of the green movement – the BBC – somehow concocted such a picture of the sceptics. Germany’s FOCUS magazine, a proponent of the AGW theory, sees the sceptics in a completely different way – read below.
Obviously, things have gotten awfully bad for the green movement, and especially the BBC, who now finds itself resorting to the dirtiest of tactics – once used exclusively by totalitarian regimes.
Once a premier news organisation, the BBC has reduced itself to being a pathetic caricature of journalism.
Without a doubt the BBC, a public network, has departed from its obligation of fairness and balance, and has assigned itself with the higher mission of “rescuing the planet” and has given itself a role in setting public policy. That is not its duty under its current charter.
It has assigned itself a new job: to isolate the targets and to get the masses to despise them – all on behalf of a virulent green movement. Not unlike Goebbels. When one looks at how the BBC stitched together its recent documentary on climate sceptics, even Goebbels would blush. While Goebbels propaganda was mean and mean, BBC’s is mean and desperate.
The Rupert Murray stitchwork is in the same league as the 1010 clip. Make no mistake, it too will backfire. It will only serve to entertain the greenshirts, and appall the rest.
It is a particularly desperate piece of propaganda, one that I’d classify it as something you’d see from Baghdad Al, Saddam’s Information Minister during the Iraq war, who everyday insisted everything was peachy as Baghdad burned behind him. It should tell you something about how these guys communicate.
Can we trust the news they tells us? Can we trust the science that’s put forward?
Alternative view of sceptics: German FOCUS magazine 
I wish to remind people that there is an alternative view of climate sceptics one that recently appeared in the warmist German news magazine FOCUS. I advise people to read and compare it to the BBC documentary. It’s a completely different picture.
Here it is again (originally posted on January 11, 2011):
===============================================
FOCUS Story On Germany’s Hostile Environment For Skeptic Scientists
What’s going on at FOCUS magazine in Germany? Has it become “fair and balanced”?
An online FOCUS story here about the 3rd International Climate (Skeptic) Conference, which took place in Berlin early last month, got past my radar. Even though it is 3 weeks old, it is still worth writing about. The FOCUS story is dubbed: “Among Doubters”.
Hat-tip: Ike
The story looks in-depth at the climate conference and the overall atmosphere for skeptics in Germany, but does it fairly, something we are not at all accustomed to from the rest of the hostile media here in the Vaterland.
For example not so long ago Die Zeit had a notorious drive-by shooting piece that put the cross-hairs on Fred Singer called “The Merchants of Doubt”, read here.
The FOCUS piece starts out by describing the overall “poisonous” atmosphere that pervaded before the start of the conference. Some German Parliamentarians started their own McCarthy-style inquisition on the sceptic movement in an attempt to intimidate and marginalise it. The inquisition was laced with the term “denier” and had all the usual Big-Oil and Tobacco accusations, read here.
FOCUS quotes EIKE-spokesman Holger Thuss, and comments:

‘Oil money? That would be nice!’, defends Holger Thuss of the European Institute for Climate and Energy(EIKE), with a tone of sarcasm. The think-tank founded in 2007 is headquartered in Jena and is supported only by small donations from private persons and membership fees. After the conference, the institute was penniless.
Being a bit familiar with this institute, I can tell you that it operates on a shoestring and does not have an office, as members appear to work from their homes. Hardly oil-funded. The press has always used this point to ridicule EIKE as post office box operation.
Yet the press, politicians and activists fear the organisation, and are working hard to marginalize it. But so far they’ve succeeded in doing just the opposite.
For most of the media, the 3rd Conference in Berlin was allegedly a gathering of wacked-out conspiracy theorists. But FOCUS found that this was hardly the case:
The approximately 120 who gathered in Berlin were supposedly “climate deniers“, yet hardly gave a conspirator impression. They were predominantly men, mainly of retirement age, with thinned hair and gray scholarly beards.”
As someone in attendance, I was an exception to that – in both respects. And what about all the accusations that we are just a haggle of deniers and flat-earthers? FOCUS quotes Bob Carter:
‘Whoever labels us as climate deniers is not making any scientific arguments, rather political ones’, says Australian geologist Bob Carter in response to such characterisations. When someone calls him a skeptic, then, as a scientist, he is ‘proud of it’.”
FOCUS then reports that almost all the attendees believe in climate change, and the dispute is about the extent of man’s influence, and here writes more about Bob Carter:
The paleontologist examined climate change and changes in sea level over the last 65 million years in numerous field studies – and has detected far greater variations than those of our recent history. The assertion that man is heating the world’s climate with CO2 emissions is fundamentally refuted he claims.
FOCUS also wrote about what happens when scientists do not march in lockstep with the so-called “mainstream” scientists, citing Jan Veizer’s and Nir Shaviv’s breakthrough paper on the impacts of cosmic rays on climate:
‘Practically overnight no one wanted to be seen with me’, bitterly recalls the emeritus Leibniz-Prize winner, who also taught in Germany and in Canada.
FOCUS adds:
Whoever challenges the notion of man-made climate change gets mercilessly punished by the Establishment. So it is no surprise that one hardly finds any young researchers who take a critical and skeptical view, and that mainly retired professors dominated the conference.
Also 38-year old academic high-flyer Nir Shaviv advises his own students on the threat of sanctions and reminds them to be very careful in challenging official climate dogma: ‘Whoever starts questioning is taking the risk of shooting himself in the knee.'”
What a way to conduct science. FOCUS then writes about how some politicians have been at the receiving end of hellfire and brimstone for expressing openeness to non-mainstream views, for example conservative CDU politician Marie-Luise Dött, read here and Free Democrat Paul Friedhoff.
But all the greenshirt intimidation tactics have in the end backfired for the most part. The debate is not ending, as Al Gore demanded in an authoritarian style back in 2006. Science does not stop just because a politician like Gore, who has got a stake in it all, demands it so.
FOCUS ends its piece with the subheading:
No end in sight for this debate”
We have indeed come a long way since the days of “The science is settled”, haven’t we? FOCUS then quotes Bob Carter, who demands a change in political course, and that we ought to get away from the belief that we can restrict temperature increase to 2°C. Carter pleads that governments use taxpayer more wisely.
Why not start in the third world and help the people there get clean water and better sanitation facilities. That would be a good start.“
Kudos to FOCUS. If they keep this up I’ll soon find myself adding widget for subscriptions to FOCUS magazine – and I’m now even considering a subscription to its news magazine.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFirst, a few words about 2011
I don’t want to bore everyone with a long recap of 2011, just a few highlights off the top of my head.
2011 started with the climate bet with Rob Honeycutt and Co. NoTricksZone and the coolists say this new decade 2011-2020 will be cooler than the last decade 2001-2010 (and it looks like 2011 is in the coolist column, though I haven’t run the numbers yet).
Then in March there was Fukushima and the ensuing mass media-driven hysteria that tsunamied over Germany, and led a panicked government to shut down the entire German nuclear industry.
In 2011 we also got to know Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber’s “Master Plan” for transforming global society so that it suits his view of what it should be. Unfortunately it is closed-minded, based on dogma, and has little to do with science. To me what Schellnhuber proposes is nothing less than wild adventurism in the social engineering laboratory. The results of implementing such a plan would be devastating for democracy and overall global social development. It opens the the door to authoritarianism. If anything, the “Master Plan” is a powerful argument why scientists should stay in their labs, and not be left to run society.
In April NoTricksZone got its 1 millionth visit after one year of existence (the 2 million will be reached this month).
The story that got lots a visitors was the weed-covered multi-million dollar solar field. Ironically that photo may someday come to symbolize Germany’s obsessed, misguided and rushed energy-supply conversion which the country is so hell-bent on in achieving – no matter the costs. Globally, except for China, 2011 is the year that solar energy bit the dust.
German doubt over climate science going global in 2012?
The big 2011 highlight for me is one that readers are not aware of. One morning in early September I got an e-mail from geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning, asking if I’d be interested in translating in English a new book on climate science and energy policy he and Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt were working on. I immediately said yes.
Over the next three months I used every available hour I could find to do the work. I finished the job just a few days ago, on December 29. The book’s publisher Hoffmann & Campe in Hamburg is now about to start the search for a publisher for the English version. So we’re hoping that Die Kalte Sonne (The Cold Sun) will also soon be available in English for international readers – soon.

German edition can now be ordered here.
Personally I learned a lot from this book. As a layman, I had some general knowledge gaps and gray areas in climate science. This book puts everything in clear perspective and deepened my knowledge. It’s up-to-date and cites many of the latest peer-reviewed papers – more than 800 sources in total. Both Dr. Lüning and Dr. Vahrenholt made an outstanding effort in putting it together. Already it’s starting to stir up controversy here, even though the German version won’t be available until February. It’s light-years more up-to-date than the IPCC 2007 AR4.
When you read Die Kalte Sonne, you really get the sense of how far climate science has advanced since 2007 and how outdated and narrow the IPCC AR4 truly is. Talk about divergence!
Authors forecast cooling for the decades ahead
The book’s authors focus on why the climate catastrophe is not taking place. It takes an in-depth look into the topics of solar cycles, temperature reconstructions, the Hockey Stick, aerosols, soot, fudging, amplification mechanisms, cosmic radiation, magnetism, clouds, UV radiation, ocean cycles, the shortcomings and flaws of the IPCC and their dubious models in particular. The authors also present their own look into the future using a model that considers all important climate drivers. It concludes that the Earth has to reckon with cooling over the coming decades. It’s the most convincing forecast I’ve seen up to now.
I’m very optimistic about the success of the book, and will be following it closely in the weeks ahead.
3rd year of NTZ
I also look forward to starting my 3rd year of blogging, together with the guest writers you have come to know – like Ed, Matti, and Juraj. I hope readers will keep coming back. Wishing you all the best for 2012!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis blog here is not a casino for high rollers. In fact, it’s not a casino at all. Yet, one warmist reader robhon left a comment here proposing a bet which I find quite interesting. Here’s what he proposes:
I’m taking bets with deniers that the decade from 2010 to 2019 will end with at least 7 of the warmest years on record (again, global temperature… you choose the data set, UAH, GISS, RSS, HadCRU…). So, if you genuinely believe that we are headed for a cooling trend, put your money where your mouth is. I will.”
I think what he wants to say is that the next decade will be warmer than the one we just finished. The next decade to me is 2011 – 2020. I propose the following:
I pledge to bet USD 50.00 (fifty US dollars) that the decade of 2011 – 2020 will be cooler globally on average than the decade 2001 – 2010. We will simply take the average of both decades and compare to see which is higher. I suggest using either UAH or RSS, or a composite of both satellite datasets.
Here’s how it looks so far:

You warmists are all saying it’s going to get warmer. What are you waiting for? Man, I can see that trendline just zooming right on up through the next decade – can’t you?
I’m even going to open this bet up for everyone, with all proceeds going to a charity like Children’s Hospice International.
All proceeds will go to a children’s charity.

Anyone who wishes to pledge a sum (min $5) will be able to send an e-mail to me and I will make a list of all those particpating and post it here. That total amount will then need to be matched by robhon and his warmist pals. We can place a limit so that it doesn’t get out of hand. The bet has to be accepted by February 1, 2011.
Anyone who wants to join in for a good cause, make your pledges by then. And then we will see if robhon is ready to go for it.
What do you say amigo?
If the 2011/20 decade averages to be warmer than 2001/10, then I will concede that the earth is indeed warming. But if the next decade turns out to be cooler or the same, then you will have to concede that the theory that CO2 is driving the climate is bunk.  We can work out the details in the days and weeks ahead.
Heck, the PIK ought to be the first to step up. Mr Rahmstorf made such a bet 2 years ago – and says he won!
Looking foraward to hearing your prompt reply.
P Gosselin
PS: I’ve I sent an e-mail to robhon to let him know.
=================================================
UPDATE:  Folks, the bet is on! Robhon has accepted, see his comment! He certainly is exuding quite a bit of confidence. Crap! Now I wish Dec. 2010 had been much warmer!

Share this...FacebookTwitterReaching an agreement in Cancun is out of reach. Representatives are desperate, and so they will go through every motion to give the appearance they are doing something  – anything. They are obligated to go through the formalities of trying, after all.
Der Spiegel reports here that Germany’s Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen is now singing a whole new tune. Instead of singing the blues, he’s now whistling Dixie! And that likely through his you know what. Der Spiegel wrote yesterday:
The German environment minister, it would seem, is tired of issuing dark warnings of impending climate change disaster. ‘In Germany, we have begun to see things in a different light in recent years,’ Norbert Röttgen said on Wednesday during his first appearance at the UN climate summit in Cancun, Mexico. ‘People in business, in politics and in the society at large no longer see climate change as a threat, but as an opportunity and a challenge.’
Suddenly it’s no longer a threat, and now climate change will bring us opportunities. Obviously leaders have realised that people are not being scared into acceptong policy anymore, and so now the new tactic is to try to lure them into policy with pretty pictures.
Face it, the panic tactic has failed. Climate change is 10,000 times more boring than watching grass grow. It’s a very slow process. Indeed it would take a human an entire lifetime to even notice today’s sea level rise rate. That’s why the tactic of pretty pictures and nice stories is now being tried.
Röttgen claims:
Our strategy of investing in renewable energies and energy efficiency proved itself successful in times of economic and financial crisis.

If we approach our target in an efficient manner, we will have created 500,000 additional jobs by 2020 and will spend over €20 billion ($27 billion) less on energy imports.”
Sounds good on the surface. But what is not mentioned is that consumers would be forced to buy up expensive renewable energy at, let’s say, 35 cents a kwh instead of importing it for 3 cents a kwh – or producing it domestically with conventional methods for 4 cents a kwh. In the end, its the poor consumer who would get screwed, and man-made climate change would still remain a fairy tale.
Don’t expect this new rosy facade put on by Röttgen to sway positions, which have long since been decided and cemented. Der Spiegel writes:
China, however, continues to resist concrete targets for cuts in its greenhouse gas emissions. Early in the week, there were some reports from the talks in Cancun that China may be prepared to compromise. Deputy Chinese climate negotiator Liu Zhenmin said on Monday, however, that such reports resulted from a “misunderstanding.” Pledges from Beijing, he said, are “voluntary” and “non-negotiable.”
Non-negotiable. And as far as the USA is concerned any bill reaching Congress would be DOA.
For those of you out there still worried that leaders might do something really stupid, and actually sign something – stop worrying. Merkel hasn’t jumped on any jet to Cancun, and she isn’t going to. Cancun was pronounced dead before it even got started.
Parading the dead body that is Cancun through the conference may make it look like it’s alive, but it’s still dead. Time to bury it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Foundation for Freedom recently featured a speech by German journalist/author Michael Miersch, whose works often appear at FOCUS and who is a regular contributor at the Achse des Guten (Axis of the Good) blogsite. The title of his speech: “Courage for the Future”.
Rarely do I see a message delivered as powerfully as seen by Miersch here. Every young person in Germany should see this video.

Miersch tells us how that, by almost every measure, the world is a far better place today than is portrayed by Europe’s and Germany’s white-wine-sipping intellectuals.
In the clip, Miersch is first introduced by Spiegel journalist Alexander Neubacher, who brings up the Club of Rome book, “The Limits of Growth” and reminds the audience of some of the just utterly asinine predictions they made, and taken seriously by the public, 40 years ago.
Miersch, once a trendy pessimist journalist, became optimistic about the future in the 1990s and realized that German intellectuals have a completely disfigured, hopelessly pessimistic view of the world. What follows are some of the comments Miersch makes:
2.10: “For German intellectuals, optimism is a sort of American mental illness. This applies to journalists as well. Optimists are the ones with rose-colored glasses who don’t want to see just how horrible reality is: the American ‘think-positive’ gurus who either deny or are just plain uninformed.”
3.35: “Nothing sparks more outrage than optimism [in Europe].”
4:41: “I don’t view optimism for the future as an American mental illness, but as a justified life view.”
5.24: Miersch, once a trendy, pessimistic science journalist who believed all the end-of-the-world stories, tells how he turned optimist, inspired by a single innocent remark:
“One day in the 1990s in the springtime during an editorial meeting, in the middle of the city, the window was open and the song of a blackcap could be heard, to which a young intern completely inapproporiately said, ‘Hey listen, one of your extinct birds is out there tweeting again.’ The laughter triggered a sort of subversive effect and the blackcaps slowly began to change my mind.”
6.14: Miersch on his subsequent attempt by his magazine to report that things weren’t that bad, and what happens they reported good news to readers:
“…led to a wave of subscription cancellations, which quickly brought us on the list of endangered editors. It was clear that our subscribers didn’t want facts, and they begged for gloomy, hopeless, unsolvable disasters, and please, most of all, spare us the solutions.”
7.50: Miersch tells us the first law of the media: “Only bad news are news“.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




8.00: Miersch then illustrates just how bad things have gotten in the media, citing a news report delivered German flagship ARD television, where the editors took good news and spun them into bad news. Miersch:
The news was actually good news: Life expectancy is rising, and not only in industrial countries, but also in developing countries. And how did the ARD News present this? ‘The global population is aging faster than ever!'”
8.25: He cites another media example, a headline about growing forest area in the Alps: “Forest growth threatens meadows!”
To illustrate the absurdity of the environmentalism, Miersch then tells the story of a reporter who showed how easy it is to get lots a people to sign a petition against “dihydrogen-monoxide” (H2O).
10.20: Miersch tells us that by all statistical measures, only one conclusion can be drawn: “The world is getting better – contrary to the impression conveyed by the media and newspapers.”
11.00 Miersch reminds the audience of the UN Millennium targets:
In the spring of 2012, the World Bank was able to announce that the most important Millenium target is already reached: the halving of global poverty by 2015. However, there were no headlines about this in Germany.”
11.50: Miersch tells the audience of the media reaction to the news from the MetOffice that global temperatures have stagnated: “This made front-page headlines in many papers in England, but in Germany there were no news about this.”
Miersch in his speech tells his audience that, no matter which measure you look at, the world’s ills are shrinking: war, mortality, disease, poverty, pollution, natural disasters, etc.. “This contradicts all the predictions from the intellectuals. There are even more polar bears today!”
14.20: Miersch then says that according to environmentalist ideology, communist East Germany should have developed into an ecological paradise:
No flights to Majorca, no kiwis from New Zealand, restricted individual mobility, no McDonalds, and highly restricted consumption. However what resulted was a huge garbage dump.”
16.35: Miersch says again that by any measure, the world is a far better place today, and that it is going to get better:
The world today could be better, and will be better if we just finally stopped bad-mouthing progress and viewing the human race as the plague of the planet. At its core, the green future-pessimistic and technologically hostile zeitgeist is an anti-humanistic ideology down to its roots. It’s only about restriction, limitation, and constant surveillance. Man is viewed as destructive and as a contaminator – in the best case as a consumer – and never as an inventor, creator.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnyone who still does not believe environmentalism is a front for repressive, authoritarian-like state control of our lives can now look at yet another example that it is indeed so. And again the target is poor countries.
The online weekly Die Zeit reports here on how the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recently issued a press release that surely puts a big smile on the faces of Marxist environmentalists. Get set for a another round of expensive and repressive regulation, taxes and penalties. You’ll notice the familiar language of authority and consensus.
The WHO IARC writes (link and emphasis added):
After a week-long meeting of international experts, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organization (WHO), today classified diesel engine exhaust as carcinogenic to humans Group 1, based on sufficient evidence that exposure is associated with an increased risk for lung cancer. […]
There has been mounting concern about the cancer-causing potential of diesel exhaust, particularly based on findings in epidemiological studies of workers exposed in various settings. […]
The scientific evidence was reviewed thoroughly by the Working Group and overall it was concluded that there was sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of diesel exhaust.”
Now we’re all really scared. Oh my, what can we do! The expert doctors recommend (emphasis added):

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Given the Working Group’s rigorous, independent assessment of the science, governments and other decision-makers have a valuable evidence-base on which to consider environmental standards for diesel exhaust emissions and to continue to work with the engine and fuel manufacturers towards those goals.
Dr Christopher Portier, Chairman of the IARC working Group, stated that “The scientific evidence was compelling and the Working Group’s conclusion was unanimous: diesel engine exhaust causes lung cancer in humans.” Dr Portier continued: ‘Given the additional health impacts from diesel particulates, exposure to this mixture of chemicals should be reduced worldwide.’
Dr Kurt Straif, Head of the IARC Monographs Program, indicated that ‘The main studies that led to this conclusion were in highly exposed workers. However, we have learned from other carcinogens, such as radon, that initial studies showing a risk in heavily exposed occupational groups were followed by positive findings for the general population. Therefore actions to reduce exposures should encompass workers and the general population.’
Dr Christopher Wild, Director, IARC, said that ‘while IARC’s remit is to establish the evidence-base for regulatory decisions at national and international level, today’s conclusion sends a strong signal that public health action is warranted. This emphasis is needed globally, including among the more vulnerable populations in developing countries where new technology and protective measures may otherwise take many years to be adopted’.”
How about just letting the developing countries develop like the industrial countries did. Now a body of bureaucrats want to take their diesel fuel away or force them to accept technology they can’t afford.
The big green monster just keeps growing. Expect men donning white protective suits to soon show up to tow your car away.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman readers know that after the Tagesschau (8 p.m. national news) on ARD German television, regular programming sometimes, but not very often, gets interrupted by a special news report on some sort of disaster that impacts the entire country. It takes something pretty big for this to happen.
This so-called special news report, during prime time, is called “Brennpunkt”; in English that’s “ignition-point”.
Well, we got a Brennpunkt this evening on ARD after the news – about the cold and snow that has wreaked havoc on the country and throughout Europe.
All transportation in Germany has been paralyzed or disrupted. Many trains have been idled, and numerous flights have been cancelled. Passengers are stranded everywhere.
28 people have died in Europe as a result of the cold. Temperatures are forecast to plummet to -25°C in some areas as winter’s onslaught continues unabated.
I think the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy, slated to start tomorrow, will be impacted too. It’ll go on, for sure, but some participants may be delayed. Berlin area has been hit pretty hard.
I was planning to leave by train tomorrow from Osnabrück, but with the situation as it is now, I don’t think I’ll be arriving in Berlin on time. But I’m going, and hoping the situation stabilises overnight and that I’ll manage to get there in the afternoon.
Damn global warming!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe situation for German global warming activists is getting ever more hopeless by the hour. Are we witnesing the death of one of the greatest hoaxes of all time? Now that large, major media outlets are putting the CO2 scam under the spotlight, and revealing the CO2 lies, sales of Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s skeptic book are skyrocketing.
Number 12 on the overall Amazon.de bestseller list - and still rising.
The new book has skyrocketed up to No. 12 on the overall Amazon.de bestseller list. This really increases the chances that a publisher for an English version book will soon be found.
The warmists can say all they want – once undecided readers read just a quarter of the book, they will already be convinced that there indeed will not be any climate catastrophe. All the facts and data are there – presented so that laypersons can understand it. Global warming in Germany will soon be kaput!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe 5th International Climate and Energy Conference is taking place on November 30 and December 1, 2012 in Munich. The conference features a number of outstanding speakers who are critical of climate science and energy policy today.

In the year that the German energy transition to renewables failed, the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)together with partner institutes is holding its 5th conference.
The conference is taking place at the Bayerische Hof. Scientists and managers from a number of countries will be presenting and discussing climate science  and the causes and problems of Germany’s energy transition to renewable energy. The problems can be traced back to the hysterical belief that there is a threatening climate catastrophe.
What follows below is the program as it now stands. Some changes may take place. The conference with be held simultaneously both in English and German.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I’m going to meander off into politics. It’s election day after all.
Here in Europe, that dreaded day has unfortunately arrived. This one is as welcome as a root canal treatment. Now that it’s here, for the European Establishment, it’s: let’s get it over with and hope the pain will be bearable.
In Germany the newsrooms and media are having a difficult time coming to terms with the inevitable results. The insults and nervous breakdowns are everywhere. The dreams of socialism, world goverment and climate theocracy are crumbling before their eyes.
Now, instead of being inspiring slogans, “Yes we can” and “Hope and Change” have become a big joke.
It’s that damn Tea Party, which is made up of unsophisticated, rather ignorant, white, racist, narrow minded, religious, ultra-conservative, angry gun-wielding Americans who are too stupid to know what’s good for them, all led by extremists like Sarah Palin – so laments much of the established media here. The Tea Partiers are so disinformed, e.g. many don’t even believe in the hard science of manmade global warming and believe the planet was created 6000 years ago.  If only Americans weren’t so stupid and ignorant.
Two years ago the German and European media made Obama their darling, portraying him as the savior that had delivered America and the world from the clutches of the evil Bush regime. A year later he was even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for doing so. But that has since turned out to be a certificate of failure (think Gore, Arafat and a host of others).
Now, as Europe views it, the Tea Party express places the whole grand global plan of a world nanny state rescuing the planet from climate catastrophe and capitalism in jeopardy. Nothing gets more villified in the European press than the Tea Party (except climate deniers, that is).
Many media outlets have complained that climate initiatives will soon be blocked by these new denier Republicans. Here are some excerpts of how the German print media feels about the upcoming Congressional overhaul and the reasons behind it.
Sueddeutsche Zeitung
The USA increasingly appears to be a giant that is paralyzed by polarity. On one side you have the political middle who are attempting to implement solutions for the big challenges that the nation faces. On the other side, there’s the Tea Party, TV network Fox News and the “no”-faction who say no to government, no to taxes, no to change, no to environmental protection. In this camp there are many who believe that climate change is a big conspiracy by intellectuals or by the Chinese.

In the meantime, reality has caught up to the Obama government. The promised hope and change has stalled time and again in committees and meetings, failing because of resistantance from the political opposition.
Die Welt
Many Americans are disappointed by the economic policy of the government, even though the financial and economic crisis began on Obama’s predecesssor George W. Bush’s watch. The right-wing populist Tea Party movement, which supported many candidiates, profited the most from the frustration.
Die Zeit
In the House, Obama has had a majority of 39 seats. They will lose 70 or even 80 seats to the Republicans. Soon the conservatives will have a majority and will appoint the Speaker of the House. In the Senate the Democrats have had a majority of 59 of the 100 seats. There are surely going to be losses there too. But most likely they will hang on to a slim majority with 51 or 52 seats.
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
It is mainly the conservative grassroots Tea Party that has provided the Republicans, who took it on the chin 2 years earlier, with a Renaissance. It’s likely that the Tea Party movement will also be a major factor in 2012 with its economically motivated demands for debt reduction, spending discipline, tax cuts and smaller governments.

The Europeans hoped that the US would go green, and adopt all those wonderful sustainable social programs that people love so much in Europe. Like this one for example:
No more money for dentists.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is no April Fool’s story. It’s a real story at Spiegel. 
Everyone knows that some climate scientists like to use sea level rise as a way to scare the public when it comes to the dangers of global warming. A one-meter rise could wreak havoc and displace tens of millions of people overnight over 100 years they fret.
 Most experts, however, agree that the current rate of sea level rise is more of a nuisance than a catastrophe, and something that we can do little to prevent. But now there are some experts who say that there is another risk looming out there that needs to be taken far more seriously, especially in Japan – monster tsunamis.
Der Spiegel has a new article on how Japan could be a hit by a 34 meter (113-foot) tsunami from earthquake activity in the Pacific. Spiegel writes:
New research results show that the danger is greater than assumed up to now. […] An earthquake in the ocean with a magnitude of 9.0 in the Nankai Gorge off the east coast of Japan could trigger a wave of more than 20 meters and flood a large part of the coastal region, the Japanese media quoted a research report today from a government-appointed expert commission. […] Wave heights with peaks of up to 34 meters are possible in the future, the report now says.”
That is something we definitely need to worry about, much more than the improbable one meter sea level rise over 100 years due to global warming in a dubious climate model. The Japanese report goes on to say that even earthquakes of 7.0 under certain conditions would be enough wreak havoc for Tokyo, an area that is home to 33 million people.
So what should the government do? Should coastal areas be closed and everyone moved to higher ground? The answer is of course no. The benefits of residing along the coast are immense. People should be made aware of the risks and plans need to be drawn up that allow for an effective response in the event of such a disaster. The best we can hope for is to find effective ways to minimize the damage.
Is this all just irresponsible fear-mongering? Der Spiegel writes:
A powerful earthquake in the area is long overdue. In the event of a catastrophe, a power outage of more than one week has to be expected and the water supply could be knocked out for a mionth.
The report states that most people are not stocked up with enough supplies to carry them over for these periods.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the statement issued by the New York Times itself:
The Times is discontinuing the Green blog, which was created to track environmental and energy news and to foster lively discussion of developments in both areas. This change will allow us to direct production resources to other online projects.”
Why do we suppose this is? Didn’t this part of the Times bring yet more respect and credibility to one of America’s most renown dailies – especially now that”we are all facing a planetary crisis“?
Perhaps a recent Twitter post by NYT environment reporter Andrew Revkin can answer that question. It appears the green pages of the Gray Lady were turning out to be more of an embarrassment than anything. As is the case with any operation that gets shut down, it is because either there’s no longer a demand for it, or other sources are simply doing a much better job delivering.
Recently Andrew Revkin, for example, implied that recent volcano activity was probably the explanation for the stop in global warming over the past years. There’s got to be some explanation. After all, we all know it just can’t be the sun. Here’s what Revkin tweeted:

You can link to the study’s abstract here. Every time they pull the aerosol joker. But even Gavin Schmidt was not impressed by Revkin’s adventurism. Here’s what Schmidt tweeted back:

Yes, indeed it was probably a good time to end the Green blog show, and to “direct production resources to other online projects“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUnless the power grid collapses, the printing presses will continue churning out tens of thousands of copies of the latest edition of DER SPIEGEL – well into the night so that they’ll be fresh for the newsstands tomorrow.
UPDATE: SPIEGEL reveals more
Tomorrow’s edition features a story on environment expert Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, author of the new book Die kalte Sonne” (The Cold Sun). According to the text provided by Der Spiegel, Vahrenholt’s underlying message is clear: “It’s also the sun, stupid!”
Here’s how DER SPIEGEL describes tomorrow’s upcoming story:
THE CLIMATE REBEL
With heretical claims, RWE ma­na­ger Fritz Vah­ren­holt is causing a commotion: ‘The climate catastrophe is not taking place’, the environment expert claims. The sun is being underestimated as a natural climate factor. ‘The sun has been weak since 2005’, Vahrenholt said in a DER SPIEGEL interview. ‘We can only expect cooling from it for the time being.'”
Perfect timing

The timing of the DER SPIEGEL feature story couldn’t be worse for Germany’s catastrophe-obsessed warmists. This week renewable energies manager Fritz Vahrenholt’s and geologist Sebastain Lüning’s much anticipated climate-catastrophe skeptic book “Die kalte Sonne” is also hitting bookstores everywhere.
Even the weather is cooperating!  When citizens pick up their copy of the flagship Spiegel magazine tomorrow morning at the newsstands, they’ll be shivering in temperatures down to -20°C, as Germany remains gripped in its coldest February freeze in 25 years. Temperature tomorrow morning in Berlin are forecast to dip to a frigid -17°C with no warming in sight.
There’s no way of knowing whether DER SPIEGEL will unload on Professor Vahrenholt and Dr. Lüning, take a more fair and balanced approach, or back them up. One thing is certain – the DER SPIEGEL story will push sales of Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s book way up the overall best-seller list. The unwanted debate is unavoidable.
More than just the sun
One thing I have noticed: all the premature criticism from the warmists so far is focussed on the sun. I hate to tell you critics, guardians of the climate catastrophe narrative, but the book looks at a hell of a lot more than just the sun. We’re talking about over 800 cited sources (many peer-reviewed) and 80 graphics on a wide range of factors. I suggest you all hold your blabber and read the book first.
Expect lots of howling from the catastrophe-obsessed warmist zealots in the weeks ahead.
So pick up a Spiegel copy tomorrow (and the book) and let the debate begin!

Share this...FacebookTwitterEd Caryl, author of One Of Our Hemispehere Is Missing and A Light In Siberia, brings us his latest essay. If history is an indicator, then today’s simultaneously declining PDO and AMO, in combination with a solar quiet period, mean that a “rapidly cooling situation” may be in the works, or we could even be “headed for a new ice age”.
Sunspots and Temperature
by Ed Caryl
Sunspots have been tracked systematically since 1700. Temperature has been recorded in Central England since 1659. We can compare these two records and measure the relationship. Both are plotted below.

Fig. 1: Sunspot activity and temperature
First, note that the trend lines for both temperature and sunspot number are parallel. Annual sunspots have been increasing since the Maunder Minimum at about 10 spots per century. Temperature has been increasing at about 0.4°C per century.
Sunspots drive the solar output. Here is a plot of solar irradiance as reconstructed by Judith Lean. (Lean, J. (2000). “Evolution of the Sun’s Spectral Irradiance Since the Maunder Minimum”. Geophysical Research Letters 27 (16): 2425–8. doi:10.1029/2000GL000043.)
Below, the irradiance data is plotted against the temperature data seen in Fig. 1 above. The irradiance is in watts per square meter. Notice that the since the Maunder Minimum, the irradiance as increased by almost 3 watts/m2, on the same order as the supposed recent CO2 warming.

Fig. 2: Temperature and Solar Irradiance.
Figure 3 follows, and is a scatter diagram of solar irradiance and temperature. Note that it also shows a trend of 1 degree from minimum irradiance to maximum. That also corresponds to 0.4 degrees per century.

Fig. 3: Temperature versus Irradiance
Another thing to notice is that warming takes place immediately as sunspots and irradiance increase, but cooling seems to be delayed by a few years. This is likely due to the oceans’ “flywheel” effect on land temperatures, as has been noted by Juraj Vanovcan here. The oceans take a long time to react to solar influence.
What does this say about the future?
The land temperature at the end of the Maunder Minimum was still falling after 50 years of no sunspots and minimum irradiance. During the Dalton Minimum from 1800 to 1835, it took almost 20 years for the Central England temperature to react by cooling. Other cooling events, in 1740 and 1880, have happened faster. The reaction time depends on timing with ocean cycles.
The Dalton Minimum took place during a high point in the PDO, but the PDO was falling in 1880. At this time, 2010, PDO has fallen, and AMO is starting to fall. With the solar cycle staying low, we may be in for a rapidly cooling situation.

What is the current irradiance? It is 2 watts/square meter below the minimum shown by Judith Lean, above. Hopefully there is a 2 watts/square meter offset error in her 2000 reconstruction, or we are headed for a new ice age.

Fig. 4: Solar Irradiance Trend. Source: here.
What about CO2? According to the U. K. Met Office, the rise in the Central England temperature record after 1974, “has been adjusted to allow for urban warming”. They don’t reveal what those adjustments were, so that portion of the record should be taken with a grain of salt, especially the last 10 years. No other evidence of anthropogenic temperature rise can be seen.
