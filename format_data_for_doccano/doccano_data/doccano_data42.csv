Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German press and politicians are writing off this conference, already. It’s over, and nobody sings “Time to say goodbye” better than Europe does. Sit back and enjoy this lovely tribute to Cancun (pre-recorded).

Lovely! Isn’t this supposed to be a sad song? For me it’s a happy one.
When the media in Germany are this pessimistic about Cancun and are already rehearsing this beautiful tune, then you know it’s over.
Even German centre-left daily Die Zeit has the headline today: Germany Dampens Cancun Expectations.
Germany, led by Angela Merkel, is a leading proponent of a global climate treaty, actually believing it is possible to regulate the globe’s temperature. Japan, Canada and Russia are demanding a treaty that also commits China to limiting greenhouse gas emissions, which is a sure way to kill it. Die Zeit writes:
Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen (CDU) does not expect a breakthrough in Cancun.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) is not even taking part in the conference.

Even the UNEP Director, Achim Steiner, is dampening expectations: ‘Cancun is certainly not the summit that is going to bring about a breakthrough’, he said.”
If Germany has given up, then you can be 99.9999999999999% sure this thing is dead as a doornail.
To save face, countries of course will agree on token measures like protecting forests and signing pledges to continue efforts – next year. Of course, all the finger pointing is being directed at the USA and China. No blame for those that conjured up the idiotic idea that was nuts to begin with.
Die Zeit ends its piece with:
The Chairman of Environment and Nature Protection Germany, Hubert Weiger, calls on Röttgen to continue fighting together with Europe for a continuation of the Kyoto  Protocol. But observers see little chance for a breakthrough in the talks.”
Perhaps Europe ought to wake up and realise that the rest of the world is not interested in being constantly nagged and told what to do. Take care of your own problems. Nobody is listening to you.
And here’s another for Cancun (with well-deserved standing ovation)

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn reader comments yesterday, there was a little discussion about Peter Heller’s recap of the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy, here (German), which took place in Berlin last weekend.
Heller exposed a spy who had been sent over to check up on what was going down at the denier pow-wow on the other side of the Climate Science Iron Curtain. Heller writes:
In any case, by coincidence, I happened to sit down at lunch with a young lady, who outed herself as an employee of Hans Joachim Schellnhuber [PIK], completely forthright and without any reservation. She expressed her wonder at the political emphasis of the conference. She had obviously expected something esoteric and anti-science, probably, which would later allow her institute to gripe endlessly about. However, the conference offered none of that.”

For readers not familiar with PIK, it is the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which is directed by Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, and is the workplace for Stefan Rahmstorf and Wealth Redistributor Ottmar Edenhofer. It is, unfortunately, the primary scientific institute advising Angela Merkel on climate policy.
Obviously Schellnhuber didn’t want to be caught slumming it by being seen at such an event (or maybe he felt the risk of being caught peering through 2 holes cut in a copy of the Süddeutsche Zeitung was too high). So instead he opted to issue an underling an Ausreisegenehmigung (travel permit) to Denierland – with the mission to observe the capitalistically funded conference.
As a visiting blogger, I’m a little intrigued by all this. I’m told Greenpeace activists were sent over last year. This year we got a young spy. I view that as progress. The level of sophistication in dealing with skeptics is indeed climbing.
I can only speculate what may have gone through this young lady’s head as she listened to the speakers.
First of all, it must have made an impression on her that on the skeptic side of the Climate Iron Curtain people are much more positive and optimistic about the future, and not all mired in the doom, gloom and pessimism of the sort one finds at the PIK, where scientists constantly fret and wring their hands over the ever faster approaching climate catastrophe.
And working at the PIK, where a certain science dogma is rigidly enforced and nothing else is tolerated, she had to have appreciated the intellectual freedom that the skeptics enjoy, where everyone is free to think and express any view, and do so without fear of having to do time in a science gulag.
At RealClimate, how many scientists have had their comments deleted? How often do we hear Rahmstorf complain about newspapers openly expressing views he does not agree with? How many hours does Rahmstorf spend surfing the Internet in search of “denier” articles and rebutting them, smearing scientists as he does so?
Peter Heller writes that the political and economic emphasis at the conference appeared to confuse the young lady:
This seemed to be an aspect that she perceived as surprising. From our short discussion at the lunch table, she expected more a debate about climatic model certainty and the possibilities for their improvement. Instead, she was shown the risks that today’s climate protection policies entail, and the risks that politicians are willing to take and what their motives are. She did not want to accept the fact that climate policy in Germany is labelled with PIK, and carries the tags of Schellnhuber, Rahmstorf and Edenhofer, and that we certainly oppose these also with political arguments. Who, I ask myself, suffers here from cognitive dissonance?
It’s obviously all too much for the young lady, who by now has surely returned back to the PIK where she finds all the comforts that dogma and restricted intellectual freedom have to offer.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m beginning to wonder if Germany’s online Die Welt daily is still a serious publication. Certainly not its fiction fantasy alarmism science section, which has become an outlet for every wildly imaginable climate catastrophe scenario.
It’s become sort of a laughing stock, along with much of the rest of Germany’s established media.
Yesterday Die Welt reported here on how scientists at the University of Giessen’s Institute For Plant Ecology, based in the central German state of Hesse, have conducted experiments that have yielded “surprising and worrisome” results.
For 12 years scientists have been simulating climate change in a time lapse by pumping CO2 over a green pasture area at levels that are expected to be reached in the year 2030 (bought-and-paid-for junk science).
The results showed that the added CO2 did not lead to higher CO2 concentrations in the ground. Moreover, it led to higher emissions of nitrous oxide. The scientists found it “alarming”. In addition, the times at which plants blossom and foliage changes colours have changed. Plants have a phenological clock says Christoph Müller, Director of the Institute For Plant Ecology. He says:
One sees: The clock has shifted a little.
A little? Die Welt does not define how much “a little” actually is, but it must be enough to allow it to write:
The winters have shortened, the springs are starting earlier. According to projections, spring could begin already at the end of January after 2030.
According to Müller:

The climate in Hesse has changed. The vegetation has responded to climate change.”
That itself should not surprise anyone, unless of course one is among those who are ignorant of climatic and oceanic cycles, and who happen to believe that climate stagnation is the natural norm (when humans are not around). Maybe Müller believes this. In the Die Welt report he says 0.7°C temperature increase is something that took thousands of years to occur in earlier history. Today this is occurring in just 100 years!
Perhaps all those ice-bore proxies are wrong now. Maybe the earth needed thousands of years to come out of the ice age, and not hundreds as is thought to be the case.
And so it is in the “science” section of Die Welt.
And what can we do to avert this coming climate catastrophe? Christopher Müller demands we handle energy in a different way, and calls for another way of living.
One reader calling him/herself Impfstoffel commented at the end of the article:
This year (2010) spring 2010 didn’t not get started until the end of May – at least where I live!!
And living in northern Germany, allow me to add to that: Fall this year started already in August!
I wonder if the media and scientists realise how stupid they are making themselves look before the educated public. The Die Welt readers who have felt comments are laughing at the story by the usual 10 to 1 margin.
I’ve filed this post under a new category: “Stupid Predictions”.

I can’t recommend the following video (below) enough: h/t: Stu, reader at Climate Progress.
I admit I’m backpedalling, and took the 1010 clip too lightly. I realise now why some people are so very upset about it. They are right to be so. The following video hits it home as to why radical anything is so dangerous.
I’m not saying that environmentalists are that far, but the intolerant, radical ones are certainly well on their way. When one starts fantasizing about blowing up children with the push of a button, something is terribly amiss.
I watched the clip below 3 times. The following passages struck me.
Look for yourself. This is the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz. This is where people were turned into numbers.
Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some 4 million people. And that was not done by gas.

It was done by ARROGANCE. It was done by DOGMA. It was done by ignorance. When people believe they have ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE, with no test in reality, this is how they behave.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe 5th Arctic Frontiers Conference in Tromsø, Norway recently took place with about 1000 scientists attending from all over the world (another big footprint). But except for a few fringe media outlets, no one listened. So I thought I’d lend these poor desperate alarmist scientists a favour and help them get their message out.
This year’s motto for the conference was dubbed: “Tipping Points”. The German online, leftist TAZ daily wrote a piece called:
The Blind Spots Of Climate Scientists
The article of course is another spread-the-panic piece that claims the climate could reach a tipping point at a certain temperature, this according to “leading scientists”. This is so shocking that Norway’s foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre was compelled to say:
 “The scientists are warning us that we are approaching a condition where the Arctic ecological system is about to collapse.”
Scientists warn that the tipping point is rapidly approaching because a number of “tipping components” are already in action, namely the melting of sea ice, which reduces albedo and leads to warming of the ocean. There’s also the thawing of the permafrost, which leads to the release of methane gas, which…and so on. And TAZ reminds us of the Greenland ice pack:
“If the ice on Greenland disappeared, oceans would rise seven meters globally – but that would take thousands of years, because the ice in the middle is 2 km thick.”
I thought Greenland’s ice was three km thick. Has 1 km already melted away? Oceanographer Carlos M. Duarte of the Spanish research centre Imedia says:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




With a melting of Arctic sea ice, the ‘tipping point’ would already be exceeded. Beginning in the year 2020, an Arctic in the summer months that is practically without ice most likely cannot be averted.
Perhaps Mr Duarte is not aware, but the Arctic core has gained 2000 CUBIC KILOMETERS of ice since 2007. That would be 4 million sq km of equivalent additional ice half a meter thick. Add that to the current sea ice area!
Greenland melts with another 0.4°C of warming
Wherever alarmism and end of the world scenarios are fantasised, one can expect to find Stefan Rahmstorf of Germany’s alarmist Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research. TAZ quotes Rahmstorf:
New research could yield that the targeted limitation of global warming to 2°C will not be enough, says oceanographer Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research: It’s possible that Greenland’s ice already could melt irrevocably with a rise of 1.3 to 2.3°C, which is what still unpublished research indicates. In its 2007 report, the IPCC spoke of 1,9 to 4.6°C. Already now the global temperatures have risen on average 0.8 to 0.9°C .
So as TAZ reports it, Rahmstorf is claiming that Greenland could melt with just another 0.4°C of warming. TAZ mentions “still unpublished research”. Perhaps this is new research from Rahmstorf that’s designed to salvage his already discredited claims of 1.8 metres of sea level rise by 2100. Does that mean we should expect another piece of panic science from Rahmstorf to appear in an upcoming Nature issue.
What is needed is an early warning system for a climate tipping, say the scientists. But TAZ reports  that the scientific basis is still missng for such a system – there are so called blind spots. Oran R. Young, Professor at the University of Santa Barbara:
Our problem is not that we have too little data. We have to find out which data is relevant. We need just a few but decisive indicators.”
Blind spots? I’d say dead zones would be more accurate.

"Canada has imposed a landmark carbon tax on four provinces which had defied Ottawa’s push to combat climate change, prompting unhappy premiers to say they would challenge the measure.  The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, citing international commitments to fight global warming, had made clear for two years he would slap the tax on any of the 10 provinces that did not come up with their own plans by 1 April. The measure is opposed by Ontario, the most populous province, where Trudeau’s Liberals need to do well to stand a chance of retaining power in a federal election this October. Carbon pollution will initially cost C$20 ($15) a tonne, rising by C$10 a year until it reaches C$50 in 2022. It also applies in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. “As of today, it’s no longer free to pollute anywhere in Canada,” the environment minister, Catherine McKenna, said on Twitter. “Climate change is real ... some politicians may not care much, but our kids and our grandkids do.“ Official data regularly show Canada has little chance of meeting its climate change goals of reducing emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. Although Ottawa says the money collected will be returned to taxpayers in the form of rebates, right-leaning parties portray it as a cash grab. The Conservatives, who polls show could win the October election as a scandal over alleged political interference dogs Trudeau, promise to scrap the measure. Ontario premier Doug Ford vowed to oppose what he called “the worst tax ever” in court. “We’re going to keep fighting this carbon tax with every single tool at our disposal,” he said in a filmed statement. Scott Moe, the premier of Saskatchewan, which has already launched a challenge, said he hoped the tax was an April Fool’s joke. “We now have four provinces representing half the population in this nation that say this is a flawed policy,” Moe told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Trudeau’s other efforts to combat climate change are also proving a challenge. Last year the government unveiled legislation to overhaul environmental assessments of energy projects, paying more attention to greenhouse gas emissions. Critics say this will deter future investment at a time when existing projects are already in trouble. Canada bought Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s Trans Mountain crude pipeline for $4.5bn last year after the company expressed doubts it could proceed with plans to more than double the existing capacity."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis has to be a short post as it’s 1 a.m. and I’m beat. The conference today ended at 9.30 and then I met up with some other German bloggers at the bar for a couple of drinks and good discussion.
The first day went very well with a slate of very interesting speakers. I feel it’s beginning to crumble, and I’m getting signals that some media outlets are beginning to shift gears. It only takes one domino to fall to get the rest of it going. The recent FOCUS feature was a sign.
None of the mainstream media outlets bothered to show up. But that’s okay becuase I scanned the headlines of all the big German newspapers while at the train station this morning, and they had nothing about Cancun! Summary: climate has lost its signficance – completely.
I’d say there were around 150 people attending today, with a good number of young faces, and so I was surprised by the turnout. Many of the talks today were about the cosmic radiation.cloud correlation. Scientists Henrik Borchert:
The German Weather Service has to start looking at their own data.”
One highlight was a live video feed of Lord Monckton and Roy Spencer from Cancun, who gave us a progress report there and we were able to ask questions directly.
I wanted to post a photo but I have to convert the photo and it’s too late. I’ll post more tomorrow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterParts of Europe are being gripped by unusual cold, even though the calendar says it’s meteorological summer. Now children in Sweden are finding out what snow is like – in June! Strangest warming I’ve ever seen.

Winter pounds Sweden – and it’s summer!
The English language The Local here writes that “Stockholm broke an 84-year-old cold record on Saturday, as the capital’s temperature only reached 6 degrees Celsius, the lowest June maximum daily temperature the city has seen since 1928.”
Indeed, you could be excused for thinking that the current chill is more like winter than summer. It was actually colder in the capital yesterday than on Christmas Eve. ‘The temperature was a degree lower than it was at Christmas in Stockholm, so it is colder. And it’s windier, too,’ said SMHI’s meteorologist Lisa Frost to newspaper Dagens Nyheter.”
Just two days ago The Local here reported that snow blanketed northern parts.
Residents in northern Sweden were forced to grab shovels rather than sun lotion on what was supposed to be the first day of summer, as much of the region was left covered in a thick blanket of snow on Friday. As much as 20 centimetres of thick, wet snow fell in parts of Västerbotten County, giving residents quite a shock when they woke up Friday morning.”
The mercury also dropped to minus 6 degrees Celsius in one town, making it the coldest June Sweden recording in 20 years. The Local adds:
The weather agency forecasts that the first weekend in June will feel more like the start of winter than the start of summer.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s Sunday and this report here at The Local has parallels that I just couldn’t help but notice.
For us skeptics we should never be so naive to think that we are going to convince the world of natural climate change in our lifetime. As history shows us, those who are right often have to wait a very long time before getting the credit or apology they deserve. Hey, it’s the price of far-sightedness.
In climate science we are indeed dealing in large part with religious, fanatic zealots – all drugged up in their CO2 global warming paranoia. Today every weather anomaly even gets blamed on the wicked ways of CO2 emitters, who, we are told, have a pact with the Big Oil devil.
Today, skeptic scientists, bloggers and a few journalists are being singled out and a guilty verdict is being sought for them in the court of public opinion. Some nut-cases are even calling for Nuremberg-type trials.
The Local here writes about skeptics and dissidents (witches!) of the past, how they were blamed for natural catastrophes. Take Katharina Henot –
Germany’s most notorious ‘witch’ – stood accused of having entered into a pact with the devil, conjured up a plague of caterpillars, sown strife and encouraged sexual deviancy. In 1627 she was sentenced to death by torture by the Cologne Court. 385 years later, in a symbolic gesture by the Cologne City Council, Henot and 37 other “witches” executed by local authorities are to be pardoned and rehabilitated, wrote Die Welt newspaper on Saturday.”
So you see, the path back to sanity can indeed be a very long one. Those with the truth at times are put to death as “criminals”.
As the climate catastrophe-obsessed mob decends deeper into madness, us skeptics must always keep in mind that we could very well end up being burned at the stake (of public opinion) and not be rehabilitated until the next phase of the solar millenial cycle when the Earth enters its next cold period – 500 years from now.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEurope’s winter refuses to let up as large areas saw a white Easter accompanied by record lows and snowfall amounts. Media outlets are warning that this year could the year without a spring. Germany’s number 1 daily by circulation Bild writes here that the cold weather may be around even until Pentecost (mid-May)!
The German Weather Service (DWD) reports that March, 2013 was the 6th coldest in 132 years of measurements. The forecast for Germany calls for the cold weather to persist through the rest of the week. Nighttime temperatures will plummet to -10°C.
Some people think that the chances for a hot, sunny summer are higher after going through a long, cold winter. But meteorologist Karsten Brandt says this is not so. Bild writes:
Brandt is skeptical: ‘I can imagine brief, hot phases, but in many years  when the winters were cold, the summers were also not better.’“
If that’s the case this year, then Germany could wind up putting 2013 in the books as one of the coolest on record.
The situation is a disaster in Eastern Europe: “At least 100,000 people in Poland without power due to heavy snows…up to 30 centimeters of new snow. … Also in the Czech Republic and Slovakia up to 40 centimeters of new snow fell in 24 hours. … In Moscow a new snow record was set for the date…65 centimeters on the ground.”
German Weather Service: “Global warming is increasing”
Bild then asks ideologically warmist German Weather Service (DWD) meteorologist Christoph Hartmann if the cold winters mean global warming has stopped.

Bild: And what’s with global warming? Snow and frost in April. Is it now an ice age instead of global warming?”
Hartmann: No, it remains warming; global warming is increasing. One cold winter does not refute it. What happens in Germany or Europe has no significance for world climate.
Bild: Apparently climate warming is taking a break in Germany.
Hartmann: Between 1985 and 1995 the temperature rose continuously. But since then not much has happened. However, worldwide new high temperature values are measured every year.
Very sloppy terminology by Hartmann and poor reporting by Bild aside, we have to ask what impression the reader ends up getting here. “Global warming is increasing,” says Hartman. Warming means increasing temperature, and so increasing increasing temperature means accelerating temperature. Have the meteorologist at the DWD looked at any global data lately, say the last 15 years?
 
Where’s the accelerating temperature? (Source woodfortrees.org).
Not only does Hartmann use sloppy terminology, but his facts are completely wrong. Where are the “new high temperature values measured” every year? The trend is actually downwards over the last 10 years. Quality at the DWD has deteriorated to comic levels.

"In 2007, an article in the Wall Street Journal appeared with the headline “Inconvenient youth”. A pun on Al Gore’s film An Inconvenient Truth, it described parents being badgered by their children to drive less or install low energy lighting to help climate change. It even included tips and strategies for fed-up parents to deflect these suggestions. A new study challenges this narrative. In 2015, a poster competition for Utah schools was launched to encourage teens to consider the air pollution implications of their driving privilege and to learn strategies to preserve air quality. Although the competition was directed at the teenagers, it soon became clear that they were talking to their parents and encouraging them to change behaviour too.  Changes included stopping engine idling, joining short trips together or walking instead of driving. In later rounds, researchers began to focus on this parent-teenager interaction. In contrast to the pessimistic Wall Street Journal article, only 6% of parents said the information from children was as annoying or irritating. The clear majority were proud of their child’s clean air actions and were motivated to change themselves.  Let’s hope our politicians are as open in listening to the thousands of school children taking to the streets each Friday."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnyone who still does not believe environmentalism is a front for repressive, authoritarian-like state control of our lives can now look at yet another example that it is indeed so. And again the target is poor countries.
The online weekly Die Zeit reports here on how the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recently issued a press release that surely puts a big smile on the faces of Marxist environmentalists. Get set for a another round of expensive and repressive regulation, taxes and penalties. You’ll notice the familiar language of authority and consensus.
The WHO IARC writes (link and emphasis added):
After a week-long meeting of international experts, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organization (WHO), today classified diesel engine exhaust as carcinogenic to humans Group 1, based on sufficient evidence that exposure is associated with an increased risk for lung cancer. […]
There has been mounting concern about the cancer-causing potential of diesel exhaust, particularly based on findings in epidemiological studies of workers exposed in various settings. […]
The scientific evidence was reviewed thoroughly by the Working Group and overall it was concluded that there was sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of diesel exhaust.”
Now we’re all really scared. Oh my, what can we do! The expert doctors recommend (emphasis added):

Given the Working Group’s rigorous, independent assessment of the science, governments and other decision-makers have a valuable evidence-base on which to consider environmental standards for diesel exhaust emissions and to continue to work with the engine and fuel manufacturers towards those goals.
Dr Christopher Portier, Chairman of the IARC working Group, stated that “The scientific evidence was compelling and the Working Group’s conclusion was unanimous: diesel engine exhaust causes lung cancer in humans.” Dr Portier continued: ‘Given the additional health impacts from diesel particulates, exposure to this mixture of chemicals should be reduced worldwide.’
Dr Kurt Straif, Head of the IARC Monographs Program, indicated that ‘The main studies that led to this conclusion were in highly exposed workers. However, we have learned from other carcinogens, such as radon, that initial studies showing a risk in heavily exposed occupational groups were followed by positive findings for the general population. Therefore actions to reduce exposures should encompass workers and the general population.’
Dr Christopher Wild, Director, IARC, said that ‘while IARC’s remit is to establish the evidence-base for regulatory decisions at national and international level, today’s conclusion sends a strong signal that public health action is warranted. This emphasis is needed globally, including among the more vulnerable populations in developing countries where new technology and protective measures may otherwise take many years to be adopted’.”
How about just letting the developing countries develop like the industrial countries did. Now a body of bureaucrats want to take their diesel fuel away or force them to accept technology they can’t afford.
The big green monster just keeps growing. Expect men donning white protective suits to soon show up to tow your car away.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve mentioned at least a couple of times at this blog how the German public school system is pounding the climate protection religion in school classrooms.
For example former minister of environment Sigmar Gabriel of the SPD socialist party was so impressed by Al Gore’s Inconvenient Truth propaganda film that he procured 6000 copies and had them distributed to Germany’s upper secondary schools for viewing by university-bound students.
Environmental groups like Germanwatch make the rounds through schools to spread panic by grossly exaggerating climate change scenarios (German port cities will be under water).
Greenpeace is even petitioning the German government to have Climate Protection” adopted in its Constititution:
‘Climate change is the most dangerous threat to our natural existence, yet it is neither mentioned in the Constitution nor in the UN Charter. The German Parliament must therefore anchor this as one of the most important duties of the state,’ says Stefan Krug, leader of the political representation of Greenpeace in Berlin.
But that doesn’t go far enough. Let’s take a page out of the Pyongyang playbook and start early – real early.  The German education system has assigned itself another new function beside education – environmental indoctrination. Germany’s sceptic site Readers Edition here has a piece today on the latest indoctrination program at schools called: klima on… s’cooltour 2009, again delivered by alarmist organization Germanwatch.
This program is initiated by the manufacturers of energy saving lights, like Philips – see video (in German).
These big greedy corporations are behind scaring kids in order to boost the sales of their poisonous, mercury-laden lights.

As the film shows, all kids are in uniform, dressed in “s’cool tour” T-shirts. and fed the junk science and environmental propaganda of rescuing the planet. First the kids are explained in simple terms “why the earth has a fever”, and, using an inverted glass jar, shown how heated air turns into storms.
And of course, they are taught that energy saving lights will rescue the polar bears in the Arctic.
The clip says: “thanks to the program, kids now better understand why storms are caused and that each person can make an “enormous contribution in reducing the earth’s fever”.  Indeed. In fact, Germany cutting its CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050 will lead to the enormous temperature reduction of 0.0072°C.
Says Lena Haller:
We are trying to change the behaviour of the kids and thus improve it.
It doesn’t matter what the science turns up. The enviro-brainwashers aren’t interested in it. They are into changing behaviour – getting everybody to believe their phoney doomsday scenarios and have them behave in fear accordingly. It hardly can get worse. Their target with the little ones is to turn them into greenshirts – like this:

"People pressed their semi-naked bums on the gallery glass in the House of Commons and had to be peeled off by police, and it still wasn’t the stupidest thing that happened in parliament this week. On Monday, the night that parliament was supposed to “take back control”, protest group Extinction Rebellion got into the gallery, took their kit off and tried to stick a variety of body parts to the glass, turning the House of Commons into some kind of X-rated human zoo. It seemed weird but by the time Tuesday came around we were all looking back on it as a rare moment of sanity. For one thing, it was just nice to see people who had made a decision. It wasn’t the best decision – they were going to glue their hands to some glass and wriggle their bums around for a bit – but at least something got decided in parliament. Because what happened next was that MPs, who had just taken control from a government who kept bringing back the same deal over and over again, decided to reject every available option they had created for themselves for the second time in a row. You can only imagine how the evening went down in EU capitals. “All right, 1,011 days since the referendum, 11 left to go. Let’s take a look at what the UK is doing … oh you’re taking the piss!” “What’s wrong, Angela?” “They’re having a wee initial think about what kind of Brexit they actually want to happen.” “Are you sure they aren’t making final preparations?” “NO, THEY’RE BRAINSTORMING!” “OK, but how are they getting on? Are they at least nearly there, Angela?” “No. And I don’t know how to tell you this, but they’ve hired strippers.” With all other options having been rejected, Theresa May sat down to reject the final option of having a general election. In a seven-hour cabinet meeting, she and her colleagues argued furiously about what the hell to do next, probably setting aside at least two hours to talk about what a baller move it was of David Cameron to call the referendum to solve divisions within the Tory party. At the end of it, May gave her inevitable press statement (they may as well strap a lectern to her tummy at this point) and announced her genius solution: do the same thing that had just failed 24 hours before on Bum Day. May’s game-changing suggestion was to try to agree an approach with Jeremy Corbyn, and if that didn’t work then a range of options for the future relationship would be put to the Commons in a series of votes. To be fair to May, it was extremely on brand for her to go down a route that had already failed repeatedly. The government, which spent almost three years fighting itself before it even considered compromising with a party it actively despises, now wants to get this sorted by the end of the week. In 2016 this offer would have been sensible. Now, with a week to go, it looks like the prime minister, having started a fire and fanned the flames, is asking Labour to stand there holding a can of petrol with her and act a bit shifty till the police arrive. There’s another problem. Anything Labour agrees, it will have to trust May’s successor to carry out. A few weeks ago it looked like May would cling to the doorframe of No 10 until humans died off and she was governing over a mutated breed of cockroaches who also didn’t like her that much. But she’s now promised to resign, meaning whoever replaces her will have to carry out what she agrees. And that’s, to put it mildly, bad, as Boris Johnson is trying to make himself look electable again. Late on Tuesday, irony died as the cauliflower told the BBC that people want politicians in Westminster “not to focus on themselves, but to focus on the needs of the country”. This from a man who hired a photographer to photograph his own resignation in protest against a deal he would go on to endorse in return for the prime minister quitting to make way for him. Now with Brexiteers already quitting or threatening to strike, the DUP livid, the EU sceptical that the plan will work, maybe even to the point that it won’t grant an extension, the chaos really begins. And it’s going to make bum glue-apalooza look like a regular Monday. • James Felton is a TV and radio comedy writer"

Share this...FacebookTwitterUnless the power grid collapses, the printing presses will continue churning out tens of thousands of copies of the latest edition of DER SPIEGEL – well into the night so that they’ll be fresh for the newsstands tomorrow.
UPDATE: SPIEGEL reveals more
Tomorrow’s edition features a story on environment expert Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, author of the new book Die kalte Sonne” (The Cold Sun). According to the text provided by Der Spiegel, Vahrenholt’s underlying message is clear: “It’s also the sun, stupid!”
Here’s how DER SPIEGEL describes tomorrow’s upcoming story:
THE CLIMATE REBEL
With heretical claims, RWE ma­na­ger Fritz Vah­ren­holt is causing a commotion: ‘The climate catastrophe is not taking place’, the environment expert claims. The sun is being underestimated as a natural climate factor. ‘The sun has been weak since 2005’, Vahrenholt said in a DER SPIEGEL interview. ‘We can only expect cooling from it for the time being.'”
Perfect timing

The timing of the DER SPIEGEL feature story couldn’t be worse for Germany’s catastrophe-obsessed warmists. This week renewable energies manager Fritz Vahrenholt’s and geologist Sebastain Lüning’s much anticipated climate-catastrophe skeptic book “Die kalte Sonne” is also hitting bookstores everywhere.
Even the weather is cooperating!  When citizens pick up their copy of the flagship Spiegel magazine tomorrow morning at the newsstands, they’ll be shivering in temperatures down to -20°C, as Germany remains gripped in its coldest February freeze in 25 years. Temperature tomorrow morning in Berlin are forecast to dip to a frigid -17°C with no warming in sight.
There’s no way of knowing whether DER SPIEGEL will unload on Professor Vahrenholt and Dr. Lüning, take a more fair and balanced approach, or back them up. One thing is certain – the DER SPIEGEL story will push sales of Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s book way up the overall best-seller list. The unwanted debate is unavoidable.
More than just the sun
One thing I have noticed: all the premature criticism from the warmists so far is focussed on the sun. I hate to tell you critics, guardians of the climate catastrophe narrative, but the book looks at a hell of a lot more than just the sun. We’re talking about over 800 cited sources (many peer-reviewed) and 80 graphics on a wide range of factors. I suggest you all hold your blabber and read the book first.
Expect lots of howling from the catastrophe-obsessed warmist zealots in the weeks ahead.
So pick up a Spiegel copy tomorrow (and the book) and let the debate begin!

"It’s not hard to see why Chris Grayling jumped at the opportunity to visit Heathrow airport early on Tuesday to welcome passengers landing on a dreary morning at Terminal 2. He was marking the launch of an air service from Flybe – which will now be operating four return flights from Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall to London seven days a week. This is a transport secretary made famous for his inability to actually transport things, whether that be people by train or goods over water (he’s even managed to stop cyclists making it safely from A to B) – and so for Grayling, a plane on a new flightpath taking off and landing on time is a much needed chance to claim an easy win and arrange a photo-op.  But while I’m sure travellers were thrilled to be greeted by grinning Grayling at baggage reclaim, news that more domestic flights are set to take off and land in Britain is not a cause for celebration. It’s remarkably irresponsible, even by this government’s standards, to embrace a growth in domestic air travel when global carbon emissions are on the up, as are global temperatures. To put it bluntly: it is entirely unsustainable while we’re in the midst of a climate emergency. Just this week, budget airline Ryanair was revealed to be one of Europe’s top 10 carbon emitters alongside nine coal plants; the company’s carbon footprint is up nearly 50% in the past five years. And while aviation accounts for about 3% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, it’s forecasted that by 2050 this could rise by up to 700% as growth in demand continues. There’s a complex conversation to be had about how we drastically limit international air travel in a way that reduces climate change while offering travel opportunities. But, let’s be honest, in a country as small as the United Kingdom the vast majority of domestic fights are far from essential. That said, yesterday afternoon I took a quick look online to see the options for travel from Newquay to London and back for early next week. On Great Western Railway, a Super Off-Peak return ticket purchased in advance for the 250-mile journey would set me back £116, and it takes up to five hours each way. Meanwhile, I’d get change from £100 if I decided to fly, and I could be disembarking in just over one hour. It’s a broken system that’s reflected across the UK which urgently needs fixing. It’s hard to quantify just how reckless unnecessary air travel is, and how misguided it is for our politicians to support it. According to the Aviation Environment Federation, taking a flight from Newquay to London sees (roughly) six times more emissions released per person than rail travel, and that’s before other emissions such as nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to global warming when released at such high altitudes, are taken into consideration. But while it remains faster and cheaper to jump on a plane, it’s difficult to expect travellers not to. For families on a budget, the difference in cost can end up being huge; company bosses intent on efficiency are likely to want employees to be in transit for a short a time as possible. It’s why an antidote to our addiction to air travel won’t be found in “the market” or through consumer choice – no good will come of leaving it up to the individual to give up the short-term convenience of slightly faster journeys for the longer-term ambition of having a planet to live on. That’s why we need bold governmental action if we’ve any chance of reducing emissions from travel. Instead of cosying up to airline executives at Heathrow, a transport minister should be campaigning to reverse the airport’s third runway plans. The state should be restricting all but essential domestic air travel in the UK and nationalising a sustainable rail service, subsidised where needed – intervention on this scale is sorely needed. It’s the role of the government to invest in sustainable employment for job losses that would follow: a Green New Deal in action. That should be a priority for any politician taking climate change seriously, but instead Grayling’s department is using public money to subsidise these Cornwall-London airfares. These are the things he should have been talking about at Heathrow this week, rather than singing the praises of air travel. In fact, the only silver lining to Grayling’s airport announcement that he hopes to see more and more flights traversing the length and breadth of Britain is that, given his track record, it’s a plan that will end up failing miserably. Lo and behold, just this morning Flybe cancelled flights amid talks of hub closures. Failing Grayling strikes again – maybe there’s hope for the planet after all … • Michael Segalov is a contributing editor to Huck magazine"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe media today in Germany are filled with the news of the ethanol debacle. 
The government has mandated that super grade gasoline be sold with a minimum content of 10% ethanol in Germany, so-called E10 gasoline. But as always, when the wishes of the government clash with the wishes of the markets and citizens, then you get chaos. That’s the case today in Germany.
Never mind that burning ethanol is an environmental debacle that leads to the destruction of forests and food shortages that lead to higher prices and more hunger worldwide, but it also burns less efficiently and causes damage to many cars. It is yet another well-intentioned program that is making things only worse. Nobody in Germany wants the stuff – neither the drivers nor the environmentalists.
WDR public TV has a report here (in German), which interviews an expert from the environmental group Bundesumwelt- und Naturschutz, Werner Reh, who calls the whole program “stupidity”:
Laws are passed where ethanol percentage requirements are mandated without even knowing where the quantities are going to come from. They have to be certified. A 35% reduction of CO2 has to be shown. Yet the indirect impacts on landuse are not even included in the calculation, and if you do that, then the entire CO2 reduction is wiped out completely.”
But German consumers are not avoiding ethanol for those reasons. Many are simply afraid that the 10% ethanol content will damage their auto engines. So what is the result? They aren’t buying the fuel blend and are opting for the more expensive super premium gasoline instead, paying about €0.40 per US gallon more.

Petrol stations aren’t selling the unwanted ethanol blended fuel. So with unsold E10 gasoline piling up, refineries will soon find themselves scaling back production and will incur additional costs, which eventually the consumer will have to bear.
Gas stations that are still offering the fuel will continue to do so. But the rest are refusing to order it. Holger Krawinkel, energy expert of the Federal Association of Consumer Centres (that’s the best translation I can come up with) offers a brilliant observation, read here:
With biofuels, the costs of CO2 savings are very high.”
Unfortunately that’s the case with almost all renewable energy forms, and not just with biofuels. And we should again ask ourselves what are these high costs for?
A couple of tenths of a degree less warming over 100 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe widespread frigid cold gripping Asia and Europe is illustrated by the following chart (Source here) .
Media outlets have reported that this is the worst February cold wave to hit Europe and western Russia in 25 years. Dozens have frozen to death over the last few days.
So it goes without saying that the warmists at their websites are truly desperate for an explanation – any explanation will do. It turns out that all the cold is caused by global warming, the warmist sites and one institute are now claiming. And, the global warming is going to cause winters to get even colder in the future, they say.
Their level of desperation is clearly illustrated by their most recent absurd claims to explain the cold. The reason for all the cold, writes warmist site klimaretter.de (climate rescuer) emphasis added:
It’s going to get much colder. So far 70 people have frozen to death in Central Europe, but this is only the start of the effects of global warming: The less summertime  ice coverage there is in the Arctic, the higher the probability is for Arctic cold in the following winter in Munich, Dresden, Potsdam, Warsaw or Kiev. That’s the result of a study from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Sciences.”
The same rubbish is also being spewed by warmist site Klima der Gerechtigkeit (Climate of Justice). Both of these hard-up sites are referring to an Alfred Wegener Institute paper I mentioned a few days ago here.

Altered States
So how does a little local Arctic summertime warming freeze half the globe? The Alfred Wegener Institute says that in the summertime the warming melts the Arctic ice, which leads to a more exposed Arctic Ocean, which in turn then can release heat into the atmosphere. This heated atmosphere then triggers altered atmospheric dynamics that morph into massive widespread frigid cold waves sweeping down all over the northern hemisphere 6 months later.
You see, the situation was reversed back in the 1960s and 70s when all the extra summertime Arctic ice coverage led to all them warm Eurasian winters – you know – the ones with all the snow and cold in Europe?
Altered atmospheric dynamics where a little warm triggers massively amplified cold?
I’d say the Alfred Wegener Institute has become that weird little laboratory in that early 1980s film Altered States. Climate science trips, sensory deprivation, hallucinations, dormant genes – it’s all there folks!

"Your article on why women need to start investing to exercise more control over their futures (Why finance is a feminist issue, G2, 9 April) contains much sound advice. However, it neglects an important consideration. If, as Emilie Bellet explains, women are “looking more at where we want to be in 10, 20 or 30 years’ time”, then we also need to think hard about the kind of future our money is going to support. Many women – and men – would be horrified to think that the price for their own security is increased uncertainty and instability across the world, as many funds continue to rely heavily on the fossil fuel and extractive industries. Even so-called ethical funds are often only undertaking basic negative screening, for example ruling out pornography, weapons, tobacco and gambling, but with very little to say on climate risk. The real bottom line is that there is no money to be made on a dead planet. Happily, this can be a win-win situation. Increasingly, fund managers are recognising the risk of the “carbon bubble” and are starting to shift their own funds. And evidence is growing that over the long term, sustainable investments can outperform the broken business-as-usual market. But this shift won’t happen without ongoing consumer pressure on the financial sector. An influx of motivated women into this space presents an excellent opportunity.  At Friends of the Earth we have been campaigning for fossil fuel divestment and corporate accountability for many years. Through our innovation work we are currently piloting a new peer-led programme for women who want to take control of their finances, but in a way that supports their vision for a safe and liveable planet.

"In my role as shadow minister for sustainable economics, I have spent the past year looking at what will be required of government to respond to the environmental calamity we are facing. It’s been pretty bleak, if I’m honest, as the deadly impacts scientists have long predicted have spiralled into a horror carousel of heatwaves and wildfires, floods and hurricanes, droughts and famines. For some the response is pessimism, fatalism and paralysis. In Dune, the main character declares: “The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.” With so little progress on climate, it’s little wonder we so fear what lies ahead. But two big rays of sunshine have broken through the clouds in recent months, dispelling the gloom and instilling a sense of renewed hope.  The youth strikers arrived on the climate politics scene in February like gatecrashers at a premature funeral, smashing in through the window in a shower of glass to announce to the hushed congregation that the patient is in fact still alive. Seeing these kids thronging the streets of Westminster and my own city of Norwich has been a thrilling and timely reminder of how real change happens. Meanwhile, the newly minted superstar congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the youth-led Sunrise Movement have busted open the tired assumptions of a hollowed-out US political system to demand good jobs and a liveable future, under the banner of a Green New Deal.  Friday’s declaration from the UK youth climate strikers calling for a Green New Deal in the UK brings these two strands together, and marks a shift from the oppositional to the propositional for the youth strikers. It is now up to all British politicians to heed their call. The time for incrementalism has passed. The young people striking today recognise this. They know that their only hope of a decent future is if government works with the people to throw everything we have got at this problem before it’s too late. But they also have the vision to see that the life-saving work of tackling climate change offers a golden chance to fix so many of the other things in our society and economy that decades of neoliberal dogma have broken. The youth strikers are calling for a government-led, 10-year mobilisation to completely modernise every aspect of our infrastructure and built environment, to reshape the public realm, restore threatened habitats and carbon sinks and prepare communities for the climate impacts we can no longer avoid. This epic transformation would create millions of good jobs across every corner of Britain, breathing new life into places that haven’t seen inward investment for decades. YouGov polling data released on Friday shows that these proposals are highly popular, enjoying more than two-thirds public support. People in Britain might not have heard of a Green New Deal yet, but they seem to really love the idea of it when they understand what it would mean in practice. Maybe Labour still isn’t entirely where it needs to be on this issue – but, with my encouragement, we are getting there fast. While the Conservatives dither, Jeremy Corbyn has committed to achieving net-zero emissions in the UK before the middle of the century. My boss, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is rewriting the Treasury rulebook to ensure all future public investment is green, and is looking at moving Britain towards a four-day working week, which could improve lives and reduce pressure on the environment. The Treasury under Labour would become the driver of positive environmental policy instead of a block in the system, working with each secretary of state to develop a departmental carbon budget alongside a financial budget at each spending review. Last month, the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, declared a climate and environment emergency in parliament, and the shadow business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has announced plans for a green industrial revolution that would see the UK lead the world in tidal energy, recapture our crown in offshore wind and recruit a carbon army of local workers to insulate millions of leaky homes. For those who say we can’t afford to do this, I say we can’t afford not to. Dealing with the horrors of unmitigated climate change will be incalculably more costly than intervening now to prevent them. It requires a massive public investment, but that would pay for itself many times over in the years ahead through the good quality work it would create. There are huge economic opportunities in renewable technologies and energy efficiency that are currently passing Britain by as a blinkered Tory government looks the other way. Money supply is quite literally the least of our worries. As Keynes said: “Anything we can actually do we can afford.” As the UK’s youth climate strikers geared up for their action on Friday, Theresa May was refusing to even meet the Nobel peace prize-nominee Greta Thunberg when she visits parliament later this month. My message to Thunberg and all of her British counterparts is simple: the Labour party’s door is open. We hear you, and we will work with you to do what needs to be done. • Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South"

"The US Senate defeated a motion to take up the Green New Deal, the non-binding proposal spearheaded by progressive Democratic lawmakers to radically reduce greenhouse gases and try to lessen social inequity. Republican leaders in the Senate had scheduled Tuesday’s vote in an effort to turn the proposal into a wedge issue in the 2020 elections, hoping to force Democrats on the record about their support – or opposition – for a proposal that is popular among the Democratic base but has been criticized by many conservatives. Democrats called the efforts by the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell a “sham”, and 43 of them voted “present” rather than casting an up-or-down vote. Lawmakers ultimately voted 57-0 against the proposal. Three Democrats and independent senator Angus King of Maine ultimately joined all 53 Republicans in opposing the plan. The Green New Deal aims to virtually eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and calls for the US to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal. It also urges national healthcare coverage and job guarantees, high-quality education and affordable housing, as well as “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States” to be energy-efficient. The proposal has broad support among Democratic activists, and all six of the 2020 presidential contenders serving in the Senate have signed on as cosponsors, putting it at the forefront of the party’s sprawling primary race. Republicans say the plan would devastate the economy and lead to a huge tax increase. They call it more evidence of the creep of “socialism” in the Democratic party, along with “Medicare for All” and a sweeping elections reform package that would allow public financing of congressional campaigns. McConnell said the proposal “might sound like a neat idea in places like San Francisco or New York” but would result in communities across the country being “absolutely crushed”. He argued the deal would “kill off entire domestic industries” and eliminate millions of jobs. Donald Trump also weighed in against the plan, which the White House called “job crushing”. At a luncheon with Senate Republicans, Trump urged lawmakers to keep the Green New Deal alive as an issue to use against Democrats. Mike Lee, a Republican senator from Utah, called the Green New Deal “ridiculous” and displayed pictures of dinosaurs, cartoon characters and babies as he derided the plan. He said he was treating it “with the seriousness it deserves”. Democrats derided the GOP moves and said they carried their own political risk by mocking an issue – climate change – that a growing number of Americans care deeply about. Climate change, they said, is deadly serious, citing floods in the midwest, wildfires in the west and hurricanes in the south. “Climate change is not a joke,” said Ed Markey, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and the resolution’s lead Senate author. “Mocking it is shameful.” “The GOP’s climate delaying is costing us lives [and is] destroying communities,” congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the plan’s sponsor in the House, tweeted. The GOP’s climate delaying is costing us lives + destroying communities.Iowa, Nebraska & many in the Midwest are catastrophically flooded right now, in one of the 1st major climate change disasters of 2019.A #GreenNewDeal urges us to pursue a plan on the scale of the problem. https://t.co/dWXe44hxWX  Ocasio-Cortez also said she had encouraged fellow Democrats to vote present, and questioned Republicans’ reluctance to schedule major hearings on the effects of climate change. Separately, speaking at a hearing of the House financial services committee on Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez sharply criticized the suggestion that concerns about the environment were “elitist” and condemned past inaction. “You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist? Tell that to the kids of the South Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates of child asthma in the country,” she said. “This is about our lives, and this should not be partisan,” she added. “Science should not be partisan.” By Tuesday evening, the clip of her comments had been shared thousands of times. Watch every second of this... @AOC is so incredibly spot on. pic.twitter.com/ESP4dC5TTo The New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of a half-dozen senators seeking the Democratic nomination for president, said Republicans treat climate change “as a game” and said Democrats “will not fall for this stunt”. Slowing climate change “should be our nation’s moonshot” in the 21st century, Gillibrand argued. “We don’t know if we can get to net-zero carbon emissions in 10 years, but why not try?” she said at a rally before the Senate vote."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother “abnormal” baby is born.
Heike M. was born this morning at St. Peters hospital and weighed in at 3850 grams and was 57 cm long. Doctors said that she was heavier and longer than normal. The normal weight for a baby girl in Germany is 3250 grams and 51 cm long. Though bigger than normal babies can occur, their increasing frequency is a sign that size at birth is going up, experts say. If the trends continue, babies will outweigh their mothers by the year 3700.  
Also Heike’s hair was more reddish than normal, and not the blond we used to see more often, say 100 years ago. Moreover, Heike’s skin colour was too pale. Though German babies tend to be on the pale side, it is abnormal for a baby to be as pale as Heike. The last baby that was that pale was 2 and half years ago. Doctors report that St. Peters hospital has not seen a normal baby in about 15 years.
Last week Sven was born. He weighed in at 2850 grams and was 49 cm long. Doctors said that although smaller babies are not unusual, and will also occur in the future, Sven’s smaller size, they say, is attributable to “natural variability”. Mothers, they say, will however have to fear oversized abnormal babies in the future.
Maybe some readers by now are wondering what all this is supposed to mean. I’m merely using this baby example to demonstrate the absurdity of taking the statistic of a single random event and attaching too much significance to its deviation from the mean. This unfortunately has become standard practice in weather analysis and climate.

At the end of each month in weather, the statistics get tallied up and compared to a 30-year mean that is arbitrarily chosen. Nowadays if there is a single weather deviation from the mean, we are told that something is wrong and that something significant is happening. But as the above baby example shows, this is a ridiculous practice and we need to get away from it.
The German Weather Service (DWD) just released its statistics for March, 2012 (for Germany) and they tell us that the month was “too warm, too sunny, and too dry”, i.e. that once again the month was not normal. It appears that the German Weather Service, and especially the media, have forgotten that weather is never normal.
Indeed things are getting so bad that the media and desperate warmists are now fretting over half months, or even claiming that single weather events are climatically significant. It seems that deviations are no longer supposed to occur. More often than not we now hear in Germany claims like: “The first half of this month was 4°C warmer than normal”, or “the last 10 days of this month were the wettest in 33 years”, or “the winds in Hamburg in yesterday’s storm were the strongest in 6 years.” The public is supposed to believe that something is wrong with every deviation that occurs in a chaotic system.
We have to return back to reality and remember that with weather, anomaly is normal, and normal is anomaly. Weather anomalies are not climate trends. Anyone claiming otherwise is either a charlatan or a plain fool.
Note: The above baby characteristic statistics are arbitrary and selected only for the purpose of demonstrating a point. I don’t know what an average baby is.

"It is written into celebrity lore that the reason the boyband Blue never made it in the US isn’t because it looked as if the smouldering line-up of Lee Ryan, Duncan James and Simon Webbe were being forced to hang out with Antony Costa because their mums were all friends with his mum. The real reason is quite different: in the wake of the 9/11 attacks – in a let’s-break-America-with-our-wholesome-brand-of-banter interview – Ryan went off-piste and said: “This New York thing is being blown out of proportion. What about whales? They are ignoring animals that are more important. Animals need saving and that’s more important.” And lo: record contract revoked, tail-between-their-legs flight back to Britain, now the fragmented shards of Blue are the face of the home improvement company Ideal Boilers. Before we analyse whether Ryan was right all along and might be an underappreciated intellect-cum-soothsayer (whales are important! He’s right!) (But! With! Caveats!), I want to visit this quote from Grimes, the poptronica, Pitchfork-approved musician who granted a rare interview to the Wall Street Journal this week. “I want to make climate change fun,” she said, describing the theme of her upcoming concept album, Miss Anthropocene. “People don’t care about it, because we’re being guilted. I see the polar bear and want to kill myself. No one wants to look at it, you know? I want to make a reason to look at it. I want to make it beautiful.” Now read Ryan’s one about whales, then Grimes’s bit about the polar bears again. Oscillate between them. Here is my theory: this is the same quote, tumbled out of different mouths.  Yes, Grimes is back, and – as she insists to the WSJ – she wants to be known as c now (lower-case artist’s own, italics artist’s own). Grimes is a curious beast because she spent almost a decade in the indie pop backwaters – very much beloved by, how to say this, “men who wear glasses and make playlists for a hobby”, but not exactly known by anyone outside those one-craft-beer-then-home circles. Then, last year, she went to the Met Gala with Elon Musk – a billionaire whose legacy is either going to be “the guy who ended death” or “that guy who tried to eat the moon” – and now she and he have broken through into power couple mainstream. This seems to sit uneasily on c – how do you enter a legitimate album cycle when your career to date has been eclipsed by Azealia Banks calling you a “brittleboned meth-head” who “smells like a roll of nickels”? How can anyone take you seriously as an artist when your fanbase has recently been flooded with the sort of lads who write “Pickle Rick” under their religious beliefs section on application forms? The strategy so far seems to be: “affect the demeanour of a 2003-era MSN Messenger status come to life”. This is how we end up, here, with c earnestly suggesting we recast climate change as banter, something I can only imagine ends in doom for us all. Further highlights: c says the album’s central beautiful love song was inspired by watching the trailer for the movie Assassin’s Creed (36%, Rotten Tomatoes); that the interstitial persona of c is part of the world-building central to her career, like JRR Tolkien or George RR Martin (Game of Thrones, of course, very famously lenient on new-world kings who hoard excessive wealth – and they rarely get stabbed to death or get poisoned or go mad at all); the sheer m’ladyness of Musk’s emailed quote about his girlfriend, sent to the WSJ: “I love c’s wild fae artistic creativity and hyper intense work ethic.” At times it feels as if the Wall Street Journal gave up interviewing Grimes and instead talked to the nearest goth girl they could find smoking on a low wall behind some school tennis courts, wearing spidery fingerless gloves and lamenting the low grade they got at AS-level art. Finally, c hints at her nascent plans to murder the alter ego of Grimes in some extravagant way in the not too distant future. “It will be a public execution,” she says coyly, “followed by – by something else. I shouldn’t say yet.” What? Blow back so hard she explodes? A Doritos-and-watching-Queen-of-the-Damned-on-DVD session that lasts so long everyone involved expires? Absinthe overdose? It’s hard to know what the most AOL chat room-goth way of executing someone is, but be assured c will find it. Until then, and until climate change inevitably becomes fun, remember this: Grimes is just what would happen if Lee Ryan had access to a billionaire. A shuddering thought. Something has gone wrong with the ancient glowing runes buried deep beneath the moors that tell of who gets to be a celebrity. They’ve stopped spitting out the explain-it-to-the-camera irony-free Towie B-team and one-cap England footballers who pivot into entertainment after doing in their knee at 29. Now they have decided that our latest celebrity is to be Harry Redknapp, who absolutely does not want this and it shows. To recap: last year, former football manager Redknapp went on I’m a Celebrity, where he basically sat around looking deflated in a vest, talked endlessly about his wife, and refused to eat any food. Inexplicably, he won because of it. Harry’s time in the jungle was typified by 20-year-old Hollyoaks actors saying, without any provocation, “You’re a legend, mate” before then teaching him to rap as a joke. Now – and, again, this is unasked for by everyone, including the British public and, most especially, Redknapp himself – now, for some reason, this is being spun out into a fifth career: player, manager, pundit, dog accountant and reluctant celebrity. As every nascent flavour-of-the-weekend celebrity knows, you need an ITV reality show to launch from. Enter Harry’s Heroes: The Full English, a show seemingly commissioned from the inside of a turbulent Farage wet dream, where a dozen or so retired England internationals compete with each other over 12 weeks to lose their middle-age spread before a gala testimonial game in which they will stick it to the Germans. You can marvel at David Seaman softly chuckling about everything; Neil Ruddock starring in an insane GoPro-shot montage of him partying on a cruise ship before a flash-cut of him, in a doctor’s office, being told solemnly: “Razor, you’re due for a heart attack”; Paul Merson sobbing in a taxi; Robbie Fowler’s Puerto Banús hangover. And … a dearth of Harry Redknapp. Despite Redknapp as the hook, he basically spends the entire show trundling into or out of shot, trailed by carry-on luggage. At the meet-the-gang training session, he hands over weigh-in duty to a tank of a personal trainer, then goes outside and quietly banters with John Barnes about a knee injury. At the show’s centrepiece Spanish getaway, Redknapp turns up a full day late because he took his wife’s passport to the airport, in a move I cannot quite discount as being deliberate. Before the win-or-we-haven’t-got-a-show Germany game, he assembles everyone on the subs bench then gets someone else to read out how much weight they have lost (Matt Le Tissier dropped 10kg. Redknapp: “[extremely long, tired pause] … Well done”). His pep talk amounts to “Stick it to ’em, boys”, before turning away from the camera and rubbing his nose. The most effort he puts in is a scene where he meets ‘Razor’ Ruddock in a cafe to tell him he is going to die if he doesn’t lose weight, but did so in front of an irresistible poster shouting “ICE-CREAM MILKSHAKES”. The voiceover: structurally extensive, delivered with the all the elan of a great-aunt in a Harvester restaurant reading out the menu through some bifocals. The adverts: inexplicably all starring Redknapp, including a GoDaddy bit where he bakes jam roly-poly. I do not want to imagine the wastelands of this country, post-Brexit, where the only celebrity we are allowed is Redknapp – reluctantly attending prosecco-and-nibbles makeup launches in a sequined suit, hammering into the water from 10 metres in an ill-fated reboot of Splash! Or Redknapp bewildered on the panel of Celebrity Juice. And I don’t think he does either. Give the man a break. Stop making him famous. He doesn’t want it."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany the news from the NOAA that the Barrow, Alaska station has recorded a CO2 concentration at 400 ppm “for the first time” is sweeping through the media – along with fresh warnings of impending climate doom.

“The northern sites in our monitoring network tell us what is coming soon to the globe as a whole,” said Pieter Tans , an atmospheric scientist with NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) in Boulder, Colo. “We will likely see global average CO2 concentrations reach 400 ppm about 2016.”
Average global levels of CO2 were 390.4 ppm in 2011, according to NOAA measurements.
The NOAA press release also writes that the concentration of the greenhouse gas has increased every year since 1959. “In the early 1960s, it rose about 0.7 ppm per year. For the last decade, it has been rising at about 2 ppm per year. That observed increase, independent of the seasonal ups and downs described above, is due to the accelerating pace of emissions from human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels.”

What impact has that had on temperature over the last decade?
Spiegel online tells us:
The data, however, have not shown any warming  for 13 years.
At the same time the question of whther the CO2 increase will warm the climate is still always disputed. The strength of the warming depends mostly on how much water evaporates; water vapour enhances the greenhouse effect considerably more than CO2. Estimates on the water vapour effect diverge greatly. Thousands of scientists are working on that question.
Global temperatures just aren’t listening to the climate models. And so much for consensus.

"The problems caused by apparent overabundance of cow faeces (Turd world: how poo is mucking up the environment, 25 March) are at least partly in the control of the farmers, who feed a broadband insecticide (Dimilin) to their cows. The purpose is to stop flies and beetles from feeding in the dung and thus breaking it down, a crucial step in the removal of the dung. Flies and beetles are thus no more a problem in intensive rearing units. Dimilin can remain active in the dung for a month or more, so when the dung is disposed of, it is still not possible for an insect (or many other species of arthropod) to survive or breed in it. Dimilin then becomes an added pollutant of run-off and water courses.  Its action is to disrupt the formation of a primary component (chitin) of the insect’s skin or shell. So the shell is never formed properly and breaks very easily, usually when the insect is expanding into its new shell after moulting. It can also affect the insect’s gut lining. I did some of the early work on Dimilin.Julian VincentBath • David Cox says we need a systemic approach to the disposal of farm animal dung, but that the most obvious use in fertilising land faces real obstacles. These could, however, be avoided if dung were fermented instead of decomposed. The right kind of fermentation (homolactic) kills bacteria so effectively that it even stops itself, producing a kind of pathogen-free preserve. When exposed to air, this becomes a harmless and attractive food for soil creatures, retains all of its original energy, carbon and nutrients, and smells sour rather than disgusting. It would make a perfect substitute for muck-spreading. The preserving process takes just a few weeks, as does the feeding frenzy in soil. In America, you can buy household fermentation for pet poo. Scaling up to farming is a huge undertaking but is surely doable. Environment departments everywhere, take note. Humans can use this, too. Hygienic dry toilets instead of sewage, anyone?Malcolm FowlesReading, Berkshire • I notice you have not included the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from ruminants, or the huge agricultural acreages that meat production requires. Given the last UN report on global warming, it is surely the time to start taking serious action. A tax on meat and eggs would reduce the demand for meat, encourage veganism, and reduce the problems of poo, greenhouse gas emissions and inefficient use of agricultural land. The tax could partly be used to subsidise independent butchers, and assist them to find other business opportunities. Farmers could also be helped to move towards greater crop production for human consumption. As schoolchildren are telling us, time is running out for them, and it is time we started to take action. The dairy industry is probably too complicated for any change, but our lives will have to change in so many ways if we really want to stop global warming.Philip StringerLewisham, London • It’s fair that your article should highlight the potential issues with conversion of animal poo into energy using anaerobic digestion (AD). Judging by the increasing number of UK companies seeking business angel funding in this area, I am pleased to say that market activity is strong. Many of the innovations pitched to us attempt to radically reduce a farm’s storage and operational footprint, in a move to so-called “micro AD”. The problems you outline are crucial, but business angels are helping many startup companies invest to resolve them.Cam RossDirector, Green Angel Syndicate • Peter Duckers (Letters, 26 March) is only 129 years late in suggesting the House of Commons as a receptacle for cow poo. William Morris got there first in News from Nowhere, his fantasy of a future socialist society: “Use them [Houses of Parliament]! Well, yes, they are used for a sort of subsidiary market, and a storage place for manure, and they are handy for that, being on the water-side.”Frank JacksonHarlow, Essex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’ve been hearing stories that the UK government may have put the lives of its citizens at risk by keeping a forecast of cold winter secret from the public in a cynical attempt to mislead them. 
If this is true, then this government has squandered its public trust and is not fit to serve its citizens. Who needs a government that deceives the people it is entrusted to serve?
Benny Peiser has assembled 19 questions for the Government to answer, see his press release here.
 Here is Dr. Peiser’s letter to Louise Ellman, MP and Chair, Transport Select Committee:
————————————————————————–
Louise Ellman, MP
Chair, Transport Select Committee
House of Commons
London SW1A 0AA
5 January 2011
Dear Mrs Ellman
Transport System’s Winter Fiasco
I am writing to you on behalf of the Global Warming Policy Foundation regarding the transport system’s ill-preparedness in face of this year’s record cold winter.
The GWPF is calling on the Transport Committee to set up a parliamentary inquiry into the winter advice the Government received by the Met Office and the renewed failure of both the Government and local authorities to prepare the UK transport system for the third severe winter in a row.
This year’s winter fiasco has severely damaged the British economy – and its international reputation – as a result of the country’s ill-preparedness.
It would appear that the Met Office provided the government with contradictory winter advice and we need to find out what went wrong. Lessons have to be learned well in advance of the start of next year’s winter so that we are much better prepared if it is severe again.
Last summer, the Department of Transport carried out a study of the resilience of Britain’s transport infrastructure in the light of the two previous severe winters.
When the Quarmby Report (The Resilience of England’s Transport Systems in Winter) was published in late October, it entirely relied on the Met Office’s assurance that the chance of a severe winter and heavy snow would be relatively small and that the effect of climate change had further reduced the probability of severe winters in the UK; see also Transport chaos not an annual issue, say official report. Investment in more equipment may not be economical given rarity of British snow, says RAC Foundation chairman <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/dec/21/transport-met-office>
In recent days, the Met Office has stated that it apparently changed its original advice in October and actually warned the Cabinet Office that the start of winter would be exceptionally cold. It would appear that the Met Office’s cold warning was kept secret from the public.
According to media reports, the Cabinet Office has been unwilling to confirm whether or not it failed to pass on the Met Office warning to local and road authorities, airports and water companies.
Not only is the lack of Government preparedness a cause for concern, but we wonder whether there may be another reason for keeping the cold warning under wraps, a motive that the Met Office and the Cabinet Office may have shared: Not to undermine the then forthcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun.
Throughout October and November, the Met Office repeatedly pushed and published their key message in the run-up to the UN climate summit – that 2010 would probably turn out to be the hottest year on record, culminating in these Cancun-timed media reports: Cancun climate change summit: 2010 was hottest year on record <http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/weather/8175591/Cancun-climate-change-summit-2010-was-hottest-year-on-record.html>
The Met Office was represented at the UN Climate Summit in Cancun by key scientists who briefed news media about their key message; see Scientific evidence is Met Office focus at Cancun <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2010/pr20101126b.html>
It will be important to establish whether the Met Office consulted with government officials about the UK’s Cancun strategy and what effect this may have had on the handling of the ‘secret’ cold winter warning.
The transport minister Philip Hammond has asked the government’s chief scientific adviser whether the last three cold winters may signal a ‘step change’ in weather in the UK.
The Met Office appears to deny this possibility. In its submission to the Quarmby Report, the Met Office claims that the chances of a harsh winter are receding steadily. Yet, the Met Office models were contradicted by Sir David King, the former government’s chief scientific adviser, who has publicly warned that the government should plan for more cold winters in the next few years.
It is evident that Sir David King has serious doubts about the reliability of the Met Office’s computer models. This manifest contradiction is further undermining the credibility of the Met Office which makes it all the more important to properly investigate the underlying problem of its erroneous winter projections and government advice over the last three years.
In light of the renewed failure to prepare the UK and its transport system for a prolonged and harsh winter, the following questions need to be addressed in order to avoid future debacles:

1. Why did the Met Office publish on its website estimates in late October showing a 60 per cent to 80 per cent chance of warmer-than-average temperatures this winter? What was the scientific basis of this probabilistic estimate?
2. Why did the Met Office provide the government with a secret forecast about a exceptionally cold start of the winter, at the same time it was publishing an opposite forecast to the public?
3. Did the government conspire to keep the Met Office forecast secret in the run-up to the Cancun climate summit?
4. Did the Cabinet Office fail to take appropriate action in response to the forecast and inform the relevant authorities to prepare the country, to keep the highways clear, to prepare airports?
5. Why did the government let its Winter Fuel Allowance budget be used up with only a fraction of the winter gone?
6. On what scientific basis did the Met Office tell the Cabinet Office that there were early indications of an exceptionally cold start to winter?
7. Why did the Met Office confirm to the news media on 27 October that its probability map showed significant warming in the months ahead?
8. Has the late October prediction by the Met Office that this winter would be mild affected planning for this winter? If so, what is the best estimate of how much this has cost the country?
9. In 2009, the Met Office predicted a 65% chance that the winter of 2009/10 would be milder than normal. Has the Met Office subsequently explained what went wrong with its computer modelling?
10. What is the statistical and scientific basis for the Met Office’s estimate of a 1-in-20 chance of a severe winter?
11. Has the Met Office changed its view, or its calculations, following the harsh winters of 2008, 2009 and 2010?
12. Is the Met Office right to be confident that the severe winters of the last three years are not related?
13. Which severe weather alerts were issued by the Met Office and when?
14. Although the Met Office stopped sending its 3-month forecasts to the media, it would appear that this service is still available to paying customers, the Government and Local Authorities for winter planning. What was their advice, in September/October, for the start of winter 2010?
15. Has the Met Office been the subject of any complaints from its paying customers regarding the quality of its advice?
16. Is it appropriate that the chairman of the Met Office is a member, or a former member of climate pressure groups or carbon trading groups?
17. Should senior Met Office staff (technically employed by the MoD) make public comments advocating political action they see necessary to tackle climate change?
18. Has the government evaluated different meteorological service providers and has it ensured that it is using the most accurate forecaster?
19. What plans has the government to privatise the Met Office?
In view of the high level of public interest in this matter, we shall be releasing the text of this letter to the press. I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Dr Benny Peiser

"When measures designed to curb climate change have a beneficial effect and result in a greener planet, it is cheering. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been on a relentless upward trend but things would be far worse if countries in the northern hemisphere were not planting forests and restoring natural habitats. Measurements taken over 60 years of the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the growing season show that, north of the equator, plants are absorbing more carbon than they used to.  This is not enough to halt global warming but it is at least slowing it down. The increase in uptake became apparent in the 1990s but has again grown significantly since the turn of the century. Sadly, this has not been replicated in the southern hemisphere, where many tropical forests are still being destroyed at an alarming rate. The figures from the north have surprised scientists, who had not anticipated this so-called carbon sink in their climate models. Some contributions are from the use of extra fertiliser in Asia, but the scientists believe that the main driver is the growth of young forests, particularly in China and North America, which is locking the carbon in young trees. It proves that planting trees and restoring forests works. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat do the intellectually challenged do when they’re out-matched in debate and fully exhausted of arguments?
You do what the University of Osnabrück has done: you prevent the opponent from entering the debating arena. You call it off and closed-mindedly insist you’re right.
Hat-tip: Die Achse Des Guten
This is what is happening today with the University of Osnabrück and Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, who had been invited by the university to give a speech on February 8.
It’s a vivid look into the cowardice of today’s German academia and it’s intellectual depletion.
The problem is that Vahrenholt has just written a controversial climate skeptical book (Die kalte Sonne) together with geologist Dr Sebastian Lüning – a book that is politically incorrect because it doubts the climate catastrophe fairy tale. The book is already near or at the number 1 position in Amazon.de bestseller list for environment and ecology books, and is thus causing the warmists to scurry in panic. The sense of alarm and fear that have gripped the climate establishment is so strong that the University of Osnabrück decided it would be improper to have Vahrenholt as a speaker.
Vahrenholt got his dis-invitation 2 days ago. Openly questioning the dogma of catastrophic global warming is not welcome. The University prefers to stay in the Dark Ages.
Here’s the public invitation:
In the series of presentations “University Speeches” of the University of Osnabrück, Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt – RWE Innogy, Essen will hold a speech titled “The Climate Catastrophe is not Taking Place”.
The IPCC is wrong. The climate debate has to be restarted. In contradiction to prognoses, there has been no global warming in over 10 years. Even with rising CO2 emissions the warming for this century will not exceed 2°C. The warming effect of CO2 is over-estimated. The latest findings show that ocean cycles and the sun, which recently entered a longer-term period of quite activity, has played a greater role in the course of climate than previously assumed.

Date: 08 February 2012
Time: 18.00 h
Location: Schlossaula (Osnabrück)”
Here is the incredible letter of cancellation:
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
When we invited Prof. Vahrenholt in May, 2011, it was done with regards to a very good speech he had given in Greifswald (Greifswald Speeches – a Foundation of the Alfried Krupp College Greifswald) on the topic of “Options for the Future Energy Supply of Germany”. This topic and the speaker also were accepted by the Osnabrück University Professorium.
When we invited him, we suggested this topic, which he did not object. When we asked him to provide us with the exact title of his speech 3 weeks before it was scheduled to take place, he surprised us with the provocative title ‘The Climate Catastrophe Is Not taking Place’. The reactions to this announcement range from positive to critical, and to negative. Independent of these reactions, we have become convinced that such an assertion requires ‘a counter speech’ from a climate scientist and that the subsequent discussion be led by a competent moderator. Because it is not possible to organize this before February 8, we will search another date in 2012, in agreement with Prof Vahrenholt and the 2 yet-to-be-named individuals. We will inform you on a timely basis.
Yours sincerely,
Prof. Dr. Karlheinz Altendorf
Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Asholt”
So unhindered, free dissent and questioning are unwelcome. Not believing that the world is on the road to catastrophe is “provocative”. Sorry, but this is the kind of insecure behaviour ones sees from dictatorial regimes. It’s intellectual insolvency.
Things really are that bad in Germany’s academia today – at least at the University of Osnabrück.
Two questions to professors Altendorf and Asholt: What are you afraid of? Does a movement steeped in fear and insecurity have any chance of victory? Your letter is as clear an admission one could get that the answer is “definitely no”.
Your decision is as about as remote as one can get from the true spirit of academia.

"Josh Frydenberg spent the first night of the election campaign defending the Coalition’s decision to approve the groundwater management plan for the Adani coalmine to a room of 600 voters in his electorate of Kooyong, where climate change has emerged as a key issue. Speaking at a candidates’ forum hosted by the local environment group Lighter Footprints at Hawthorn Arts Centre on Thursday night, Frydenberg said the project still had to pass nine more approvals after the environment minister, Melissa Price, granted the latest approval on Tuesday, of which he said the “most fundamental” were with the Queensland government. “In this case on the water issue, we took the advice of the CSIRO, of Geosciences Australia, and that is why it has gone to the next stage,” he said. Labor has indicated it may push for a review of the approval decision because the timing of the election announcement meant a planned estimates hearing where the CSIRO would explain the extent of its advice did not go ahead. The Adani coalmine is expected to cause difficulties for Frydenberg in Kooyong. Of the six candidates at the forum – also there were Labor’s Jana Stewart, the Greens’ Julian Burnside and the independents Oliver Yates, Bill Chandler and Angelina Zubac – he was the only one who did not criticise the project. About a quarter of the 260 questions submitted by the audience in the packed venue were about Adani. Yates, a former Liberal party member and chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, said the project had lost all social licence. “For a government that represents its people and for a member who represents this audience to be continuing to support a project that its electors in this area do not support is an extraordinary position for a local member to take,” he said. Burnside said suggestions that voters in Kooyong would vote solely on economic rather than environmental issues was “a mark of the contempt with which the Liberal party see this electorate”. “They can’t even imagine the possibility that this electorate would turf them out.” He dismissed concerns of sovereign risk over the Adani project as “a meaningless expression as a matter of law”. “I would say if there’s a contract which Adani could enforce I would hold to account those members of the outgoing Liberal government who signed the contract,” he said. Yates, Burnside and Chandler had the strongest support from the crowd. Stewart said she “personally [didn’t] agree with Adani” but that Labor would take a “balanced approach”, prompting Chandler to hop to his feet and step from side to side, saying: “This is Labor jumping from one foot to another on Adani, they keep moving on it all the time.” At a separate climate change forum in Mildura, the Nationals candidate for the western Victorian seat of Mallee, Anne Webster, engaged in some heavy product differentiation from her Queensland party colleagues. “The only people I’m beholden to are the voters of the Mallee electorate,” she said. “Some of you possibly thought I would come tonight and talk about climate change not being real … I want to assure you that I make up my own mind, have my own opinions and I’m not afraid to stand up to others.” While four independent candidates at the forum emphatically panned the Adani project, Webster said: “Renewables ought to be our focus.” She said she would not be afraid to cross the floor of parliament on a range of issues. Webster is seeking to continue the Nationals’ hold over the seat after it was vacated by Andrew Broad following allegations of inappropriate conduct during an official government trip overseas. The forum was divided on whether there needed to be a federal royal commission into the Murray-Darling basin plan, with Webster and the independent Cecilia Moar, a former farmer, opposed, and the independents Jason Modica, Allen Ridgeway and Ray Kingston in support."
"The largest five stock market listed oil and gas companies spend nearly $200m (£153m) a year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change, according to a new report. Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil were the main companies leading the field in direct lobbying to push against a climate policy to tackle global warming, the report said. Increasingly they are using social media to successfully push their agenda to weaken and oppose any meaningful legislation to tackle global warming. In the run-up to the US midterm elections last year $2m was spent on targeted Facebook and Instagram ads by global oil giants and their industry bodies, promoting the benefits of increased fossil fuel production, according to the report published on Friday by InfluenceMap.  Separately, BP donated $13m to a campaign, also supported by Chevron, that successfully stopped a carbon tax in Washington state – $1m of which was spent on social media ads, the research shows. Edward Collins, the report’s author, analysed corporate spending on lobbying, briefing and advertising, and assessed what proportion was dedicated to climate issues. He said: “Oil majors’ climate branding sounds increasingly hollow and their credibility is on the line. They publicly support climate action while lobbying against binding policy. They advocate low-carbon solutions but such investments are dwarfed by spending on expanding their fossil fuel business.” After the Paris climate agreement in 2015 the large integrated oil and gas companies said they supported a price on carbon and formed groups like the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative which promote voluntary measures. But, the report states, there is a glaring gap between their words and their actions. The five publicly listed oil majors – ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP and Total – now spend about $195m a year on branding campaigns suggesting they support action against climate change. But the report said these campaigns were misleading the public about the extent of the oil companies’ actions because while publicly endorsing the need to act, they are massively increasing investment in a huge expansion of oil and gas extraction. In 2019 their spending will increase to $115bn, with just 3% of that directed at low carbon projects. Shell said in a statement: “We firmly reject the premise of this report. We are very clear about our support for the Paris agreement, and the steps that we are taking to help meet society’s needs for more and cleaner energy. “We make no apology for talking to policymakers and regulators around the world to make our voice heard on crucial topics such as climate change and how to address it.” Chevron said it disagreed with the report’s findings. “Chevron is taking prudent, cost-effective actions and is committed to working with policymakers to design balanced and transparent greenhouse gas emissions reductions policies that address environmental goals and ensure consumers have access to affordable, reliable and ever cleaner energy.” The successful lobbying and direct opposition to policy measures to tackle global warming have hindered governments globally in their efforts to implement policies after the Paris agreement to meet climate targets and keep warming below 1.5C."

By Ed Caryl
We know, from ice measurements, measurements at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, Barrow Alaska, and the South Pole, that atmospheric carbon dioxide has been increasing in our atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial age. We also know that temperatures have been increasing in that same time interval, as the earth warms up from the “Little Ice Age.” The proponents of the theory that man’s production of CO2 has resulted in this temperature increase, use that idea to predict future temperature increases based on our continuing to use fossil fuels and continuing to force an increase in atmospheric CO2. But, is the increase in CO2 due to man; or is the increase in CO2 natural, due to rising temperatures caused by natural means?
The natural CO2 flux to and from oceans and land plants amounts to approximately 210 gigatons of carbon annually. Man currently causes about 8 gigatons of carbon to be injected into the atmosphere, about 4% of the natural annual flux. There are estimates that about half of man’s emissions are taken up by nature. But is that true? Are there variations in the natural flux? Could those explain the CO2 increase?

Figure 1: From NOAA and the IPCC, here.
In June, 2011, Dr. Murry Salby gave a presentation at a IUGG meeting in Melbourne, Australia. This presentation was mentioned later on Judith Curry’s blog, and some others. DirkH brought this presentation to my attention recently in comments on NTZ, and I tracked down the YouTube version. In that presentation, Dr. Salby plotted the changes in CO2 and changes in global temperature and soil moisture. The soil moisture data is behind a paywall, but the monthly global temperature and sea surface temperature sets are easily and freely available from WoodForTrees. The annual carbon fossil carbon release figures are also available, covering nearly the same period as the Mauna Loa CO2 numbers.
The differential changes in CO2 are calculated on a two-year centered average of the monthly figures, then taking the monthly differential on that average. This gives a somewhat smoothed number, removing the annual cycles, yet preserving the timing.

Figure 2: Monthly change in CO2 at three measuring stations.

Figure 3: Magnified view of Figure 2.
Figure 3 is a magnified view of Figure 2, the interval from 1990 to 2000, showing the effect of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in June 1992 and the El Niños of 1995 and 1998. The sharp cooling from the volcanic eruption appears before June 1992 because of the centered averaging to remove the noise and the annual variation.
Changes in CO2 seem muted at the South Pole, and the Barrow station is noisy as well as having a somewhat short record. Effects at the equator appear delayed at the stations closer to the poles. For those reasons, we will use the Mauna Loa record. It seems evident from Figures 2 and 3 that temperature influences CO2. But is it the global land and ocean temperature, or just the sea-surface temperature that is most important? Figure 4 is a plot of global surface temperature and monthly CO2 change:

Figure 4: Global surface temperature and monthly CO2 change.
The plots in Figure 4 look very similar; the question is how similar?

Here is the scatter diagram:

Figure 5: Scatter diagram of the data in Figure 4. Note the R2 value is 0.47636.
Here is the same comparison using sea surface temperature (HADSST2).

Figure 6: Plot of the monthly sea surface anomaly and monthly CO2 change.

Figure 7: Corresponding scatter plot showing an R2 value of 0.5528.
Sea surface temperature seems to be driving atmospheric CO2 changes. This makes sense because CO2 solubility in seawater is temperature dependent.
But what of man’s CO2 additions to the atmosphere? The data for carbon release is annual data, so the graphs are much coarser in appearance, and the change in CO2 must be annualized.

Figure 8: Annual change in fossil carbon use and the annual change in CO2.
 
Figure 9: Scatter diagram of carbon emissions change vs atmospheric CO2 change. Note that the R2 value is 0.05386, less than a tenth of the value of SST vs CO2.
It is ten times as likely that atmospheric CO2 is coming from natural sources, namely the warming ocean surface, as it is likely that it is coming from anthropogenic sources. The changes in CO2 track ocean surface temperature, not global carbon emissions. Burning fossil fuels is not increasing atmospheric CO2. Recovery from the Little Ice Age, driven by the sun, is causing the oceans to release CO2. It is temperature driving CO2 release, not the other way around. Just as it has always been.
As the sun gets quiet in the next few years, sea surface temperature will begin to fall, and the rise in CO2 will cease. If the sun stays quiet for 30 or 40 years, ocean surface temperatures will fall far enough to reverse the CO2 rise, the globe will enter a new little ice age, and things will get really interesting.

"Ryanair has become the first non-coal company to join Europe’s top 10 carbon emitters, according to EU figures. The Irish airline, which transports 130 million people a year, declared 9.9 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, up 6.9% on last year and 49% over the last five years, according to data in the EU’s latest emissions trading system registry. Andrew Murphy, the aviation manager at the European Federation for Transport and Environment, said: “When it comes to climate, Ryanair is the new coal. This trend will only continue until Europe realises that this undertaxed and under-regulated sector needs to be brought into line, starting with a tax on kerosene and the introduction of mandates that force airlines to switch to zero-emission jet fuel.” Ryanair’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, dismissed climate change concerns as “complete and utter rubbish” in an interview two years ago. His airline is now ranked as Europe’s 10th worst emitter, after nine coal plants. Poland’s Bełchatów is the worst polluter, producing 38 megatonnes of planet-warming emissions annually. Coal emissions are falling, though, as Europe’s transition to cleaner energy continues. In stark contrast, emissions from airlines, which are exempted from fuel taxes and VAT on tickets, have soared by 26.3% since 2014, outpacing all other transport sectors. EasyJet was Europe’s next worst-performing airline, in 31st place on the list, after an 11% rise in emissions in 2018. It was followed by Lufthansa, Norwegian and British Airways, according to analysis of the EU data by the thinktank Sandbag and Transport and Environment. Aviation is responsible for about 3% of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions, but industry forecasts suggest this could rise by up to 700% by 2050 as the sector grows. Murphy described aviation as “Europe’s biggest climate failure”. Europe’s airlines pay about €800m (£680m) a year for their rights to pollute. But some studies suggest this sum is eclipsed by the €27bn they would have to stump up if their fuel tax and VAT exemptions were ended. Despite increased attention from policymakers, the sector receives up to 85% of its EU emissions trading allowances free, with Ryanair consequently saving €96.6m in 2018. Kevin Anderson, a professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, said: “Ryanair use new and efficient aircraft rammed to the rafters with passengers, illustrating how technology alone cannot reconcile aviation’s rocketing emissions with the Paris climate commitments. “If we genuinely care for our children’s futures, we need to drive down the demand for aviation. This will require stringent regulations focusing on frequent fliers rather than those taking the occasional trip.” A Ryanair spokesperson said: “Ryanair is Europe’s greenest and cleanest airline. Passengers travelling on Ryanair have the lowest CO2 emissions per km travelled than any other airline.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother of Germany’s leading dailies, DIE WELT, has a skeptical piece (for a change) on global warming – written by Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch. Read here. It starts:
The claim that man was causing global warming has long been said to be irrefutable. But this is contradicted by renown scientists but also by the latest data.”
My how the times have changed. Remember how just a few years ago the debate was over and the science was settled? Die Welt reminds us:
In the middle of the last decade, former UN Secretary Kofi Annan handed down the final verdict: ‘The few skeptics who are left and trying to sow the seeds of doubt should be seen for what they are: out of touch, depleted of arguments and washed up.’ Since then, much has changed“
But today, once written off skeptical scientists are now re-emerging. Maxeiner and Miersch write:
Svensmark, whose research in this field had long been ignored, is now causing people to change their minds. Those who are convinced of anthropogenic climate change have suddenly gotten much more careful. And those who kept their doubts hidden, have suddenly become braver.”
Take Professor Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning, for example. DIE WELT is just the latest major media outlet to put controversial, new skeptical book Die kalte Sonne in the public focus, following right on the heels of FOCUS magazine and DIE ZEIT. This early media attention is likely just a preview of what is to come in the days and weeks ahead.
For many establishments this is all going to cause some major indigestion, like the University of Osanbrück, for example.  Maxeiner & Miersch write:

This politically correct field of science still has not gotten used to the new situation. When the University of Osnabrück found out that Vahrenholt wanted to speak about his book at his scheduled speech, he was promptly dis-invited. The reason: It was necessary to first organize a the counter-speech by a climate scientist.
Just one problem. One couldn’t be found.”
Maxeiner and Miersch should have mentioned that the University of Osnabrück also deemed skepticism of the climate catastrophe as “provocative”.
The book comes out next week. I’m quite excited about how the greenheads and alarmist kooks are going to react.
Chronic insistence of the “climate catastrophe” is not really normal
Normally the book ought to be good news. It’s a powerful argument that the climate catastrophe is not coming and that the science underpinning the theory of a coming climate catastrophe is pathetically weak, crappy, and so cannot be taken seriously at all.
But oddly, from a psychological point of view, the chronic alarmists appear obsessed with the end of the world, and actually seem to hope that it will come. And it’s as if it couldn’t come soon enough for them. If I were like that, I’d seek professional help and counseling. That’s just not healthy.
This reminds me of all the elite kooks now down in Antarctica claiming the ice there is melting faster than ever. Yet, the data shows the contrary – ice growth trending up over ther last 30 years!

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately desperate global warming-obsessed scientists have been claiming that the recent cold winters are more evidence of global warming. Cold is caused by warming, they now insist.

Source: www.woodfortrees.org/trend
Well, why stop at just the last few winters? Let’s look at the whole planet over the whole year, and do so for the last 10 years. Doing so, I’ve found solid proof of global warming!
The plotted anomaly goes from .47 to .38°C over 10 years. That’s a drop of 0.09°C, which translates to about 1°C of cooling per century. That means the year 2100 will be back to Little Ice Age conditions. The warming is worse than we thought.
Of course, crackpot warmists will say that 10 years is not enough, that is unless the trend is the other way. Heck, for them one single storm is already enough for proof, let alone a few winters.

"The charity running the Edinburgh international science festival is to ban sponsorship from oil companies including Shell and Total after protests by climate campaigners. Edinburgh Science said on Wednesday it realised its commitment to educating people on climate change was substantially compromised by accepting money from fossil fuel companies.  The charity said the oil industry “is not moving fast enough” to cut greenhouse gas emissions, adding that “climate change is without doubt an urgent threat of unprecedented magnitude”. Edinburgh Science has taken money from Total and Exxon to pay for its “Generation Science” tours of Scottish schools, promoting science as a career in classrooms, as well as from Shell and the Scottish Oil Club. Climate activists had warned Edinburgh Science it faced protests during this year’s festival, which starts this weekend. Protesters believe the festival does not do enough to educate visitors about the threats posed by climate change. The Scottish Oil Club was targeted by Extinction Rebellion activists last month when it held its annual dinner at the National Museum of Scotland, leading to 14 activists being charged. The Edinburgh international festival dropped BP as a sponsor in 2017. One science festival event for families this year involves teaching children how to find and drill for oil, inviting participants to construct a scale-model drilling rig. In contrast, this year’s Edinburgh medal for scientific achievement is being awarded as part of the festival to Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change. Edinburgh Science said: “With the issues of climate change ever present and urgent, we feel increasingly compromised by the conflict between accepting sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and programming events that scrutinise the main causes of climate change. “The UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) calls for a dramatic and immediate reduction in the amount of fossil fuels consumed if we are to keep global warming to no more than 1.5C. “Whilst we see change happening in the oil and gas sector and appreciate that the demands on them are complex, we are of the view that the sector is not moving fast enough to meet the IPCC targets and that there is a conflict between their behaviour and the underlying science.” Tara Wight, a spokeswoman for the campaign group Science Unstained, said the charity’s decision was welcome. “By being associated with science outreach events, fossil fuel companies aim to clean up their image and present themselves as responsible organisations that are in alignment with scientific consensus on climate change. “Sponsoring educational and cultural organisations is a cheap and effective means of improving their public image while continuing to destroy the earth.”"
"The UK will miss almost all the 2020 nature targets it signed up to a decade ago, according to a report by the government’s official advisers. The nation is failing to protect threatened species; end the degradation of land; reduce agricultural pollution; and increase funding for green schemes, the assessment concludes. It also says the UK is not ending unsustainable fishing; stopping the arrival of invasive alien species; nor raising public awareness of the importance of biodiversity.  The targets were set in 2010 by the global Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the report from the joint nature conservation committee (JNCC) found insufficient progress was being made on 14 of the 19 targets. The news came on the day Britain formally launched its bid to host the UN climate change conference in 2020, seeking to prove its green credentials are not tarnished and to show the disarray that has been caused by Brexit does not mean the UK has forfeited its right to be a major international player. Speaking at a launch event for the bid in Downing Street, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said: “Britain has an exceptional record of hosting big international events, ranging from the G20 summit in 2009 to the London Olympics in 2012. “Most importantly of all, we are ambitious. If we are going to ensure that future generations do not pay a price for our prosperity today, we must collectively change our economies and societies. We believe this can be done and protecting the environment can go hand-in-hand with economic growth.” Hunt has not yet said if the UK bid will involve London as the venue. Critics of the government said the report showed wildlife and natural habitats were in deep crisis. The UK is “among the most nature-depleted countries in the world”, according to a separate 2016 report, with continuing declines in species such as skylarks, hedgehogs, many insects including butterflies and corn marigolds. “The JNCC report says nature in the UK is pretty bad, declining and not recovering, and that is in the context of an awful lot of rhetoric [from ministers] about being a world leader on the environment,” said Kate Jennings, the head of site conservation policy at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). “We are going to fail to meet the vast majority of our international commitments,” she said. “Some of the things presented as positive are where places are getting worse more slowly – if that’s the best achievement we’ve got, it’s a pretty sorry state of affairs.” The environment minister Thérèse Coffey said: “Nature matters. Our species and ecosystems are valued in their own right, but they also contribute to our wellbeing and economic prosperity. We acknowledge that in many areas there are ongoing declines in nature, but there are real points of progress on which we can build. Our 25 Year Environment Plan is a step-change in ambition.” A key CBD target is to improve the conservation status of threatened species but the report says “there have been widespread and significant ongoing declines across many species”, such as farmland birds and pollinating insects. Another of the 2020 targets is to cut the rate of loss and degradation of natural habitats to “close to zero”. While the report says some places have improved, there have been “ongoing losses of natural and semi-natural habitat, for example through neglect or development”. The target to cut fertiliser and other pollution to levels that do not harm biodiversity is being missed, the report says, with little reduction in sensitive habitats since 2010 and with 65% of inland and coastal waters remaining below target levels. Only about half of fish stocks are sustainably caught, the report says, meaning the target to end overfishing will be missed. The goal to prevent new invasive species entering the UK and harming wildlife, as the grey squirrel has, is also being missed. Despite strong action, the report says, the number of invasive species has increased in fresh and marine waters. The CBD targets also require that funding to support biodiversity should “increase substantially” but the report found a fall in government spend on biodiversity. Another goal is to eliminate subsidies that harm nature and increase those that boost it. But the report says: “The UK recognises some ongoing declines of woodland, farmland and marine biodiversity and some recent reductions in areas under agri-environment schemes.” The CBD targets also require the UK government to make the public aware of the value of biodiversity but the JNCC found “more than half of the UK public report no awareness of the threats to biodiversity … and there has been no significant increase since 2009”. “This report proves that behind the smoke and mirrors of [the environment secretary] Michael Gove’s press releases, photo opportunities and endless consultations, our natural world is in deep crisis,” said Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary. “This government doesn’t put its money where its mouth is when it comes to biodiversity.” The five targets the JNCC says are being met include implementing a national biodiversity action plan, improving scientific knowledge and integrating biodiversity values into planning processes. “The process box – not outcomes – is much easier to tick,” said Jennings. The JNCC also says the UK has exceeded the target of effectively conserving 17% of land and 10% of marine areas, with 28% of land and 24% of the sea now protected. But Jennings said the land total includes national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, which are not managed for biodiversity. In England, she said, only 8.5% of land was protected for wildlife, and only 40% of that was in good condition. “I’m not sure how anything not in favourable condition can be said to be effectively managed.” The CBD targets are not legally binding. “Embarrassment is the only enforcement mechanism,” Jennings said. Martin Harper, also of the RSPB, said: “After decades of fudged targets and false promises on the environment, it’s crucial that we secure binding targets in new national legislation, and a robust watchdog.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Die Welt reports here (surprise! surprise!) that huge costs will be coming due because of the needed extra electrical infrastructure for feeding in green power from offshore wind farms and solar panels into the existing power grid. The current power grid is far too inadequate and has to be massively expanded.
Europe’s target is to provide 20% of its energy with alternative energy by 2020. Germany wants to produce 80% of its energy through alternatives by 2050. These extra costs, says Die Welt, will be “huge”.
The EU wants to have consumers contribute to the cost of the green electrical power offensive. The expansion of the power grid is going to be really expensive.
The energy offensive dubbed Energy Action Plan 2020 by the European Commission, wants to involve all 27 member countries in paying the grid expansion costs. EU Energy Commissar Günther Oettinger says:
Bringing offshore power from the North Sea to Cologne or Stuttgart costs money that we have to pay. We only have God and the citizens, and God doesn’t pay.
In Europe when consumers are expected by politicians “to contribute”, it means of course paying all of it.

"A fresh wave of youth strikes for climate action will hit towns and cities across the UK on Friday, as a government report revealed that the nation is set to miss its emissions targets. More than 60 demonstrations involving tens of thousands of young people are expected from Parliament Square in London to sites in Leeds, Manchester and Brighton. They follow the global strike on 15 March, when more than 1 million young people across the world took action to demand rapid action to tackle the climate crisis.  The movement began when Swedish student Greta Thunberg started a solo school strike in August. The protests have been widely praised, although some have criticised the students for skipping school. On Friday, many UK students will already be on holiday. “Young people in the UK are sending those in power a clear message: we won’t accept anything less than urgent climate action,” said Anna Taylor, 18, from London and co-founder of the UK Student Climate Network. “Our futures, the health of our environment and the lives of those around the world already suffering the devastation of the climate crisis are not up for debate. We need [leaders] to act to protect people and planet.” On Wednesday, Green party MP Caroline Lucas challenged Theresa May to join the leaders of all the other major parties who have already agreed to meet Thunberg when she visits the UK on 23 April. Thunberg has already met UN secretary general António Guterres, the pope and addressed the Davos summit. The prime minister declined to say she would meet Thunberg, saying: “I often hear young people tell of the importance of climate change.” May added: “This government has a fine record on climate change.” However, a government report published on Thursday showed the UK is now set to miss its 2025 and 2030 emissions targets by an even larger margin than before. “Many policies which will affect the 2020s and beyond have not yet been developed to the point at which they can be included in these projections,” it said. “With our young people coming out on to the streets in record numbers calling for a structural change to tackle the climate crisis, the public will not forgive failure on this scale,” said Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary. Concern about climate change is higher than ever amongst UK students – 91% – according to a rolling opinion poll for the National Union of Students, which began in 2014. In Cambridge, several hundred school children plan to lie on the ground in a “die-in” protest to demand urgent action against climate change. They will wear blue to highlight the impacts of flooding and sea level rise on future generations and on the people of Mozambique and Zimbabwe who were hit by Cyclone Idai in March. Rowan Williams, former head of the Anglican church and master of Magdalene College at the University of Cambridge, will join the protest. “It’s a great sign of hope that so many of our young people are willing to stand up and be counted. This is their world, and our generation has come close to wrecking it,” he said. Ella Hone, at Chesterton Community College, said: “This Friday is my 12th birthday, so as a present I would like people to understand how important it is not only to me, but to everyone. Climate change is affecting all life on earth [and] we desperately need to stop it.” While the once-a-month strikes are expected to be large in the UK, Brazil, India and the Baltic nations on Friday, elsewhere weekly strikes have continued, particularly in Germany and Belgium. Luisa Neubauer, a youth striker from Hamburg, said 20,000 were expected to protest again on Friday. Neubauer has put the demands for climate action to Germany’s economy environment ministers. “We still don’t see that our government has understood what historical and global responsibility it carries,” she said. “So we really don’t have a choice but to keep going. For us young generations it’s an existential question.” Around the world, strikes are expected in 500 towns and cities in 70 countries on Friday, according to the Fridays for Future website. “These striking school children might not be able to vote yet, but they’re certainly changing the face and pace of the debate – this is exactly what we’ve all been waiting for,” said Helen Clarkson, CEO of The Climate Group, which has agreements from 200 multinational companies and 220 state and regional governments to take significant climate action. “For the last 20 to 30 years, the environmental movement has been waiting for the public to care about climate change,” she said. “[The young people] taking to the streets to protest, are bringing exactly the energy and urgency that is needed to transform the conversation.” Extinction Rebellion activists have said they will “shut down London” on Monday by blocking roads in the capital, as part of global protests by that movement."
"In the past few months I have started putting down roots. It’s a cliche but it’s literally what I’m doing. I spend my weekends transforming the tired old lawn into garden beds, layering woodchips, straw and horse shit I’ve shovelled from the paddocks next door into rich soil to grow my lettuces and kale. I have always loved gardening but now, more than ever, working with the earth has taken on an element of the spiritual. As a teenager, like many suburban white girls, I got way into Wicca, that gentle, nature-centred neo-pagan religion beloved by would-be witches everywhere. Much later, in my early 20s, I revisited witchcraft, finding an unstructured feminine spirituality that helped me make sense of the world.  Like many other young women I loved the playfulness of astrology and the tarot, but what always appealed to me most was the sense of communion with the natural world. Now, at a point of genuine global climate crisis, I am beginning to see how valuable fostering that connection can be. Women have long been associated with nature, usually to our detriment. An enduring, exasperating thorn in the side of feminism has been the persistent belief that women are inherently closer to the physical world, and to our animal bodies, than men, disqualifying us from our right to intellectual or cultural pursuits beyond the home. Simone de Beauvoir wrote about it when she described woman as being “more enslaved to the species than the male” thanks to the embodied reality of human reproduction; the anthropologist Sherry B Ortner wrote in 1974 that associating women with nature handily allows us to subjugate half of the world’s population, while asserting confidently that it is simply the natural way of things. It’s all rubbish, of course; as Ortner put it, all humans have a physical body and a sense of nonphysical mind. And, certainly, we can’t be bound to either by something as ephemeral as gender. But I think this correlation of women to nature, which has been oppressive and restrictive for so long, can now be a source of power and unity for women who are concerned – as we all should be – about the future of our natural environment. My favourite way to think of the witch is as a woman drawing strength from what ought to subdue her. When you think of it this way, a whole coven of earth witches emerges among the women of Australian agriculture. Much of what we associate with the figure of the witch concerns women’s knowledge of the natural world: plants for eating and healing, solstices for planting and harvesting, cycles of the world by which to set the cycles of the home. When I part the mulch to plant seedlings, or when I forage blackberries and wild brassica while I’m walking the dog, I feel a sense of connection to all the planting, farming and foraging women who’ve come before me. And though many of the farmers I’ve spoken to would probably balk at the idea of identifying as a witch, the term taps into a long lineage of women’s knowledge about the earth. Women in agriculture seem the most logical inheritors. Regenerative agriculture is a radical new approach that privileges soil health and holistic farming. In Australia many more women are involved in regenerative agricultural practices than are in traditional agriculture, which remains male-dominated. It can be tempting to attribute this unquestioningly to the notion that women are somehow inherently more in tune with nature but that’s neither accurate nor useful. The reality is that many farming women inordinately take on the role of childcare and food preparation – and this is what makes them experts in their field. They see the connections between earth and food and human health. Living those connections feels like the most conscious, everyday kind of witchcraft. It’s easy to dismiss this kind of thinking as kumbaya nonsense but that’s partly because the impulse is so ingrained in us to devalue anything associated with the feminine – in this case, something as objectively neutral and undeniably necessary as the Earth on which we stand. For a long time, just as we have associated women with nature, we have coded nature as feminine and, as we do with all other things coded feminine, we have degraded, exploited and subjugated it. But taking up the position of the witch – someone who values the feminine, and defiantly claims the knowledge and power of the bodily and natural – shows how to completely reimagine our relationship with the Earth and, hopefully, to change the future of all who live on it for the better. • Sam George-Allen is the author of Witches: What Women Do Together"
"Researchers have documented what they are describing as the most severe coral bleaching to hit the world’s southern-most reef at Lord Howe Island. Scientists from Newcastle University, James Cook University, the University of New South Wales and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have spent the past two weeks surveying corals around the island in the far south Pacific Ocean after they were alerted to bleaching in isolated areas. Bill Leggat, a coral biologist at Newcastle University, said the worst of the bleaching was in shallow water closer to the shoreline. “It’s quite variable but where it’s severe it is actually quite severe,” he said. “Some of the sites are looking at 80-90% bleaching going very close inshore.” Other reef sites the scientists surveyed showed bleaching levels of 50%, 30% and some areas with as little as 5% bleaching. Lord Howe Island was named a Unesco world heritage site in 1982. It is habitat for species that are found nowhere else on earth. The bleaching has occurred over the past summer, with March the peak month of the year for coral bleaching due to warmer ocean temperatures. Scientists have documented three bleaching events at Lord Howe Island in the past but it has been some years since it last occurred. Leggat said although the bleaching was isolated to shallow areas, for scientists to be documenting 90% bleaching in some parts signalled the latest event “is really quite severe”. “As far as we know it’s the most severe we’ve ever seen it on Lord Howe Island,” he said. “Our concern now is we’re going to start seeing coral mortality.” Leggat said some areas still remained healthy but researchers doing surveys last week could see the bleaching was progressing. They will return in April to conduct fresh surveys to assess whether it has caused coral mortality. While much of Australia’s focus on coral bleaching has been centred on the Great Barrier Reef, it is a worldwide occurrence due to climate change. “Reefs around the world are being affected everywhere,” Leggat said. “We’re starting to see beaching in sites where wouldn’t have previously expected to see it.”"

"A few weeks ago I came downstairs and discovered I had left the freezer door open overnight: what a pain. We had to eat up the mushy produce as quickly as possible and some of it ended up going to waste. But my tribulations were nothing compared to the problems that Canada jays are having with their freezers right now. As winter approaches Canada jays collect up all sorts of treats to see them through the winter – juicy beetles and centipedes, mushrooms, berries, little voles and mice. These tasty morsels are hidden throughout the forest and help to see them through the lean winter months. But new research, published this week in Royal Society Open Science, shows that Canada jays living at the southern edge of their range in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, are struggling. The data shows that over the last 40 years the number of winter freeze-thaw events has increased. It appears that this frequent defrosting of the jays’ winter larders is leaving the birds hungry and unable to bring up large broods the following spring.  Many other species also rely on sub-zero winters to keep their food supplies fresh. For all of them climate change is reducing their range and forcing them to keep moving polewards."
"I don’t expect much joy in writing about climate breakdown. On one side, there is grief and fear; on the other side, machines. I became an environmentalist because I love the living world, but I spend much of my life thinking about electricity, industrial processes and civil engineering. Technological change is essential, but to a natural historian it often feels cold and distancing. Today, however, I can write about something that thrills me: the most exciting field of research I have covered in years. Most climate scientists agree that it is now too late to prevent 1.5C or more of global heating only by cutting our production of greenhouse gases. Even if we reduced our emissions to zero tomorrow, we would probably overshoot this crucial temperature limit. To prevent a full-spectrum catastrophe, we need not only to decarbonise our economy in the shortest possible time, but also to draw down carbon dioxide that has already been released. But how? The best-known proposal is called bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). This means growing wood or straw in plantations, burning it in power stations to produce electricity, capturing the carbon dioxide from the exhaust gases and burying it in geological formations. Yet, if deployed at scale, it is likely to trigger either an ecological or a humanitarian disaster. One BECCS proposal, favoured by certain governments, would cover an area three times the size of India with plantations. This involves converting agricultural land, in which case BECCS would cause mass starvation, or converting wild land, in which case almost lifeless plantations would replace 50% of the world’s remaining natural forests. Even so, it might not be effective, as any carbon savings would be counteracted by the use of nitrogen fertiliser and the release of greenhouse gases from the soil as it’s churned up for planting. BECCS can lead only to catastrophe, and should be immediately abandoned. Another option is direct air capture: extracting carbon dioxide with machines. Aside from the expense, which is likely to be massive, the amount of steel and concrete required to build these machines could help to push the world beyond certain climate tipping points before the positive effects are felt. None of this is necessary, however, because there is a much better and cheaper way of drawing carbon from the air. Natural climate solutions do it through the restoration of living systems. The greatest potential identified so far – as so much land can be used this way – is in protecting and restoring natural forests and allowing native trees to repopulate deforested land. The greatest drawdown potential per hectare (though the total area is smaller) is the restoration of coastal habitats such as mangroves, salt marsh and seagrass beds. They stash carbon 40 times faster than tropical forests can. Peaty soils are also vital carbon stores. They are currently being oxidised by deforestation, drainage, drying, burning, farming and mining for gardening and fuel. Restoring peat, by blocking drainage channels and allowing natural vegetation to recover, can suck back much of what has been lost. These are the best-studied natural climate solutions. They could help to solve two existential problems at once: climate breakdown and ecological breakdown. Their likely contribution is enormous – bigger than almost anyone guessed a few years ago – and other possibilities have scarcely been explored. For example, we currently have little idea of what the impact of industrial fishing may be on the seabed’s vast carbon store. By disturbing the sediments and lifting the carbon they contain into the water column, trawlers and dredgers are likely to expose it to oxygen, turning it into carbon dioxide. One study suggests that repeated trawling in the north-west Mediterranean has caused a reduction in carbon storage in the top 10 centimetres of sediments of up to 52%. Given the vast area trawled every year (most of the seabed on the world’s continental shelves), the climate impact could be enormous. Closing large parts of the seas to trawling could turn out to be a crucial climate strategy. Scientists have only begun to explore how the recovery of certain animal populations could radically change the carbon balance. For instance, forest elephants and rhinos in Africa and Asia and tapirs in Brazil are natural foresters, maintaining and extending their habitats as they swallow the seeds of trees and spread them, sometimes across many miles, in their dung. White rhinos can play a major role in preventing runaway wildfires in African savannahs: their grazing prevents dry grass building up. If wolves were allowed to reach their natural populations in North America, one paper suggests, their suppression of herbivore populations would stop as much carbon being released every year as that produced by 30-70m cars. Healthy populations of predatory crabs and fish protect the carbon in salt marshes, as they prevent herbivorous crabs and snails wiping out the plants that hold the marshes together. What I love about natural climate solutions is that we should be doing all these things anyway. Instead of making painful choices and deploying miserable means to a desirable end, we can defend ourselves from disaster by enhancing our world of wonders. However, nothing should be done without the involvement and consent of indigenous people and other local communities. Nor should damaging projects, such as monocultural plantations, be passed off as natural climate solutions. As a paper published this week in Nature shows, several governments are attempting this deception. Today, a small group of us is launching a campaign for natural climate solutions to receive the commitment and funding they deserve. At the moment, though their potential is huge, they have been marginalised in favour of projects that may be worse than useless, but which are profitable for corporations. Governments discuss the climate crisis and the ecological crisis in separate meetings when both disasters could be addressed together. We have set up a dedicated website, produced an animation and written a letter to governments and international bodies signed by prominent activists, scientists and artists. We don’t want natural climate solutions to be used as a substitute for the rapid and comprehensive decarbonisation of our economies. The science tells us both are needed: the age of carbon offsets is over. But what this thrilling field of study shows is that protecting and rewilding the world’s living systems is not just an aesthetically pleasing thing to do. It is an essential survival strategy. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"The UK’s biggest teaching union is to decide whether to object to fossil fuel giant Ineos sponsoring the school Daily Mile initiative over allegations the company is using the event to greenwash its image. Campaigners accuse Ineos, owned by the UK’s richest man, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, of endangering the wellbeing of future generations through its fracking activities and plastics production.  On Saturday the executive of the National Education Union will debate a call for the schools to oppose Ineos’s sponsorship of the event, which sees tens of thousands of children take part in an outdoor run each week. The campaign is being supported by the UK Student Climate Network, which helped coordinate the recent school strikes that saw more than a million young people take part in demonstrations over the escalating global warming crisis. Anna Taylor, 18, co-founder of the group, said: “Climate criminals like Ineos, with their fracking for plastics agenda, are already destroying our environment and fuelling climate change for profit. “Allowing them unfettered access to classrooms and attempting to normalise their fossil fuels ‘extractivism’ with our generation is totally and utterly unacceptable and must be outlawed.” The Daily Mile is promoted as “a social physical activity, with children running or jogging – at their own pace – in the fresh air with friends”. But campaigners say its promotion of “fresh air and a healthy lifestyle” is at odds with the reality of Ineos’s operations. Two primary schools in Strensall and Copmanthorpe, York – both of which are within areas licensed for fracking – have withdrawn form the Daily Mile after the link was highlighted by local campaigners. Adrian Palmer, a parent from the Copmanthorpe school, said: “Our schools are unwittingly falling foul of these Ineos PR stunts as they don’t have time to research and make the connection between the Daily Mile and its controversial petrochemical fracking company backers … Having this Ineos PR in our schools is akin to a tobacco company sponsoring the school’s sports day.” An Ineos spokesperson said: “Ineos has supported the Daily Mile for many years and has seen this project grow from modest beginnings to a global success. We are proud of the role we have played in this growth and we intend to go on supporting the charity, which helps improve children’s health and wellbeing across the world.”"

"Last Saturday the Guardian started publishing the carbon dioxide (CO2) measurement from Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Far from big sources, this is an indicator for the whole northern hemisphere. Each day you will see the numbers change a little. Over the last year they varied between 404 and 415 parts per million (ppm). They were lowest in late summer due to plant photosynthesis and greatest in spring from emissions that accumulated during the winter. But compare year on year and you will see CO2 rising as emissions from our fossil fuel burning exceed what natural systems absorb. Globally, about 70% of CO2 emissions comes from cities. In leafy Egham, west of London, summer CO2 decreases by day due to plant photosynthesis and then plant respiration releases some of this at night. Along with emissions from fossil fuels, typical summer days show a variation of about 25ppm.   For nearly 10 years, scientists at King’s College London have been measuring CO2 right inside the city. Here, the daily changes from the plants are completely overwhelmed by emissions from traffic and building heating. Close to roads CO2 can reach 1,000ppm. These measurements will tell us if our vehicles and buildings are really becoming more fuel efficient."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFormer German Chancellor (1974-82) Helmut Schmidt of the center-left SPD Social Democrat party gave a speech at the Max Planck Society earlier this year, which in part was focused on “the responsibility of science and a personal word on the relationship between science and politics”. He also commented on the topic of global warming, see below.H/t: Benny Peiser, who starts with:
In a now disclosed Speech at the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has cast the integrity and credibility of the IPCC deeply into doubt and has called for an independent, scientific investigation of questionable practices.”
It goes without saying that the 92-year old chain-smoking Schmidt will say what is on his mind and couldn’t care less about any political retaliation or critique at this stage of his life, and so is free to speak openly. He starts by reminding us that the predictions made by Thomas Robert Malthus more than 200 years ago were false, and that many more people are being fed today than Malthus could have ever imagined.
Here it is clear that Schmidt’s focus is not on a climate that may occur in 100 years, but on today’s problems of over-crowded cities, sprawling urbanization and the threatof conflict if supply does not meet the needs. Schmidt also speaks about the challenges and “the total failure of bank supervision, supervisory boards, accountants, etc. with respect to the obscene practices of some banks, shadow banks, mortgage institutes and insurance companies.”
He then focuses on another challenge that mankind is claimed to be confronting: climate change. Schmidt says that the earth has gone through natural cycles of ice ages and warm periods, i.e. climate change is natural. He then says that nobody knows exactly what man’s contribution to warming really is, and then adds (emphasis added):
The documentation delivered so far by the international group of scientists (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) has been met with skepticism, particularly that some of the involved scientists have proven to be frauds. In any case the targets publically set by some of the governments have turned out to be less based on science. and based much more on politics. 
In my view it is time for one of our leading scientific elite organisations to take a hard critical and realistic look at the work of the IPCC, and thus explain in a clear manner the yielded conclusions to the public.”

I wonder if the scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)  are listening. Here Schmidt is clearly calling for a real, COMPETENT investigation by an independent expert body, and not a small group of corrupt hacks.
Schmidt points out that the development of new alternative energy is indeed a real challenge for science and research, as conventional supplies are not unlimited.
Here fundamental research is challenged to make regenerative energy sources as suitable alternatives.”
This statement is open to interpretation. Here he uses the adjective “suitable”. For me these energies first have to be made appropriate and reasonable for use. Committing economic suicide is not what I’d call “suitable”. More research on alternatives to make them affordable ? Yes! Forcing down half-baked expensive technologies with the false claim they are going to save the planet? No!
Schmidt also looks into the future and expresses his views on what to expect in the future:
–  there is not going to be an end to economic growth – technonological growth is unavoidable.
– there is not going to be any global food problems as growing crops and animals will continue to be successful, as gene technology will aid this.”
The full text of Schmidt’s speech can be found here (in German).

"The Greens will propose 2030 as the cut-off point for thermal coal exports, and the shutdown date for Australia’s fleet of coal-fired power stations, in the party’s new climate and energy policy heading into the federal election. With Labor expected to unveil the remaining elements of its climate policy before next week’s budget, the Greens will on Thursday open the bidding on ambition, laying down markers for the policy bartering that could play out after the federal election in the event Labor wins power and the Greens remain significant crossbench players.  The new Greens policy proposes the creation of a new public authority, Renew Australia, to lead the transition to low emissions, and a new government-owned energy retailer with a mandate to deliver cheaper power. The party is proposing to phase out thermal coal exports by setting a yearly limit on coal exports from 2020, a set of procedures that would require resources companies to secure permits at auction in order to export product. The Greens say Renew Australia will determine the timetable for shutting down the coal fleet, but the policy scenarios accompanying its policy puts the cut-off point at 2030. The policy also advocates for vehicle emissions standards “that lead up to a complete ban on new internal combustion vehicles by 2030”, and a 17% tax on “luxury fossil fuel cars” to help cover the costs of scrapping registration fees, import tariffs, GST and stamp duty on electric vehicles, “reducing the cost of electric vehicles by around 20%”. The Greens policy comes as the Investor Group on Climate Change will also on Thursday release a new policy document setting out what institutional investors such as the major super funds see as the climate policy priorities for the Australian and New Zealand governments between now and 2022. The IGCC says from an investor perspective, three areas require action over the next four years. The first is developing durable policies that will create a pathway to a net zero emissions economy. The second is creating structures that allow the transition to be managed, including implementing stable policy, “using public sector finance to crowd in private sector investment” and pursuing mechanisms that allow a just transition for workers and business in carbon-intensive industries. The third is implementing national climate change adaptation strategies and strengthening the governance regime, including mandating climate-related disclosure requirements for companies and investors. Reflecting the impatience now endemic in the business and regulatory community after a decade of rancorous partisan warfare on climate change, the IGCC warns that investors are currently “exposed to systemic, climate-related physical, transition and litigation risks” – a message that also echoes a recent intervention by a deputy governor of Australia’s central bank. Guy Debelle issued a stark warning in the middle of March that climate change poses risks to Australia’s financial stability, and he argued that warming needed to be thought of by policymakers and business as a trend and not a cyclical event. The IGCC says a carbon price – implemented by Labor during the time of the Gillard government, and repealed by Tony Abbott in 2013, and still the epicentre of the partisan war – needs to be reinstated. “Pricing carbon embeds climate risk into the lifeblood of investment decisions,” the group says. “If carbon is priced, the cost of pollution can’t be ignored. Development of a carbon market that is transparent, liquid – many participants and free flowing trade – and focused on achieving net zero emissions will enable investors to better anticipate and plan for future carbon risks”. Labor has already released its policy for reducing emissions in the electricity sector and in the first instance will attempt to persuade the Liberals to revive their now abandoned national energy guarantee in an effort to achieve some bipartisanship. If that fails, it will pursue other measures. Shortly, the opposition will unveil the rest of its climate change policy, expected to include a trading scheme for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year; new vehicle emissions standards to bring down pollution in transport; and its final position on the use of international permits and Kyoto credits. The Greens have disavowed using Kyoto credits, which is an accounting system that allows countries to count credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris emissions reduction commitments for 2030. The Morrison government will bank a 367-megatonne contribution from carryovers as part of its recently released carbon budget, which details the emissions reductions from various programs that will be required to meet the Paris target. Labor has sent a number of public signals over recent weeks that it is unlikely to use Kyoto credits, but the opposition is expected to deploy international permits to help with the abatement task."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman readers know that after the Tagesschau (8 p.m. national news) on ARD German television, regular programming sometimes, but not very often, gets interrupted by a special news report on some sort of disaster that impacts the entire country. It takes something pretty big for this to happen.
This so-called special news report, during prime time, is called “Brennpunkt”; in English that’s “ignition-point”.
Well, we got a Brennpunkt this evening on ARD after the news – about the cold and snow that has wreaked havoc on the country and throughout Europe.
All transportation in Germany has been paralyzed or disrupted. Many trains have been idled, and numerous flights have been cancelled. Passengers are stranded everywhere.
28 people have died in Europe as a result of the cold. Temperatures are forecast to plummet to -25°C in some areas as winter’s onslaught continues unabated.
I think the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy, slated to start tomorrow, will be impacted too. It’ll go on, for sure, but some participants may be delayed. Berlin area has been hit pretty hard.
I was planning to leave by train tomorrow from Osnabrück, but with the situation as it is now, I don’t think I’ll be arriving in Berlin on time. But I’m going, and hoping the situation stabilises overnight and that I’ll manage to get there in the afternoon.
Damn global warming!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is no April Fool’s story. It’s a real story at Spiegel. 
Everyone knows that some climate scientists like to use sea level rise as a way to scare the public when it comes to the dangers of global warming. A one-meter rise could wreak havoc and displace tens of millions of people overnight over 100 years they fret.
 Most experts, however, agree that the current rate of sea level rise is more of a nuisance than a catastrophe, and something that we can do little to prevent. But now there are some experts who say that there is another risk looming out there that needs to be taken far more seriously, especially in Japan – monster tsunamis.
Der Spiegel has a new article on how Japan could be a hit by a 34 meter (113-foot) tsunami from earthquake activity in the Pacific. Spiegel writes:
New research results show that the danger is greater than assumed up to now. […] An earthquake in the ocean with a magnitude of 9.0 in the Nankai Gorge off the east coast of Japan could trigger a wave of more than 20 meters and flood a large part of the coastal region, the Japanese media quoted a research report today from a government-appointed expert commission. […] Wave heights with peaks of up to 34 meters are possible in the future, the report now says.”
That is something we definitely need to worry about, much more than the improbable one meter sea level rise over 100 years due to global warming in a dubious climate model. The Japanese report goes on to say that even earthquakes of 7.0 under certain conditions would be enough wreak havoc for Tokyo, an area that is home to 33 million people.
So what should the government do? Should coastal areas be closed and everyone moved to higher ground? The answer is of course no. The benefits of residing along the coast are immense. People should be made aware of the risks and plans need to be drawn up that allow for an effective response in the event of such a disaster. The best we can hope for is to find effective ways to minimize the damage.
Is this all just irresponsible fear-mongering? Der Spiegel writes:
A powerful earthquake in the area is long overdue. In the event of a catastrophe, a power outage of more than one week has to be expected and the water supply could be knocked out for a mionth.
The report states that most people are not stocked up with enough supplies to carry them over for these periods.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore major media covering mavericks Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’ new skeptical book. Influential daily DIE WELT jumps in, see below!
First, part 2 of the 3-day special series called “The CO2 Lies” appearing in the 16-million circulation German daily Bild is out today. Its title:
There Hasn’t Been Any Global Warming In 12 Years!”
This part was authored by Vahrenholt and Lüning themselves, who remind us that CO2 is not that potent of a gas, and that a doubling would lead to only a 1.1°C temperature increase. But the IPCC fudges the models so that they produce a much higher increase because of the assumed water-vapor amplifier. Vahrenholt and Lüning remind readers:
But the amplification process is far from being understood and that the whole assumption is a really on shaky ground.”
But don’t tell that to the climate-catastrophe addicts. Without their daily fix of impending doom and catastrophe, they’re likely to start bouncing off the walls. Any good news about the catastrophe getting called off is the last thing these catastrophe-crackheads ever want to hear.
Bild reminds us that very few people are aware of the fact that global temperatures have stagnated over the last 10+ years. Thanks Bild, for finally telling us! Hopefully Bild will keep reminding us in the future.
Bild wonders why the IPCC never predicted that and asks: “How could the IPCC have erred? Here Vahrenholt bring up the ocean cycles and the sun, which the IPCC has a chronic habit of forgetting them in its summary reports. They write:
If the sun and PDO play a role, then it means CO2’s role is even less. And it’s precisely this that the IPCC refuses to acknowledge.”
Vahrenholt and Lüning then remind us that soot also is a major contributor and that a recent study shows that it was seriously underestimated just a few years ago. It all means that the IPCC models are completely out of whack. How do the IPCC lead scientists react to this? Bild tells us:
“…the IPCC decision-makers are fighting tooth and nail against accepting the roles of the oceans, sun, and soot.”

When assigning the amount of forcing to various factors, Vahrenholt and Lüning conclude:
“The facts need to be discussed sensibly and scientifically, without first deciding on the results.”
Full page interview with DIE WELT
Meanwhile flagship daily DIE WELT featured a full page interview with Professor Vahrenholt in its print edition…no restrictions, no omissions. Finally a good interview by a warmist paper.
In the interview, Vahrenholt explains why he grew skeptical of the IPCC. One problem was that the IPCC had the habit of filtering out important scientific findings so that they never appear in the summary reports. By examining past temperature fluctuations, Vahrenholt and Lüning believe that the sun is a greater factor than CO2.
Vahrenholt gives three reasons why he expects it to get cooler in the future: 1) we are or soon will be beginning on the downward flank of the Gleissberg and Suess cycles, 2) the ocean cycles will be in their negative phases over the next decades, and 3) we currently find ourselves in the weakest phase of solar activity in 80 years, and the next solar cycle could be a very weak one.
German Minister of Environment Röttgen “clueless”
Then the DIE WELT interview focuses on energy policy in Germany. According to Vahrenholt, Germany has a solar capacity of 25,000 megawatts and a wind capacity of 29,000 megawatts, which are very volatile sources. Conventional power plants are going to be needed to balance out the supply.
At the end of the interview, because of Germany’s now volatile power supply, DIE WELT asks Vahrenholt to estimate the current chances of power blackouts:
The outgoing President of the Federal Power Grid Agency says that we are dancing on a razor’s edge. A cold wave like the one we are now experiencing means Alarm Level Red. The French and the Czechs, from whom we import, need the power for themselves – for heating. Currently we are supplying our needs with power from an Austrian oil-fired power plant. We hope that things will not go astray over the coming 2 weeks. When Mr. Röttgen [Minister of Environment} says that solar energy reduces the probability of blackouts, it shows how clueless this man is. The greatest demand for power occurs in the evening in the wintertime – just when solar energy is zero.”
All these major media reports started appearing just when Vahrendorf’s and Lüning’s book was released. Skepticism is firing up in Germany. But the real battle is coming. Expect the catastrophe-crack-heads to go into violent seizures of protest.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEd Caryl, author of One Of Our Hemispehere Is Missing and A Light In Siberia, brings us his latest essay. If history is an indicator, then today’s simultaneously declining PDO and AMO, in combination with a solar quiet period, mean that a “rapidly cooling situation” may be in the works, or we could even be “headed for a new ice age”.
Sunspots and Temperature
by Ed Caryl
Sunspots have been tracked systematically since 1700. Temperature has been recorded in Central England since 1659. We can compare these two records and measure the relationship. Both are plotted below.

Fig. 1: Sunspot activity and temperature
First, note that the trend lines for both temperature and sunspot number are parallel. Annual sunspots have been increasing since the Maunder Minimum at about 10 spots per century. Temperature has been increasing at about 0.4°C per century.
Sunspots drive the solar output. Here is a plot of solar irradiance as reconstructed by Judith Lean. (Lean, J. (2000). “Evolution of the Sun’s Spectral Irradiance Since the Maunder Minimum”. Geophysical Research Letters 27 (16): 2425–8. doi:10.1029/2000GL000043.)
Below, the irradiance data is plotted against the temperature data seen in Fig. 1 above. The irradiance is in watts per square meter. Notice that the since the Maunder Minimum, the irradiance as increased by almost 3 watts/m2, on the same order as the supposed recent CO2 warming.

Fig. 2: Temperature and Solar Irradiance.
Figure 3 follows, and is a scatter diagram of solar irradiance and temperature. Note that it also shows a trend of 1 degree from minimum irradiance to maximum. That also corresponds to 0.4 degrees per century.

Fig. 3: Temperature versus Irradiance
Another thing to notice is that warming takes place immediately as sunspots and irradiance increase, but cooling seems to be delayed by a few years. This is likely due to the oceans’ “flywheel” effect on land temperatures, as has been noted by Juraj Vanovcan here. The oceans take a long time to react to solar influence.
What does this say about the future?
The land temperature at the end of the Maunder Minimum was still falling after 50 years of no sunspots and minimum irradiance. During the Dalton Minimum from 1800 to 1835, it took almost 20 years for the Central England temperature to react by cooling. Other cooling events, in 1740 and 1880, have happened faster. The reaction time depends on timing with ocean cycles.
The Dalton Minimum took place during a high point in the PDO, but the PDO was falling in 1880. At this time, 2010, PDO has fallen, and AMO is starting to fall. With the solar cycle staying low, we may be in for a rapidly cooling situation.

What is the current irradiance? It is 2 watts/square meter below the minimum shown by Judith Lean, above. Hopefully there is a 2 watts/square meter offset error in her 2000 reconstruction, or we are headed for a new ice age.

What about CO2? According to the U. K. Met Office, the rise in the Central England temperature record after 1974, “has been adjusted to allow for urban warming”. They don’t reveal what those adjustments were, so that portion of the record should be taken with a grain of salt, especially the last 10 years. No other evidence of anthropogenic temperature rise can be seen.

"George Monbiot (The natural world can help save us from climate chaos, 3 April), Greta Thunberg and other signatories (Letters, 3 April) are right. Nature can provide effective options to help tackle climate change. Often there is no need for complicated, expensive and unproven technology. As we know from our work in such countries as Bhutan and Costa Rica, some governments are embracing nature-based solutions where natural forests are managed for their key role in storing carbon and regulating water for clean, green hydropower. Policies and investment need to work with local people and focus on linking nature to infrastructure to help avoid catastrophic climate change, protect biodiversity and cut emissions. The real challenge is to align the politics of change to the actions that are needed. While some countries are doing the right thing, in other places (such as Brazil) the politics is going backwards in deeply troubling ways. The international community needs to act to support local livelihoods and enable communities to be good stewards of the natural world. Our lives depend on it.Andrew NortonDirector, International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED)  • Readers seeking a wide-ranging introduction to the practicalities and benefits of rewilding formerly intensive agricultural land in the UK will find lots of interest in the book Wilding, by Isabella Tree – about a live, 20-year-old project on the Knepp Estate in West Sussex, which can be visited. Especially interesting is the information on the role of glomalin in carbon capture and in soil improvement. A natural glycoprotein, it is produced by mycorrhizal fungi from plant roots and is a key soil component. A Defra assessment of the increased carbon storage capacity on this site, in neutral grassland and broadleaved woodland under rewilding, showed a 51% rise compared with the intensive agricultural management of last century. I was pleased to find that there does seem a way to get a grip on climate change alongside reducing emissions, if we can grasp it. We can all do it in our gardens as well – we don’t have to plant trees.Roy RhodesBelmont, Lancashire • This mobilisation to draw carbon naturally from the atmosphere is long overdue. Sign me up! But is it still too narrow? Logically, the more people and places that are mobilised, the more carbon we can extract. But how many of us can access the forest, swamp, coastal margin etc of which George Monbiot writes? Very few. This is still for others to do, not me. Yet here I am in my back garden deliberately burying carbon. I ferment all food waste (no carbon emitted), feed it directly to my soil’s ecosystem (more soil carbon biomass), add wood biochar (permanent carbon sink) to house more soil micro-organisms and retain water and nutrients (for more biomass), then mulch with dead vegetation (protection and food for biomass). This is low-tech, and makes lovely worm-dug growing soil. My point is that we can trap carbon naturally in many ways, some of which fit local resources and local needs like food and sanitation. These lend themselves to community efforts, in every neighbourhood everywhere. Summed together across a country, they’d be as significant as George’s big-ticket items. We can, and should, become the Carbon Preservation Society. This is for everyone – for all those feeling helpless to affect climate change. We are not powerless. Within this new campaign, let’s create a web of local, regional and worldwide carbon preservers. Let the great and the good give the annual prizes!Malcolm FowlesReading, Berkshire • I have supported tree protection and worked to encourage and undertake both small- and large-scale tree planting for all of my professional career. I have undertaken much planting myself in my own semi-rural parish. I propagate trees from our local native, established giants! There are so many issues relating to this work at all levels, including encouraging local authorities and landowners to support, protect and maintain trees on their own land. But, putting that matter to one side, one of my biggest concerns for the last two decades has been the ever-increasing reliance on plastic tree protectors, along with their sturdy tree ties. The result is that we see plastic tubes – either whole or in pieces – contaminating and strangling our planting schemes, littering our landscapes, watercourses, open spaces, highway embankments and verges, existing and new woodlands. This practice must be resolved so that we can have healthy, protected trees but without the plastic contaminating litter residue. I suggest new products, new materials, more input into good planting design and practice, in order to reduce reliance on tree tubes, and much more positive management.Anne WestoverWestover Landscape Ltd • Your correspondents are correct in asserting that planting permanent stands of hardwoods can contribute a great deal to sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Every hectare of hardwood in a temperate climate with adequate water can accumulate at least 20 tonnes of aerial biomass annually for 30 years – 600 tonnes per hectare. But then sequestration stops on that plot. The trick is what to do next, but the answer is at hand. Simple technologies with very low carbon emissions are available to harvest accumulated biomass, recover most of the sequestered plant nutrients, and densify the remainder to above 1 tonne per cubic metre – the density of water. Provided the right species are chosen, the roots left in the ground will sprout and within two years the carbon-capture process will have resumed as rapidly as before. Pop down to your local coppice to see what I mean. If the densified wood is deposited in the deep ocean, below 1,000m, where it is cold, dark and with little oxygen, it is there for good. Even if some organism worked out how to use the densified wood for metabolism, any CO2 or methane produced would remain a solid, out of the atmosphere for ever. To indicate the enormous volume available in which to sequester carbon in the deep, 1bn tonnes of CO2 deposited there would raise sea level by 2 nanometres. If all the annual CO2 emissions were dealt with in this way, sea level would rise by the thickness of a human hair.Dr Graeme Coles Chairman and technical director, Knewe, New Zealand • The natural climate solutions approach proposed by scientists and activists including Michael Mann, Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot is a vitally important component of our global approaches to tackling climate and ecological breakdown. But carbon sequestration by trees (the removal of carbon dioxide from the air via net photosynthesis), and carbon storage in forest ecosystems (especially soils) are only two of the methods by which sustainable forest management can combat climate change. The third method is the carbon substitution effect achieved by replacing fossil fuels, either directly as bioenergy, or indirectly through use of wood (for example as structural timber) instead of higher carbon footprint materials, such as concrete and steel. In the UK, with only 13% forest cover, we are less than 20% self-sufficient in wood products and thus need to increase all three methods of using forestry to mitigate climate change. Otherwise we are dependent on importing harvested wood from other parts of the world rather than helping restore their forests. Climate-smart forestry is an approach that considers how natural woodlands and commercial forest plantations need to adapt to climate change while maintaining, and increasing, their climate mitigation through individual trees, in the forest and by products from the forest. This needs to be achieved without reducing the other benefits to society that the forest habitat provides, such as flood mitigation, access for recreation and associated health and wellbeing.Dr Andrew WeatherallNational School of Forestry, University of Cumbria  • Conserving natural ecosystems to help mitigate and adapt to climate change is indeed an urgent necessity. A key question is how such places should be managed and secured. The world’s protected area network already covers 15% of the planet’s land surface and its role in defending against climate change is recognised, for instance in a groundbreaking declaration by 18 Latin American countries at the Paris climate meeting in 2015. Additional opportunities include the territories of indigenous peoples, plus many community lands and other natural landscapes. But the survival of all such areas is fragile: national parks and nature reserves are being de-designated or degraded, indigenous peoples forced off their lands and conversion of natural forests has in many areas increased recently. Bold targets for avoiding further conversion of natural habitats are needed. Collaboration between conservation and human rights groups can help to ensure that protection does not further disadvantage the people who live in near-natural ecosystems, who are often among the world’s poorest. Pressure must be kept on governments and industry to honour existing conservation pledges and to increase these to the levels needed to provide a measure of environmental security.Nigel DudleyEquilibrium Research, Bristol • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"After months and months of picking over the minutiae of negotiations in parliament and beyond, the UK is tired of Brexit. I know I am; you take one day off from following the ins and outs and even though “nothing has changed” for weeks, you’re somehow behind. You know it’s important, but watching politicians and commentators trade macho insults is incredibly tedious. And now there could be European elections on the cards.  A European election might seem like a distraction when it can’t deliver what the country desperately needs: a general election and with it a new government that will fund our schools so they aren’t at the point of collapse and design an economy where the norm is not plummeting living standards and rising homelessness.  European elections are a hard sell. We were told we’d have left the EU by now. A swift, successful departure is what leave MPs kept saying was possible – and it’s what Theresa May said she would deliver. For people who want Brexit over, the last thing they’re interested in is voting for more politicians they don’t even think should exist. But with the Commons in deadlock, elections on the 23 May is where we might be headed. So it seems to me there’s a choice: either the elections end up as a rerun of the referendum campaign – with one side demanding Brexit and crying betrayal and the other rehashing the same uncritical pro-EU messages from three years ago – or we step away from these torturous, well-rehearsed arguments and try something different. Rather than resent the elections, perhaps they could be an opportunity to talk about all the things we haven’t been focusing on because of Brexit. The British left has to engage. We have a pretty good idea what the right will say, focused as they are on ramping up anti-immigrant rhetoric, imperial nostalgia and mythical sovereignty. Their rhetoric poses a very real, violent threat that must be countered. Whether, in the end, we remain just inside the EU, just outside of it or somewhere else altogether, there are issues the left has to consider and bring to the mainstream. It must tap into progressive internationalist movements – including explaining the importance of cooperation with the rest of Europe – and advocate for tackling tax avoidance, climate change, the rise of the far right and the mistreatment of migrants. Last month, right in front of the building where MPs have been plotting their next moves and TV stations have almost permanently set up camp, thousands of schoolchildren gathered in Parliament Square as part of a global movement demanding action on climate breakdown. A few days of news coverage, some tone-deaf comments from Theresa May and the news cycle moved on, but the climate is still breaking down. We need to hear nonstop about Labour’s green new deal and how they are working with people around the world on climate change; about how MEPs might team up with their leftwing allies to develop this – and what this future cooperation might look like. The far right is on the rise and already attempting to commandeer the levers of the EU. Matteo Salvini – the Italian deputy prime minister, who last year said he would expel Roma from his country, where there has since been an intensification of violent anti-Roma racism – is trying to build an alliance of far right parties for the elections. And though far from a unified force, the far-right already has a foothold in Poland, Hungary and Austria and is doing well in other parts of the continent. If it gains more power and is able to wield anti-immigrant politics to promote a racially homogenous Europe, the continent’s borders will become firmer – and member states’ policies will become ever more violent, exclusionary and racist. We need a united, anti-racist, pro-migrant left fighting across and against borders worldwide. But of all the problems at the heart of Brexit, the one that has been most neglected is Britain’s deep and damaging anti-migrant politics. The left needs to take on anti-migrant narratives unashamedly and directly, including during the European elections. Arguing for free movement is one of many starting points. The failure of the Labour party to make the case for this, loud and proud, is hugely disappointing. But if the broader left can keep up the pressure, the leadership has shown it is not above changing course. The Conservative party has been tearing chunks out of itself over Europe for decades and it’s conducting the final stage of that battle while in government, to the detriment of us all. All the while, our slow destruction of the planet accelerates, and inequality and anti-migrant politics grow. There is no quick fix but the left should use everything they can to change the debate for the better. The European elections should be seen not as an irrelevant distraction, but as an opportunity to campaign for a better future. • Maya Goodfellow is a writer and researcher.

This is the real deal, with speakers like Fred Singer, Nir Shaviv and Henrik Svensmark on the roster.
More information here: 3rd International Energy and Climate Conference.
This conference is taking place concurrently with the United Nations Conference of Climate in Cancún. But in Berlin, leading international scientists in the fields of climate and energy will present the latest science and findings on climate and energy, and not the usual worn-out scare stories and dread.
This year will also include aspects of climate policy and their impacts. The conference thus covers a wide spectrum of natural science topics and the social-political impacts of energy policy.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I mentioned here how Stefan Rahmstorf spends more time organising PR campaigns than he does doing science (understandable I guess, as crystal ball gazing takes only a few minutes per day).
It took less than a day for him to confirm this observation.
EIKE posted here yesterday that ZDF television did a Frontal drive-by-shooting on the climate skeptics, particularly EIKE, and the Berlin Climate Conference, which took place last weekend. Of course, as is the case with all such attack reports of this kind, there’s always the same unhappy and increasingly nervous person behind it: Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research.
I was wondering what German readers think of the following ZDF clip:

Keep in mind that while almost all serious scientists say the sea level will rise around 30 cm over the next 90 years, Rahmstorf is one of the few oddballs who’s way out in left field, with a couple of other kooks like Al Gore, claiming sea levels will rise 1.4 meters or more.
Unfortunately for him, Jason/Topex shows a clear deceleration of sea level rise over the last years.
I’m wondering what the German readers think of the Frontal report.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago, biofuels were vigorously pushed with great enthusiasm and urgency by environmentalist groups, for example Greenpeace here:
Instead of cutting tax on fuels that wreck the climate, Gordon Brown should use this week’s budget to boost genuine green fuels like biodiesel, hydrogen and green electricity.
And Greenpeace here:
Although the plant-based fuel is not pollution-free, it is significantly cleaner than its petro equivalent and causes just half the damage to the climate.
Or take a look at this April 2007 Greenpeace Fact Sheet here. And so it was with many environmental groups.
And as a result, governments, pressured by the enviro-groups, and ever so eager to rescue the planet from the imminent climate catastrophe, went hog wild implementing programs and subsidies to launch the biofuels boom. The targets were ambitious.
By 2020 9.5% of Europe’s demand for fuel by its transportation sector would be supplied by biofuels made from climate-friendly sources like oilseed, palm oil, sugar cane or sugar beet. It became a boom for Europe’s agriculture. Thousands of farmers have since invested heavily in new agricultural machinery.
The race to be the greenest in Europe, and the whole world, was on.  The science of global warming was settled after all, and biofuels were a big part of the answer. Europe would lead the way in the planet’s rescue and be the hero.
Things have since gone terribly wrong.

Now, it turns out, according to the newest study (by the very groups that spurred the madness on to begin with), Europe’s targets are going to have the opposite effect on the planet. Fulfilling its biofuels plan will mean converting 69,000 square km of forests into agricultural land – that’s an area twice the size of Belgium.
Not surprisingly, few bothered to question the science behind global warming and the possible impacts biofuels would have on the earth’s ecosystems and food markets. Those  who did, were vilified and slapped down. Us sceptics are all too familiar with that.
Today the German online Mananger Magazine reports here:
According to a new study, the planned expansion of agricultural land for biolfuel will damage the climate more than the fossil energies they are supposed to replace. Millions of tonnes more CO2 have been released as a result.
Manager Magazine writes that nine major environmental organisations have commented on a new study put out by the London-based Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) saying biofuels will produce far more CO2 instead of less.
The growing use of biofuels in Europe will lead to an increase in climate damaging CO2 emissions because huge tracts of land will have to be transformed into agricultural crop fields worldwide to supply the needed biofuel.
IEEP researchers studied the official renewable energy plans of the 23 EU member countries up to 2020. Germany will be mixing 5.5 million tonnes of biofuel with its gasoline and diesel fuel.
As a result this means that annually up to 56 million tonnes of CO2 will emitted. That equals an additional 12 to 26 million cars on Europe’s streets.
A far more damning commentary appears here at the European Voice:
The next time Europe comes up with an idea to save the planet – run!!

"Utah representative Ben McAdams, a Democrat, warned ominously this week that a “day of reckoning is coming”. It’s the kind of sober language typically used to describe a climate crisis which – if we continue on with business as usual – could end human civilization as we know it. McAdams, though, was describing a decidedly less grave threat, if it can be considered a threat at all: the federal deficit.  He and 26 other members of the so-called Blue Dog Coalition – centrist and fiscally-conservative Democrats – are pushing for a constitutional amendment that would prohibit the federal government from running a deficit if there isn’t a war or recession happening. Social security and Medicare would be spared from the brutal spending cuts the amendment would bring about ... but that’s it. At a time when scientists are calling for governments to adopt a “wartime footing” to address the existential threat of climate change, the proposal isn’t just a stupid play into Republican hands. It’s climate denial. McAdams’ proposal emerged after a lengthy fight between those so-called moderate Democrats and the 90 member Congressional Progressive Caucus over a proposed budget measure, which House Democratic leadership moved to cancel a vote on Tuesday afternoon amidst rising tensions. Progressive wanted more domestic spending and less for our already bloated military. Moderates – radically – want to curb spending overall. And for what? There’s nothing inherently dangerous about a growing deficit; vigilante bondholders are not going to come knocking on America’s door threatening our sovereignty. And a country that issues debt in its own currency like the US is never going to face the kind of sadistic punishment the Troika visited upon Greece several years back. Deficits do matter, of course. But what’s important isn’t their dollar value. It’s whether the things that public money is pouring into are actually putting the economy on a stronger footing. Republicans know this all too well. Famed small government deficit hawk Ronald Reagan ran up the third largest debt of any US president, after Franklin D Roosevelt and Barack Obama. And today’s Republican party didn’t bat an eye before passing $2tn worth of tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy. Centrist Democrats, meanwhile, paint themselves as the fiscally responsible wing of their party out to curb waste on both sides of the aisle. Yet what’s so responsible about kneecapping the government’s ability to avert $32bn worth of infrastructure damage, $118bn from sea level rise and $141bn in costs due to heat related illness, according to the National Climate Assessment? If there were some foreign invader threatening to inflict this much damage on the US, neither conservative Democrats nor Republicans would bat an eye before throwing as many resources as possible toward fighting them off. Because the threat is posed by climate change – and these politicians’ fossil fuel executive donors – their response has ranged instead from indifference to outright denial. They may not all quibble with the scientific consensus on global warming, but they’re doing everything they can to sabotage reasonable responses to it. Most recently, they’ve taken to pushing back on calls for a Green New Deal – the only proposal on the table that remotely matches the ambition science demands. While Republicans fabricated a $93tn price tag for the Green New Deal, it’s impossible to predict how much any suite of programs will cost until you have something concrete to look at and cost out. What is clear, however, is that any earnest response to the climate crisis will require significant federal investment to do things like electrify large swaths of the economy, scale up renewable energy and invest in communities likely to be hardest hit by a transition away from fossil fuels. Done right, these investments could radically improve Americans’ quality of life and salvage our chance for a livable future. A balanced budget amendment would take away the best tools we have to make one possible. As Republicans pick and choose when to fearmonger about the deficit, Democrats like McAdams continue to describe its growth in apocalyptic terms – all the while ignoring the actual apocalypse the climate crisis could bring about. “It is clear we are on a dangerous and unsustainable course,” he wrote in the Deseret News. “The decisions won’t be easy, but our children and our grandchildren are counting on us to make this right.” If McAdams and other centrist Democrats were actually worried about their children and grandchildren, they’d throw out their amendment and back the Green New Deal that so many young people have rallied behind. For now, they’re more interested in screwing them over."
"The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has issued a stark warning before the coming election campaign, declaring the Australian parliament must end the stalemate and back Labor’s climate policy in the event of a Bill Shorten victory, or politicians will betray the next generation. In an interview with Guardian Australia’s political podcast, Butler says Labor’s commitment to reduce emissions by 45% on 2005 levels by 2030 is a “rock solid commitment”, not an “aspiration” or “something that would be nice to achieve” – and he says voters are more agitated now about climate action than he has ever seen during his time as an MP .  Butler says the Morrison government is lining up to deploy “tired old scare campaigns” about carbon taxes in the coming campaign – with Scott Morrison this week characterising the measures this week as a “Borat tax” – “but what I see as I get around the country after a very angry summer … the hottest summer we have ever had … is Australians are sick of it”. He argues voters are in a mood to punish the Coalition if the government defaults to wrecking and hyperbole over the coming weeks. “The consciousness, the level of expectation for this building, for the Australian parliament to do better on climate change is greater than I’ve ever seen – I think it’s greater than it was in 2007. “People are increasingly seeing the impacts of climate change, they are seeing the urgent clear advice from scientists that this is a climate emergency. “We have to stop having these petty political fights. We need to stop responding to Tony Abbott’s playbook and actually start putting some serious policy in place.” Butler indicated Labor would pursue as much of the policy, outlined this week, as it could without triggering “a drawn out legislative battle” – meaning by regulation, and by working within existing mechanisms – and he predicts the Greens will be punished by their supporters if they refuse to support Labor’s climate policy on the basis of insufficient ambition. The Greens outlined its own climate policy before Labor to define some of the boundaries of policy ambition post-election, and have already signalled they could torpedo one element of Labor’s climate plan – allowing heavy polluters to use international permits to meet their emissions reduction targets. Butler says that is a backflip on the position the Greens took during the implementation of the carbon price in the 43rd parliament. “They supported [the use of permits] when we were last in government, it was a central feature of the clean energy package they signed up to … but now, apparently, that’s an abomination. “I think there is a lot of politics going on.” He said if the Liberals lost the coming federal election, and Abbott lost his seat, that could create the conditions for the Liberal party to come back to the table on climate change, and he predicted if the Greens shot down the policy on the basis it wasn’t perfect, “that would be an extraordinary decision, frankly, for the Greens to take”. Butler said the Greens voting with Abbott against Labor’s first climate policy mechanism during the last period in government was one of the factors in shattering the political consensus at the federal level which has prevented policy action for the best part of a decade. The shadow climate change minister says Australia has now lost five years, with emissions rising when they should have been falling. “If Labor is elected at the next election, I think the gravity of responsibility of the next parliament to do something here should not be under-estimated. “If the next Labor government is not allowed to make serious changes in this area, I hate to think where Australia is going to be in 2030. “I hate to think of the scale of betrayal to our children and grandchildren if, for politics, our government, if we are elected at the next election, is prevented from implementing this policy.” Labor’s policy involves boosting the existing safeguards mechanism to impose more stringent pollution reduction standards on heavy emitters, and imposing a new pollution regulation on car retailers “in line with” 105g CO2/km for light vehicles, which will drive the uptake of electric vehicles. The specific timeframes for implementation are not clear in the policy document released this week, and Labor has refused to release a carbon budget making transparent the specific levels of emissions reduction it is factoring in in each sector of the economy. Butler acknowledges that Labor will face lobbying from politically influential stakeholders on its climate commitments if it wins the coming election, but he insists the changes will be implemented, pushback or no pushback. He says a key difference between now and when Labor was last in government is a substantial shift from investors, regulators and lenders to a world where carbon emissions are now considered “a key investment risk”. “Emissions reduction is now no longer an option. Emissions reduction is now a must do for emissions intensive businesses.” Butler says he would like to remain in the climate portfolio in the event of an election win, but adds whether he does is a matter for Shorten – and he repeated his personal opposition to the controversial Queensland Adani coal mine. “I don’t think there’s a case for opening up a new thermal coal mine.”"
"The ALP is preparing to use federal powers under the Water Act and its influence with the two Labor-controlled basin states to drive better environmental outcomes if it wins government in May. The opposition spokesman on the environment and water, Tony Burke, told Guardian Australia he would immediately convene the ministerial council and outline what he wants to achieve.  “If the states refuse to cooperate, I will look at powers in the Water Act,” he said. So far the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) has not used all its powers, preferring to work collaboratively with the states. However the act gives the MDBA the authority to take over the planning powers of the states in relation to the river system as well as allowing a greater role in enforcement. Since Guardian Australia investigated the Murray-Darling in March 2018, the health of Australia’s greatest river system, and the $13bn plan to save it, have been thrust into the centre of the national political debate. The drought that began to unfold in early 2018 has become prolonged and highlighted inadequacies in the plan. The most dramatic warning has been the deaths of hundreds of thousands of fish at Menindee. The deaths of 40- and 50-year-old Murray cod, which survived the millennium drought of the early 2000s but perished this time around, horrified Australians and raised serious questions about the management of the river. There are now marked policy differences between the Coalition and Labor at state and federal level over what should happen next under the plan, though both major parties remain committed to retaining the plan itself. The question is: can the basin plan be reformed – and the remaining $4.5bn be spent constructively – without the key stakeholder states and the farming lobby pulling out of the plan? The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists has warned from the outset that the environmental water recovery target of 2750GL in the plan was a political compromise and is a bare minimum to restore the health of the Murray-Darling River. Since then, serious management failures have led to a systematic weakening of reforms and undermining of the plan, they say. “Without major changes in implementation, it is almost certain that the basin plan will fail,” the group has warned in numerous submissions. The group’s spokesman, Prof Jamie Pittock, said there have been improvements in enforcement in New South Wales after the ABC Four Corners report in July 2017, which sounded the alarm over allegations of water theft by cotton irrigators in the north of NSW. But he said: “The major part of the problem – bad rules in water-sharing plans – remain. NSW and Victoria haven’t changed their attitude towards fixing them.” The most scathing and comprehensive criticism of the basin plan was delivered in February by a South Australian royal commission. It found officials at the MDBA and in government were guilty of maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions in drawing up the multibillion-dollar deal to save Australia’s largest river system. The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, warned the plan’s failure to take account of climate change was “potentially catastrophic”. While the Morrison government and the MDBA dismissed the findings (they had refused to participate in the inquiry) the royal commission heard from many of the leading scientists in the field. There was a distressing consensus in their assessments. Many of its findings were backed up by the Productivity Commission’s five-year review, albeit in more temperate, bureaucratic language. “Deficiencies in the way that governments have approached implementation of the plan have caused considerable concern in many basin communities. This has left a legacy of community distrust, which the commission considers is a risk to effectively implementing the next phase of the plan,” it said. In the fine print, it noted the poor enforcement by states, that new plans to deliver on water sharing were way behind schedule, that programs to find water savings in other ways were highly ambitious and risky, and the MDBA’s evaluation frameworks were inadequate. Then there were two reports – by the Academy of Science commissioned by Labor, and the Vertessy report commissioned by the government – in the wake of the fish kills. Both concluded that low flows had been responsible for the conditions that led to the mass deaths. Australian National University professor and chairman of the Academy of Science’s panel, Craig Moritz, said his review found “there isn’t enough water in the Darling system to avoid catastrophic outcomes”. “This is partly due to the ongoing drought. However, analysis of rainfall and river flow data over decades points to excess water extraction upstream,” he said. A common theme in all of these reports is that flows in the northern part of the system are dramatically reduced compared with historical records, and it cannot be explained solely by drought. The likely causes are climate change, which is changing rainfall patterns, and overextraction by irrigators – possibly in breach of the rules and floodplain harvesting, which involves diverting overland flows into private storages before it even reaches the river. A study by the MDBA identified the problem. From 1990 to 2017, a period which covered the millennium drought, “Some individual flow events in the post-2000 period were seen to be very heavily attenuated in both the Collarenebri-to-Walgett and (particularly) the Walgett-to-Brewarrina reaches, contrary to the established pre-2000 trend,” the study said. In other words, too much water was being diverted from the river. But facing up to this new reality is proving difficult. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists argue that the plan can be salvaged but requires governments and regulators to recognise its weaknesses and put the environmental objectives of the plan ahead of politics. Over the past 12 months, there have been developments that are both positive and negative. In the wake of the fish kills, Labor, Greens and minor parties joined forces to make one important change: an amendment that will lift the cap of 1500GL on water that can be bought back from farmers. The cap had been put in place by the Abbott government in 2015 under pressure from the Nationals who feared the economic impact of more buybacks on rural communities. But the change will only be relevant if the government of the day calls more tenders to buy back water or if other measures to reclaim water for the environment, such as the supply projects like Menindee Lakes are unsuccessful, forcing a government’s hand. Burke said the cap on buybacks was never part of the original Murray-Darling Basin Plan. “By removing the cap on buybacks, Labor is removing a legislative barrier to providing more water for the basin, if that is what is needed,” he said. The more serious threats to realising the environmental outcomes are two amendments to the plan, supported by the government and opposition, which reduce the amount of water available for the environment.  The plan always envisaged there could be changes, but the two changes – a 70GL cut to the environmental water target in the northern basin and agreement to allow 605GL of water to be recovered in the southern basin through efficiency projects – are controversial.  Both have drawn almost universal criticism from scientists but were supported by the MDBA and by both major parties. The 70GL is a straight cut that reduces the environmental water recovery target by about 31,000 Olympic swimming pools. “I guess I was surprised by the figure. But the reality is the plan falls over if you do not support the independent process,” Burke said, explaining his decision to support the government. But since the Menindee fish deaths, he said he would “not be surprised if MDBA review the 70GL cut”. The 605GL adjustment in the southern basin is more complex. The idea is that environmental outcomes equivalent to this amount of flows can be achieved by using water more efficiently often through building river infrastructure or removing it. The problem is knowing whether the projects will work. The Productivity Commission described the supply measures projects, as they are known, as “highly ambitious” and rated the risk of failure as “high”.  The Menindee Lakes project, to reduce evaporation by shrinking the lake system, is a case in point.  If the project fails to deliver on its 105GL of evaporation savings, it will mean a shortfall in environmental water that needs to be made in 2024.  Then there is the glacial progress by the states in implementing key commitments under the plan. NSW has been slow on its new water resource plans, leaving in place old plans like the Barwon-Darling water-sharing plan, which have been roundly criticised for allowing pumping by irrigators during low flows at the expense of the environment. Victoria is under fire for its failure to remove or rebuild bridges and roads and other assets that currently prevent the commonwealth environmental water holder from flooding the upper flood plains, which is critical for endangered ecosystems such as red gum forests. “If I win the election, I would want to get the ministerial council together as quickly as possible,” said Burke. “One of the things we need is a clear work plan for constraints removal, particularly in Victoria. “I am determined that I will get constraints removed and I am frustrated by the lack of progress. I would prefer a consensus approach but failure to remove them is not an option.” Burke said he also expected the states to take notice that water-sharing plans underpin the reforms and there will be “no tolerance” for plans that subvert them.

The schadenfreude here can hardly be contained, I have to admit. In Great Britain citizens are being told not to expect a steady supply of power in the future. Now German leaders, also insisting we make due with less, have gotten a taste of it. Elevators, toilets, etc. ceased to function.

Eco-radical and Green Party Faction leader Jürgen Trittin, who, according to DIE WELT, was outraged:
It is impossible that when Vattenfall screws up once again, the German Pariliament has no emergency back up supply of electricity.”
Vattenfall is the Sweden-based power company that operates some of Germany’s power plants, and probably has nothing to do with the outage that Trittin and Ott find so damn inconvenient.
I say leave the power off and let them use candles and portable toilets.

The whining and moaning by the Guardian is something to cherish and a must read.
Hopefully these new climate deniers joining Congress will slap USA lawmakers back awake to reality and get the government to focus on the real problems that demand immediate attention, like run-away deficits and  unemployment.
Even Obama now sees Crap & Trade as a useless venture.  The Guardian writes:
Obama in his post-election press conference indicated he was giving up on the idea of sweeping climate and energy legislation in the remaining two years of his term. He said he hoped to find compromise with Republicans on areas like fuel efficiency or electric cars. ‘Cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way,” he told reporters at the White House “I’m going to be looking for other means to address this problem.’
A little hope and change for Obama? Recall the change in direction by Bill Clinton in 1994. And here’s the part I like:
The new crop of Republican leaders in the house are way ahead of Palin, with plans for sweeping investigations of climate science and of Obama administration officials such as Lisa Jackson, who heads the EPA.
As far as the leaders are concerned, the science of climate change is far from settled. “We’re going to want to have a do-over,” Darrell Issa, a favourite to head the house oversight and investigations committee, told a recent interviewer.
Rep. Issa, let’s get it all out on the table where everyone can see it.

Last winter was also a harsh one in Cuba. Last January, 26 patients at a psychiatric hospital in Havana died as a result of cold weather, so reports the M&C News here. But we can’t really blame climate change for that, now can we? There are accusations that the hospital was too poorly equipped to care for the patients. M&C reports:
Cuba provides free universal health care. The communist state admits that its system is in a poor state, but blames the US trade embargo, which makes it difficult to import medical supplies and equipment.
Sure – blame warming for all the cold, and so let’s blame US capitalism for failed socialism too. You Canadians may want to go elsewhere for your holidays this winter.
Cold In India
It’s also has been very cold in India too. The Swiss 20 min reports of “extreme cold”.  20min writes:

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel reports here on the latest ideas from climate activists to revitalize the stalled climate movement, which has run aground over the last year – thanks to Climategate and gross errors in the 2007 IPCC report. Hat-tip oekowatch.org.
Yawn – a “loser topic”
Surveys have found that the population is bored by the issue as a whole, and show that a majority of the public is not even interested in climate change. The topic is too technical, too dry and something that’s 100 years out into the future.
Der Spiegel writes that just one third of Dutch people are concerned about climate change, even though the country is highly vulnerable to rising sea levels! Der Spiegel writes:
Earlier, the telephone rang off the hook whenever we had extreme weather, recalls Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Now hardly anyone calls anymore. Climate has become a ‘loser topic’, he told a ‘Tagesspiegel’ editor on the German TV news program ‘Panorama’.”
Calls for the use of shock, emotion, sex and advocacy journalism
So what do you do to revitalise a dud issue? You repackage the product and re-market it. Der Spiegel piece presents the ideas that activists want to use to get the issue back into the headlines and in people’s minds.

According to the report, some activists want to use emotion, sex, critical debate, improved communication and a new scientific language to better communicate with the public. These are some of the less spectacular methods. Others are calling for more controversial methods, such as advocacy journalism. Der Spiegel writes:
Climate activists are currently financing million dollar training programs for environmental journalists. The target is to promote journalism that is interest-related.”
But experts warn this could backfire as the line between science and advertising becomes blurred. This could make the science even less credible than it is now (as impossible as that may seem).
A climate Martin Luther King /  and where’s Al Gore?
One particularly odd strategy activists are pushing for is the search for a charismatic Messiah. Der Spiegel writes:
A Messiah is needed: Like Martin Luther King spurred the black movement, we now need a climate-Messiah, so believes environmemtal scientist Andreas Ernst of the University of Kassel. The message could be something like: “I have a nightmare“. Al Gore, who for awhile played the role and won a Nobel Prize for his moving film, is hardly ever seen anymore.”
A Climate Messiah?  “I have a nightmare”?  Al Gore?
Folks, it’s over. What they need is Brünnhilde in Götterdämmerung.

CO2 being the primary cause of global warming is disappearing – fast. Now a new UNEP-sponsored study says.
Half of the temperature increase in the Arctic can be traced to black exhaust dust (soot).
We’ve always known that CO2’s greenhouse impact on global warming was inflated, maybe 10-fold. The T-Online News here presents a summary of a recent UNEP study written by a German alliance of environmental organisations called Russfrei Fürs Klima, in English: “Soot-Free for the Climate”. T-Online writes:
Because of these new findings, the so-called German Environment Aid group (DUH) is now calling for diesel filters for heavy construction machinery.”
Ed Caryl wrote about black soot’s impacts on glaciers some time back, read Glaciers – The Dark Side.
Okay – the UNEP study says “half the Arctic warming” and not half of the “global warming”. But recall that scientists have long said that global temperature rise would be most apparent in the Arctic. Now that we know half of it is caused by black soot, then it indicates the problem over the rest of the globe is nowhere near as bad.

‘The black carbon settles on snow and ice,’ explains Dietmar Oeliger, transportation expert of the Nature Protection Alliance Germany (NABU). ‘It leads to more absorption of solar heat by ice and snow, and thus melt more quickly.”
and (emphasis added):
‘The UNEP study is so important because it has finally offcially identified soot particles as a climate driver,’ said Axel Friedrich, international transportation consultant. “The detrimental effects of CO2 on climate have been discussed for a long time, while the topic of soot was always ridiculed.’ “
 Soot deposits in glaciers
Of course these concerned environmentalists would like to have us believe that soot is equally as harmful as CO2. But all they have done is convinced me that CO2 is much less a problem then they’ve been claiming.
And another important factor in warming from 1980 – 1998 (there has been no warming since 1998) are the oceanic oscillations, which were in their warm phase from 1980 – 1998. That doesn’t leave much room left for CO2. Call it the incredible shrinking CO2 warming effect.
I think the call for exhaust filters is a reasonable proposal and I’d support it. I’m in favour of less soot in the air that I breathe. Filters wouldn’t be that expensive, and would have a real impact – if the study’s results are true.
Frankly, I think the study is a bit odd in that it places most of the blame on construction equipment. Maybe the environmental groups are trying to shake down the construction equipment manufacturers for money. Factory production and the earlier, very dirty burning of coal by power plants certainly had an impact that was equally great, if not much greater.

"Parliament’s pension fund trustees are to reconsider the rules of their investments to take account of the risk of climate change, in a first for MPs’ finances. While stopping short of a promise to fully divest from fossil fuels, the pledge by the trustees marks an important first step towards assessing and reducing the effect of the pension fund’s investments – which are ultimately paid for by the taxpayer – on climate change.  The move is a victory for a group of MPs from all parties who have long campaigned for changes that would stop the funds – which amount to more than £700m – being invested in companies that promote or benefit from fossil fuels, thus exerting economic pressure on them to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP who has been campaigning for reform of the fund, said: “Protecting the natural world is now humanity’s greatest mission, so this change of tack from the MPs’ pension fund is very welcome. It has taken four long years to get to this point, but the trustees finally now appear to accept that fossil fuels are a risky investment, both for savers and the planet, and this marks a significant change in policy.” Around the world, the divestment campaign targeting investors with large holdings in fossil fuels has gathered pace in the last five years and won notable victories. Last week, Norway’s national oil fund began to refocus on renewable energy. About two-thirds of the UK’s university pension funds, as well as other public pension funds, have also either divested or reformed their rules, though some have retained their fossil fuel focus despite strong public pressure. Other funds to have divested include the Irish infrastructure fund, the New York state pension fund, and in the UK local authorities including Waltham Forest and Southwark. The pensions of MPs are looked after by the parliamentary contributions pensionfund (PCPF). The trustees have written to Lucas, in correspondence seen by the Guardian, to confirm they will reconsider the funding guidelines to recognise the risks from climate change. The trustees have committed to asking their advisers to “prepare a climate change policy” and added that they “do wish to show ambition in this area”. They will formulate a responsible business plan, and by October update the statement of investment principles. They also said divestment would be considered alongside the option of keeping fossil fuel shareholdings in order to have a “voice” on the future direction of those companies, to put pressure on the businesses involved. Five of the top 20 investments made by the fund, representing more than £20m, are in fossil fuel companies including the UK-based BP, which makes up the biggest single shareholding by the fund. Others include Royal Dutch Shell of the UK and Netherlands, and the French company Total. Last December, more than 200 serving and former MPs from all parties, spearheaded by Lucas, called on the PCPF to phase out fossil fuel investment. Lord Deben, chair of the Committee on Climate Change and former Conservative environment secretary, called the trustees’ initiative a “positive step” and said the PCPF should follow scientific advice as the basis of its investment policies. “The PCPF should now adopt a strategy that shifts investment towards companies driving innovation in low-carbon technology, and over time remove their investments from coal, oil and gas altogether,” he said. “Aligning investment with the 1.5C aspiration of the Paris agreement is the best way to protect our prosperity for many generations to come.” Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat former secretary of state for climate change and energy, called on all pension funds to make the shift to investment in renewable energy and other low-carbon efforts. “All pension trustees ought to ensure their investments take account of climate risk, so it’s right parliament should take this initiative,” he said. “The best way is to switch funds from fossil fuels into clean technologies, as these are already highly profitable, but without the long-term carbon risk of oil, gas and coal.” Moves to divest the MPs’ fund have faced opposition in the past. When Liz Truss, one of the names mooted as a possible leader of the Conservative party, was asked by the Guardian whether she supported such a move as environment secretary in 2015, she said she opposed it."
"A US government climate change advisory group scrapped by Donald Trump has reassembled independently to call for better adaptation to the floods, wildfires and other threats that increasingly loom over American communities. The Trump administration disbanded the 15-person Advisory Committee for the Sustained National Climate Assessment in August 2017. The group, formed under Barack Obama’s presidency, provided guidance to the government based on the National Climate Assessment, a major compendium of climate science released every four years. Documents released under freedom of information laws subsequently showed the Trump administration was concerned about the ideological makeup of the panel. “It only has one member from industry, and the process to gain more balance would take a couple of years to accomplish,” wrote George Kelly, then the deputy chief of staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in a June 2017 email. The advisory group has since been resurrected, however, following an invitation from New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, and has been financially supported by Columbia University and the American Meteorological Society. It now has 20 expert members. The panel is now known as the Science to Climate Action Network (Scan) and has now completed work it would have finished for the federal government, releasing a report on Thursday warning that Americans are being put at risk from the impacts of a warming planet due to a muddled response to climate science. “We were concerned that the federal government is missing an opportunity to get better information into the hands of those who prepare for what we have already unleashed,” said Richard Moss, a member of Scan and a visiting scientist at Columbia University, who previously chaired the federal panel. “We’re only just starting to see the effects of climate change, it’s only going to get much worse. But we haven’t yet rearranged our daily affairs to adapt to science we have,” he added. The fourth National Climate Assessment, released on the day after Thanksgiving last year, detailed how climate change is already harming Americans, with sobering findings on future impacts. At the time, Trump said he didn’t believe the report. “The impacts and costs of climate change are already being felt in the United States, and changes in the likelihood or severity of some recent extreme weather events can now be attributed with increasingly higher confidence to human-caused warming,” the report, the work of 13 US government agencies, states. On current trends, the US economy is set to lose $500bn a year from crop damage, lost labor and extreme weather damages, the report found. Rainfall levels and flooding have increased in much of the country, with the amount of the US west consumed annually by wildfires set to increase as much as sixfold by 2050, according to the assessment. But these warnings have been only intermittently heeded in decisions made by cities and states across the US, due to a lack of knowledge, political will or funding. The US has no national sea level rise plan, for example, and the Trump administration has scrapped rules around building infrastructure in areas deemed vulnerable to climate change. These circumstances have led to haphazard planning that results in certain dwellings repeatedly lost to flooding or fire. “We live in an era of climate change and yet many of our systems, codes and standards have not caught up,” said Daniel Zarrilli, chief climate adviser to New York City, one of the few US cities with such a person. “Integrating climate science into everyday decisions is not just smart planning, it’s an urgent necessity.” In its new report, the Science to Climate Action Network recommends the creation of a “civil-society-based climate assessment consortium” that would combine private and public interests to provide more localized help for communities menaced by floods, wildfires or other perils. “Imagine working in state or county government – you have a road that is flooding frequently and you get three design options all with different engineering,” Moss said. “You don’t have the capacity to know what is the best option to avoid flooding, you just know what costs more. “Climate issues aren’t being raised in communities. They may know they are vulnerable but they don’t know whether to use, for example, wetlands or a flood wall to stop flooding. We need to establish best practices and guide people on how to apply that locally. “This is extremely urgent. Every year that goes by means more people losing everything from flooding and fire, including the lives of loved ones. This needs to be addressed as rapidly as possible.”"
"Our food makes up something like a quarter of our greenhouse gas footprint, and at the same time as cutting this we need to feed a growing population better than we are doing now, while rescuing our haemorrhaging biodiversity and avoiding an antibiotics crisis. There is no escaping the clear evidence that humans need to reduce their meat – especially beef and lamb – as well as dairy consumption. When we feed a soya bean to a cow, we get back only about 10% of the nutrition in beef, and it comes with a hefty dose of methane (a powerful greenhouse gas) and very likely some deforestation.  But there is no requirement for us to go all the way to either vegetarianism or veganism – it is all about the proportions. We do not even need to make all the changes overnight. We just need to start chipping away so that the proportions in our diets change radically over the next 10 or so years. And most of us can use this as an opportunity to eat more healthily.  Here is an inconvenient reality: a long-distance plane will typically burn though about 100 tonnes of fuel, turning it into almost four times that weight in carbon dioxide. Because of some complex high-altitude effects, the climate change impact of this is perhaps double what it would be if we burned that fuel on the runway. There are three options: biofuel (but the strain on our land is huge), synthetic fuels generated using solar power (but we already need all the solar power we can get), and fossil fuel counterbalanced with a mechanism for taking carbon back out of the air (but we do not yet know how to do this properly, and when we find out, we will already need to be doing this as fast as we can to mitigate non-flying climate impacts). Short-distance electric flights are almost becoming feasible but the need to save weight means that at the moment liquid hydrocarbons are the only suitable fuel for a long-haul flight. So, a bit of flying is still OK, but not as much.  Today’s global energy supply is only one seven-thousandth of the energy from the sun that lands on the planet. An area of solar panels 228 sq miles in a sunny part of the world could harness our entire global energy supply. Neither the cost nor the resource use is prohibitive. There are issues of distribution and storage, but the solutions to these problems are also coming along nicely.  The precise energy mix – plenty of solar with significant bits of wind, hydro and tidal – will vary from place to place. Australia has 200 times more sunlight per person than the UK, which is the fifth worst major country in the world on the sunlight per person stakes (ahead of Bangladesh, Belgium, the Netherlands and Rwanda). But the UK has better wind and tidal potential than most, so its energy mix will be more complex. To summarise, the transition is technically feasible if we invest enough, cap fossil fuels and moderate our energy consumption. With the right investment (made possible through redistribution from fossil fuels, and through a carbon tax, say) it is totally feasible to replace our energy supply over the next three decades. Somehow the world’s fossil fuel needs to stay in the ground. For that to happen it needs to be too expensive to extract. That requires a carbon price. I think the simplest way to achieve that is a carbon tax, although I would be happy with a cap and trade arrangement too – they have the same effect. A tax could be administered at the point of extraction, but it is also possible to levy it at the point of consumption – such as the household meter and the petrol station. What we are talking about is the creation of a huge pot of money that would fund the new green energy infrastructure, assist the countries and individuals that would otherwise stand to be losers in the transition to the low-carbon world, as well as support a suite of social and environmental goods.  Twelve billion careful people could live well together on our wonderful planet. One billion careless people can trash the place in no time. It is not just about the number of people, it is about how they live. It takes about 500 Malawians to clock up the carbon footprint of just one person in the UK. Every additional birth increases the need for everyone else to be slightly more careful. So is it bad to have kids? No. Is it responsible to have a big family? Perhaps not any more. Does it matter what lifestyle my children have? Absolutely. There are two aspects to the way people can make a difference. The first is to personally embark on more traditional low-carbon and sustainable living. It is still as important as ever because it brings integrity to everything else we do, it demonstrates commitment and, if done well, it makes it easier for everyone else to do likewise. The second is to push for the cultural and political change that we need, in every situation: how we influence our politicians (not just through our votes), and the things we say and do at work, at leisure and perhaps most challenging of all, at home. Grassroots pressure can change politics – the youth organisation Sunrise Movement has had remarkable success in pushing for the proposal of a Green New Deal in the US, forcing every Democratic hopeful to speak out on the climate. And two decades ago, the Jubilee 2000 campaign was widely credited with the cancelling of debt in developing countries.  After decades of talk and negotiation on climate change, years of personal actions and corporate targets, a mass of rhetoric, greenwash and, to be fair, occasional flashes of sincere action from the business world, there has been no dent whatsoever in the rising global carbon curve. Nothing at all. Talking about it has not been enough. Asking for it has not worked. Somehow, we have to insist. I think it needs to be thoughtfully done. The tone needs to be constructive: it is a better world we are pushing for and certainly not a violent one. How and where to take to the streets must be a deeply personal decision. But given where we have got to, and I do not write this lightly, it has to be one that each of us carefully asks. Mike Berners-Lee is the author of There is No Planet B.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe warmists continue to stay in denial about why the public isn’t buying the hoax, refusing to come to terms with the sloppy climate data behind the flakey AGW theory. Instead they prefer pretending that the public’s lack of acceptance is due to faulty communication, as illustrated by this video of Rutgers University professor Tony Broccoli.
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6L4jTypQKY&hl=de_DE&fs=1]
Read here at the Yale Forum On Climate Change And The Media.
It has finally dawned on the warmists that they’ve seriously underestimated the public’s ability to understand the issue. They’re dismayed that the public was smart enough as a whole not to fall for the hoax.
But they still think they can maybe turn things around by “communicating better”. which only means packaging and delivering the hoax in a diferent way. Now warm and extreme events are going to be called “teachable moments”. Cold and non-warming events will remain natural variability, I suppose.
Well, it’s not going to work.
Once a person sees through a hoax, there’s no way to make them go back and believe it. And it gets a lot harder the next time around because the trust is gone.
Finally, you just have got to love the question from Peach to Broccoli:
Let’s say I’m a journalist who knows nothing about climate science because all of the environmental reporters at my paper or station have been laid off. Do you have tips for me on how to grapple with climate change?
My advice: Wake up from the hoax and find real stories you know something about so that you yourself do not join the rest of the redundant journalists. View them as “teachable moments”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeo Hickman of the Guardian’s Environment blog Friday had a frustration-filled, teeth-gnashing screed where he expressed his disdain over so many skeptic blogs being nominated for the best Science & Technology Category of the Weblog Awards 0f 2013.

Source: Weblog Awards site.
He accuses the climate skeptics of “gaming” the competition because they’ve succeeded in generating so much enthusiasm.
It was tough not to gloat reading that piece. It’s indeed a good look at a sour grapes display by the increasingly defeated looking alarmist side, now that they see they have got no chance of winning. Of the five finalists, four are skeptic blogs. The sole remaining alarmist blog, Skeptical Science, has dropped out.
On the long list of 17, thirteen were climate science skeptics (including NoTricksZone).

If anything, the Weblog Awards results tell us one thing: the alarmist blogs have a very, very serious problem. The problem (for them) is that nobody is listening to their message any more. And, except for themselves, nobody else even has an inkling of enthusiasm left to nominate them, let alone to vote. They’re rapidly sinking into irrelevance.
The problem boils down to credibility. You can only cry wolf so many times before people ignore you totally and think you’ve completely lost your marbles. The hysterical shrieks of a world-ending climate collapse are looking more ridiculous today than ever, and many are finding it simply too embarrassing to be associated with.
The Guardian laments that it didn’t even know who some of the blogs on the long list were. Well, whose fault is it for that ignorance? Should we be surprised to hear this from a media outlet that appears ignorant of hundreds of peer-reviewed papers showing that CO2 is way over-hyped? If the Guardian had done its homework, it wouldn’t be standing there appearing so clueless. Reporting means getting both sides of the story, and not just the part you agree with and ignoring all the rest.
The skeptics on the other hand are energized, enthusiastic, and their numbers are growing by the day. Little wonder they are mopping up at the Weblog Awards. If a blog can generate that type on enthusiasm among readers, well, then it deserves to win. It gets down to having the ability to capture and engage an educated audience, and to do so without resorting to spectacular tabloidish claims of a dramatic global meltdown.
The alarmist/hysterical climate blogs have been so out-classed that those left (Skeptical Science) are now hightailing it out of the ring. Like when it comes to debating climate science in public, they are willing to step into the ring only if the fight is rigged in a way that ensures they’ll win – quality and science be damned.
PS: Thanks to readers for having nominated NoTricksZone. Being on the list of the top 17 is already a great success.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to climate models of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Potsdam Germany, the recent cold winters in Europe  are caused by low sea ice extent (due to AGW) in the Barents and Kara Seas. Juraj Vanovcan now has an essay that shows the opposite seems to be true. 
Debunking PIK’s Low Barents/Kara Sea Ice – Cold Winters Claim
By guest writer Juraj Vanovcan
In dealing with three consecutive cold winters in NW Europe, orthodox climatology is now doing all it can to avoid mentioning the changing trends in NAO/AO and the cooling Atlantic. Instead, various bizarre theories have been floated out – from the Big Oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico slowing down the Gulf Stream, to tremendous melting of Greenland ice sheets having the same effect. They all ignore the fact that the Gulf Stream is powered by tropical trade winds.
Fig 1 Selected areas for investigating the low ice extent – cold winter hypothesis
Another tactic that warmists have used for damage control is claiming that low sea ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea may cause changes in air circulation, thus allowing cold Arctic air to pour down to the mid-latitudes. But this theory is dubious, as we shall see. It is the prevailing direction of air circulation and not the “increased greenhouse effect” that rules the European winters.
Such attempts to tie the cold with warm elsewhere, here the alleged decrease of ice cover in a part of the Arctic, reminds us of Kevin Trenberth’s search for the “missing heat”.
Climate data are freely available via KNMI Climate Explorer, so let’s investigate the PIK claim.
Figure 1 shows the area of Barents and Kara Sea (65-80N, 10-100E), and North-West Europe (45-70N, 10W-15E), where it is being claimed low winter ice extent there is causing low winter temperatures and snow in Europe.
Figure 2 shows winter (D-J-F) ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea, combined with winter temperature anomalies over the Northwest Europe.

//-->




Eyeballing the relation between those two curves, there is a relation, but the opposite of what is claimed by PIK! For example, low winter sea ice extent in 2007 and 2008 were tied with mild European winters. Also cold winters in the mid-1980s happened despite rather high ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea. Figure 3 as follows shows the two parameters in direct relation:

Figure 3  Relation between Barents/Kara winter sea ice extent and NW European winters, 1979-2010.
Mathematicians could argue about the statistical significance of observed trend, but the trend itself is rather logical: Cold Barents/Kara Sea with more ice means cold winters in Northwest Europe. One does not know yet, where the 2010/2011 winter plot will appear on the graph above, but even if it is an outlier it will not change the overall trend.
The claim that cold European winters are caused by low ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea is therefore not supported by observed data.
Since the Arctic ice extent depends mainly on North Atlantic SST, as presented elsewhere, there is a good chance that in near future we will see remarkable growth. Figure 4 shows the North Pacific and North Atlantic SST monthly anomalies, based on Reynolds OI.v2 dataset.

Figure 4:  Monthly SST anomalies for North Pacific and North Atlantic since 1982.
There seems to be a 1-year lag between the two plots, with the Atlantic trailing the Pacific SST trend. Warm SST peak in Atlantic, observed in 2010, seems to mimic similar event in North Pacific in 2009. But Pacific SST have since dropped to levels seen only in the 80s. If the Atlantic follows, then 2011 summer sea ice extent may see a considerable gain.
Future attempts to explain increasing Arctic ice cover with warming somewhere else will no doubt raise more amusement and doubts about the ”scientific consensus”.

"The strong showing for independents and Greens on Sydney’s north shore in the New South Wales election, and the likely win for Labor in Coogee, have buoyed the two most high-profile independents contesting Sydney seats in the federal election. The independent MP for the federal seat of Wentworth, Kerryn Phelps, said the results showed the electorate was interested in strong female candidates and that climate change remained a major vote-changing issue. Phelps, who won the blue ribbon Liberal seat in October following the retirement of Malcolm Turnbull, will be contesting it again in May. The Olympian Zali Steggall is running against another former prime minister, Tony Abbott, in the northern beaches federal seat of Warringah. It is also regarded as a historically safe Liberal seat, but Abbott’s role in opposing his own party’s policies on climate change have turned off some voters in the affluent electorate. Phelps said she did not want to read too much into the state results. “There’s a big difference between the federal Liberal party and the moderate state Liberals,” she said. “But I think it shows that in the eastern suburbs climate change is a big issue, and it was said to be a big issue in Coogee.” On Sunday morning Coogee seemed likely to be the only Sydney seat to fall to Labor, although the outcome remained uncertain. The electorate overlaps with the southern part of Wentworth. The Labor candidate, Marjorie O’Neill, ran heavily on the party’s plans to address climate change at state level. “The Liberal party does not have a story to tell about how they will address climate change – in fact the story is inaction,” Phelps said. “There are people in the federal Liberals who want to continue with coal and fossil fuels, and the party depends on donations from the coal industry,” she said. “We also have to listened to the younger generation. I attended the Town Hall school rally and an in-school rally at Emmanuel college. Young people are very well informed on climate change science – they have read the IPCC reports – and they want action,” she said. Vaucluse, the other state seat overlapping with Wentworth, recorded a 5.6% swing to the Greens. Steggall said the re-election of the Berejiklian government had clarified an important local issue: the building of a tunnel from the northern beaches to alleviate congestion on the Spit Bridge. Both she and Abbott support the tunnel, but Steggall said she wanted to ensure that environmental concerns about the stacks were properly addressed. “The tunnel is Tony Abbott’s only policy, and it’s a state issue,” Steggall said. “A 13.8% swing away from the Liberals shows that the electorate wants change, and James Griffin [the Liberal MP for Manly] is a moderate and quite sensible,” she said. She also noted the 10% swing against the Liberal MP, Felicity Wilson, in North Shore, where the Mosman mayor Carolyn Corrigan won more than 20% of the primary vote as an independent. The seat overlaps with the Mosman part of Warringah."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI wasn’t really following this get-together in Lisbon, but Der Spiegel has just come out with a report about the subject tilted: The Climate War Can Continue, and there are a few interesting points. You could call it the German view. Of course, Der Spiegel used the opportunity to take some cheap shots at the sceptics – calling them conspiracy theorists and grumblers. But nothing we aren’t used to.
Yet, at least Der Spiegel admits that there are indeed “alarmists” on the other side, and that there is no consensus. So the real story here is that the sceptics are presented as a force equal to the warmists, and that it is not 98 – 2.
The fronts are deeply entrenched, pouring oil into the fire
The goal of the conference was to get both sides to take a step or two towards reconciliation. But as Der Spiegel writes, the prospects of that happening are very slim. Some participants in Lisbon even poured more oil into the already hot fire. Der Spiegel quotes Jerome Ravetz:
 The fronts in climate research are fully entrenched, says Ravetz’s diagnosis. The result is a huge credibility problem.'”
Some examples of oil in the fire, quoting Hans von Storch:
‘The sceptic side is comprised of everything from academics to confused grumblers.’ “
That didn’t go over too well with some sceptics. I don’t know if von Storch is the right guy to say such things, as he’s been doing his share of grumbling himself. Der Spiegel also wrote how comments by Steve McInytre also provoked the warmists, Spiegel provides quotes by McIntyre:
“Climate scientists have to be obligated, just like investment bankers, to make the information that support their projections public.’ “
Or else face sanctions:
‘The managers of Enron didn’t go to prison because they blew billions of dollars, but because they deceived investors by withholding information.’ “
Judith Curry on models and consensus:

‘The uncertainties in models are completely inadequately researched, and the established research is trying to hide this from the public.’ “
So the complaints, or provocations as Der Spiegel calls them, continue to be the same: the hiding of data and the inadequacy of models.
Gavin Schmidt chickens out
On Gavin Schmidt, Der Spiegel wtites: “He was invited but he declined to show up, which was probably because Steve McIntyre said he would attend.” Der Spiegel then focused in on McIntyre, recognising his important role in the climate debate and mentions his Climateaudit.org blog and how he found errors in Mann’s hockey stick. Der Spiegel took no cheap shots at McIntyre.
Von Storch on public opinion and ignoring sceptics
As sceptics have known for a long time that opinion and the science is all moving to the state of non-alarmism. Hans von Storch is quoted by Der Spiegel:
‘As knowledge increases, the percentage of people who believe that change is dangerous gets smaller.'”
And of course, the warmists and the alarmists would like nothing better than for the sceptics to go away. Or at least that they be ignored. Hans von Storch had the following to say about that strategy:
We simply cannot ignore the sceptics and think they will eventually go away. We have to discuss with them.’ “
Conference is sponsored by the EU
I wasn’t aware of this, but according to Der Spiegel, the Climate Debate Reconcilaition Conference was also sponsored by the European Commission, which has the official target of limiting global warming to 2°C, an endeavour that has been a favourite target of attack among sceptics.
In conclusion, the two sides were unable to agree on a mutual statement. And so the warmists will continue hoping that the sceptics will go away, or at least be ignored. Unfortunately for the warmists, the sceptics are going to do just the opposite, as surveys have shown. More and more are going to come, and they are going to get a lot louder. So much so that it will be impossible to ignore them.

"Children born today will have to live their lives with drastically smaller carbon footprints than their grandparents if climate change is to be controlled. Fast, deep cuts in global emissions from energy, transport and food are needed to keep temperature rises in check and an analysis has shown this means the new generation will have lifetime carbon budgets almost 90% lower than someone born in 1950. The data dramatically highlighted the burden inherited by today’s children, an issue at the heart of the global school strikes for climate. Another major strike will take place in more than 70 nations on Friday. “Those in positions of power – from politicians to business leaders – that have benefited from a much higher lifetime carbon budget have a duty to act to ensure a liveable planet for current and future generations,” said Jake Woodier at the UK Student Climate Network, which is supporting the strikes. “Without appropriate action, those in power are sacrificing our tomorrow for their today.” The new analysis by the climate analysts Carbon Brief combines data on emissions and population changes with climate models. It then calculates how much the average citizen on Earth can emit over their lifetime to keep temperature rises below 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the world’s nations to avoid climate catastrophe. Previous and existing generations have emitted nearly all the carbon dioxide needed to take the world to 1.5C or 2C, meaning future generations will have to severely cut the emissions from flying, meat consumption and other activities in their lifetimes. The children and young people taking part in the youth strikes (born 1997-2012) will have carbon budgets just one sixth those of their baby boomer grandparents (1946-1964). “As protests by school children increase each week around the world, our analysis starkly highlights the intergenerational injustice of climate change,” said Leo Hickman, editor of Carbon Brief. “If warming is to be limited to safe levels, today’s children are going to have to greatly curtail their own lifetime emissions compared to older generations.” The idea for the analysis came from Ben Caldecott, at the University of Oxford’s Sustainable Finance Programme. He said it is the first systematic use of emissions data to inform the debate about intergenerational responsibility for climate change and had produced some “uncomfortable numbers”. “The purpose is not to fan the flames of rising intergenerational angst, but rather to provide some objective analysis to support dialogue between generations within countries and across them so we can tackle climate change,” he said. “The results will feed into intergenerational equity debates, for example in terms of access to housing, the availability of pensions, rising university tuition fees, changing retirement ages.” There is a currently a wide gap between the average annual emissions of a US citizen (16.9 tonnes) and an Indian citizen (1.9 tonnes). The analysis showing that children born now would have a lifetime carbon budget 90% lower than their grandparents assumes the relative gap would remain. But in a second analysis, Carbon Brief posited a future carbon budget that would be the same for every citizen on the planet. This would mean that the budget for a child born today in the US is even lower, 97% lower than that of that of their grandparents. For someone born today in Europe, their budget would be 94% lower. “That those born today only have a carbon budget a fraction of the size of those from previous generations exemplifies the need for a transformative approach that puts social and economic justice at the heart of plans to tackle the climate crisis,” said Woodier. “We need massive investment in people and planet to transform our economies, and we need it urgently.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Mitteldeutsche Zeitung (Central German Newspaper) reports on Europe’s extended brutal winter. In today’s online article, it reminds us that the cold is not only a phenomenon that is isolated in Central Europe, but one that is widespread and extends all the way across Russia to Siberia.
The article writes that there’s lots of data showing that March, 2013, was a record cold month, citing German meteorologist Dominik Jung
In northeast Germany, March 2013 was even the coldest March in 130 years. However, not only Germany and wide areas of Europe suffered from the cold wave reports Dominik Jung: ‘Quite to the contrary, the dramatic negative temperature deviations from the 1981 -2010 longterm mean were widespread across western, central, eastern Europe, all the way to Siberia.‘  Moreover, there were many regions in North and South America where it was very cold. … the cold in Germany was no single isolated case here.”
I never knew global warming could cause such widespread cold.  I thought it was supposed to make things warmer.

"Prevention is better than the cure. No, it is not an argument about the merits of late-70s goth bands, but a medieval wisdom that seems to get more apposite with every year. Indeed, it is an idea that is not only relevant to human health, as the Upside team found out this week. When it comes to terrorism, Kenya is discovering that preventing radicalisation is a far better option than trying to “cure” it, as Jason Burke reported. With animal extinctions, of course, there is no cure, so it is prevention or nothing. New research has suggested a rather brutal way to forestall the extinction of about 10% of the world’s threatened species. Preventing climate change will likely be a much more effective strategy than trying to reverse it further down the line. There is much to be done. But at least some numbers are moving in the right direction, as per the latest data from the UK this week. Contraception is arguably one of the biggest prevention programmes in the history of mankind, though it has of course been womankind that has largely shouldered the burden. But for how much longer? And finally, when it comes to mental health, prevention is an essential part of the strategy. Fortunately there are a dizzying array of digital tools to help with this now. Ammar Kalia found out if they are any good. The CNN article about the Kenyan teacher who gives away 80% of his salary to the poor – and has now been rewarded with a $1m prize. Also, this surprising Vox article about what happened when Ecuador legalised gangs. What do you think happened – did the murder rate go up or down? The mentoring program in Mombasa is an interesting approach. You might also want to know about the Friends Church Peace Team, led by Peter Serete, which works in areas of conflict to create cultures of cooperation and non-violence. I believe they have a Facebook presence. Margaret Katranides, via email On the article about mental health apps, a few things really stood out as things we see as well: • People love the anonymity. • You *CAN* help people through an app, but you are always limited • Any “unnatural” mistake in conversation feels very jarring to the end user. • It doesn’t have to be about treatment but can be about boosting *everyday* mental health (this is what we promote -- be a little more content / a little happier, vs. “treat a disease”) Mike Nolet from LiveBetter, via email In south London, where a fine piece of investigative reporting by my colleague Harriet Grant resulted in an egregious injustice – a ban on poor children using a playground – being overturned.

"Faced with unprecedented challenges, politicians appear more divided than ever – that’s why Labour’s Clive Lewis and I are doing something bold. We are jointly tabling a bill in parliament designed to address two of the greatest threats we face – climate breakdown and spiralling inequality. Our bill would introduce a “green new deal” – an unprecedented mobilisation of resources invested to prevent climate breakdown, reverse inequality, and heal our communities. It demands major structural changes in our approach to the ecosystem, coupled with a radical transformation of the finance sector and the economy, to deliver both social justice and a livable planet. It’s an idea congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has recently reinvigorated in the US. And it could scarcely be more urgent. The UN’s top scientists have warned we have just 11 years to halve global emissions and avoid climate catastrophe. Global wildlife populations have collapsed by nearly 60% in our lifetimes. This has led 1.4 million young people to join the inspiring global school strikes movement to demand change. The response from ministers? To continue to force fracking on local communities, and to hand millions in tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry. Last week, unbelievably, a new coal mine was given a green-light on their watch.  The UK is also host to grotesque levels of inequality. More than 4 million children are living in poverty. Two-thirds of the country’s highest earners live in London and the south-east, while northern areas have been hit hardest by austerity and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says incomes of the poorest 20% fell in 2018. The prime minister’s announcement that austerity is coming to an end was a lie. Benefits for the poorest remain frozen, millions are still struggling to get by on universal credit, and headteachers are still having to cut crucial staff to keep the lights on in our schools. The response to these crises must be nothing short of a transformation of our economy, our environment and our constituents’ lives. The green new deal would launch an unprecedented programme of investment in clean energy, warm homes, affordable public transport, sustainable farming, and restored natural habitats – delivering a decent, well-paid job to everyone who wants one. It would force the government to finally start paying attention to once proud communities that have been hollowed out through de-industrialisation and austerity – and empower them to take up the opportunities of new zero-carbon industries. This once-in-a-lifetime government intervention would involve a 10-year strategy to completely and rapidly decarbonise our economy – as well as massively reduce economic inequality. It is not good enough to tinker with the status quo – we must reprogramme our economy so that it works for everyone. It’s about sharing our country’s wealth fairly and acknowledging that our planet’s finite resources cannot magically regenerate in an instant. This is purposely radical territory. We must push the boundaries of what is seen as politically possible. Because climate justice and social justice go hand in hand. It is the poorest who will bear the brunt of the fires, the floods, the storms and the droughts that come with climate breakdown, and it is the forests and wildlife of the global south that are being devastated to generate profits for the global north. And it is the young who will pay the highest price for our generation’s throwaway economy. Greater market regulation will be key to tackling the terrifying threat of planetary collapse. We have always known that markets can only thrive if they are managed and accountable to the societies in which they operate. Once monetary and financial systems regain their role as servants – not masters – to the real economy, then it will be possible to mobilise the financial resources to support the most urgent of challenges: the transformation of the economy away from its dependence on carbon, creating hundreds of thousands of good-quality jobs in the process. We know it can be done, because it has been done before, when singlehandedly, and almost overnight on the day of his inauguration, President Roosevelt dismantled the globalised financial system known as the gold standard. This freed his administration from the shackles of Wall Street and enabled him to tackle the ecological crisis that was the dust bowl, as well as America’s crisis of unemployment. In this moment of crisis, political idleness is unforgivable. When it comes to climate breakdown and spiralling inequality, doing nothing has consequences. By choosing to incentivise business as usual, to withhold investment from our communities, our government is robbing our young people of a future. Instead MPs from all parties must choose action – not to score political points or to make the other side look bad – but to deliver the hope people need. Parliament must get behind our bill to deliver a green new deal. • Caroline Lucas is the MP for Brighton Pavilion"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe price of bad science. 
First off, I want to thank the readers who have joined in on the CLIMATE BET whereby the winnings will be donated to a charity for children in dire need, yet to be decided.
So far us 11 coolists have bet $300 in total that 2011 – 2020 will be cooler than the last decade.
It seems that our warmist opponent “Robhon” has mustered the courage and revealed his name: Rob Honeycutt. I ask myself where could all that cockiness and confidence come from?
Turns out he’s a regular at the warmist blogs, like Skeptical Science. Anyone that spends time with such sources of “information” undoubtedly will develop the beliefs that he now holds. In fact I found a post Honeycutt wrote himself at Skeptical Science called:
Kung fu climate.
He really believes in that hockey stick. I wonder if he really knows what he is getting himself into with this bet – he has committed $5000! I have no reason to doubt that he is serious about it and that he will pay if he loses. But that’s a lotta money. Either you have to be very rich, or cock-sure you’re gonna win.
The next decade is likely going to teach him a lot about climate science. We’ll see how cocky he’ll be in 10 years. It could be that it will get warmer. But if it does, it will not be because of a few molecules more of a trace gas. No, the odds are that it’s going to cool. As we have seen, more and more scientists are expecting cooling. The ocean cycles have reversed, and so the climate has begun to do the same in tow. The sun is sleepy too.
My bet with a similar warmist five years ago

Exactly five years ago I also made a bet with a warmist who also was cock-sure it was going to get warmer. Like Rob, this person was convinced that man was heating up the planet. But I told him it was mostly due to natural causes, and that we’d see cooling in the years ahead. So we bet as follows:
If the average temperature for the next five years (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010) is warmer than the average of 2005, then I lose the bet. But if the average of 2005 is warmer then the next five years, then I win the bet.
The amount: If it cooled, then he would pay me 6 bottles of red, dry wine. If it warmed, then I would have to give him 6 bottles of Scottish whiskey (I like a fair bet).
Back then we did not stipulate which dataset to use to decide the winner. But I think using the average of all four, i.e. UAH MSU, RSS, GISS, and HadCrut, would be the way to go.
I haven’t run through the calculations in detail, but I see a slight downward trend. The 2010 El Nino made it really close, but was not enough in the end. As you can see the 2007/2008 El Nino ruined the warming trend (damn models didn’t see that).
Some people have to learn the hard way. Glass of red wine anyone?
—————————————————————-
UPDATE: I don’t want to give the impression that Rob Honeycutt is impolite or anything. He has a view and he rightfully asserts it. So far he has been very polite and cordial here. As I mentioned, I’m just impressed by his confidence.
UPDATE  2: The warmist has conceded defeat (2005 was warmer than the 2006-2010 average) and I have  gotten my bottles of wine. I expect a similar outcome in 2021.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is a story on how some good ol boys are pushing extreme scenarios to make big money.
Fiduciary duty is getting thrown overboard by banks, insurance companies and investment houses as they race to capitalize on carbon schemes and the “green economy” – all under the guise of “saving the planet”. 
When large financial institutions like banks, insurance companies or investment houses invite leading catastrophists to give speeches for the purpose of spreading fear among clients, and ignore the vast volume of science that indicates the contrary, then they are breaching their fiduciary duty to these clients.
Has bank-sponsored climate-fear-mongering become the new way of exercising fiduciary duty to clients? Seems so.
The OLB invites a climate extremist to speak to clients
A short time ago I got a brochure in the mail from my house bank, the Oldenburgische Landesbank (OLB). The brochure features distinguished speakers from media, politics, industry and science who are slated to give speeches during the year, all part of the OLB Forum. Being both a private and business clientof the OLB, I got this brochure too.
When I looked at the brochure I was dismayed to learn that one of the speakers this year is none other than the Merchant of Doom himself – Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research. He is scheduled by the OLB Forum to give a speech in Osnabrück on October 12:
Die Klmakrise (The Climate Crisis) 
Wednesday, 12 October 2011, Osnabrück, 19:00 h
Speech by Prof. Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, Director of the Earth Systems Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, on the state of the science on climate change.
Needless to say, I was not pleased to learn that my house-bank is getting into end-of-the world scenarios and working with such science salesmen. Banks pushing end-of-the-world scenarios, chronic pessimism and fear-mongering are not in my best interest, and certainly not in the best interest of many other businesses.
“What’s going on?” I thought.  Either the OLB is very naive, or is in the scam to make big money. Gee, I wonder which?
My call to the OLB
So I picked up the phone and reached a middle manager (little customers don’t reach the top brass) and expressed my displeasure over their invitation of Rahmstorf. I asked the OLB lady on the phone if the bank was aware of his extreme positions and his scientific intolerance. She said the bank was not aware of anything unusual and that they simply thought the distinguished Professor Rahmstorf would be interesting to have as a speaker. All very innocent sounding.
I explained to her how extreme Rahmstorf views are, but this all seemed foreign to her – after all she’s a banker, and not trained in science. I also sent a few reports and suggestions for alternative speakers that I think ought to appear to balance things out, but got no feedback. Overall I was a dissatisfied with the OLB’s response, attitude and dismissiveness. They just don’t want to be bothered by it. That’s why I decided to do a little research and write this post.
Surely the OLB top management is fully aware of Rahmstorf’s extreme scientific views. His invitation is no accident; it’s by design. Banks are salivating over the prospects of making the big profits that the green movement promises, clients be damned. Let them meet Rahmstorf and get to know the fury of man-made climate change up close and personal.
OLB is 64.3% owned by insurance giant Allianz 
Who really stands to gain from the climate crisis scenario and cutting carbon emissions? Overwhelmingly the answer is: investment banks, re-insurers and financial institutions, among others. They are all maneuvering to cash in big time at the expense of many small businesses and the working class, who will have to pay through the nose. Banks are focused on their interests first and then on the interests of its clients.  That’s the reality. There’s a saying about bankers:
When the sun shines, they give you an umbrella. And when it rains, they take it away.”
The OLB invited Rahmstorf because his horror scenarios help to herd investors in a certain investment direction and mindset. Considering the vast array of investment instruments that the low carbon-economy presents for some, there’s a real incentive to spread doom and gloom over the future of the climate.
The OLB purposely got Rahmstorf for the task of performing his magic with OLB corporate clients. Looking deeper into the OLB, one finds that the staid, conservative bank is majority-owned by insurance and financial powerhouse Allianz. And Allianz’s reinsurance arm Allianz SE Reinsurance stands to profit handsomely from higher insurance premiums based on Rahmstorf’s future climate threats.
But aren’t insurance institutions, banks, etc. obligated to inform their potential clients about the other side of the science, and thus the risks of green investments? Not if they want to make tons of money doing so. They’ll be more than happy to watch clients panic and buy up the green investments, carbon credits and accept higher insurance premiums. So tell the clients only what they really need to know, i.e. the world will end unless you pay green.
Rahmstorf: hired merchant of doom for re-insurers
Stefan Rahmstorf, distinguished professor of climate science of the renown Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research will give them the latest on the state of the climate (crisis).

He’ll instill the fear of catastrophic climate change that’s needed to generate acceptance. Surely they’ll believe him and do what is necessary to save the planet. The problem is that Rahmstorf fancies himself as a prophet who is not to be questioned. And who is going to? And as long as large institutions stand to profit from it all, questions aren’t likely to be raised.
And whenever one sees promotional literature from the world’s largest reinsurer, Munich Re, Rahmstorf’s name appears. He’s the European bank and reinsurer industry’s top man – their salesman for gloomy scenarios. Read klimaskeptiker (German).
With this in the backdrop, the Munich Re has a special fondness for the PIK climatologists. The klimaskeptiker writes:
The climatologists produce the most wonderful horror scenarios, which appear to be indisputable proof and prognoses that man is faced with many more and much worse natural catastrophes in the future. With this seemingly unavoidable and fast approaching catastrophe, politics can be driven and customers can be duped into thinking that higher insurance premiums are essential because the damage will be much higher in the future.”
Also read here a paper written by Rahmstorf for Munich Re called: Abrupt Climate Change (in German).
Surprise! Allianz is trading in carbon too
Moreover, Allianz is heavy into carbon trading. Its website writes:
Carbon markets have grown rapidly in the past few years and play a central role in global activities involving climate change today. In 2008, the volume of traded certificates totaled four billion tons of CO2. The global carbon market will also continue to experience strong growth far beyond the boundaries of the European Union over the coming years.”
Of course banks and financial institutions are allowed to pursue profits and their interests, but must do so while fulfilling their fiduciary duty to clients, and act in the best interest of society. Indeed the OLB, and surely a huge number of other banks with it, are going down a questionable path, especially when one takes a look at the complete body of climate science, and not only the extreme science of Stefan Rahmstorf. For now they are claiming to be working for the good of society by claiming it’s to protect the climate. Of course this is based on dubious science, and they refuse to look at any science that shows the contrary.
OLB and corporate misogyny?
And probing a little deeper into the OLB, one sees they are also neglecting more than just their fiduciary duties to clients, but that they’ve also abandoned their social responsibility to half of the German population (women). It’s indeed quite the good ol boys club. Misogyny is probably too strong a word of course, but when one looks at the top management of the OLB, one can only conclude that top managenment is no place for a lady.
There is not a single molecule of estrogen to be found there. On its Board of Directors, 0 of 5 are women. Its Supervisory Board  is not any better: 0 of 13 are women. And here’s the page with its notable employees, the movers and shakers in the bank: a whopping 0 of 24 are women!
You mean to tell me there is not a single German woman out there that can do the job? No corporation in Scandinavia, North America and in many other European countries would ever get away with this level of chauvinism.
I know of a lot of women’s groups who might not be too impressed by these figures.
It has to be pointed out that the Oldenburg region is a very traditional and conservative area. But we are also living in the year 2011 and not in the Dark Ages. Hard to believe that this absence has gone unnoticed.
The OLB also has an advisory council: here of 61 members only 6 are women. So we’ve got a good ol boys’ club here. After all, they are only helping to rescue the climate. They got Rahmstorf on board to certify the science.
Final comments
Don’t get me wrong. My family has been served very well as clients by the OLB for over 15 years, and we want to continue doing business with the bank. But it is becoming increasingly obvious that the OLB has to change its way of running things. The OLB is not alone here. I’m sure the situation is hardly better at the other German banks. So I’m not advocating clients to boycott. We just want to see BALANCE.
I preregistered to see Rahmstorf’s climate spook-show. If any NTZ readers in the area are OLB customers, do sign up. Who knows, maybe they’ll be a few skeptics there to balance the discussion.

" Cuts to carbon emissions from vehicle efficiency standards have been left out of government projections for meeting Australia’s Paris climate commitments, indicating the policy has been shelved. The office of the transport minister, Michael McCormack, said the government had not made a decision on “how or when” standards to cut carbon pollution from vehicles might be implemented.  After almost five years of submissionsa spokesman said the government “is not going to rush into a regulatory solution” with regards to vehicle emissions. New data shows Australia’s emissions from transport are soaring and projected to be 82% higher in 2030 than they were in 1990. Australia lags behind the rest of the world in setting vehicle efficiency standards, with most countries in the OECD adopting policies to reduce emissions and improve the efficiency of cars. The ministerial forum on vehicle emissions was set up under the Turnbull government in 2015, and stakeholders are frustrated at the lack of progress. Fact sheets produced by the government that set out how it intends to reach Australia’s emissions reduction targets under the Paris agreement suggest any policy on vehicle emissions standards has been abandoned. In 2015, the government produced a graph indicating it expected to achieve cuts of about 100m tonnes between 2020 and 2030 through vehicle emissions standards. The government’s latest climate package contains no mention of this, and projects only about 10m tonnes of abatement through an electric vehicle strategy, with no reference to vehicle emissions standards. The Victorian government asked what progress had been made on vehicle standards at the December meeting of environment ministers, but its questions were dismissed, sources told Guardian Australia. Environment groups and the automotive lobby have asked for clarity before the election. The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, said it had hoped for more progress towards cleaning up the “woefully dirty” national car fleet. “But 18 months of radio silence and the removal of proposed standards from pollution abatement estimates out to 2030 strongly suggests the government now has no intention of establishing them.” In 2017, interest groups consulted as part of the ministerial forum were sent a model proposing a standard of 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre for Australian light vehicles, phased in from 2020 to 2025. The proposal would have brought Australia broadly into line with vehicle standards in the US and was forecast to deliver a net economic benefit of $13.9bn. But it faced opposition from the National party and the automotive lobby, and was painted as a carbon tax on cars. The independent senator Tim Storer, who chaired a Senate inquiry into electric vehicles last year, said the lack of progress was “embarrassing”, given there was “clear evidence of cost benefit” in bringing in the standards. Labor’s climate policy, due to be announced soon, is expected to point to a target of 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre. The Greens have proposed vehicle emissions standards “that lead up to a complete ban on new internal combustion vehicles by 2030”. The chief executive of the Australian Automobile Association, Michael Bradley, said the industry wanted both sides of politics to make their positions clear, but the AAA remained opposed to the 2017 model. “We’re supportive of an emissions standard but we’re supportive of one that’s reflective of Australians’ vehicle preferences and our market,” Bradley said. A spokesman for McCormack said the ministerial forum was exploring ways to encourage the uptake of electric and low emissions vehicles. “The government has not made a decision on how or when noxious emission or fuel efficiency standards may be implemented,” he said. “It is interested in developing a sensible framework that places savings for motorists and health benefits for the community front and centre while ensuring that the vehicles that Australians enjoy and love remain in the market.” He added: “The government is not going to rush into a regulatory solution, especially where it has the potential to increase the up-front costs of motor vehicles for Australians”. Much of the focus on Australia’s carbon emissions has been on the electricity sector. But climate scientists and environment groups have been calling for more attention to carbon pollution from other industries. Transport accounts for 18% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions, making it the second largest source. Modelling produced by climate scientist Bill Hare for the Australian Conservation Foundation shows emissions from transport are climbing fast and are projected to be 82% higher in 2030 than they were in 1990. Cars represent the largest source of transport emissions and have grown by 25% since 1990. Nearly 80% of new light duty vehicles sold globally, including in China, Japan, India, UK, the US and the EU, are subject to emission or fuel economy standards, while Australia has failed to implement any policy. “Australia is almost alone in not having any motor vehicle emissions standards for carbon dioxide and/or vehicle efficiency standards for litres per 100km,” Hare said. “That means that vehicles in Australia are much more inefficient and more costly to run than in the US or Europe or Japan.” Sarah Fumei, the project manager for ClimateWorks, said the federal government’s own estimates showed emissions from the transport sector would grow by a further 9% from 2018 to 2030. She said introducing standards would be “a win-win policy” for the environment and motorists’ hip pockets. “The Australian government should implement the strongest standard put forward in the 2016 Regulatory Impact Statement, which by 2030 would save motorists $500 a year on fuel and reduce emissions by 12m tonnes,” she said. “Weaker standards will not achieve the same benefits.”    "
"Academics have mapped out a network of sanctuaries they say are required to save the world’s oceans, protect wildlife and fight climate breakdown. The study, ahead of a historic vote at the UN, sets out the first detailed plan of how countries can protect over a third of the world’s oceans by 2030, a target scientists and policy makers say is crucial in order to safeguard marine ecosystems and help mitigate the impacts of a rapidly heating world. “The speed at which the high seas have been depleted of some of their most spectacular and iconic wildlife has taken the world by surprise,” said co-author Prof Callum Roberts from the University of York. “This report shows how protected areas could be rolled out across international waters to create a net of protection that will help save species from extinction and help them survive in our fast-changing world.” The campaign to protect to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030 was backed by the UK government last year. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, welcomed the report, which is the result of a year-long collaboration between academics at York and Oxford universities and environmental group Greenpeace. “From climate change to overfishing, the world’s oceans are facing an unprecedented set of challenges,” said Gove. “It is now more important than ever to take action and ensure our seas are healthy, abundant and resilient. I join Greenpeace in calling for the UK and other countries to work together towards a UN High Seas Treaty that would pave the way to protect at least 30% of the world’s ocean by 2030.” Experts say that in addition to a wealth of marine life and complex ecosystems, the high seas – those waters beyond national boundaries – play a key role in regulating the earth’s climate, driving the ocean’s biological pump that captures huge amounts of carbon at the surface and stores it in the oceans’ depths. Without this process, they warn the atmosphere would contain 50% more carbon dioxide and become too hot to support human life. However, in recent decades, oceans have faced growing exploitation from a handful of mainly wealthy nations with intensive fishing and deep seabed mining combining with climate change, acidification and pollution to put marine ecosystems under serious threat – with potentially devastating consequences for the survival of humanity. The report breaks global oceans – which cover almost half the planet – into 25,000 squares of 100x100 km, and then maps 458 different conservation features including wildlife, habitats and key oceanographic features. Finally academics have modelled hundreds of scenarios for what a planet-wide network of ocean sanctuaries, free from harmful human activity, would look like. The move comes as the UN is hammering out the details of a new Global Ocean Treaty – a legal framework which would allow the creation of high seas ocean sanctuaries. The first of four UN meetings was held in September 2018, and a final decision on the treaty is expected next year. Report co-author Prof Alex Rogers, from the University of Oxford, said: “Creating marine reserves is critical to protecting and conserving the diversity of marine life. The report puts forward a credible design for a global network of marine protected areas in the high seas based on knowledge accumulated over years by marine ecologists on the distribution of species, including those threatened with extinction, habitats known to be hotspots of biodiversity and unique ecosystems.” Speaking from negotiations at the UN, Dr Sandra Schoettner from Greenpeace’s global ocean sanctuaries campaignsaid climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing and pollution, meant oceans “are under threat like never before”. “We urgently need to protect at least a third of our oceans by 2030, and what’s so exciting about this research is that it shows it is entirely possible to design and create a robust, planet-wide network of ocean sanctuaries,” she said. “This is a blueprint for ocean protection that would safeguard the full spectrum of marine life, help tackle the crisis facing our oceans and enable their recovery.” Schoettner said passing a UN Ocean Treaty next year would be a huge step in creating a sustainable planet as long as it has “the teeth to realise a network of ocean sanctuaries” that were “off-limits to harmful human activities”. “This would give wildlife and habitats space not only to recover but to flourish,” said Schoettner. “Our oceans are in crisis, but all we need is the political will to protect them before it’s too late.”"
"The world faces two existential crises, developing with terrifying speed: climate breakdown and ecological breakdown. Neither is being addressed with the urgency needed to prevent our life-support systems from spiralling into collapse. We are writing to champion a thrilling but neglected approach to averting climate chaos while defending the living world: natural climate solutions. This means drawing carbon dioxide out of the air by protecting and restoring ecosystems.  By defending, restoring and re-establishing forests, peatlands, mangroves, salt marshes, natural seabeds and other crucial ecosystems, large amounts of carbon can be removed from the air and stored. At the same time, the protection and restoration of these ecosystems can help minimise a sixth great extinction, while enhancing local people’s resilience against climate disaster. Defending the living world and defending the climate are, in many cases, one and the same. This potential has so far been largely overlooked. We call on governments to support natural climate solutions with an urgent programme of research, funding and political commitment. It is essential that they work with the guidance and free, prior and informed consent of indigenous people and other local communities. This approach should not be used as a substitute for the rapid and comprehensive decarbonisation of industrial economies. A committed and well-funded programme to address all the causes of climate chaos, including natural climate solutions, could help us hold the heating of the planet below 1.5C. We ask that they are deployed with the urgency these crises demand.

"New analysis shows 22 of Australia’s largest companies are actively working to undermine the Paris agreement targets, betting shareholders’ money on strategies that assume global climate change action fails. Investor action group Market Forces says those companies – worth a combined $121bn and representing 7% of the ASX300 – are “out of line and out of time” and has called on shareholders to divest their holdings.  The group’s legal analyst, Will van de Pol, said it was the first time Market Forces had “named names” and called out companies whose business strategies relied on the world failing to meet the Paris targets to restrict the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. “A handful of Australian companies are undermining efforts to limit global warming by pursuing new fossil fuel projects, or basing their business plans on energy projection scenarios that would doom the Paris agreement to failure,” the report says. “These companies have now been given more than three years to align their business with the Paris goals, but have dismissed the notion.” The list of “uninvestables” includes mainly resource and energy companies, but also diversified investment vehicles including WH Soul Pattinson and Seven Group Holdings. The Market Forces study found that 199 ASX300 companies, representing 64% of total market capitalisation, faced heightened transitional climate risk but had not yet demonstrated business strategies consistent with the Paris agreement. There were 143 companies with policies “not overtly inconsistent with Paris”, and just eight had aligned their strategy with the agreement. Three companies – AGL, Origin and BHP – earned a reprieve from the list of the worst offenders, despite acting in a similar manner, because Market Forces said they had shown some progress towards aligning their goals with Paris. In recent years, the boardroom has become an increasingly important front for climate activism. This month, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, announced it would divest from firms that explored for oil and gas. Last month, Glencore said it would no longer back new coalmines in response to investor calls for the company to act on climate change. Pressure is also increasing on Australian companies, though many still refuse to even consider the financial risk posed to their businesses by climate change. In September, a report from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said “the law requires” relevant companies to “include a discussion of climate risk” in their annual report. In February, the Asic corporate governance council released new recommendations that directors and companies should make climate risk disclosures. The Market Forces report singled out “coal cowboys” Whitehaven and New Hope, which it said had plans to establish new coalmines, or expand existing ones, based on forecasts that assume the failure of Paris. Oil and gas companies Woodside, Santos and Oil Search had each “faced increased investor engagement over climate change in recent years, but this has done nothing to dissuade their plans to increase fossil fuel production”, the report said. “Investors determined to play their part in the fight against runaway climate change must immediately reallocate capital away from these companies.”"

"From Cyclone Idai, which has killed hundreds in south-east Africa, to flooding in Bangladesh – where my family is from – for decades climate change has been devastating communities in the global south. More recently these effects have begun to be felt by people in the UK too: just last month, wildfires raged on Saddleworth Moor, while where I live in Brixton, the air is so polluted I suffer from breathing problems. We all know that the impact of climate change is felt unequally, depending on where you live, how wealthy you are and how easily you can shield yourself from its effects. Less widely known, however, is that responsibility for the crisis is unequal too. In recent years we have been sold a lie: that ordinary people are to blame for the climate crisis. It’s our spending and our consumption habits that have created the mess we’re in, we are told, not the bankers, oil companies and a rich elite.  French president Emmanuel Macron’s fuel tax, which sparked the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement into life, exemplified this approach. The tax attacked the rural working poor – ordinary people are being pitted against planet. But there is another way. The truth is that the crises we face – economic, social and ecological – are the fault of an economic system that serves the few, not the majority. The rich have become richer, while austerity has hollowed out Britain, and the ecosystems sustaining life have been devastated. At the pinnacle of this system stands the fossil fuel industry. A report last year showed that just 100 companies have been responsible for over 70% of the world’s carbon emissions since 1988. The fossil fuel industry has wrecked the planet, while enacting violence and devastation across the global south. They brought about this crisis, and they should be the ones to pay for it. But fossil fuel companies aren’t the only ones to blame here. These companies are only able to finance their mines and oilfields with the help of banks. And believe it or not, these banks are increasing their financing for fossil fuel companies. A decade ago they crashed the economy; now they’re crashing the planet. According to the Banking on Climate Change report, the worst offender in Europe is Barclays. Since the Paris agreement was signed at the end of 2015, Barclays has funded the fossil fuel industry to the tune of $85bn, from fracking and coal here in Britain to the Dakota Access pipeline in North America. In each case this funding has been integral to fossil fuel companies undertaking ecocidal projects, sometimes forcefully, against the wishes of local communities. If we can pressure Barclays into stopping its fossil fuel finance, we will throw a spanner in the workings of a capitalist machine intent on extracting profit by any means, even at the expense of the planet. That’s why today, Momentum members around the country are launching a new campaign to bankrupt climate change and stop Barclays funding the fossil fuel industry. With over 40 creative direct actions planned at Barclays branches on the first day of the campaign alone, we will put huge political pressure on the bank to end its key role in financing climate chaos. In doing so, we are drawing on a rich history of protest. In the 1980s British students campaigned for Barclays to withdraw from apartheid South Africa – and won. More recently French campaigners successfully pressured banks into stopping funding coal projects. And just last month, renters’ unions across the UK, including Acorn, forced NatWest to drop a policy discriminating against welfare claimants. Our campaign can succeed too, especially in the context of an upsurge in climate activism. From the inspiring youth climate strikes, to the push for structural change by the Sunrise Movement in the US and Labour for a Green New Deal in the UK, people across the world are demanding not just the decarbonisation of our economies, but the transformation of the very basis of our societies too. Ordinary people will no longer accept the many being punished for the crimes of the few who caused the climate crisis. Instead, we’re pointing the finger squarely at the oil barons, the fossil fuel executives, and the corporate elites – and demanding something better. • Seema Syeda is a Momentum activist based in London"

When people believe they have ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE, with no test in reality, this is how they behave.
Every judgement in science stands on the edge of error, and is personal.

Hopefully other blogs, especially those who can really make a difference, can join in as well. We are only asking for a voice in the discussion, that’s all.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDo you recall Lockwood’s paper?
Central Europeans right now are scratching their heads, wondering how on Earth they are still shoveling snow past Easter. March in Germany, according to the German Weather Service DWD, was the 6th coldest since measurements began in 1881. Britain has just seen it’s coldest March in 100 years. In fact over the last few winters hundreds of cold and snowfall records have been shattered.
Lockwood wasn’t alone in suspecting that climate is profoundly impacted by the sun. Now is a good time to recall these findings from scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research working with Lockwood, from a little less than 3 years ago in 2010. 3Sat television quoted MPI scientist Sami Solanki in 2010:
There hasn’t been sunspots and thus no activity on the sun for three years. Solar activity is on the increase, but it is completely unclear if the sun will reach the same level of activity we saw over the last decades. If it does, then it is improbable we will again have extreme cold winters, if our statistical analysis proves right. If it doesn’t, then everything is open.”
Lockwood and the Max-Planck Institute scientists had examined weather and solar data going back all the way to 1659. Statistically they found a correlation that CO2 proponents could only dream of. When solar activity was low, the climate in Great Britain was 0.5°C cooler. And when solar activity was high, the climate was warmer.
The reason, the scientists explain, is that low solar activity could lead to changes to the winds in the troposphere. The researchers assume that when the stratosphere above it heats up only weakly, the mild strong winds from the Atlantic break off in the troposphere. Great Britain and Central Europe are then exposed to the influence of cold winds from the North East instead. The exact mechanism is still unclear, however.

3Sat (2010) then added:
Whether the coming winter will also be bitter cold, the Max Planck scientists don’t know. Their results are purely statistical. They only indicate a trend.”
Well, three critical winters have since joined the data set: How were these 3 winters?  Not just one bitter cold winter followed, but three more in a row! Right now it’s April and Central Europeans are still shoveling snow!
With 350 years of data, we can safely assume that there is very likely much more behind solar activity and the global climate, and that many CO2 alarmist scientists know it too. That’s why months later they concocted the ludicrous quackery that missing Arctic sea ice in September refrigerates the entire northern hemisphere months later in the wintertime.
Some will claim it’s only a regional phenomenon! Wrong. The link between solar activity and climate has been shown to be profound not just in Europe but at every corner of the globe, and that by dozens, if not hundreds, of peer-reviewed studies.

Here are the temperature forecasts for the next 16 days for most continents and regions. Many are forecast to be below normal. As you click on each link below, you’re going to be seeing blue (except for Canada). But in the period 10-18 January, Canada too is going to cool down from a dark red to a pink.
East Asia will shiver in January. See link below. 
Now I am going out on a limb by saying these temperature conditions will extend through much of the month of January and February, with zones shifting here and there, thanks to La Nina.
All in all I heard Joe Bastardi forecast here December global temps to drop to about +0.15 to 0.20 above the normal. I say expect a similar drop for January, meaning we’ll be in negative territory. Same goes for February. There just seems to be lots of cold out there.
Here are the color-coded temperature forecasts for much of the land mass on the globe.
1. United States is projected to be well below normal from 2-9 January. And 10-18 January will be even colder. COLD!
2. Canada is projected to be well above normal from 2-9 January, But many regions will get closer to normal from 10-18 January. Sea ice will expand much. WARM!
3. Europe on the whole will be around average from 2-9 January. But the next cold wave is forecast to hit in another week to 10 days. That means Europe too will be well below normal from 10-18 January. COLD!
4. East Asia: Look at all the blue from from 2-9 January – well below normal. And it doesn’t get better from 10-18 January. COLD!
5. South Asia is projected to be well below normal from 2-9 January, and not much change from 10-18 January. COLD!

6. Central Asia is projected to be well below normal from 2-9 January in western China and north above it. The Middle east and Turkey will be normal to warm, and not much change from 10-18 January. COOL!
7. Middle East will be in general cool from 2-9 January with some warming from 10-18 January. NORMAL!
8. Africa will be generally cool from 2-9 January with some warming from 10-18 January. NORMAL!
9. South America is projected to be below normal from 2-9 January. And 10-18 January will be even colder. COLD!
10. Australia is projected to be normal from 2-9 January. But 10-18 January will be cooler. COOL!
11. Antarctica has been COOL too.
Total it up: 5 cold, 3 cool, 2 normal and only 1 warm. Let’s see Tricky Jim Hansen fudge this. It’ll be interesting to see the satellite numbers in the months ahead.
The Danish Meteorological Institute also shows a cold Arctic.
Interestingly, Joe Bastardi’s forecast of a cold winter in Turkey looks to be elusive. Yesterday it looked like he would be right, but the latest computer outputs appear to confirm Piers Corbyn’s latest forecast of another winter grip steamrolling over northern and central Europe instead.
Of course we should not forget the oceans. Lots of blue there too. All that barking about global warming and 2010 being so hot that we’ve been hearing is about to get muzzled. Enjoy the silence.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s the headline at the online Die Welt. This according to former German Green Party member Rezzo Schlauch.
And when a Green party member says that, you know it’s going to be really costly – especially for the German state of Baden Württemberg, where the Greens swept into power in last Sunday’s state elections and are set to rapidly shut down the state’s nuclear power.
This is going to be fun to watch, but will be painful for the taxpayers.
Rezzo Schlauch was a German Parliamentarian from from 1994 to 2005, and Green Party Faction Chief from 1998 to 2002 in the Bundestag (Federal Parliament). In the year 2000 Gerhard Schroeder’s SPD/Green coalition government pushed through a law that mandated the winding down of nuclear power.
After Fukushima, everybody wants to shut down the nuclear power plants rapidly, especially the southern German state of  Baden Württemberg. But the hitch is that the Baden Württemberg owns a 45% stake of energy giant EnBW. Shutting down EnBW’s nuclear power plants is going to hurt the state – big time. Why is it these things never get communicated before all these fuzzy warm green save-the-planet schemes get put into action?

According Die Welt: 
In an interview with the internet portal Entermagazin Schlauch said: ‘When you are a shareholder of a company that is up to 50% dependent on nuclear power, and the nuclear power is radically stopped, which is the goal, and must be the goal – then you are destroying capital’.”
Economics learned the hard way. Baden Württemberg ‘s state elections of last Sunday will put a Green Party governor in the capital of Stuttgart – Winfried Kretschmann, who is adamant about shutting down all the nuclear power plants as quickly as possible. Baden Württemberg is Germany’s largest producer of nuclear power.
Schlauch says that the state now faces huge challenges. They have to make up the huge atomic power shortfall quickly, and that is going to be expensive. No problem though. Where there is a state, there are also taxpayers. Schlauch warned:
Of course this is going to cost money that is going to have to be paid by the taxpayer.”
Really? I always thought the sun didn’t send power bills and that money was blowing in the wind. Looks like lots of money is going to get blown. Dear citizens, you voted for this – now live with it.

"Trees growing near the South Pole, sea levels 20 metres higher than now, and global temperatures 3C-4C warmer. That is the world scientists are uncovering as they look back in time to when the planet last had as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as it does today. Using sedimentary records and plant fossils, researchers have found that temperatures near the South Pole were about 20C higher than now in the Pliocene epoch, from 5.3m to 2.6m years ago.   Many scientists use sophisticated computer models to predict the impacts of human-caused climate change, but looking back in time for real-world examples can give new insights. The Pliocene was a “proper analogy” and offered important lessons about the road ahead, said Martin Siegert, a geophysicist and climate-change scientist at Imperial College London. “The headline news is the temperatures are 3-4C higher and sea levels are 15-20 metres higher than they are today. The indication is that there is no Greenland ice sheet any more, no West Antarctic ice sheet and big chunks of East Antarctic [ice sheet] taken,” he said. Fossil fuel burning was pumping CO2 into the atmosphere extremely rapidly, he said, though it took time for the atmosphere and oceans to respond fully. “If you put your oven on at home and set it to 200C the temperature does not get to that immediately, it takes a bit of time, and it is the same with climate,” Siegert said, at a Royal Meteorological Society meeting on the climate of the Pliocene. He added that global temperature had already risen by 1C since the industrial revolution, when CO2 levels were 280 parts per million (ppm). CO2 was now at 412ppm and rising, suggesting the planet would be locked into rises of 3C-4C in the next few centuries. Ice melting, he said, took even longer and the huge sea level rises indicated by the Pliocene evidence would probably take a few millennia to come about. In the Pliocene a variety of beech and possibly conifer trees grew at Oliver Bluffs, 300 miles from the South Pole. The tree remains had been unearthed as fossils, along with cushion plants and mosses.  Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey, said: “This is an amazing discovery. They found fossil leaves of southern beech. I call them the last forests of Antarctica. They were growing at 400ppm CO2, so this may be where we are going back to, with ice sheets melting at times, which may allow plants to colonise again.”  The evidence showed summertime temperatures in the Pliocene were a tundra-like 5C near the Pole, compared with -15C to -20C today. The presence of plants showed the Antarctic ice cap was much smaller in the Pliocene and the sea level much higher. “Twenty metres of sea level rise would have a major impact on our all our coastal cities and all our coastal areas where people live,” Francis said. Polar regions were especially important in understanding global climate, she said: “We know that is where the change happens first and where it is most dramatic.” About 100m years ago an even more extreme climate occurred. In the Cretaceous period CO2 levels were 1,000ppm. Antarctica still sat over the South Pole, but the region was warm and covered in great forests, the stumps and soil of which have been preserved as fossils in places like Alexander Island. “If we keep carbon emissions going at the current rate, by the end of the century we will have 1,000ppm,” said Siegert. The low 280ppm level of CO2  in the run-up to the industrial revolution was rooted in carbon being removed from the air by plants and animals and then buried. “It formed coal seams, gas and oil fields. And what we have been doing for the last 150 years is digging it all up and putting it back into the atmosphere, it’s crazy.” One climate peril these emissions ruled out, said Siegert, was a return to an ice age, which had happened several times in the last million years; CO2 was now at too high a level for there to be any chance of a big freeze, said Siegert. “We’ve killed it.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitter“I’m a climate pig” – so confesses a climate sinner in a satirical new video clip produced by German public television ZDF. It is a spoof on the whole climate change movement, a parody on the climate religion, and this by an icon of politically correct media, ZDF, no less!
The video is also quite hip – thus targeting the young.
Are the German media now starting to take a satirical view of the whole climate-saving movement? That certainly would be a change of course. But let’s not get our hopes up too much.
The video pokes fun at the feelings of guilt that many people struggle with daily because of their self-perceived CO2 sins, which are simply impossible to avoid in modern living. We all do our best to avoid emitting the climate-killing stuff, but it just can’t be helped! The video starts with a person confessing his climate sins. Dear Father:
– Boiling water: 36 kg of CO2.
– Surfing in the Internet: 391 kg.
– Driving the car: 2 tons!
– Living in an old apartment in Berlin: 3.6 tons
– Holiday flight to New York: 4 tons!
Using this online climate calculator, I reach a total of more than 18 tons per year. But the scientists say I should emit no more than 2 tons per year!
Oh my God, what can I do? Cutting CO2 emissions that drastically would be totally painful. The guilt that’s felt is just unbearable.
But it’s got to be done. There’s no choice, at least so says Regine Günther, Director of Climate Protection and Energy WWF:
If we don’t, then we will be changed, and that in the form of traumatic climate change. And the consequences for people will be much much more painful then you could ever imagine.
Gulp! That’s pretty painful. I myself can imagine some pretty painful things – like root canal treatment without Novocaine. So climate change will be 10 times, no, a thousand times more painful than that? Then we better hurry up and make the brutal sacrifices today. ZDF asks how on earth are we supposed to do get down to just two tons?

Deliver our e-mails by bicycle?
Turn off the heat?
Dear Father, what am I to do? No matter what I do, I commit CO2 sins. Help me!
Norbert Bolz, media theorist, says everywhere there are feelings of guilt, people doing penance by performing acts of offsetting. “People are now praying to Mother Nature, who has taken over for God.”
The clip sarcastically points out that the average person causes 1.24 tons of emissions annually just by default existing, before even taking a breath, and that through government administration, autobahns, and taxation. ZDF asks: “Is there even a chance for me to live a climate-friendly life?”
The movement has become religious and is now even filled with rituals, explains Bolz, citing Germany’s obsession with separating it’s household garbage as a way of being a “good person” and doing penance for our environmental transgressions.
But don’t despair, now private industry allows you to buy offsets, thus allowing you to perform acts without having to feel so guilty. Now that’s service. Pay a little extra for that flight ticket, and bam! Everything is rosy again. Fly guilt-free! A good conscience in exchange for money. ZDF adds satirically:
For singles at COOL.de, there’s also the climate-neutral complete package for only 10 euros a month!” Is that the solution?
Not for WWF High Priest Regine Günther, who warns offsets are not enough:
The only good emissions are the ones that don’t happen. And for the ones that do occur, you have to try to avoid them. And if that isn’t possible, then you have to offset them. But that’s only possible over a transitionary period.”
So only for a little while? All this offset stuff is just temporary, and will have to go before too long. After that it’s going to be all cold cold turkey, and big time. ZDF on Günther’s warning:
I was afraid of that. First I was a waste sinner, and now I’m a climate sinner. Our Father, give me my daily CO2. Forgive me for my trespasses, and deliver me from climate change. Yours is the state, nature and the CO2 budget for eternity. Amen.
I’ll say Amen to that too.

The proposed 270 billion per year plan (€10.8 trillion total by 2050) for Europe to reach its target of becoming a low-carbon economy and society presented by Climate Commissar Connie Hedegaard yesterday has received a cool reception.
While the industry says not no fast – it’s too expensive, the environmentalists are complaining that it is not fast enough and does not allow them to take over Europe as its dictators.
The plan presented yesterday in Brussels is widely known as the EU Commission Low Carbon Roadmap, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 percent of 1990 levels by 2050. Interim targets have also been set: 25% by 2020, and 40% by 2030.
Europe’s emissions have gone down by 16% over the past two decades and the EU economy has grown by 40%. But much of that CO2 reduction came from shutting down the old communist mismanaged industry of former Warsaw Pact countries after the Berlin Wall fell in late 1989.
Ridiculous argument
The EU climate commissars are encouraging Europe to take more action, some even resorting to ludicrous logic, like Connie Hedegaard – quoted by Environment News Service:
We need to start the transition towards a competitive low carbon economy now. The longer we wait, the higher the cost will be. As oil prices keep rising, Europe is paying more every year for its energy bill and becoming more vulnerable to price shocks. So starting the transition now will pay off.”
She’s saying: let’s switch over to expensive alternatives right away and really pay through the nose right now. That way we won’t have to worry about paying for higher-priced oil in the future!

And this low carbon-living isn’t going to make Europe more competitive, either. To be competitive energy has to be affordable and its supply steady. It’s not for nothing many countries are cutting back subsidies to wind and solar.
Non-binding
The EU Commission’s Low Carbon Roadmap outlines a vast number of criteria for meeting the the targets: smart meters, renovation of buildings, thermal insulation, energy efficient machines, expansion of solar and wind energy, etc. But environmental groups were disappointed by the plan as a whole. Klimaretter blogsite writes (emphasis added):
The proposals of the Commissar were “unacceptable” said WWF energy expert Regine Günther: ‘The Commission views an emissions reduction of 25% as possible’, but did not make it binding, says Günther. “Without any clear ambitious target requirements, the European economy will lose the competitive leadership in markets for energy efficiency and renewable energy in the near future.’ “
What’s bad news for the eco-dictators is of course good news for EU citizens. Sorry, but many of us don’t think that spending €10.8 trillion for a few tenths of a degree Celsius is worth it. Besides, whatever CO2 Europe saves in the decades ahead will be wiped out by China and India CO2 growth in just a few months.
Meanwhile others are biting off their fingers. Environment News Service:
Friends of the Earth’s Head of Climate Change Mike Childs said, ‘If these plans go ahead, European governments are effectively abandoning any realistic hope of keeping global temperatures rises below two degrees, locking us into catastrophic climate change.’ ”
‘If the EU is serious about tackling climate change it must slash its emissions by 40 percent by 2020, without buying carbon credits from abroad,’ said Childs.”
Words of an eco-dictator.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to a new paper published by the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestial Physics, it appears the cause behind global warming is a lot more complicated than a few molecules of CO2.
The paper titled Geomagnetic South Atlantic Anomaly and global sea level rise: a direct connection? authored by De Santis et al recently has uncovered an “intriguing and to date unreported relationship between the surface area of the South Atlantic Anomaly of the geomagnetic field and the current trend in sea level rise”.
The abstract starts:
These two geophysical variables have been growing coherently during the last three centuries, thus strongly suggesting a causal relationship supported by some statistical tests.”
According to the paper, the first quantitative evidence of a relationship between the geomagnetic field, external field activities and weather or climate change was given by Wollin et al (1971) and by Bucha (1976, 1978).
The anomaly at an altitude of approximately 560 kilometers, 2007 (Source: NASA).
The abstract states:
The monotonic increase of the SAA surface area since 1600 may have been associated with an increased inflow of radiation energy through the inner Van Allen belt with a consequent warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and finally global sea level rise.”
The good news for the IPCC is that there is little understanding of the connection between the SAA and warming, thus giving them reason enough to just completely ignore it in its next assessment report.

The paper’s abstract:
Although we cannot establish a clear connection between SAA dynamics and global warming, the strong correlation between the former and global sea level supports the idea that global warming may be at least partly controlled by deep Earth processes triggering geomagnetic phenomena, such as the South Atlantic Anomaly, on a century timescale.”
The paper then states that the geomagentic field can modulate charged particles reaching the earth and that the average field strength has decreased substantially over the last 150 years. The paper adds:
This reduction of the field strength may imply an enhanced effect on some climatic parameters, if in fact the energy flux associated with the incoming particles has an effective impact on climate.”
Could this all be just a coincidence? The authors quantified the correlation with two robust tests, and write in their conclusion:
The agreement between global sea level rise and SAA area is spectacular […] a mere coincidence is highly unlikely.”
There you have it. Yet another phenomenon that likely impacts the climate without CO2. Now you understand why in my last post I wrote the IPCC and its 2007 AR4 report are totally obsolete and divergent from reality. The IPCC models are Stone Age. With its focus welded solely on CO2, the IPCC is out to lunch, out of the ballpark – and on a different planet.

To offer an anecdote, Stefan Rahmstorf wrote a post a while back boasting (prematurely) how Amazon-gate had been debunked. So I left a reader comment congratulating him, along with a link to my previous list of 94 gates suggesting he get to work on the remaining 93.
Needless to say, my comment was deleted. I know he doesn’t have much to do in Potsdam, except surfing in the internet and doing PR damage control, and so I hope this new list can help him pass the time.
New gates are designated with “NEW!“. Some gates involving people are filed under their first names, e.g. Judith Lean-gate (No. 70), or Jeff Greene-gate (no. 65). Surely I’ve missed some gates, as I’m not always focused on looking for them.
I hope this helps bloggers, journalists and readers in finding and citing sources as we wage our campaign against the merchants of junk AGW science and bad policy.

Share this...FacebookTwitterActually, who’s counting? It seems a major solar company goes bust every other day.

Odersun – the latest German ghost town. Failed solar company lays off 260 employees.
The latest to bite the dust and add to the rapidly rising sea level of red ink is Odersun (sorry, but even their website is no longer operating)  in eastern Germany, near the border to Poland.
According to Klimaretter (Climate Rescuers) website:
Frankfurt/Oder headquartered solar company must stop operations on June 1. As the dpa press agecny reports, 260 employees were laid off already last week because the company was unable to pay wages. Negotiations with Staatsholding Rusnano as an investor crumbled over the last week.”
Not even the Russians are interested in German state-subsidized industry or companies.

Odersun is just the latest in a long string of spectacular green failures sweeping across Germany, thus vaporising the fantasy of economic revitalization in the former communist East Germany.
Just months ago politicians from every party were promising high-tech jobs and heady times ahead, thanks to the green revolution they boasted to have ushered in. However, very few people expected bitter reality to replace blissful fantasy so quickly. Politicians, once falling all over themselves to be on camera standing in front of humming state-subsidized solar module production lines, are now bolting for the exits, leaving a landscape littered with shuttered factories.
A money abyss
According to the online Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten:
State of Brandenburg poured tax money to the tune of millions into solar module manufacturer Odersun. The company is now being shut down and its 260 employees will be laid off on June 1. The bankruptcy had sparked a heated debate on the politics of subsidies by the state and especially criticism of economic minister Ralf Christoffers (Left Party) . For years Odersun had been generously supported – with subsidies of more than 10 million euros, a guarantee of 8 million euros, and finally just when bankruptcy appeared inevitable, an emergency funding of 3.2 million euros approved by Christoffers.”
Count it up – well over 20 million euros!
Now that the pigs have thoroughly gorged themselves and left the trough, I wonder who is left to pick up the tab.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I’m going to meander off into politics. It’s election day after all.
Here in Europe, that dreaded day has unfortunately arrived. This one is as welcome as a root canal treatment. Now that it’s here, for the European Establishment, it’s: let’s get it over with and hope the pain will be bearable.
In Germany the newsrooms and media are having a difficult time coming to terms with the inevitable results. The insults and nervous breakdowns are everywhere. The dreams of socialism, world goverment and climate theocracy are crumbling before their eyes.
Now, instead of being inspiring slogans, “Yes we can” and “Hope and Change” have become a big joke.
It’s that damn Tea Party, which is made up of unsophisticated, rather ignorant, white, racist, narrow minded, religious, ultra-conservative, angry gun-wielding Americans who are too stupid to know what’s good for them, all led by extremists like Sarah Palin – so laments much of the established media here. The Tea Partiers are so disinformed, e.g. many don’t even believe in the hard science of manmade global warming and believe the planet was created 6000 years ago.  If only Americans weren’t so stupid and ignorant.
Two years ago the German and European media made Obama their darling, portraying him as the savior that had delivered America and the world from the clutches of the evil Bush regime. A year later he was even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for doing so. But that has since turned out to be a certificate of failure (think Gore, Arafat and a host of others).
Now, as Europe views it, the Tea Party express places the whole grand global plan of a world nanny state rescuing the planet from climate catastrophe and capitalism in jeopardy. Nothing gets more villified in the European press than the Tea Party (except climate deniers, that is).
Many media outlets have complained that climate initiatives will soon be blocked by these new denier Republicans. Here are some excerpts of how the German print media feels about the upcoming Congressional overhaul and the reasons behind it.
Sueddeutsche Zeitung
The USA increasingly appears to be a giant that is paralyzed by polarity. On one side you have the political middle who are attempting to implement solutions for the big challenges that the nation faces. On the other side, there’s the Tea Party, TV network Fox News and the “no”-faction who say no to government, no to taxes, no to change, no to environmental protection. In this camp there are many who believe that climate change is a big conspiracy by intellectuals or by the Chinese.

In the meantime, reality has caught up to the Obama government. The promised hope and change has stalled time and again in committees and meetings, failing because of resistantance from the political opposition.
Die Welt
Many Americans are disappointed by the economic policy of the government, even though the financial and economic crisis began on Obama’s predecesssor George W. Bush’s watch. The right-wing populist Tea Party movement, which supported many candidiates, profited the most from the frustration.
Die Zeit
In the House, Obama has had a majority of 39 seats. They will lose 70 or even 80 seats to the Republicans. Soon the conservatives will have a majority and will appoint the Speaker of the House. In the Senate the Democrats have had a majority of 59 of the 100 seats. There are surely going to be losses there too. But most likely they will hang on to a slim majority with 51 or 52 seats.
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
It is mainly the conservative grassroots Tea Party that has provided the Republicans, who took it on the chin 2 years earlier, with a Renaissance. It’s likely that the Tea Party movement will also be a major factor in 2012 with its economically motivated demands for debt reduction, spending discipline, tax cuts and smaller governments.

"The UK’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 3% in 2018 as pollution from the energy sector continued to decrease, provisional government figures show. Emissions of the gases that drive climate change have fallen for six years in a row, and are 44% below the 1990 baseline for the UK. Emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, are at the lowest level since before the start of the 20th century, when Queen Victoria was still on the throne, government officials said.  The fall was mainly due to a 7% reduction in pollution from energy suppliers, as the power sector continued to switch away from coal to low-carbon technology such as renewables. There was also a 3% drop in emissions from transport, which have barely fallen since 1990 and now make up the biggest share of the UK’s climate pollution. Energy data also published on Thursday revealed that renewables accounted for a record third (33%) of electricity generation in 2018, while coal was just 5%, and gas was 39%. Low-carbon generation, which covers renewables and nuclear, rose to a record 53%, the figures show. Claire Perry, the energy and clean growth minister, said: “We can be proud that we continue to lead the way in reducing emissions while growing our economy. “More than half of our electricity comes from low-carbon sources thanks to more than £52bn of government support for renewable projects in the UK since 2010, all part of our modern industrial strategy.” Greenpeace argued transport emissions were falling at a “snail’s pace”. Morten Thaysen, a Greenpeace climate campaigner, said: “For years now we’ve known that transport is the UK’s leading driver of the climate emergency. “Both the government and the car industry are stalling when we need proper action. Ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, instead of the government’s date of 2040, would be a good starting point. “Matching this with new policies to promote electric vehicles and greater support for cheap, green public transport, walking and cycling is essential too.” The shadow energy secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said the new greenhouse gas figures “show that the government is failing on climate change when nothing less than a green industrial revolution is needed”. She added: “Public sector and residential emissions actually increased last year, while other sectors remain flat. Agricultural emissions are higher now than in the year 2000. Only a Labour government will tackle the climate emergency while revitalising whole swathes of the country that have been held back for decades.”"
"Greenhouse gas emissions from energy production rose strongly again last year, according to new data from the International Energy Agency, with a young fleet of coal-fired power plants in Asia accounting for a large proportion of the increase. Energy demand grew at its fastest pace this decade, with a 2.3% increase globally driving rises in fossil fuel consumption. Coal use in power stations was a third of the increase in energy consumption, and together gas and coal were responsible for nearly 70% of the growth in energy consumption, and while demand for solar and wind power also increased, it was by much less overall.  Gas consumption in the US leapt by 10%, or the equivalent of the UK’s entire gas consumption in a year. Fracking has been a key driver, and oil production in the US also grew, while the dismantling of government incentives intended to reduce reliance on fossil fuels has continued. Asia is now responsible for the majority of coal-fired power generation globally, and the average age of power plants there is now just 12 years, meaning they have decades to go before reaching their planned end of production in about 30 to 50 years. Heating and cooling accounted for a fifth of the increase in global energy demand – the cooling needed for many areas to cope with global warming is an increasing factor in the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, as temperatures in some regions rose to record levels as the result of climate change. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said last year had been a “golden” year for gas, which met nearly half of the growth in global demand for energy, but urged governments to take action that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “We have seen an extraordinary increase in global energy demand in 2018, growing at its fastest pace this decade,” he said. “Last year can also be considered another golden year for gas. But despite major growth in renewables, global emissions are still rising, demonstrating once again that more urgent action is needed on all fronts.” He called for greater development of non-fossil fuel energy sources, action from governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and investment in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide, as ways to reduce the impact of energy production on climate change. Energy efficiency has been increasingly ignored, the IEA found, despite the economic gains to be had from relatively simple measures to curb energy waste. Nuclear reactors met 9% of the increase in global electricity demand last year, according to the IEA’s analysis, as newly built plants in China came onstream and facilities in Japan were reopened after the Fukushima disaster at the beginning of the decade. • This article was amended on 26 March 2019 because coal use did not rise by a third, as an earlier version said, it accounted for a third of the rise in energy consumption."
"The restoration of natural forests and coasts can simultaneously tackle climate change and the annihilation of wildlife but is being worryingly overlooked, an international group of campaigners have said. Animal populations have fallen by 60% since 1970, suggesting a sixth mass extinction of life on Earth is under way, and it is very likely that carbon dioxide will have to be removed from the atmosphere to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Trees and plants suck carbon dioxide from the air as they grow and also provide vital habitat for animals. “The world faces two existential crises, developing with terrifying speed: climate breakdown and ecological breakdown,” the group writes in a letter to the Guardian. “Neither is being addressed with the urgency needed to prevent our life-support systems from spiralling into collapse. “We are championing a thrilling but neglected approach to averting climate chaos while defending the living world: natural climate solutions. Defending the living world and defending the climate are, in many cases, one and the same.” The signatories include the school strikes activist Greta Thunberg, the climate scientist Prof Michael Mann, the writers Margaret Atwood, Naomi Klein and Philip Pullman and the campaigners Bill McKibben and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, and the musician Brian Eno are also among the signatories of the letter, which was instigated by the Guardian writer George Monbiot. The group emphasises that natural climate solutions are not an alternative to the rapid decarbonisation of energy, transport and farming. Both are needed, the campaigners say. The United Nations announced a Decade of Ecosystem Restoration at the start of March. “The degradation of our ecosystems has had a devastating impact on both people and the environment,” said Joyce Msuya, the head of the UN Environment Programme. “Nature is our best bet to tackle climate change and secure the future.” Recent research indicates that about a third of the greenhouse gas reductions needed by 2030 can be provided by the restoration of natural habitats, but such solutions have attracted just 2.5% of the funding for tackling emissions. The greatest impact is likely to come from the restoration of forests, particularly areas in the tropics that were razed for cattle ranching, palm oil plantations and timber. But natural climate solutions must not compete with the need to feed the world’s growing population, the letter says, and must be implemented with the consent of local communities. Effective ways of restoring habitat often overlap with the conservation of wildlife, the group says. Boosting the populations of forest elephants and rhinos in Africa and Asia would help spread the seeds of trees that have a high carbon content, for example, while more wolves would lead to fewer plants being eaten by moose. The fastest accumulation of carbon occurs in vegetated coastal habitats such as mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrass beds, research shows, which also protect communities from storms. Here, carbon can be sequestered 40 times faster than in tropical forests. Peatlands must also be protected and restored, the group says, as they store one-third of all soil carbon despite covering just 3% of the world’s land. Other suggested ways of removing carbon dioxide from the air include burning wood to generate electricity and burying the emissions, but to work at scale this would require vast amounts of land. A website, Natural Climate Solutions, is launched on Wednesday calling on governments to back such measures and “to create a better world for wildlife and a better world for people”. “Our aim is simple: to catalyse global enthusiasm for drawing down carbon by restoring ecosystems,” said Monbiot, who has written a report for the website. “It is the single most undervalued and underfunded tool for climate mitigation.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe photo montage could have been better, I know – but you get the idea.
Funny how Britain’s propaganda unit of the green movement – the BBC – somehow concocted such a picture of the sceptics. Germany’s FOCUS magazine, a proponent of the AGW theory, sees the sceptics in a completely different way – read below.
Obviously, things have gotten awfully bad for the green movement, and especially the BBC, who now finds itself resorting to the dirtiest of tactics – once used exclusively by totalitarian regimes.
Once a premier news organisation, the BBC has reduced itself to being a pathetic caricature of journalism.
Without a doubt the BBC, a public network, has departed from its obligation of fairness and balance, and has assigned itself with the higher mission of “rescuing the planet” and has given itself a role in setting public policy. That is not its duty under its current charter.
It has assigned itself a new job: to isolate the targets and to get the masses to despise them – all on behalf of a virulent green movement. Not unlike Goebbels. When one looks at how the BBC stitched together its recent documentary on climate sceptics, even Goebbels would blush. While Goebbels propaganda was mean and mean, BBC’s is mean and desperate.
The Rupert Murray stitchwork is in the same league as the 1010 clip. Make no mistake, it too will backfire. It will only serve to entertain the greenshirts, and appall the rest.
It is a particularly desperate piece of propaganda, one that I’d classify it as something you’d see from Baghdad Al, Saddam’s Information Minister during the Iraq war, who everyday insisted everything was peachy as Baghdad burned behind him. It should tell you something about how these guys communicate.
Can we trust the news they tells us? Can we trust the science that’s put forward?
Alternative view of sceptics: German FOCUS magazine 
I wish to remind people that there is an alternative view of climate sceptics one that recently appeared in the warmist German news magazine FOCUS. I advise people to read and compare it to the BBC documentary. It’s a completely different picture.
Here it is again (originally posted on January 11, 2011):
===============================================
FOCUS Story On Germany’s Hostile Environment For Skeptic Scientists
What’s going on at FOCUS magazine in Germany? Has it become “fair and balanced”?
An online FOCUS story here about the 3rd International Climate (Skeptic) Conference, which took place in Berlin early last month, got past my radar. Even though it is 3 weeks old, it is still worth writing about. The FOCUS story is dubbed: “Among Doubters”.
Hat-tip: Ike
The story looks in-depth at the climate conference and the overall atmosphere for skeptics in Germany, but does it fairly, something we are not at all accustomed to from the rest of the hostile media here in the Vaterland.
For example not so long ago Die Zeit had a notorious drive-by shooting piece that put the cross-hairs on Fred Singer called “The Merchants of Doubt”, read here.
The FOCUS piece starts out by describing the overall “poisonous” atmosphere that pervaded before the start of the conference. Some German Parliamentarians started their own McCarthy-style inquisition on the sceptic movement in an attempt to intimidate and marginalise it. The inquisition was laced with the term “denier” and had all the usual Big-Oil and Tobacco accusations, read here.
FOCUS quotes EIKE-spokesman Holger Thuss, and comments:

//-->




‘Oil money? That would be nice!’, defends Holger Thuss of the European Institute for Climate and Energy(EIKE), with a tone of sarcasm. The think-tank founded in 2007 is headquartered in Jena and is supported only by small donations from private persons and membership fees. After the conference, the institute was penniless.
Being a bit familiar with this institute, I can tell you that it operates on a shoestring and does not have an office, as members appear to work from their homes. Hardly oil-funded. The press has always used this point to ridicule EIKE as post office box operation.
Yet the press, politicians and activists fear the organisation, and are working hard to marginalize it. But so far they’ve succeeded in doing just the opposite.
For most of the media, the 3rd Conference in Berlin was allegedly a gathering of wacked-out conspiracy theorists. But FOCUS found that this was hardly the case:
The approximately 120 who gathered in Berlin were supposedly “climate deniers“, yet hardly gave a conspirator impression. They were predominantly men, mainly of retirement age, with thinned hair and gray scholarly beards.”
As someone in attendance, I was an exception to that – in both respects. And what about all the accusations that we are just a haggle of deniers and flat-earthers? FOCUS quotes Bob Carter:
‘Whoever labels us as climate deniers is not making any scientific arguments, rather political ones’, says Australian geologist Bob Carter in response to such characterisations. When someone calls him a skeptic, then, as a scientist, he is ‘proud of it’.”
FOCUS then reports that almost all the attendees believe in climate change, and the dispute is about the extent of man’s influence, and here writes more about Bob Carter:
The paleontologist examined climate change and changes in sea level over the last 65 million years in numerous field studies – and has detected far greater variations than those of our recent history. The assertion that man is heating the world’s climate with CO2 emissions is fundamentally refuted he claims.
FOCUS also wrote about what happens when scientists do not march in lockstep with the so-called “mainstream” scientists, citing Jan Veizer’s and Nir Shaviv’s breakthrough paper on the impacts of cosmic rays on climate:
‘Practically overnight no one wanted to be seen with me’, bitterly recalls the emeritus Leibniz-Prize winner, who also taught in Germany and in Canada.
FOCUS adds:
Whoever challenges the notion of man-made climate change gets mercilessly punished by the Establishment. So it is no surprise that one hardly finds any young researchers who take a critical and skeptical view, and that mainly retired professors dominated the conference.
Also 38-year old academic high-flyer Nir Shaviv advises his own students on the threat of sanctions and reminds them to be very careful in challenging official climate dogma: ‘Whoever starts questioning is taking the risk of shooting himself in the knee.'”
What a way to conduct science. FOCUS then writes about how some politicians have been at the receiving end of hellfire and brimstone for expressing openeness to non-mainstream views, for example conservative CDU politician Marie-Luise Dött, read here and Free Democrat Paul Friedhoff.
But all the greenshirt intimidation tactics have in the end backfired for the most part. The debate is not ending, as Al Gore demanded in an authoritarian style back in 2006. Science does not stop just because a politician like Gore, who has got a stake in it all, demands it so.
FOCUS ends its piece with the subheading:
No end in sight for this debate”
We have indeed come a long way since the days of “The science is settled”, haven’t we? FOCUS then quotes Bob Carter, who demands a change in political course, and that we ought to get away from the belief that we can restrict temperature increase to 2°C. Carter pleads that governments use taxpayer more wisely.
Why not start in the third world and help the people there get clean water and better sanitation facilities. That would be a good start.“
Kudos to FOCUS. If they keep this up I’ll soon find myself adding widget for subscriptions to FOCUS magazine – and I’m now even considering a subscription to its news magazine.

"The simplest measure of how the mass burning of fossil fuels is disrupting the stable climate in which human civilisation developed is the number of carbon dioxide molecules in the atmosphere. Today, the CO2 level is the highest it has been for several million years. Back then, temperatures were 3-4C hotter, sea level was 15-20 metres higher and trees grew at the south pole. Worse, billions of tonnes of carbon pollution continues to pour into the air every year and at a rate 10 times faster than for 66m years. At the dawn of the industrial revolution, CO2 was at 280 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere. By 1958, when the first measurements were made at Mauna Loa in Hawaii, it had reached 315ppm. It raced past 350ppm in 1986 and 400ppm in 2013. The Guardian will now publish the Mauna Loa carbon count, the global benchmark, on the weather page of the paper every day. “When I read the letter from Guardian reader Daniel Scharf encouraging us to include information on climate change in our weather forecasts, we thought it was a fantastic idea,” said the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. “Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have risen so dramatically, and including a measure of that in our daily weather report is symbolic of what human activity is doing to our climate. People need reminding that the climate crisis is no longer a future problem – we need to tackle it now, and every day matters.” While weather changes daily, climate changes over years and decades. So alongside the daily carbon count, we will publish the level in previous years for comparison, as well as the pre-industrial baseline of 280ppm, and the level seen as manageable in the long term of 350ppm. Year-on-year comparisons are important because each year there is a natural rise and fall of CO2 levels, rather like the planet breathing. Trees and plants absorb carbon and release oxygen as they grow, lowering atmospheric CO2. As most plants are in the northern hemisphere, CO2 reaches its lowest level each year at the end of the growing season in October. Then it begins to rise as dying plants decay, reaching a peak in May or June. While the CO2 level is an important and symbolic measure of the global warming caused by humanity, it is a simple one. The increases in temperature the world experiences, and the heatwaves, storms and droughts that strike, also depend on how fast emissions rise or fall and how long they remain at high levels. The 350ppm level was proposed in 2008 by Nasa’s Prof James Hansen as a suitable target. However we measure climate change, one thing is clear: to keep below 1.5C of warming, the aspiration of the world’s nations, we need to halve emissions by 2030 and reach zero by mid century. It is also likely we will need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, perhaps by the large-scale restoration of nature. It is a huge task, but we hope that tracking the daily rise of CO2 will help to maintain attention on it. When the 400ppm milestone was passed, Prof Ralph Keeling, who oversees the Mauna Loa measurements begun by his father, said: “It is symbolic, a point to pause and think about where we have been and where we are going.”"

I’ve decided to be generous and to move his comment and make it a post. Maybe other readers here can help him (her) out.
Comment by reader JC Smith:
Yes…..global cooling.  Wouldn’t that be nice.  Let’s just ignore the facts, and click our shoes together and tell ourselves that global cooling is in.
For anyone curious about FACTS, you can look at this link at NOAA:  http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/records/
For the last 365 days in the US, the daily high temp records have exceeded the daily minimum temp records by a ratio of 3.3 to 1.0 (29,298 to 8,968 as of 02/03 in the morning).  If you look at just the LAST MONTH…it is even worse.

Over the last 30 days, there have been 2,949 new daily high records (ie highs for a specific day) while there have only been 160 new daily low records.  The ratio is almost 20 to 1, new high records to new low records.
Aberdeen, South Dakota set a new record high for January 5th of 63 degrees which beat the old record or 46 degrees by 17 degrees.  Phillip, South Dakota set a new record high 74 degrees which beat the old record of 46 degrees by 28 DEGREES.  Think about that for a minute.  A new record high which was 28 degrees HIGHER than the old record high for January 5th (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/plains-bask-in-historic-record-warm-weather/2012/01/06/gIQAZleBfP_blog.html).
Global warming has been happening for at least the last 120 years.  For the last 30 years, it has gotten worse.  The last 30 days are “off the charts” as far as record high temperatures go.
So, please show me some FACTS with LINKS, that show me that global cooling is taking place.  I look forward to seeing them.”
Quite the powerful evidence you present here, JC. Even the most talented of defense attorneys surely would be trembling in their shoes just from its sheer caliber.
You’ll get your facts and links. The question is: are you even going to listen?

"Modelling for the Morrison government’s climate policy assumes electric vehicles will make up between 25% and 50% of new car sales by 2030, a similar figure to the target set by the Labor party, which the Coalition criticised this week. Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said “it shows how out of touch the Liberals are even with their own department” when it comes to cutting carbon pollution from transport.  Labor’s climate policy, announced this week,  included a target for 50% of new cars sold by 2030 to be electric. The government has said Labor’s reforms could prove costly – the environment minister, Melissa Price, said the party’s stance on electric cars “lacks any credible planning or detail to back up its target”. The Morrison government’s electric vehicles policy has not yet been written but Price said the Coalition was aiming for “25% +” of all new vehicles to be electric by 2030. The environment department told estimates hearings that projected emissions cuts of 10m tonnes through the government’s proposed electric vehicles strategy were based on data indicating electric cars could account for 25-50% of new sales by 2030. The projection, contained in the climate solutions package, was drawn from data prepared for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation by consulting firm Energeia. “That analysis indicated that electric vehicles could make up between 25 to 50% of new car sales in 2030 if supported by coordination and facilitation of local state and commonwealth actions coordinated through a national strategy,” Kristin Tilley, the first assistant secretary of the department’s climate change division, told the hearing. “Just so I’m clear, the government’s climate solutions policy includes a climate solution package that’s projecting a 10 mega tonnes CO2 abatement number that could come from an electric vehicle strategy, that sees 25 to 50% of new car sales in 2030 as electric vehicles?” the Labor senator Kristina Keneally asked. “That’s right” officials said. Officials told the hearing the government’s electric vehicle strategy hadn’t been written and the announcement in the climate solutions package was that one would be developed. This week’s budget included $400,000 for its development, something that could take until mid-2020. “The hard-right of the Coalition have strangled any effective climate change policy,” said Butler. “That’s why the Liberals don’t have a transport emissions policy, just like they have no broader emissions reduction policy. “A Shorten Labor government will work with Australia’s transport sector to cut vehicle emissions, boost adoption of electric vehicles and help Australians save on their petrol bills.” Labor’s policy also includes a proposal for vehicle efficiency standards, which it originally proposed to impose on car retailers. But it changed course this week and instead will require this of car manufacturers, similar to other countries. Price said the “embarrassing backflip” suggested a lack of planning in the policy. “Rapidly increasing the number of electric vehicles on the road requires a plan for a multi-billion dollar investment in charging stations and supporting infrastructure, and the equity of the associated reduction in fuel excise,” she said. “That’s why the Coalition is making targeted investments in charging stations and creating a national electric vehicle strategy to coordinate federal, state and local government policy. “The Coalition is aiming for 25% + of new vehicles sold in 2030 to be EVs.” Australia lags behind other OECD countries in setting efficiency standards to cut carbon pollution from vehicles, and government modelling shows it would deliver billions in economic benefits, including reduced fuel costs for drivers."

"Announcing new climate change policies is something Australian politicians have learned to fear the most. Over the past decade, climate change politics has knocked off four prime ministers, and split political parties and allegiances apart at their core. The political risks in this election campaign are no doubt even more exacerbated, with many calling this the “climate election”. Nor is this a battle that is limited to the Green versus Labor swing seats. It is perhaps even more acute in key traditionally safe conservative seats. Buoyed by the result in the Wentworth byelection, several high profile independents are taking on Tony Abbott, Josh Frydenberg and Greg Hunt. Central to their campaign is climate change action.  In the last few weeks the major parties have trepidatiously released their climate change policy platforms. The LNP policies reflect a party that needs to be seen to be doing something to fend off the independents. Simultaneously it needs to somehow be seen not to be doing too much to avoid deserting votes on the right. The ALP policies on the other hand reflect a party trying to be seen to be doing a lot to capture the political momentum from the school strike movement, and the broad majority of Australians who want more climate action. On the other hand, being too ambitious gives the Murdoch press the ammunition for headlines it has frothed over for the past decade. Both parties’ climate policies of both parties are dominated by energy and by and large focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Such policies and actions are often grouped in the category of “mitigation”. Mitigation in this case refers to actions that are taken to limit the magnitude or rate of long-term global warming and its related effects. What is missing from both parties’ policy platforms is any substantive commitment to deal with adapting to climate change. Adaptation recognises that even with the most aggressive mitigation efforts, Australian society is already being impacted by a changing climate and will continue to do so. Even among environment and climate groups, adaptation is often missing from advocacy platforms, or a footnote. Perhaps this is because for many climate activists, promoting adaptation sometimes has that feeling that the battle to combat rising temperatures has been lost. Adaptation has long been the poor cousin of climate change policy and funding so perhaps this is no surprise. But what is perhaps more intriguing is that adaptation has often been the area of climate change policy that has had more bipartisan support. One of the first national adaptation strategies came about during the Howard era, and in many states, adaptation activity carried through changes in government more in tact than mitigation. If anything, the 2019 election should highlight the need for adaptation more acutely than any other previous election. The number of weather and climate records surpassed in this last term of government has brought climate change “home” to many Australians. Images of dead fish in the Murray Darling, burning rainforests and button grass plains in the Tasmanian wilderness, coral reef bleaching is front of mind for a large majority of Australians. So are the more personal experiences of hotter and drier conditions and more extreme weather events. No longer an abstract concern for future generations, it is an issue that is affecting Australians now and in major and complex ways. Unsurprisingly it is this dramatic shift from the abstract to the tangible that is galvanising non-traditional political actors to speak up and demand more. Groups like Farmers for Climate Action, the School Strike for Climate movement, and the Climate and Health Alliance are new movements challenging the climate politics of the past decade. Local governments and their communities across the country are on the frontline of climate change impacts right here right now and need federal support. Interestingly, in its 2018 annual survey of Australian attitudes towards climate change, an Ipsos poll found that Australians considered local governments leading when it comes to climate action compared to state and federal governments and industry/business. Infrastructure upgrades to improve resilience to extreme weather events and hotter and drier conditions are obvious needs. Community and social resilience programs to ensure communities are informed, empowered and have capacity to respond to climate change are also crucial. Several programs are under way, led by local governments such as the Ramp Up Resilience project in rural shires in northern Victoria, and the Resilient South project in South Australia. Critically, what is needed most is funding support to local communities to design local solutions to the very localised impacts of climate change already being experienced. This goes beyond disaster relief funding, but takes a more proactive approach so that communities can become more resilient to disasters as they will inevitably unfold. In coming weeks hopefully we will hear both parties reveal the rest of their climate change policies, the much needed adaptation policies. • Rob Law works for the Victorian Greenhouse Alliances, regional networks of local governments working on climate change projects, advocacy and knowledge sharing"

And it is morally questionable that today thousands of tonnes of maize are being taken off the plates of the world’s hungry in order to rescue them from a computer-modelled climate change in 2100.
If that wasn’t bad enough, now the maize that’s left for consumers in Germany is contaminated with cancer-causing Alfatoxin fungus. Bottom line: The good stuff gets burned, and we en up eating the toxic crap that’s left!
As maize farmers in Germany sell their harvests of top quality maize to subsidized biogas plants next door for conversion to biogas fuel, animal feed producers and food processing companies can no longer pay the high local prices and thus have to source the maize they need from foreign countries with low standards and dubious agricultural practices. Result: garbage winds up in the human food chain.
Today, all the major German media outlets are reporting on the discovery of thousands of tons of animal-feed contaminated with Alfatoxin fungus. These animals are for future meat and dairy products consumption.

News magazine Spiegel writes:
In Lower Saxony at least 10,000 tonnes of toxic maize feed are now in the feed chain. The goods originate from Serbia, and according to the Minister of Agriculture they are contaminated with the carcinogenic Aflatoxin fungus.”

The question many are now asking is: What is all this dangerous-grade maize feed from Serbia doing in Germany when so much of it is grown here locally? Europeans are burning the high quality maize and poisoning themselves to protect the climate!
Spiegel reports that up to 3500 beef livestock farms may be affected, supplied by 13 feedmills in Lower Saxony. Overall, up to 45,000 tonnes of feed may be involved.
Spiegel writes that Aflatoxin B1 “is one of the most carcinogenic substances in nature” and that the shipment from Serbia had a concentration that was 10 times higher than the allowable limit. The substance was first detected in contaminated milk.
Authorities claim that there is a little danger to consumers.

"More than two-thirds of all staff employed directly by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) are working on delivering Brexit, according to official figures released by the government. The response to a freedom of information request also shows that 320 staff have been transferred from other parts of Whitehall to help Michael Gove’s department cope with preparations for leaving the EU.  The figures show that by the end of last year, Defra had placed more than 2,700 staff into “EU exit roles”, amounting to 68% of the total 3,989 staff working for the department, not including its agencies. Last year, Defra said 400 staff had been seconded to Brexit-related work from the Environment Agency, which is responsible for enforcing rules on recycling, air pollution and flooding, and from Natural England, which protects animal habitats. Much of the work in Defra on Brexit will be on finding new arrangements for farmers if the UK no longer falls under the EU’s common agricultural policy. The work in Defra on Brexit also covers areas such as pet passports, fishing, chemicals and food imports. Tom Burke, the chair of independent climate-change thinktank E3G, said the figures showed Brexit was consuming time, effort and resources that could be used to tackle environmental challenges facing the country. The former government adviser on the environment said: “The government has already subjected the Environment Agency and Natural England to savage budget cuts, so that they are no longer able to do their job properly.” Calling for a second referendum in the interests of the environment, he said: “We are somehow unable to find the money we need to protect the environment but we can find all the cash we need to prepare for Brexit. “Whichever way you look at it, Brexit is bad for the environment. It takes us out of the European institutions that have successfully driven up environmental standards across Europe as well as in this country. It removes us from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, which has insisted that Britain starts reducing its air pollution. “At a time when the world is increasingly challenged by climate change and Britain is losing the battle to deliver breathable air, failing to meet our own targets for protecting nature and investing far too little in adapting to climate change, Brexit is a massive drain on the money and people necessary to meet the government’s promise to leave the environment in a better state than it found it.” A Defra spokesperson said: “As you’d expect, Defra and departments across Government are hard at work preparing for the UK’s exit from the EU. It’s the job of a responsible Government to ensure we’re prepared for all scenarios, and we are recruiting and prioritising our resources accordingly. “The Civil Service has always moved its staff to where they are most needed. But we will continue to deliver on the issues that matter to people, such as tackling single-use plastic and taking steps to improve animal welfare, as well as delivering on the promise of a Green Brexit.”"

===================================
How Much Power Should We Consume?
By Ed Caryl
There have been many suggestions here on this blog, and elsewhere, that the aim of the CAGW hoax is population control.
It is obvious that the poor people of the world produce more babies; witness Africa with a birth rate much higher than the rest of the world but a very low GDP. The Africans would seem to be the model for what the Greens want the world to be: a low carbon footprint. But with their high birth rate and low production, most of Africa teeters on the brink of famine. Unable to afford energy and sanitation, many burn forests and dump their waste untreated into the environment. This would suggest that the “low carbon footprint” model is only a recipe for disaster.
On the other hand, countries with well developed economies have low birth rates but high carbon footprints. If we are to reach a stable population, one that can be sustained far into the future, a world-wide well developed economy will be required.
A well developed economy requires energy. Producing food, goods, keeping people warm or cool, assuring hygiene, and providing transportation for people, food, and products, require energy.
What are the relationships between population growth, energy consumption, and production? First, here’s a chart of electricity consumed versus GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per person for 202 countries. (Source for all the numbers in these charts is the CIA World Factbook.) Electrical power consumption can be considered a proxy for all energy consumption.

Figure 1: Per person GDP as a function of electricity use.
It is clear from Figure 1 that to have a well developed economy with a high GDP, energy consumption must also be high. A rough trend can be seen: each KW hour produces about $10 GDP per person. The average GDP per kilowatt-hour for all countries is $8.31. The ten highest electrical power users per person are: Iceland, Norway, Kuwait, Canada, Finland, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, Luxembourg, United States, and Australia. Oil production in Africa and the Middle East distort some of the GDP numbers.
What does a high GDP do to birth rate?

Figure 2: As per capita GDP rises, fertility rates (children per woman) fall.


<!--

In Figure 2, a fertility rate of 2 is the replacement level. Fertility rates below 2 indicate a declining population. Above 2 there is an increasing population. As you can see, most of Africa is poor and pregnant. African countries that are not poor are oil producers like Libya and Nigeria. Most European populations are in decline. The exceptions are Andorra and Gibraltar. Asian countries with thriving economies are below the replacement value. Singapore is the bottom point on fertility with a rate of 0.78 children per woman. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau are just above that number.
There is a third leg to our stool: the relationship between fertility rate and electrical power. The next chart shows that relationship.

 Figure 3. The more power people consume, the less children they have.
Again, most of Africa, and some of Asia, is pregnant and powerless. It should be clear by now that there is an optimum electrical power and GDP necessary to result in a sustainable, stable population. Those numbers would appear to be about 3,000 KW hours and a GDP of about $30,000 annually per person. The total population is about seven billion. Therefore:
7 billion X 3,000 KWh = 21 trillion KWh.
21 trillion kilowatt-hours would seem to be a reasonable target. The world currently produces 19 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity. It appears that about 10% more electrical energy, with the accompanying improvement in GDP, primarily in Africa and some parts of Asia, would go a long way toward improving the quality of life and stabilizing population in those areas.
Energy drives civilization. This fundamental should be obvious to all, but apparently has not penetrated the consciousness of Greens, Progressives, and warmist zealots. Man builds cities to concentrate people, jobs, markets, and energy use into more efficient areas. Energy allows more efficient production, including food, technology, housing, and transportation. Cities and energy encourage creativity and innovation. More energy means a higher Gross Domestic Product.

Figure 4: GDP as a function of electrical power usage, for Europe and the Americas.
Figure 4 shows a clear relationship between GDP and electrical power consumption. If less electricity is generated, the cost of electricity will go up (due to the economic law of supply and demand), less will be used, and GDP will go down. The converse is, of course, more desirable: more power and reducing the cost, will result in a higher GDP. High priced wind and solar is not the answer. Let the market decide how to generate more power efficiently.
For those that are screaming “what about carbon footprint!”, the market will very soon take care of that non-problem. We are currently passing the “peak oil” point. Fossil fuels, in the long term, will be a declining portion of our power production. Barring governmental stupidity, nuclear power will be an increasing percentage of energy production.
Due to the fact that carbon dioxide is a vital plant food, as well as a minor greenhouse gas, sometime in the not too distant future we will be developing schemes to keep the atmospheric CO2 level above 400 ppm or higher.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMinggu lalu kami sudah mengulas informasi mengenai tata cara bermain judi bandar dominoQQ, dan pada kesempatan kali ini kami akan sangat senang bisa membagi informasi mengenai jenis kartu spesial judi online untuk semua player yang ingin megetahui lebih dalam seperti apa jajaran kartu spesial yang bisa membawa kemenangan besar untuk setiap participant ceme. Jadi dari artikel ini kami akan menjelaskan satu per satu seperti apa kelebihan dari kartu spesial judi over the internet yang banyak diharapkan oleh para player di internet.
Mengenal Kartu Spesial DominoQQ
 	Kartu qiu qiu
Kartu spesial pertama ini terkenal dengan sebutan qiu qiu atau jika diartikan dalam angka adalah kartu dengan angka 9 yang artinya merupakan kombinasi kartu dengan nilai tertinggi. Untuk mendapatkan kartu 9 ini maka kombinasi dari dua kartu yang dibagikan memiliki nilai 9, contoh 6 + 3, 5 + 4, 7 + 2 dan sebagainya. Dengan kartu dominoQQ ini maka kemenangan akan jauh lebih besar dari taruhan yang anda pasang. Anda akan menerima bayaran 2 kali lipat dari bandar karena memiliki kartu ini, namun kalau bandar dan person sama-sama memiliki kartu 9 maka kemenangan ada pada bandar. Misal anda bertaruh 1000 rupiah dan mendapatkan kartu 9 maka bayaran yang akan anda terima sebesar 1.970. jadi kalau pasang 1 juta anda menang 1.970.000, besar bukan ?
 	Kartu murni kecil dan murni besar
Kemudian kartu spesial dari permainan situs dominoqq yang paling sering didapatan oleh kebanyakan player adalah permainan judi kartu murni kecil dan besar, kombinasi kartu ini banyak didapatkan para person yang bermain di meja 8 orang. Jadi untuk kemenangan yang didapatkan hanya 50 ribu saja dengan pembelian jackpot sebesar 1000 rupiah setiap ronde permainan. Untuk mengetahui apakah kartu anda murni kecil atau besar silahkan simak baik-baik. Kartu murni kecil ditandai dengan dua kartu yang memiliki nilai 1 – 9. Contoh kartu anda 2 + bandar 4 = 6, maka masih termasuk murni kecil. Sedangkan kartu murni besar kartu anda berjumlah 20 dan bandar juga 20. Namun anda tidak perlu bingung untuk membacanya, karena ketika anda bermain secara otomatis sistem akan mendeteksi apakah kartu bandar dan person memiliki jackpot.
 	Kartu Balak
Selanjutnya kartu spesial dalam permainan judi dominoQQ yang tidak kalah menarik adalah kartu balak yang mempunyai nilai kemenangan jauh lebih besar yaitu maksimal Rp.200.000 untuk pembelian jackpot sebesar Rp.1000 rupiah saja, kartu balak ini adalah kartu kembar yang mana kedua kartu anda memiliki kombinasi seperti  ( 2 + 2 ) dan ( 4 + 4 ), namun tidak akan berlaku jika bandar tidak memiliki kartu kembar. Sekali lagi bahwa jackpot hanya akan terjadi jika bandar dan participant memiliki kartu spesial. 
 	Kartu Spesial 6 Dewa
Terakhir kartu spesial yang paling banyak di nantikan oleh para penikmat judi online adalah kartu spesial 6 dewa. Kartu satu ini cukup langka didapatkan, biasanya per hari hanya keluar beberapa saja di meja secara acak, jadi semua peluang pemain sama untuk mendapatkan kombinasi ini. Namun seperti yang sudah kami katakan tadi bahwa jackpot hanya akan terjadi jika participant dan bandar memiliki kartu jackpot. 
Demikian informasi dari artikel mengenai jenis-jenis kartu spesial dalam permainan judi ceme on the web. Terima kasih.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEnergy rationing begins. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
This is serious. A new law has been passed by the German government, quietly and almost unnoticed. Soon in the future, the government will tell its citizens how much energy they can consume. 
If the German State can pass this, then it can pretty much do whatever the hell it damn well pleases.
Gone are the days of a government that is there to serve its citizens. Here to stay is a group of elitists who are going to boss the citizens around and tell them how to live.
But of course it’s all in the name of saving planet from climate catastrophe. Never mind what Edenhofer of the PIK said awhile back, read here. They are moving quickly now, and Germany is now lost. Although climate scepticism is rising, it’s too late.
America – the last hope
I pray that the few remaining freedom-loving lawmakers in America are taking notice of this eco-martial law movement now sweeping across Europe. The greenshirts are already getting out of their cars in front of your homes (think EPA). Are you going to let them kick your doors down too? They are only waiting for the green light from Ms Lisa Jackson.
Germany’s first step in declaring eco-martial law
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) reports on the new German Energy Efficiency Law that was quietly passed on the 4th of November 2010 with nary a press report and under the noses of its citizens -passed under the guise of “necessary-to-implement EU Directives” to increase energy efficiency. The name of the law in German:
Gesetz über Energiedienstleistungen und andere Energieeffizienzmaßnahmen vom 4. November 2010 (BGBl. I S. 1483)
In English:
Law on Energy Services and other Energy Efficiency Measures dated 4 November 2010 (BGBl. I S. 1483)
Just call it the Energy Tyranny Act. Michael Limburg of EIKE has looked at this in detail and writes:
With this law, the free market is going to be abolished, carefully converted with efforts to…“remove existing market obstacles and deficiencies.“ 
Of course the law provides for the creation of a new bureaucracy to implement its provisions – with the state taking over authority. Limburg writes about what the Energy Tyranny Act means:
That means citizens will have to be and can be forced to make comprehensive energy savings in a very short time. And to make sure that functions:
Power companies, grid operators and energy retail companies are especially required to carry out special obligations in order to create the conditions for the development and promotion of a market for energy service companies and for creating other measures for improving energy efficiency for the consumer. Included in this are especially information, promotion and assurance obligations. These companies are also obligated to maintain infomational billing of energy consumption.

//-->




In plain English: Power and energy companies will be required to collect consumption data on each and every citizen and provide the means to meet energy efficiency targets.
Enforcement by the state
All this will have to be monitored of course – by a new powerful bureaucracy, which will have powers to run lives. Paragraph 9 of the law stipulates which government body will observe our energy consumption. The Federal Office for Economics and Export Control will take on the duties of the Federal Office for Energy Efficiency.
Some of these duties include the calculation of energy saving target values and monitoring the progress savings are made by the consumers. And if savings are not achieved quickly enough, Limburg writes:
In the event that the forces of the newly abolished free market are not sufficient, which of course will certainly turn out to be the case, they will be able to draw up proposals for forcing the citizens, and to sanction if necessary, to reach the ambitious targets.
EIKE reader Stefan Steger writes:
Maybe I’ve seen too much science fiction, but it appears the Orwellian surveillance society is becoming a reality; you could call it East Germany 2.0 . The whole thing has a system to it:
1. Implementation of smart grids.
2. Outsourcing of meter reading by public utilities.
3. State control of meter reading.
4. Regulating the energy consumption per person/ household etc.
5. Limiting of energy use by using intelligent meters and automatic shut-off  switches.
6. And liquidators will be sent to violating households.
Mike Limburg ends by quoting Kurt Tucholsky:
If people could change the course of politics through elections, then elections would have been banned long ago.”
That is indeed a sad but true commentary on the state of German democracy (what’s left of it) today.
The Great Menace – how far can this go?
This is just the start of the so-called “The Great Transformation” envisioned by extremists like Edenhofer, Schellnhuber and host of other social engineering zealots. It begins with rationing energy, but where does it end? What’s next?
Our water consumption? Our meat consumption? Our internet access? Our mobility? Our lights? Our weight?  How about sugar intake? The right to our organs? Our life span (death panels)? Our property and money we earn? Our freedom to speak?
They can do what they want and there is nothing now to stop them. Today there is no political opposition to this coming green tyranny – all parties in Germany, from right to left, are for it. They are only fighting each other to see who gets to have the fun of carrying out this dangerous experiment. They are all racing to see who can be Erich Honecker 2.0 first!
Urgently needed is an opposition…and maybe another D-Day.
=========================================================
UPDATE: http://www.greattransformation.e
Democratic regimes are not well prepared for the level of participation that is required: Can free democratic societies cope with the effects of grave changes in the global climate, or might authoritarian regimes possibly be better placed to enforce the necessary measures?”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s little wonder that the German public is beginning an uprising against the mandatory fees that every citizen is forced to pay in order to fund the country’s vast public radio and television. Every year the widely hated GEZ shakes €8 billion from Germans. For German readers, here’s a stinging commentary on just how unbelievably arrogant the German public media has become.
But not only are listeners and viewers fed up with the burgeoning arrogance of the public media, but also by their outright deceit and political propaganda, which they feel is necessary to properly up bring citizens.
One reader provides us yet another example of this. Deutsche Welle (German Broadcasting) here provides its readers with the latest “news” on Fukushima. The elitists in the German public media feel it is one of their solemn duties to tell audiences that nuclear energy is evil, kills thousands, and that we are all supposed to hate it.
From the report we see Japan is waking up to the fact that providing power without nuclear plants is not an easy thing after all, and so the country is contemplating a U-turn and returning to nuclear power, less than 2 years after the Fukushima disaster.
Ministerpräsident Shinzo Abe, who took office just a few days ago, says Japan simply cannot afford to stop using nuclear power.
The DW report, whose source is the German Press Agency (DPA) among others, pretty much provides background information on the Abe’s decision. But it’s the last sentence in the DW report that raises eyebrows:
Through the devastating earthquake and subsequent tsunami, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Northeastern Japan was seriously damaged. There were meltdowns in three reactor blocks; thousands of people died. It was the worst nuclear catastrophe since the Chernobyl accident in 1986.”
Thousands of people died? Really?
Sadly, editors could not be bothered to check if that spectacular number could be right. One place to start a simple fact-check would be Wikipedia, which is known for political correctness. It turns out that the “thousands of people died” claim is totally bogus – deceit fabricated and now being spread by various European media outlets.

Wikipedia writes that of what few deaths did occur, 2 deaths were caused by “sustained multiple external injuries and were believed to have died from blood loss”, and a Japanese research company found that “other deaths were due to the disruption of hospital operations, exacerbation of pre-existing health problems and the stress of dramatic changes in life” and that “the vast majority of people who died during evacuation were elderly. 45 patients were reported dead after the evacuation of a hospital in Futaba due to lack of food, water and medical care as evacuation was delayed by three days.”
Wikipedia then goes on to write about some people being over-exposed to radiation, but nowhere does the report mention “thousands of people died”. In fact, the Wikipedia report writes (my emphasis):
As of September 2012, there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures.”
It appears that any radiation deaths show up only in models:
According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Jacobson, the radiation released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimater being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan.”
Quite surprisngly, Wikipedia then writes that nuclear power actually saves and extends lives – commenting on the numbers of people who died or may die from radiation exposure (emphasis added):

These numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.”

So the next time you pick up or hear any report coming from Germany’s elitist, forced publicly-funded media, don’t believe a damn word of it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome bloggers do a yearly wrap up, and so I thought I’d do a monthly and annual summary today.
2010 – the humble start of NTZ
This blog all started with me reading climate science skeptic sites like WUWT, IceCap, CA, Bishop Hill and many others since 2007. In March 2010 I happened to be at Donna Laframboise’s No Frakking Consensus and volunteered to be a citizen auditor for her IPCC 2007 audit of the literature cited in the report, which we found out was quite gray.
So through all this I got the invitation from WordPress to start my own blog. I thought: “Hey – why not!,” and started on April 1st. My humble target was to write a couple of posts per week and to reach a 1000 page-views by the end of the month.
When you start blogging, everything feeds on itself. You get your first reader comment, and it’s a thrill. And so you write more. I ended up writing much more of course, at least one post a day. And the visitors came gradually, 40 – 50 page-views a day at first. One day I had 179 – a post about the first Earth Day.
The big break
The big break came on April 23 when I came across a story at the German-language Ria Novosti which had a piece called Global Cooling Will Make Arctic Natural Resources Inaccessible – Scientist about a Russian scientist who warned of cooling. That story led me to write the post: Russian Scientist: Expect Cooling – Pols Sitting On The Wrong Horse. It was Friday afternoon I remember, and not much happened…until Marc Morano put it up as the big headline at Climate Depot a day later on Saturday. And the rest is history. That day, April 24, NTZ went from 50 page-views – to the thousands. NoTricksZone was born. I’ve been hopelessly addicted ever since. At the end of April I had over 8000 page views – well over the original target of 1000.
Thank you readers
I don’t like to give out numbers, but I am happy to say that in November NTZ went over the 150,000 page views plateau for that month, far beyond anything I ever imagined. Thank you readers!
I’ve made all the mistakes new bloggers could make. You find out what works and what doesn’t. I tend to rush things out too quickly, and need to be more patient. It really is best to post it in the morning after a night’s sleep. I’ve blown my top a couple of times, too. Hopefully there are no hard feelings out there.
It is important to stay on the good side of your fellow bloggers, as readers get referred back and forth and all. The sites I get the most traffic from (in random order!) are Tom Nelson, WUWT, Climate Depot and Bishop Hill. There are many others. But it’s not about getting traffic. To me it’s all about having fun doing it. If you have fun, then things naturally fall into place all by themselves.
December NTZ summary
December 3-4: The Climate Conference in Berlin where I got the chance to meet some of the other German bloggers and have even agreed to cooperate with them in an effort to get the German stories out to the world. That’s right, the spotlight is now on you German warmist scientists from now on – so behave yourselves.

December 7: The newest list of climate-gates was released: List of gates balloons to 129/. But I think that will be the last. There are just too many scandals out there to keep track of.
December 13: The failure of Cancun – Cancun complete travesty and rout/. The media and bureaucrats made it look like a success, but it was a failure throughout. But they sure did have a grand ol time down there (in the record cold)!

December 17: Der Spiegel’s 1974 article on a coming ice age was examined. Read here. It’s a bit hilarious that the chances of warming back then were pegged at 1 in 10,000 – at best!
December 18: And what would December 2010 be without all the news of the cold and snow that was supposed to be rare in Europe. Read here and here.
December 23: And the PIK trying to blame it all on warming.  PIK says expect warmer colder winters.
December 27: We also heard a German professor come out on German radio and slam all the global warming science put out by the warmists: German climate professor slams climate religion.
December 28: Matti Vooro’s research showed that there is a growing number of international scientists who, like Joe Bastardi, feel cooling is in the future. Cooling over the next 1 to 3 decades/.
Grand year for the skeptics
All in all, 2010 was a grand year for the skeptics, and a nightmare for the warmists, who were kept barely alive by an El Nino. But that baby won’t be there in 2011! By 2015, AGW will be relegated to a footnote in history and remain popular only among a few die-hard fringe kooks like fraudsters James Hansen and Michael Mann. Their days are numbered – start counting them off. I feel more optimistic than ever.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPhysicist Dr. Rainer Link brings our attention to the EU’s new 20/20/20 climate scheme designed to inflict intense pain on citizens with literally zero benefits, read it here at his German blog RL Rational (in German).
This 20/20/20 program aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020, and to increase the share of renewable energy to 20% – all to satisfy the needs of those suffering from rescue-the-planet delusions.
The questions of course are: How much is this EU scheme going to cost? And what are we going to gain from it?
The answers are respectively: a fortune and nothing. Next week Connie Heedegard, EU Climate Commissar, will release more on the costs. But this is no big secret. Last week I posted on this here: 15 Trillion Dollar Self Flagellation.
The $15 trillion dollars is of course will incur only if the madness goes uninterrupted until 2050. But until 2020, Dr. Link writes on how accenture and BARCLAYS Bank introduced a study called: Carbon Capital, Financing The Low Carbon Economy, which details the necessary expected costs needed to reach the 20/20/20 target.
Dr. Link then puts together a cost/benefit analysis of the 20/20/20 EU Climate Requirements and comes up with the numbers, read details here (in German).

Total cost of the reductions up to the year 2020: €2.9 trillion
Total CO2 emissions reduction by 2020: 2.2 billion tonnes
That comes to about €6400 per EU citizen. Dr. Link says although that may sound impressive when taken alone, the sheer stupidity and frivolity of it all becomes clear when you compare it to the CO2 emissions growth from developing countries and the rest of the world: Link writes of the 2.2 biilion tonne reduction:
During this time period it compares to a total global emissions of 320 billion tonnes. The global increase in CO2 emissions of 0.5 billion tonnes per year will wipe out the EU CO2 reduction (which will cost 2.9 trillion euros) in just four years.
Dr. Link then calculates how much of a global theoretical temperature reduction this will lead to. Answer:
0.002°C
It would be much cheaper if the EU just bought everyone an air conditioner. That 0.002°C can neither be measured by a standard home thermometer nor perceived by human senses. All because of two fairy tales: 1) CO2 is leading to climate catastrophe, and 2) Europe can save the planet.
Is there any politican left out there who’s got the spine to stand up to this madness?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s because you’ve created them yourselves, or you’ve allowed yourselves to be blindly led into them.
I admit feeling a bit of Schadenfreude, reading the warminista blogs like Climate Progress, where they are all in shock. “Tell me it can’t be true!”
Come on guys, you couldn’t see this coming? Were you all so intoxicated and hypnotised by the movement that you couldn’t see it?

Betrayed this coutnry sound bite Al Gore sound bites

This spiral of violent behaviour started long ago and you were warned time and again. But your leaders told you not to listen. They told you that we are just deniers.
Climate Progress readers, and all you AGW religious faithful, the people who made this clip are your leaders, and they’re the ones who took you to this ghastly spot. Now you don’t want to believe it – again. How many times must this happen to you before you wake up?
First it was Climategate. But they took care of that for you. They whitewashed it, 3 times even, and that was enough so that you could manage to rationalise it away and begin to believe in the cause again. And so you continued to follow. When they cued you to chant “denier!, denier!” – you did so in unison, just as they instructed. When you were asked to call sceptics flat-earthers and to put them down – you obeyed, and on it went. You were taught and instructed to hate, and so you did.
And now this. The Truth.
It felt good while it lasted, though. You felt superior. And at the same time you had all these cool, hip and enlightened friends. You belonged. And you were saving the planet. You followed and followed. It was a cause.
Not long ago they had called on you to engage in civil disobedience, and many of you did that too, or you did what you could and cheered it on.
While your leaders orchestrated your thinking, they lived high on the hog making tons of money with it, flying all over the world in private jets, living in huge mansions, and decorated each other with awards.
Then they got the kids into the movement. After all it’s the future. The planet is at the tipping point. The kids have to be in fear along with the rest of you. And so you taught your kids to be afraid, to be very afraid, and that believer kids are cool, while sceptic kids are flat-earth deniers or just ignorant rednecks.
So let’s blow them up.

There isn’t enough room on the planet for them anyway. That’s what they kept telling you. Humans are parasites when you get down to it.
And what about parents? Well, many of them are just losers, stuck in yesterday. In fact they suck, too. They just want to ruin all the fun. So don’t listen to them. Either they’re with us, or they’re against us.

And what about the bastards who don’t believe and even have the audacity to argue against us? What shall we do with them? Well, we know where they live now, and where they work. Let’s drag them before Nuremberg trials and prosecute them for climate crimes. Yeah!
Trials? Come to think about it, why bother? Let’s just blow them up too – right there on the spot!

And now that your leaders have exposed themselves, look at how they’re trying to run and hide. Look at them deny they were involved. “It wasn’t us! We think the clip is disgusting too!”
You guys made the clip. It’s your work. Nice to see you finally think it’s disgusting.
Hopefully you followers will wake up this time.

"Thousands of students and activists have taken to the streets of more than 50 British towns and cities demanding urgent action on climate change for the third time in as many months. The organisers of the Youth Strike 4 Climate movement said “sizeable events” took place in London, Sheffield, Manchester and Brighton, among other towns and cities. They mirrored events around the world, as protesters from cities as far apart as Helsinki and Delhi took to the streets.  In London, protesters walked across Westminster Bridge waving banners demanding a “Green New Deal”, before bringing Oxford Street to a halt by sitting down in the middle of the famous shopping thoroughfare. Drivers looked out of their car windows, irked as young people banged on their doors, telling them to turn their engines off. Bus drivers sat in traffic on gridlocked streets, their vehicles devoid of passengers. George Bond, 16, one of the organisers of the youth climate strike said that they decided to disrupt London’s busy shopping district because of the link between consumerist culture and climate change. “It’s a stark reminder that in the western world we enjoy a culture of convenience, while people in the global south are working in bad conditions and suffering the most from climate change,” he said. The Metropolitan police said there had been no arrests, though one student was taken into a police van for refusing to move. Earlier, between 400 and 800 students joined a range of youth and leftwing activist groups in Parliament Square. Theo Sharieff, 23, a Socialist Students organiser from Birmingham, said: “To fight climate change we need socialist change.” Creative banners abounded. One youngster held a poster with teenage actor Timothee Chalamet which read “the Earth is getting hotter than Timothee Chalamet”. An eight-year-old, Agnes Freij from St Aidan’s primary school held a banner with a painting of Dr Zeus’ Lorax reading: “I am the Lorax and I speak for the trees.” She told the Guardian: “The Lorax speaks for the trees because they don’t have mouths. Right now I think the trees would be saying, stop this climate crisis.” In the Highlands, Holly Gillibrand, who has gained national prominence for her activism, was on strike for the 14th week in a row, in her usual spot outside her school in Fort William with friends. Gillibrand, 13, was not missing school because the Easter break is under way in Scotland. She said: “I think it’s important to strike during the holidays because people were saying that we were on strike because we got to miss school. This shows were are dedicated and willing to give up our free time for this crisis.” Gillibrand has met Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and wants to see politicians take more action. “We’re a rich, developed country so we need to be reducing our emissions more quickly,” she said. In Sheffield, the former Green party leader Natalie Bennett was among the speakers at a city centre rally. At the end of the London march, a selection of letters were read out by activists at Oxford Circus, including submissions from Yoko Ono, Kate Tempest and Rebecca Solnit. More than 15,000 students took part in the first Youth Strike 4 Climate event in February, which organisers said was prompted by the alarming inaction of the government. Precise figures for Friday’s turnout were not immediately available – but some found it easier to attend as some schools are already on their Easter break. Jake Woodier, of the UK Student Climate Network, said: “Thousands upon thousands of young people across the UK have shown their resolve by continuing to demonstrate for climate justice for the third month in a row, while also demanding a Green New Deal for the UK. “This idea is by the people, for the people and puts people and the planet on an equal footing. The time for action is now.” The youth climate movement was inspired by the Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, 16, who has gone on strike every Friday since August 2018. Thunberg is currently in her 34th week of striking outside the Riksdag parliament building in Stockholm. The latest strikes come after a UN report warned that limiting temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – the point beyond which climate impacts become irreversibly severe – needs new levels of action. On Thursday, the environmentalist and broadcaster David Attenborough told the IMF spring meeting that humans have at most 20 years to prevent the complete destruction of the environment. The Norwich South MP Clive Lewis signalled the Labour party’s support for the movement, writing: “The time for incrementalism has passed. The young people striking today recognise this.” The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has expressed support for the strikes, saying collective action can make a “profound difference”."

"Insurers have warned that climate change could make cover for ordinary people unaffordable after the world’s largest reinsurance firm blamed global warming for $24bn (£18bn) of losses in the Californian wildfires. Ernst Rauch, Munich Re’s chief climatologist, told the Guardian that the costs could soon be widely felt, with premium rises already under discussion with clients holding asset concentrations in vulnerable parts of the state.  “If the risk from wildfires, flooding, storms or hail is increasing then the only sustainable option we have is to adjust our risk prices accordingly. In the long run it might become a social issue,” he said after Munich Re published a report into climate change’s impact on wildfires. “Affordability is so critical [because] some people on low and average incomes in some regions will no longer be able to buy insurance.” The lion’s share of California’s 20 worst forest blazes since the 1930s have occurred this millennium, in years characterised by abnormally high summer temperatures and “exceptional dryness” between May and October, according to a new analysis by Munich Re. Wetter and more humid winters spurred new forest growth which became tinder dry in heatwave conditions that preceded the wildfires, the report’s authors said. After comparing observational data spanning several decades with climate models, the report concluded that the wildfires, which killed 85 people, were “broadly consistent with climate change”. Nicolas Jeanmart, the head of personal insurance, general insurance and macroeconomics at Insurance Europe, which speaks for 34 national insurance associations, said the knock-on effects from rising premiums could pose a threat to social order. “The sector is concerned that continuing global increases in temperature could make it increasingly difficult to offer the affordable financial protection that people deserve, and that modern society requires to function properly,” he said. Munich Re’s insurance cover in hurricane-prone regions such as Florida is already higher than in northern Europe, by an order of magnitude. Premiums are also being adjusted in regions facing an increased threat from severe convective storms which hold an energy and severity primed by global warming. These include parts of Germany, Austria, France, south-west Italy and the US midwest. Increases in the intensity and frequency of California’s wildfire season are predicted by climate models, and the Munich Re analysis combines monthly meteorological data with financial losses to graph the trend’s rise since 2001. Average annual wildfire losses trailed well below $5bn even within this millennium, until 2017 and 2018, when they leapt to more than $20bn. Munich Re believes that global warming made a “significant contribution” to this. No insurer has linked wildfires to climate change before, although a Lloyds report into Superstorm Sandy in 2014 found that global warming-linked sea level rises had increased surge losses around Manhattan by 30%. Climate scientists say that linking extreme weather events to climate change is akin to attributing the performance of a steroid-taking sportsman to drug use – the connections are clearer in patterns than in individual disasters. Paul Fisher, the Bank of England’s former coordinator on climate change, and a fellow at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, said: “In general, one can’t prove that a single event is the result of climate change but it is likely to cause more such events of greater severity.” “It is very interesting if insurers conclude that climate change was a significant contributory factor to the event and will make the insurance companies think carefully about the pricing and availability of similar insurance policies.” It may also influence several court cases testing the liability of fossil fuel companies for the effects of global warming. Dr Ben Caldecott, the director of Oxford University’s sustainable finance programme, said: “Company directors and fiduciaries will ultimately be held responsible for avoidable climate-related damages and losses and urgently need to up their game to avoid litigation and liability.” Munich Re has divested its large thermal coal holdings. However, it maintains some gas and oil investments."

Share this...FacebookTwitterBenny Peiser alerts us to this excellent feature story brought to you by the UK Spectator on the wildlife devastation being wrought by “climate-friendly wind turbines”. Hats off to the Spectator for this one.
The story just goes to show you how little the environmentalist thought these things out:
1. Wind turbines don’t produce that much electricity.
2. They run on average only at about 20% of their rated capacity.
3. Their lifetimes are turning out to be only half of what was promised.
4. They are turning the landscape into a panoramic eyesore.
5. Now, we see they are killing birds and bats by the millions.
Recall how environmentalists like to think they are intellectually superior to everyone else, and that they rarely make mistakes. At worst, they only have to “adjust” their ideas at times. This assumed intellectual superiority is what drives them.
Well, it now looks like they got some major adjusting to do with their thinking. But I suppose this windmill carnage will be too much for them to cope with, and so they’ll go on denying it and act like they’re rescuing the climate.
How can we expect them to understand the complexities of climate when they can’t even think more than one step ahead?
We saw the same pattern of behaviour with the communists and their economics. Did they change course? Except for China, they all obstinately stayed in acute denial until everything around them collapsed. Expect the same from the kook-green, drugged-up-on-climate-protectionism European governments and media.

Clive Hambler writes (emphasis added):
Though I started out neutral on renewable energy, I’ve since seen the havoc wreaked on wildlife by wind power, hydro power, biofuels and tidal barrages. The environmentalists who support such projects do so for ideological reasons. What few of them have in their heads, though, is the consolation of science.”
One has to wonder which species is more intelligent: birds or environmentalist kooks?
I’ve heard it suggested that birds will soon adapt to avoid turbine blades. But your ability to learn something when you’ve been whacked on the head by an object travelling at 200 mph is limited.”
I seriously doubt that green-kooks are any more capable of learning.

"Toyota has said that it was not consulted on a Liberal party campaign that uses targeted Facebook ads to falsely claim Bill Shorten wants to tax popular car brands including the Toyota Hilux and other utility vehicles. “Toyota Australia were not consulted on the use of the HiLux in government materials.”  The ads – which appeared on Monday – use Facebook ad functionality to target users with an interest in particular vehicle types to make the false claim about Labor’s policy, which includes vehicle emissions standards and a target of 50% of new car sales being electric vehicles by 2030. The Japanese carmaker also said it was on track with global plans to electrify the entire vehicle line up by 2025.  The Coalition is stepping up its attack despite the fact the treasurer and former environment minister Josh Frydenberg has spruiked electric vehicles on the basis they will save drivers money and that vehicle emissions standards are still part of the government’s plan to reduce emissions. The ads, posted by the Liberal party’s official account, state that “Labor’s car tax would mean higher prices on some of Australia’s most popular cars” and encourage users to “sign up to stop Labor’s car tax”. Labor’s electric vehicle policy, released earlier in April, includes only one tax-related measure – a deduction of 20% depreciation for businesses which buy electric vehicles worth more than $20,000. The imposition of an emissions standard of 105g CO2/km for light vehicles is not a tax because it does not raise any revenue for the government. In fact, the uptake of electric vehicles is estimated to cost the budget more than $1bn a year by 2030 in lost fuel excise, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The Facebook ads target users who have indicate their interest in popular car brands including Holdens, Ford Rangers, Toyota Hiluxes and Mitsubishi Tritons. Libs are now running targeted FB ads against specific car types - which are all available ""interest"" categories for FB ads (I just checked and you can target australians in specific age ranges interested in mitsubishi tritons if you want) pic.twitter.com/p395Ftf8Ti The ads do not contain detailed authorisations, although the Australian Electoral Commission has told Guardian Australia that ads meet their standards if details are posted in the “about” section of the posting page. Other ads on the Liberal party Facebook page suggest that emissions standards “will add up to $4,863 to the cost of a new car”, citing a 2016 report by the Centre for International Economics. An infrastructure department report published in December 2016 estimated that a 105g CO2/km emissions standard phased in from 2020 to 2025 will save $27.5bn in fuel costs and achieve $2.7bn worth of greenhouse gas abatement, for a total $30.1bn saving. It estimated a total cost of $16.2bn to achieve the standard, for a total net benefit of $13.9bn. As recently as August 2017 Frydenberg said vehicle efficiency standards were about “reducing fuel costs and carbon emissions at the same time”. “In Australia in 2016 the average amount of CO2 emitted per kilometre was 182 grams, while the EU is moving to 100g/km by 2021, and in the US the target is 105g/km by 2025,” he said. Frydenberg said if Australia had fuel efficiency standards in line with comparable nations, “estimates of the fuel saving per passenger vehicle could be above $500 per year, or nearly $28bn in total by 2040”. “Given the long distances travelled in regional Australia, the savings could be even greater for people living outside the main cities.” The environment department website states the the emissions reduction fund – the centrepiece of the Coalition’s climate change policy – will provide “support for the uptake of renewable energy and energy efficiency [and] vehicle emission standards”. On Sunday Scott Morrison accused Shorten of wanting to “end the weekend” because the electric vehicles would hurt “Australians who love being out there in their four-wheel drives”. The Coalition was elected under Tony Abbott in 2013 with a fierce campaign against the Labor government’s price on carbon, which it labelled a carbon tax. In 2017 Abbott’s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin, admitted “it wasn’t a carbon tax … it was many other things in nomenclature terms but we made it a carbon tax”. “We made it a fight about the hip pocket and not about the environment,” she told Sky News. “That was brutal retail politics and it took Abbott about six months to cut through and when he cut through, Gillard was gone.”"
"Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world, a landmark government report has found, warning that drastic action is the only way to avoid catastrophic outcomes. “The science is clear – Canada’s climate is warming more rapidly than the global average, and this level of warming effectively cannot be changed,” Nancy Hamzawi, assistant deputy minister for science and technology at Environment and Climate Change Canada, told reporters on Monday.  The report, released late on Monday by Environment and Climate Change Canada, paints a grim picture of Canada’s future, in which deadly heatwaves and heavy rainstorms become a common occurrence. Forty-three government scientists and academics authored the peer-reviewed report. While global temperatures have increased 0.8C since 1948, Canada has seen an increase of 1.7C – more than double the global average. And in the Arctic, the warming is happening at a much faster rate of 2.3C, the report says. While the increased warming in the Arctic is not yet fully understood, snow and ice play a critical role in reflecting the sun’s radiation and heat. But scientists say the retreat of glaciers and disappearing sea ice both contribute to a feedback loop of warming, which is one of the factors contributing to Canada’s disproportionate temperature increase. The report suggests the majority of warming felt in Canada and around the globe is the result of burning fossil fuels. Canada has already pledged to cut emissions by 200m tonnes by 2030 – a cornerstone of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s national climate strategy – largely through a federally mandated carbon tax and shuttering coal-fired plants. Despite the urgency of the report, Canada remains mired in a political battle over climate policy. Trudeau has pushed for a national carbon pricing strategy, and on Monday the federal government imposed the tax on four provinces that refuse to implement one. Conservative politicians have pledged to remove the tax if they win this fall’s general election, arguing that it is too much of a burden for Canadians. But under the current plan, households will receive rebate cheques from the federal government to offset any added expenses from the tax – meaning costs to the average consumer are negligible. The report makes clear that Canada faces markedly different outcomes, depending on the policies it chooses to reduce emissions. Under a scenario in which global emissions are dramatically reduced, average temperatures will rise only 3C across the country by 2100, including the Arctic region. But if countries – including Canada – fail to act aggressively, increases of 7-9 degrees are likely, and the Arctic faces the prospect of 11 degrees of warming. Under the report’s worst-case scenario, the risk of deadly heatwaves increases tenfold bring with it droughts and forest fires. Western Canada has already grappled with two years of record forest fire seasons. The risk of major rain events also doubles, meaning cities will be inundated with catastrophic urban flooding. Access to critical sources of fresh water will also be constrained, due in large part to reduced winter snowfall, which in turn becomes a source of clean water when the snowpack melts. Many of the previously documented effects – melting permafrost, disappearing sea ice and glacial retreat – are only set to intensify in the coming years. “We are already seeing the effects of widespread warming in Canada,” said Elizabeth Bush, a climate science adviser at Environment Canada, told reporters. “It’s clear, the science supports the fact that adapting to climate change is an imperative. Urgent action is needed to reduce emissions.”"
"Sikhs around the world are taking part in a scheme to plant a million new trees as a “gift to the entire planet”. The project aims to reverse environmental decline and help people reconnect with nature as part of celebrations marking 550 years since the birth of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak.  Rajwant Singh, the president of the Washington DC-based environmental organisation EcoSikh, which is coordinating the Million Tree Project, said he wanted to mark the anniversary in a significant way. “Guru Nanak was a nature lover. [He] had talked about nature as a manifestation of God and many of his writings talk about how we need to learn lessons of life from nature.” One of Guru Nanak’s hymns, which many Sikhs recite as a daily prayer, includes the lyrical line: “Air is the teacher, water is the father, earth is the mother.” Singh said he hoped the project would motivate Sikhs – especially the young – to improve their relationship with nature and would be seen more broadly as “a gift to the entire planet”. The Sikh diaspora has taken on the challenge and tens of thousands of trees have already been planted. These are mostly in India – the majority of the world’s Sikh population lives in the state of Punjab, which is planning to plant 550 saplings in every village – but also in the UK, US, Australia and Kenya. Sikh Union Coventry has started planting native trees, shrubs and flowers such as hazel and hawthorn at Longford Park, and is exploring locations in schools, parks and recreation areas. Palvinder Singh Chana, the chair of Sikh Union Coventry, said: “As Sikhs, our connection to the environment is an integral part of our faith and identity. Future generations will benefit from the fruits of our labour, symbolising peace, friendships and continuity for generations to come.” EcoSikh is also working with Afforestt, an organisation that trains people to design and build small native forests that grow quickly and are a sustainable part of the ecosystem. Singh said more than 1,800 of these forests were planned across the world, and that the million tree target would be achieved by the time of Guru Nanak’s birthday in November."

Share this...FacebookTwitterBoy I’ll tell you-  climate science is getting more and more convincing with every passing day.
Remember how we were always told that climate change would impact poor Africa the most…and negatively? The German language Die Presse has an online report called:
Warming: Will Africa starve or flourish?
It’s about the PNAS 28.2 paper just out, which came to the astonishing conclusion that climate change will either have positive impacts on agriculture in Africa, or it will have negative impacts. Not only that, agriculture there will have to adapt to these changes.
How brilliant! It took leading earth-systems scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to figure that out.
First, recall that the 2007 IPCC Report claimed that crop yields in some countries could get reduced by 50% and that access to food could be put at risk – all because of climate change.
These were the dire projections made just a few years ago. But then came Climategate and the discovery of a series of errors in the IPCC report, and its heavy use of grey literature. Scientists began to doubt. So to get more certainty on the subject, projections were re-evaluated and are now being revamped. The PNAS presents the new certainty.
The new results are out and were produced by a group led by Christoph Müller of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and appear in the PNAS 28.2. The group assessed 20 scientific studies on Africa and its agriculture since 2007. Unfortunately the latest results show everything but consensus and certainty. Die Presse writes:
Müller’s group found that some studies predict agricultural production in Africa will collapse to almost nothing while other studies see blooming agriculture like never before – with crop yields up by as much as 168%.”

Does anyone think these results are going to be of any use for African policy makers? The PNAS 28.2 abstract says:
Despite large uncertainty, there are several robust conclusions from published literature for policy makers and research agendas: agriculture everywhere in Africa runs some risk to be negatively affected by climate change; existing cropping systems and infrastructure will have to change to meet future demand. With respect to growing population and the threat of negative climate change impacts, science will now have to show if and how agricultural production in Africa can be significantly improved.”
Say what?
– Robust conclusions?
– Agriculture everywhere runs some risk?
– Cropping systems and infrastructure will have to change to meet future demand?
– Science will have to show how agricultural production can be improved?
No kidding! Really? Folks, what a pile of scientific crap this is! This report says nothing except confirm that they don’t have a clue about what will happen in Africa and its agriculture. They know less than ever before. Die Presse sums up the rubbish beautifully, describing this paper with an old German saying that is often used for such results:
Wenn der Hahn kräht auf dem Mist
Ändert sich das Wetter
Oder es belibt wie es ist
In English, roughly (doesn’t quite rhyme):
When the cock crows on a pile of shit
Either the weather will change
or it’ll stay as it is.
This means this PNAS paper says nothing. But this is kind of the crap that gets published by “prestigious scientific journals” nowadays. And so Die Presse writes:
The very science that cannot even project what will come in the future is now supposed to tell us ‘if and how’ agricultural production in Africa should adapt and how agricultural yields can be ‘significantly improved’ under the unknown new conditions.”

"Cities around the world were marking Earth Hour on Saturday by turning off lights at 8:30pm local time in a call for global action on climate change.  The Earth Hour gesture calls for greater awareness and more sparing use of resources, especially fossil fuels that produce carbon gases and lead to global warming. Beginning in Sydney in 2007, Earth Hour has spread to more than 180 countries, with tens of millions of people joining in. In Hong Kong, major buildings along Victoria Harbour turned off their non-essential lights and the city’s popular tourist attraction known as the Symphony of Lights was cancelled. More than 3,000 corporations in Hong Kong signed up for Earth Hour 2019, according to the WWF Hong Kong website. Skyscrapers including the Bank of China Tower and the HSBC Building in Central, the city’s major business district, switched off their lights in response to the global movement. The City of Lights also turned off the Eiffel Tower’s nightly twinkle to mark Earth Hour. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo dimmed the lights on the city’s most famous monument for an hour. In Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, the island’s tallest building, Taipei 101, joined surrounding buildings in shutting off the lights as part of the Earth Hour event. In coal-reliant Poland, top tourist sites also turned off their lights when local clocks hit 8:30pm. In the capital Warsaw, the spired landmark Palace of Culture and Science turned off its night illumination, along with some churches and Old Town walls. Lights were also switched off in several landmarks in the Greek capital. The Acropolis, Athens City Hall and Lycabettus Hill, towering above the Athens centre, went dark and the parliament building joined in. However, calls by the mayor of Athens for citizens to join in by turning off the lights in their houses went mostly unheeded. The Empire State Building in New York was planning to participate in Earth Hour at 8.30pm local time (12.30am GMT)."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFirst, a few words about 2011
I don’t want to bore everyone with a long recap of 2011, just a few highlights off the top of my head.
2011 started with the climate bet with Rob Honeycutt and Co. NoTricksZone and the coolists say this new decade 2011-2020 will be cooler than the last decade 2001-2010 (and it looks like 2011 is in the coolist column, though I haven’t run the numbers yet).
Then in March there was Fukushima and the ensuing mass media-driven hysteria that tsunamied over Germany, and led a panicked government to shut down the entire German nuclear industry.
In 2011 we also got to know Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber’s “Master Plan” for transforming global society so that it suits his view of what it should be. Unfortunately it is closed-minded, based on dogma, and has little to do with science. To me what Schellnhuber proposes is nothing less than wild adventurism in the social engineering laboratory. The results of implementing such a plan would be devastating for democracy and overall global social development. It opens the the door to authoritarianism. If anything, the “Master Plan” is a powerful argument why scientists should stay in their labs, and not be left to run society.
In April NoTricksZone got its 1 millionth visit after one year of existence (the 2 million will be reached this month).
The story that got lots a visitors was the weed-covered multi-million dollar solar field. Ironically that photo may someday come to symbolize Germany’s obsessed, misguided and rushed energy-supply conversion which the country is so hell-bent on in achieving – no matter the costs. Globally, except for China, 2011 is the year that solar energy bit the dust.
German doubt over climate science going global in 2012?
The big 2011 highlight for me is one that readers are not aware of. One morning in early September I got an e-mail from geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning, asking if I’d be interested in translating in English a new book on climate science and energy policy he and Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt were working on. I immediately said yes.
Over the next three months I used every available hour I could find to do the work. I finished the job just a few days ago, on December 29. The book’s publisher Hoffmann & Campe in Hamburg is now about to start the search for a publisher for the English version. So we’re hoping that Die Kalte Sonne (The Cold Sun) will also soon be available in English for international readers – soon.

German edition can now be ordered here.
Personally I learned a lot from this book. As a layman, I had some general knowledge gaps and gray areas in climate science. This book puts everything in clear perspective and deepened my knowledge. It’s up-to-date and cites many of the latest peer-reviewed papers – more than 800 sources in total. Both Dr. Lüning and Dr. Vahrenholt made an outstanding effort in putting it together. Already it’s starting to stir up controversy here, even though the German version won’t be available until February. It’s light-years more up-to-date than the IPCC 2007 AR4.
When you read Die Kalte Sonne, you really get the sense of how far climate science has advanced since 2007 and how outdated and narrow the IPCC AR4 truly is. Talk about divergence!
Authors forecast cooling for the decades ahead
The book’s authors focus on why the climate catastrophe is not taking place. It takes an in-depth look into the topics of solar cycles, temperature reconstructions, the Hockey Stick, aerosols, soot, fudging, amplification mechanisms, cosmic radiation, magnetism, clouds, UV radiation, ocean cycles, the shortcomings and flaws of the IPCC and their dubious models in particular. The authors also present their own look into the future using a model that considers all important climate drivers. It concludes that the Earth has to reckon with cooling over the coming decades. It’s the most convincing forecast I’ve seen up to now.
I’m very optimistic about the success of the book, and will be following it closely in the weeks ahead.
3rd year of NTZ
I also look forward to starting my 3rd year of blogging, together with the guest writers you have come to know – like Ed, Matti, and Juraj. I hope readers will keep coming back. Wishing you all the best for 2012!

"Bill Shorten has signalled Labor is highly unlikely to use carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol as part of its climate change policy, which will be unveiled over the coming weeks. In his strongest comments to date, the Labor leader said over the weekend he recognised that other countries had resolved not to use the accounting system that allows countries to count credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris emissions reduction commitments for 2030.  “One thing I do recognise about the Kyoto credits point is that some other countries have moved away from using that, as a form of our calculation, the United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark,” Shorten told reporters. “We’re seriously considering that option and we’ll have more to say in coming weeks.” Shorten’s signal follows a similar hint a week ago from the climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, at a candidates’ forum in a key Victorian marginal seat. According to an attendee at the forum in the electorate of Corangamite on 18 March, Butler said he was not personally keen to use carryovers if Labor won the coming federal election. Labor has already released its policy for reducing emissions in the electricity sector. Shortly the opposition will unveil the rest of its policy measures, expected to include a trading scheme for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year; new vehicle emissions standards to bring down pollution in transport; measures for agriculture; and its final position on the use of international permits and Kyoto credits. The Morrison government is opposed to using international permits, but has recently confirmed it will bank a 367-megatonne contribution from carryovers as part of its recently released carbon budget, which details the emissions reductions from various programs that will be required to meet the Paris target. As well as the chunk it is counting from carryovers, the government is counting just under 100 megatonnes of abatement from “technology solutions”, which have not been specified, and “other sources of abatement”. Environmental groups are opposed to deploying carryover credits as part of the abatement toolkit, because it lowers the level of ambition in emissions reduction. The Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents institutional investors such as super funds, with total funds under management of about $2tn, has also warned against substituting accounting for practical abatement, arguing the practice is “fundamentally at odds with limiting warming in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement and driving global momentum for coordinated, and increased ambition”. The Greens have been limbering up to criticise Labor if it decided to use carryovers for the looming abatement task. The Greens climate change spokesman, Adam Bandt, argued recently it was possible the ALP was leaving its options open on Kyoto credits because it could be forced to rely on credits and permits to meet its target of a 45% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, which will be imposed if Labor wins in May. The Greens argue Labor’s decision to apply their economy-wide target of 45% to the electricity sector, instead of forcing steeper abatement in electricity, where it is comparatively cheaper to cut pollution, means it will have to chase more expensive abatement in sectors such as heavy industry, transport, agriculture and waste. Bandt has argued Labor may not be able to meet its target “without relying on Scott Morrison’s accounting trick”. "
"Melting glaciers on Mount Everest are exposing the dead bodies of climbers previously entombed in ice, as global warming causes temperatures to rise. Almost 300 climbers have been killed attempting to climb the mountain since the first attempt to scale it in 1922. As the spring climbing season begins bodies which are being exposed by the melting glaciers are being removed on the Chinese side of the peak, BBC News reported. “Because of global warming, the ice sheet and glaciers are fast melting and the dead bodies that remained buried all these years are now becoming exposed,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of Nepal Mountaineering Association. “We have brought down dead bodies of some mountaineers who died in recent years, but the old ones that remained buried are now coming out.” Officials with the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal (EOAN) said they were bringing down all ropes from the higher camps of Everest and Lhotse mountains this climbing season, but dealing with dead bodies was not as easy. Under Nepalese law government agencies must be involved when handling bodies. “This issue needs to be prioritised by both the government and the mountaineering industry,” said Dambar Parajuli, president of EOAN. “If they can do it on the Tibet side of Everest, we can do it here as well.” In 2017, the hand of a dead mountaineer appeared above the ground at camp one. Expedition operators said they deployed professional climbers of the Sherpa community to move the body. Mountaineers say in recent years most dead bodies have been surfacing at the Khumbu icefall, which has a reputation for being a particularly dangerous part of the climb, and in the final camp area, located in South Col. Removing a dead body can cost up to $80,000 (£61,000). A study in 2015 revealed that ponds on the Khumbu glacier, which are crossed by climbers as they attempt to reach the summit, were expanding and joining up because of accelerated melting. Nepal’s army drained the Imja lake near Mount Everest in 2016 after its water from rapid glacial melt had reached dangerous levels. Another team of researchers, including members from Leeds and Aberystwyth universities in the UK, last year drilled the Khumbu glacier and found the ice to be warmer than expected. The ice recorded a minimum temperature of only −3.3C, with even the coldest ice being a full 2C warmer than the mean annual air temperature."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt Der Spiegel Axel Bojanowski writes a story about a study appearing in the journal Climate Change:  A 101 year record of windstorms in the Netherlands.
The results of the study are revealing. Let us recall that in Germany and within many circles of “experts” the prevailing wisdom is that man-made global warming is leading to more frequent and more severe storms. However, this new study shows that this is a myth. The study’s abstract concludes:
The Netherlands is currently experiencing the minimum aggregate storm damage of the past 100 years, though only slightly lower than a quiet period of 50 years ago.”
And Der Spiegel writes:
Prognosticated climate warming produced fears of more frequent storm surges and flooding. Especially the Netherlands was threatened. Because much of the country is below sea level – higher dikes would be needed to protect the country. However these worries are shown to be baseless a new study in the journal ‘Climate Change’ shows: According to the statistics, the Netherlands is experiencing fewer and fewer storm surges.”
Since systematic records have been kept starting 101 years ago, never have there been fewer storms than in the last 15 years, reports Stephen Cusack of the private research institute ‘Risk Management Solutions’ in London. Not only storms as a whole, but also storms with heavy damages have greatly reduced.”

Now those are results that completely contradict everything special interests like the re-insurance industry have been telling us.
Solar or ocean related?
The abstract provides another interesting observation (my emphasis):
The resulting windstorm loss time-series for the Netherlands contains some interesting features. Annual losses are stable over the whole period and have a dominant cycle with a period of about 50 years.”
The study also says that weak storms were more frequent during the previous lull 50 years ago and that the current lull is somewhat different in character. The journal suspects that this may be due to “a different mix of climate forcing mechanisms in modern times compared to 50 years ago.”
This ought not be a surprise, though. Weather is chaotic and it would be indeed foolish to assume that weather duplicates itself. Change is a natural process. It only proves that climate changes – like it’s supposed to!

"At last, a newspaper prepared to publish CO2 emissions on a daily basis, though unfortunately on the weather page (Why our daily weather forecast now includes a carbon dioxide count, 5 April). What is happening to the climate, and the CO2 emissions causing this, are not related to the weather. The economic section is where CO2 emissions should appear, alongside economic indicators like GDP and stock market prices. This is where the relationship between how we think wealth is generated and the costs of doing so should be made transparent. The thoughtful introduction of a few more headline indicators such as inequality, population numbers for humans/pollinators/dolphins/tigers, forest cover and deaths from air pollution on the same page would make the Guardian a genuinely progressive and even a transformative newspaper.Sara ParkinPrincipal associate, The Sustainability Literacy Project   • It’s great that the Guardian will publish a daily record of carbon dioxide levels, but the place for this is not the weather page. Weather is outside our control. Carbon dioxide levels are our responsibility – the inexorable rise should be (daily) front-page news.Donald SmithHaddington, East Lothian • It is good that you are recognising the climate emergency by posting the daily levels of atmospheric CO2 which are still rising. However, as reported in February, there have been even sharper rises in methane in recent years. Methane and nitrous oxide are much more potent greenhouse gases in the short term, and scientists do not understand the source of these alarming increases. Please would you also report daily methane and nitrous oxide levels as a reminder that urgent action is needed to cut the emissions and levels of these gases too.Dr Andrew BoswellNorwich • I’m delighted to read that the Guardian will now include a carbon dioxide measure as part of its daily forecast. However, as George Monbiot has been saying for years, we urgently need to change the language we are using to discuss the climate situation. The term “climate change”, still being used in your newspaper in this article, gives an inaccurate and far too benign impression of the situation. The terms “climate breakdown” or “climate crisis” are much more accurate. Please consider reviewing the language used in your newspapers when discussing this issue.

Page 2 story in Bild today! The first of a series.

“THE CO2 LIES … pure fear-mongering … should we blindly trust the experts?”

That’s what Germany’s leading daily Bild (see photo) wrote in its print and online editions today, on the very day that renowned publisher Hoffmann & Campe officially released a skeptic book – one written by a prominent socialist and environmental figure.
This is huge. More than I ever could have possibly imagined. And more is coming in the days ahead! The Bild piece was just the first of a series.
Mark this as the date that Germany’s global warming movement took a massive body blow.
Today, not one, but two of Germany’s most widely read news media published comprehensive skeptical climate science articles in their print and online editions, coinciding with the release of a major climate skeptical book, Die kalte Sonne (The Cold Sun).
Germany has now plunged into raucus discord on the heated topic of climate change
What has set it all off? One of the fathers of Germany’s modern green movement, Professor Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, a social democrat and green activist, decided to author a climate science skeptical book together with geologist/paleontologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning. Vahrenholt’s skepticism started when he was asked to review an IPCC report on renewable energy. He found hundreds of errors. When he pointed them out, IPCC officials simply brushed them aside. Stunned, he asked himself, “Is this the way they approached the climate assessment reports?”
Vahrenholt decided to do some digging. His colleague Dr. Lüning also gave him a copy of Andrew Montford’s The Hockey Stick Illusion. He was horrified by the sloppiness and deception he found. Persuaded by Hoffmann & Campe, he and Lüning decided to write the book. Die kalte Sonne cites 800 sources and has over 80 charts and figures. It examines and summarizes the latest science.
Conclusion: climate catastrophe is called off
The science was hyped. The book started hitting the bookshops today and has already hit no. 1 on the Amazon.de list for environment books. Indications show that it will climb very high in the overall bestseller charts. It’s published by a renowned publishing house and is now sending shock waves through the German climate science establishment. The first printing will produce 20,000 copies. I expect they will sell out rather quickly.
Today Germany’s national tabloid Bild (which has a whopping circulation of 16 million) devoted half of page 2 on an article called:
THE CO2 LIE
Renowned team of scientists claim the climate catastrophe is fear-mongering by politics“

The widely read Bild will follow with the rest of the series in the days ahead. In part I today Bild presents “What the IPCC of the UN doesn’t tell you.” Bild asks “what if the IPCC is wrong? Can we really blindly trust these experts? Are they really independent?”
Bild then writes:
The phenomenal prognoses of heat from the IPCC are pure fear-mongering.”
The Bild series is sure to cause radical environmentalists to seethe and lash out. Expect an all-out assault in the days and weeks ahead. Already the reaction from activists has been swift and virulent – though they have yet to read the book.
They never wanted the debate – and now the dam has broken
And the floods of skepticism are sweeping over the country. Worse, Germany’s flagship weekly news magazine Der Spiegel today also featured a 4-page exclusive interview with Vahrenholt, where he repeated that the IPCC has ignored a large part of climate science and that IPCC scientists exaggerated the impact of CO2 on climate. Vahrenholt said that by extending the known natural cycles of the past into the future, and taking CO2’s real impact into effect, we should expect a few tenths of a degree of cooling.
At a press conference today in Berlin, Vahrenholt, Lüning and publisher Hoffmann & Campe introduced the book and answered reporters’ questions. When asked why Hoffmann & Campe decided to publish “such a book”, the spokesman simply answered that the time is right – and there’s a real audience for the book. Even the weather timing was right! Germany is now experiencing it’s worst cold snap in 26 years. That makes it hard to deny lack of warming.
It needs to be pointed out Vahrenholt and Lüning are not skeptics; they are lukewarmers who have not been able to find any evidence of a coming climate catastrophe. They believe that man should switch to renewables, but do so in a rational manner: “Work fast, but don’t hurry.”
Skeptic readers should not think that the book will fortify their existing skepticism of CO2 causing warming. The authors agree it does. but have major qualms about the assumed positive CO2-related feed-backs and believe the sun plays a far greater role in the whole scheme of things.
The book cites more than 800 sources – including the latest peer-reviewed literature. It includes more than 80 graphics that clearly illustrate that all is not well with the claims made by alarmist science. It is written so that laymen can easily digest the material and it provides a comprehensive overview of the science and where it stands today.
The book has also infuriated the AGW leadership in Germany. For example, academia. University of Osnabrück took the step of dis-inviting Professor Vahrenholt who was scheduled to give a speech on February 8. The University claimed that Vahrenholt’s skeptical views were “provocative”. Also the centre-left SPD party, where Vahrenholt is a member, has been deafeningly silent.
This cat is out of the bag – and it’s not going back in.
The authors have set up a website for Die kalte Sonne here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAngela Merkel and the German government once declared the lofty aim of putting one million electric cars on German streets in a bid on how to show the world how to be environmentally responsible.

One for the history books. Electric cars cannot compete in Germany – even 108 years later.
But today they admit they will not even come close to reaching this target. In fact experts say Germany faces a new challenge: how to ensure a basic supply of electricity to its homes and businesses this winter, forget about powering a million cars with electricity in addition!
Not long ago, Germany’s energy generation and distribution system globally was second to none when it came to reliability, price and stability, making the country an attractive location for energy-intensive, high-tech industry. Germany was even a net exporter of power.
But then the government and media, having succumbed to mass climate and nuclear hysteria, made a rash, blind leap into alternative energies, particularly sun and wind. Electricity prices have been skyrocketing ever since and the supply of power has become unstable and expensive.
Larger companies are now moving out.
Germany’s power generation and distribution infrastructure has taken a massive hit because of the conversion to renewable energies. In just a few short years electricity has become one of the most expensive in the world and experts are now placing even bets that the grid will not be able to avert a blackout this winter. So far and so fast have the mighty fallen.
The Local quotes the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung:
The hype is over. The high expectations for electric cars, which have no carbon dioxide emissions, has been replaced by huge disappointment, the paper wrote.”

"Labor is set to unveil a climate policy that will beef up the Morrison government’s heavily criticised safeguard mechanism, creating new pollution reduction requirements for the aviation sector, cement, steel and aluminum, mining and gas, direct combustion and the non-electricity energy sectors. Currently the safeguard mechanism applies to businesses with direct emissions of more than 100 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent pollution each year, and Labor’s policy is expected to lower that threshold to 25 kilotonnes, which means more sectors and businesses will be covered.  It is anticipated Labor’s policy will allow over-achievement on the new, more stringent, baselines, which will allow businesses who cut pollution more aggressively to generate carbon credits that can be traded with other businesses that cannot meet their targets. In practice, this means the electricity sector, which Labor proposes to cover with a separate regulatory regime, will be able to sell carbon permits to heavy emitters. The policy is expected to include new land clearing regulations – but nothing more concrete for agriculture – and curbs on vehicle pollution. It is likely to point to a target of reducing CO2 emissions from vehicles to 105 grams of CO2 a kilometre, and also introduce incentives for electric vehicles and support for electric vehicle infrastructure. Labor is expected to unveil the remainder of its climate policy during the final hectic sitting days of the parliament, with MPs returning to Canberra at the weekend and on Monday for the budget session. As well as delivering the economic statement it hopes will be a positive springboard into the election – which could be called next weekend – the Morrison government will use the remaining parliamentary sitting days to pursue legislation making it a criminal offence for social media companies not to remove violent material, with errant executives to face imprisonment for three years. The prime minister met executives of social media companies earlier this week, and warned the government would legislate unless the companies gave assurances they would “immediately institute changes to prevent the use of their platforms, like what was filmed and shared by the perpetrators of the terrible offences in Christchurch”. The government was unhappy with the response to Scott Morrison’s overture on Tuesday, so resolved to legislate. The new offences would require platforms anywhere in the world to notify the Australian federal police if they become aware their service was streaming abhorrent violent conduct that was happening in Australia. The government said failure to comply would be punishable by imprisonment for Australian or overseas executives, or fines that could reach up to 10% of the platform’s global annual turnover. Morrison said social media platforms were being “weaponised by terrorists” so the parliament needed to take action. “Big social media companies have a responsibility to take every possible action to ensure their technology products are not exploited by murderous terrorists,” he said. “It should not just be a matter of just doing the right thing. It should be the law, and that is what my government will be doing next week to force social media companies to get their act together and work with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to defuse the threat their technologies can present to the safety of Australians.” Morrison is expected to write to the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, at the weekend to seek Labor’s support."

Warmist and NTZ observer “Robhon” has daringly entered a bet for US $5000 with NTZ and NTZ  readers that the next decade 2011 – 2020 will be warmer on average than the previous 2001 – 2010 decade.
Last update click here.
NTZ and NTZ readers say it will be cooler, or the same.
The loser of the bet will have to pay the amount to a charity for children in dire need, such as Children Hospice International.
The charity orgnaisation will have to be international, support children in dire need and at the same time have low overhead costs.
We want to thank Robhon for accepting this sporting challenge, which is for a good cause. Win or lose – everyone wins.
So far NTZ and readers have pledged about $300.00 (5 Jan 2011), betting that the earth will be cooler or at the same temperature on average over the next 10 years. We would like to get that amount up to the maximum of $5000 that Robhon has committed. Robhon also mentioned that he may find others willing to put their money where their mouths are.
The bet 
If the decade of 2011 – 2020 is cooler or the same on average globally than the decade of 2001 – 2010, then warmist Robhon will pay to charity the total amount this pledged by NTZ and readers until February 1, 2011. The target is $5K.
If the average global temperature for the decade 2011 – 2020 is warmer than the average of 2001 – 2010, then NTZ and readers will pay everything we pledged to the charity.
Which dataset?
It has been agreed to use both a composite of RSS and UAH lower troposphere temperature – close to the earth’s surface. The result will be accepted without quibbling, as it is agreed that it’s the best we’ve got.
How and when to pay?
Payment will be made when the bet is settled, i.e. 2021, or possibly earlier if it’s clear who the winner will be, but only with mutual agreement.
Right now I am only gathering the pledges and putting your username, e-mail address and amount pledged on a list. So if us coolists win, then we will not have to pay. Robhon on the other hand will have to pay an amount that equals the total that us coolists pledged – up to 5000 (five thousand) dollars. If us coolists lose, then each person will have to pay directly to the chosen charity organisation. Even if us coolists lost, I would still make the contribution anyway, simply because I think it’s for a good cause.

You will be asked to pay when the bet is settled, i.e. 2021.
Where, when and how do I make my pledge?
You can pledge by leaving a comment. I will put your username and email address and amount on a list. I will post the list from time to time (without e-mail address of course). Please make your pledges before March 1, 2011.
WHICH CHARITY GETS THE MONEY?
As mentioned above, the charity organisation will be (1) one that both sides agree on, (2) helps children in dire need (3) have low overhead costs so the money really helps and (4) be international.
What happens if the loser doesn’t pay?
If the loser of the bet refuses to pay, then he will be forever regarded as a useless deadbeat loudmouth scumbag with no honour. Ed and Juraj have the bucket of tar and a sack of feathers ready. They will not hesitate to tar and feather anyone – warmist or coolist!
How will we control if someone pays?
I have a list, and somehow we will get a statement from the charity organisation confirming that payment was indeed made.
What if something happens to me and I can’t pay?
Not your fault. You’ll be simply taken off the list and you will be remembered as a generous and honourable person.
So please pledge a nominal amount!
I hope that more readers here will pledge some money for this bet. Again it would be nice to have Robhon pay the full $5000 he has committed, and so I need to get as many pledges as possible. Minimum is $10.
So what is it going to be? Cooler, or warmer?
The bet is on!

According to the BBC: “In Italy, weather experts say it is the coldest week for 27 years.”
In the Urals and Siberia, the temperature fell to -40C while in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana, a forecaster told Interfax-Kazakhstan news agency the wind-chill factor meant the real temperature was down to -52C, even though the air temperature was -35C.”
Gas and electricitry supply have collapsed in some areas, leaving many to shiver.
-39°C in Finland
Bild reported Thursday that a new cold record had been set in Finland: minus 39°C was recorded in Northern Finland.
In Eastern Germany, temperatures are forecast to plummet to minus 20°C in the days ahead. According to Helmut Malewski of the German Weather Service: “No warm-up is in sight for the coming 8 days.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo days ago I wrote here about how a scheduled presentation by Professor Dr Fritz Vahrenholt had been cancelled by the University of Osnabrück because of his controversial climate catastrophe skeptical book, Die kalte Sonne, which will be released next week by renowned publisher Hoffmann & Campe of Hamburg.The original public announcement of Vahrenholt’s presentation read: “In the series of presentations ‘University Speeches’ of the University of Osnabrück, Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt – RWE Innogy, Essen will hold a speech titled ‘The Climate Catastrophe is not Taking Place’.”
However, since the book and controversy have been making waves in Germany, the University of Osnabrück suddenly deemed such climate science skepticism as too “provocative”, and therefore refused to allow the presentation to be made unless a “counter-speaker” and a “competent moderator” were present. But because there was not enough time to organize it, the University cancelled Vahrenholt’s presentation at the last minute.
In the cancellation notification released by Professors Asholt and Altendorf, they claimed they had actually requested the topic of “Options for the Future Energy Supply of Germany”, and that Vahrenholt “surprised” them with the provocative title: “The Climate Catastrophe Is Not taking Place” just 3 weeks before the scheduled presentation.”
BS of course. The U of Osnabrück had known about the real topic long before, and not just 3 weeks ago. And so in an e-mail sent to NTZ, Prof Vahrenholt wishes to set the record straight. He wrote the following to Asholt and Altendorf:
Last year you happily accepted our topic of choice: ‘The Climate Catastrophe Is Not Taking Place’ and we agreed on a date for the presentation. You then informed my assistant just a few days ago, because of pressure from the University management, that I would only be allowed to speak under the condition that I accept a counter-position to be presented at the event, e.g. by Mr. Schellnhuber.”
Also in the cancellation Professors Asholt and Altendorf suggested Vahrenholt had agreed to a new date for the event. Vahrenholt writes that too is false:
We specifically informed you that I would not be available for such an event. And now that I was dis-invited by the University just 7 days before the event was scheduled to take place, I am no longer available for any other event. The entire matter is already bad enough. Hence I request that I no longer be misused as camouflage for the real motive behind my dis-invitation.”
Obviously The University of Osnabrück was less than truthful about the motives behind its dis-invitation. When University professors start distorting stories and camouflaging real motives, then indeed Prof Vahrenholt’s decision to no longer have anything more to do with them is more than warranted.
Makes you wonder if you can believe anything that comes from the two U of Osnabrück’s professors.

" Australian researchers have discovered huge underwater lakes beneath the largest glacier in east Antarctica. The lakes were detected by scientists setting off small explosives 2m below the surface of the Totten glacier and listening to the reflected sound.  The Australian Antarctic Division glaciologist Dr Ben Galton-Fenzi said the research was critical to helping scientists predict how the melting of Antarctic glaciers would change the world’s oceans. The Totten glacier is 30km wide and up to two kilometres thick, and has the potential to raise sea levels by seven metres. “The explosives were a sound source for us … and it would then echo off different layers in the ice,” Galton-Fenzi told the Guardian. “We placed geophones [a series of microphones] along the surface of the glacier to listen to the reflected sound, giving us a picture of what lies beneath the ice.” He said the speed glaciers travel at is determined by what they move across. “If there’s bedrock under the glacier, it’s sticky and will move more slowly, but if there’s water or soft sediments, the glacier will move faster,” he said. Galton-Fenzi said the next step for researchers would be to drill down to take a sample of the lakes but he lamented there was no funding certainty for future research. “This is the single biggest problem we need to face and have answers to over the next couple of decades,” he said. “I’m not just a scientist saying ‘I need more money’ … I’ve got kids who are six and eight and [climate change] is a real threat for them.” The scientists, who were based at Casey research station, were among more than 550 expeditioners who travelled with the Australian Antarctic Program over the southern summer, working on more than 56 projects."
"Just when you thought things couldn’t get any messier in the House of Commons, protesters from Extinction Rebellion fetched up in the public gallery on Monday, took off their clothes and superglued themselves to the glass panels. Rumours abounded that they had done so by the buttocks, but in fact it was just their hands. Still, it sounds a bit like that description of resentment: it’s like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die. Whoever it was that ended up getting sprayed with WD40 and taken away by the police, it wasn’t Michael Gove. This manner of nude protest has a fine pedigree, on the following issues. The naked bike ride is a worldwide movement, in which clothing is optional. If you have seen it, you will remember it from the double-take: “Wait, was that person naked?” that happens when naked people are fast-moving. Its mission statement had the original aim to “protest oil dependency and celebrate the power and individuality of our bodies” – a slightly woolly purpose that makes me think that some people just really like being naked on a bike. The Ukrainian protest group Femen made history – and international front pages – protesting against sex tourism, marriage agencies, sexism generally and – by 2012 at Davos – capitalism. I always smelled a rat because they looked so great; true protest would be stripping naked when you look like a mattress stuffed with socks. But maybe that’s a really sexist thing to say. Am I part of the problem? The economist Victoria Bateman started on a different wicket, trying to “punch feminism into economics” by stripping down to her gloves in the middle of a conference. She then shifted on to Brexit and Rachel Johnson followed suit. “I thought it would make a cheeky nib in the Sun,” Johnson tells me. “‘Boris’s sister flashes baps’. I wasn’t even naked! I was wearing a flesh-coloured basque. It was horrific. Overnight, I turned into La CicciolinaThe whole world thinks I got my tits out against Brexit. And I would, if I thought it would help, but I didn’t.”  Not the classic nude protest, but an early example of the anarchic spirit: the Freedomites were Russian emigres who arrived in Canada at the turn of the 19th century hoping to escape religious persecution and soon had a beef with the Canadian government. They also used arson to protest against materialism, which is arguably the most succinct protest of all."
"An abnormally hot summer in Australia ended with the warmest March on record, new data from the Bureau of Meteorology shows. The latest monthly climate breakdown shows that despite two severe tropical cyclones in the northern states, temperatures across Australia were 2.13C above the average throughout last month in part due to an unusually dry summer in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. “One of the standout features of March was there was above-average temperatures just about everywhere; more than 99% of the country,” Blair Trewin, a senior climatologist at the bureau told Guardian Australia. “Really a few things came together: the overall, long-term background trend [of rising temperatures] means you’re starting from a higher base, which increases the probability of records. “Another major factor has been that the summer monsoon season in the tropics has been quite weak. Normally in the tropics in the summer you see fairly regular incursions of rainfall and moisture into the continent. That has been happening in Queensland but not really in Western Australia or the Northern Territory.” The record temperatures in March follow records in January, while February was in the top five on record. Last year was Australia’s third-warmest year on record. It beat out the previous third-place holder, 2017. The 2018 state of the climate report from the bureau and CSIRO found Australia was experiencing more extreme heat, longer fire seasons, rising oceans and more marine heatwaves consistent with a changing climate. So, is this the new normal? “It’s not as if we’re going to see records every month, even in the warmer overall climate we have now,” Trewin said. “This is still a very abnormal summer, when you break the record for the warmest first quarter by 0.9 of a degree, that’s not a small number. It’s been an unusually hot few months, the background warming trend we see in Australia is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 of a degree per decade. “Even in the climate of 2019 this is unusual, but is not as unusual as it would have been in say 1980 or 1950.” According to the bureau’s report, two severe tropical cyclones – Trevor and Veronica - contributed to very much above-average rainfall in parts of north Queensland, the east of the Northern Territory, north-east South Australia and parts of the Pilbara coast. A wet end to the month brought totals to above average for eastern New South Wales, far-eastern Victoria and south-east Queensland. However the report noted that “unfortunately, the rain needed to reduce significant rainfall deficiencies in drought-affected areas is substantial and will require above-average rainfall over a prolonged period to completely remove deficits at longer timescales”. Trewin said that without those downpours, the overall average would have been higher. “It had a bit of a cooling effect particularly in Queensland, though they still came in with their fifth warmest March on record,” he said. The outlook is not particularly promising either. Trewin said most areas had a “neutral” outlook for rainfall, with the expectation of above-average temperatures to continue."
"The government’s fracking proposals would release the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions as almost 300 million new cars, fatally undermining ministers’ obligation to tackle the escalating climate crisis, according to new research. Analysis by the Labour party shows that the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere if the government’s plans go ahead would be the same as the lifetime emissions of 286 million cars – or 29 new coal-fired power plants.  The findings come as ministers’ efforts to kickstart their fracking proposals face growing resistance, with defeat in the courts, fierce local objections and opposition from Labour and Tory councils alike. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was in Lancashire on Saturday to join the anti-fracking campaign in the region, said a future Labour government would ban fracking “once and for all”. “The Conservatives’ fracking plans will damage our environment and fly in the face of community opposition,” he said. “There is a clear alternative to fracking. Clean, renewable energy is the future of our economy and will create more than 400,000 jobs as part of Labour’s green industrial revolution.” Concerns about drilling flared in the run-up to Christmas when energy company Cuadrilla was forced to pause operations near Blackpool three times after drilling caused small earthquakes that breached government safety limits. Several local authorities – including London, Manchester, Leeds, Wakefield, Hull and York – have expressed opposition to fracking. There is also opposition from many Tories. In Westminster, almost two dozen Tory MPs are reported to be against fracking and willing to “destroy the government’s majority” if it tries to weaken planning laws. Several Tory-run local authorities – including Derby, Dorset and Nottinghamshire – are fiercely opposed to a change in planning proposals, which would mean companies could drill test sites without applying for permission. Labour, which has vowed to oversee “an economic revolution to tackle the climate crisis”, says on top of the widespread opposition, the government’s plans would produce huge amounts of greenhouse gases, wrecking any chance of the UK complying with its Paris climate obligations. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, said: “Fracking can’t be part of the solution to climate change. These figures demonstrate the debt we owe to the communities and campaigners who have fought back against fracking and prevented the Tories from pushing our country off a climate cliff.” The government remains committed to fracking. Ministers argue fracked gas will play a vital part of the UK’s energy mix and will create thousands of jobs. The plans came in for criticism from one of the world’s leading climate scientists last year. James Hansen, who is known as the father of climate science, accused ministers of aping Donald Trump and ignoring scientific evidence. He said the industry would contribute to climate breakdown and warned future generations would judge ministers harshly. Earlier this month the plans received a setback in the high court when it ruled the government’s fracking guidelines were unlawful as they did not take into account the impact on climate change. Long-Bailey added: “The government needs to realise that it’s time to change course and ban fracking before it’s too late.”"
"Nobody predicted the immense success of Australian Damon Gameau’s 2015 directorial debut, That Sugar Film, a candy-coloured, Supersize Me-esque documentary exploring the effects of consuming sugar while on a supposedly healthy diet. It was a smash hit in its home country, becoming the highest grossing non-Imax Australian documentary in history (since overtaken by Jennifer Peedom’s majestic 2017 doco Mountain). Perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised. Gameau took an issue relevant across cultures and demographics, and prised it open with a broadly accessible style that neither bored nor talked down to young people – who form much of his target demographic.  The director-presenter inhabited the role of a cool school teacher doing what all cool teachers aspire to do: making education fun. For his follow-up film 2040, which had its Australian premiere this week at the Gold Coast film festival, Gameau turns his focus to the health of the planet, keeping broadly the same upbeat approach. While That Sugar Film contained horrific visions of dental apocalypse that no doubt compelled young’uns to brush their teeth out of sheer, gum-gobbling terror, the overall message remained optimistic – emphasising the power we have to shape our bodies and lives. Similarly, when applying the stethoscope to the earth’s wellbeing, Gameau positions himself as a glass-half-full idealist, with his first mission to convince people that they can make a difference. Dividing his focus into key areas, including renewable energy and alternative transportation, with corresponding on-the-road case studies, he structures the film as a one-way conversation with his four-year-old daughter, who will be 25 when the titular year arrives and, he hopes, part of a brighter and better world. The outlook of the film is refreshing. There’s no shortage of gooseflesh-raising documentaries that tell us, not without justification, that the world is going – or has already gone – to the dogs. “I think there’s room for a different story,” Gameau says, in the garden with shovel in hand, near the beginning of the film. It is peppered with Kids Say the Darndest Things-type interviews – pipsqueaks discussing their ideal solutions to the world’s problems. Presumably Gameau was delighted by the sight of thousands of Australian kids walking out of school last month, protesting against the government’s inaction on fossil fuel emissions. The overarching approach of 2040 is not unlike aTV program, such as Todd Sampson’s Redesign My Brain, in which an engaging host tracks down experts who have spent their lives researching subjects that are relatively new to the presenter. Gameau’s pitch is that he has the skills to distil complex ideas into thoroughly digestible chunks. This is where we see his auteurial voice emerging – creating visual innovations that add some bling to potentially dry subject matter. For instance, he gives interviewees the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids treatment, reducing them to tiny figurines in aesthetically engaging environments –on a Monopoly board or perched atop a shovel. But given the episodic nature of 2040, and the complexity of each topic – all of which could easily form entire documentaries themselves – it is clear that a feature-length film isn’t the ideal format. A television series, with an episode per subject, would make an obviously more accommodating format. Although, given how well That Sugar Film went down, it is hardly a surprise that the producers decided to try and replicate its success. A series would have given Gameau room to expand areas that are largely absent from his remit, such as the hurdles of revolutionising power grids, or replacing all cars with self-driving group rideshare vehicles. Or even, in a perhaps unfathomably optimistic thought, the end of billboard advertising. It’s understandable why the film-maker didn’t want to get bogged down in tackling those awfully adult, awfully sobering ideas of vested interests, which in a nutshell explain many of the aforementioned hurdles. In 2040, Gameau defaults to the position of inspiring people rather than alarming or overwhelming them. You leave the film wanting more, not less, of these sorts of productions."
"The people finally got to have their say on the government’s Brexit deal. In parliament, no less. And what they had to say was that they wanted to take almost all their kit off and protest against climate change instead. Time management. They probably reckoned there was more chance of the world’s politicians agreeing on plans to save the planet than anyone coming up with a Brexit solution that the government was prepared to implement. The protest began three-quarters of an hour into the latest iteration of the indicative vote process, aka IV2, with 12 men and women in the public gallery stripping down to their pants to reveal climate change slogans on bodies that were far from beach-ready. Well, almost all of them. One bloke either lost his bottle or suddenly realised he had come out dressed commando and chose to keep his trousers on. Spoilsport. Most rushed to the front and glued their hands to the glass barrier, while a woman, daubed in grey body paint and wearing a pair of elephant ears and trunk, indulged in some unusual interpretive dance. The police were called but didn’t seem entirely sure where to look. Or touch. So what followed was a very awkward, very British standoff. In its way, the perfect Brexit statement. The dirty dozen would occasionally self-consciously wiggle their bums and then stop, as if waiting for something to happen. Knowing how to end a protest is always much harder than starting one. The police initially appeared to just hope the men and women would get bored and wander off, but once they realised they were going to have to get hands-on, a few officers reluctantly rolled up their sleeves. First to be removed from the gallery was the elephant woman who got carried out horizontally while waving goodbye with her trunk. Eventually, just a man and a woman were left and officials were sent off to find some substance to remove the glue from their hands. That seemed to do the trick and, half an hour after it had begun, the protest was over. All that remained were a few stains on the glass. Twelve semi-naked men and women in their pants was rather more entertaining and no weirder than anything else that happens in parliament these days and a few MPs greeted the disturbance as a welcome distraction. Peter Kyle snarfed about a cheeky intervention, Justine Greening asked him to flesh things out while Nick Boles wondered if Bernard Jenkin was among the protesters. Bernie’s naturism – he’s a legend in his own lunchbox – is by far his cleanest and most endearing pastime. Anything to relieve the tedium. But mostly everyone in the chamber chose to keep their heads down and plod on. IV2 more closely resembled an IV drip of liquid valium with MPs mindlessly repeating what they had said in the first round of debates the previous Wednesday. There was little else they could do. Everything that could possibly be said about Brexit has long since been said. Again and again. The sense of Brexit being an endless loop in space-time is now inescapable. After insisting the prime minister was keen to work constructively with parliament, Andrea Leadsom went out of her to do precisely the opposite by saying that the government would be whipping against the business motion to allow further indicative votes. Time was now of the essence and it was up to the government to run down the clock by failing to get its own deal passed and not up to MPs to try to find some kind of consensus. Thereafter we just got stuck in an existential hell with MPs reduced to playing caricature versions of themselves. Edward Leigh merely suggested that now was not the time for the country to have a general election because the Conservatives would lose, while the Grand Wizard of Mogg himself chose to lecture the house on the meaning of shame.  Having traded his principles for the party line and refused to take responsibility for retweeting far-right politicians, Jacob Rees-Mogg increasingly resembles the badly behaved prep school boy who has been found out by his peers and sent to the naughty step. Edward Leigh was Edward Leigh. That bad. Things did improve when the debate proper began. But only marginally. Most MPs are sick and tired of being sick and tired. No one said anything unexpected or did much to suggest they had changed their minds. No one wanted to be the person who blinked first. Everyone was now waiting on a miracle. That never came. The opposition benches were full at 10pm for the results of the indicative votes. The government benches were barely half-full. It was only Brexit, after all. Yet again parliament was unable to find anything which for which it was in favour. Seemingly natural allies proved to be deadly enemies, as the remainer purists outdid one another to shoot down the possibility of a soft Brexit. The Life of Brian’s Time’s Arrow once again. The People’s Front of Judea versus the Judean People’s Front. First as farce, then as tragedy. Theresa May seemed amazed. Her deal had the flicker of a pulse. Never let the perfect be the enemy of the wee bit shit. For Nick Boles, enough was enough. Having received almost no support from his own party for his common market 2.0 option, he made an emotional speech in which he resigned the Conservative whip. It was the most effective protest of the day."
"Donald Trump’s indifference, punctuated by bursts of mocking disdain, towards climate change has been indulged and even cheered by his supporters. The president has called climate science “bullshit”, donned a coalminer’s helmet at rallies and defenestrated federal rules designed to cut planet-warming emissions. It is becoming harder, however, for Trump to swat away the unfolding crises caused by global warming. American lives are increasingly ravaged by flooding and wildfires and Democrats have seized the initiative with the Green New Deal resolution, which proposes full-scale societal and economic change to eliminate carbon emissions while investing in education, health, transport and a federal jobs guarantee.  Now, younger Republicans are breaking with Trump in an attempt to haul their party towards scientific reality. “There’s disagreement there with Donald Trump,” said Tex Fischer, a 22-year-old conservative Ohioan with a head of unruly hair. “I don’t personally know anyone involved in young, right-of-center politics that doesn’t believe climate change is an issue. “I think conservatives for a long time have been too willing to just let this be a leftwing issue. We can talk about this. Conservatives that care about the environment do exist.” Fischer heads campus operations for the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), a Republican youth group founded 18 months ago but already with a presence in 125 colleges across the US, holding events and organizing campaigns. In January, 41 state college Republican chairs signed an ACC letter to GOP leaders urging “action on clean energy and environmental issues” to ensure “conservative values are not lost on the next generation”. On a recent Monday night, the ACC held a campus event at Temple University to extol the virtues of renewable energy. Temple is a predominantly liberal institution based in a city – Philadelphia – that’s of a similar mien. The panel discussion mustered around a dozen attendees, with one wearing a red “Keep America Great” hat. Young Temple conservatives are “subject to severe ridicule and a lot of vitriol from their peers”, said Christopher Smith, president of Temple’s student Republican group. Smith, who is 20, comes from Allentown, Pennsylvania, and sports a sober combination of navy suit, combed hair and sensible spectacles. “People call you white supremacists, Nazis. We’ve all been called that at some point. It’s not nice.” Very few of these taunts are based upon the sharp differences between senior Democrats and Republicans over climate change, however, pointing to a divide that is partially generational. “Trump’s views are definitely more typical of older Republicans than us,” Smith conceded. Almost 60% of millennial Republicans, a cohort that has never experienced a reality other than of record hot years and collapsing glaciers, agree that climate change is already having some effect on the US, according to Pew Research Center polling. Nearly half believe the government isn’t doing enough to ameliorate the damage. Older Republicans, the core of Trump’s support, are substantially less likely to back these stances and are much more enthusiastic about coalmining and offshore oil and gas drilling, with the latter proposition supported by 75% of boomer GOP voters compared with 44% of millennial Republicans. There is no guarantee, of course, that these positions will remain steadfast rather than shift rightward as the newest generation of GOP voters age. With record numbers of Americans expressing alarm over global warming, however, it may be that flat denial of climate science is becoming unmoored from political expediency. The major divisions occur, crucially, when it comes to how to respond to climate change. While the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the charismatic Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for a “10-year national mobilization” on a scale not seen since the second world war to decarbonize the economy, the college Republicans are far more reticent. ACC literature at Temple University calls for a “broad range of limited government and market-based policies”. A booklet called How to Be a Conservative Environmentalist promotes cutting regulations, as well as subsidies, for solar and wind power and allowing the market to continue to grow the clean energy sector. “With Ocasio-Cortez there is this sort of alarmism, like ‘We’re all gonna die in 12 years,’” said Fischer. “We have a more methodical, slower approach … The conversation has been so politicized and so leftwing-dominated that it has put people off. That gives us an opportunity to offer a sensible alternative.” Much like superstitious actors talking backstage at a production of Macbeth, the protagonists in the Temple climate change event dare not mention the subject of their gathering. “Climate change” is not uttered in an hour of discussion, rejected in favour of uncontroversial bromides such as job-creating “energy diversification”, the conservation accomplishments of Teddy Roosevelt and the national security benefits of American-sourced energy. “We love it when market forces produce a better product, right?” said Chad Forcey, head of a conservative clean energy organization, to vigorous nods as he flicked through slides showing the plummeting cost of solar energy. The Green New Deal, Forcey said, is “ridiculous. They’ve blended it with socialism and identity politics. What we’re trying to do is something a lot more practical.” Trump has naturally gone further, falsely claiming the Green New Deal would mean “no more airplanes, no more cows, one car per family”. Republican alternative plans have sprouted from Senator Mike Lee, who suggested having larger families will somehow solve climate change, and his House colleague Matt Gaetz, whose “Green Real Deal” would slash regulations and set no emissions targets. Ocasio-Cortez dismissed Gaetz’s plan as “just so weak” and “so lame”. A major UN report last year found the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 to avoid calamitous warming, a task that will require an enormous upheaval in the way societies create energy, raise food and transport people. The US has been rattled by record hurricanes and wildfires in the past two years, with government scientists predicting increasingly punishing storms, crop failures and coastal inundation. Thousands of people are set to perish in heatwaves. The US Government Accountability Office calculates climate impacts cost the federal government $350bn in the past decade, with economic losses on course to hit $500bn every year by the close of the century. A modest tax on carbon emissions, backed by some conservatives, is unlikely to be enough to dodge this future. “If there was a free market solution to the climate crisis we would’ve seen it in the last 40 years,” said Varshini Prakash, the 25-year-old founder of Sunrise Movement, the youth-led group allied to Ocasio-Cortez that helped spawn the Green New Deal. “We don’t have decades to wait, we need to do it in the next decade. “People are dying from the climate crisis right now. The truly irrational thing to do would be continue on the current trajectory and allow 150 million climate refugees and the complete obliteration of coral reefs.” Prakash was a campus climate activist herself while at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “There wasn’t really a robust conversation” with college Republicans on the issue, she recalls. There’s a realization on both sides, however, that the Green New Deal and growing public concern has cracked open the debate, to the odd degree that Trump reportedly will attempt to campaign on climate change in the 2020 presidential election. “Young people see the denialism and corruption of Republicans and the insufficiency of action by Democrats. They are fed up with it and want to call it out,” Prakash said. “This is a generational thing. People saying ‘wait your turn, we’ve got this’ frankly don’t see the urgency because they won’t be around for it. It’s quite obvious that they haven’t got it.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe belief that humans are destroying the climate and that we can prevent “the catastrophe” simply by committing green acts is alive and well – especially in Hamburg, Germany. With a little brainwashing quality education, everything is possible. (Hat-tip Bernd Felsche).

The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here tells us how the German city of Hamburg has instituted a climate-education program dubbed: Climate Protection At Schools with the slogan: “Climate – we’re acting!“.
In Hamburg schools of every level are encouraged (er, pressured) to implement their own “climate protection plan”. And by doing so, they can get the official “climate school seal of approval”. For example, here you’ll find the list of schools that have officially become “Climate Schools” for 2012/13.
Criteria for getting the climate school seal of approval include: “drawing up a climate protection plan” along with “deciding on concrete pedagogical targets and CO2 saving goals” and these “targets must be short, mid and long term” and they have to “be backed up by measures, deadlines and responsibilities“, to name a few.
And schools can get the full support from city “advisers” for an entire range of climate protection aspects such as “energy saving, project and team assistance, seminars on climate protection and energy, or curriculum design for elementary schools“.
Sadly, as one plainly sees, climate in Germany is hardly a science, but an increasingly fanatic religion where everyone believes they have a solemn duty to rescue the climate. The masses, which now include very young children, are coerced by a powerful forces that use subtle but effective tactics: play along, or you’ll be marginalized, or worse.

In general children are taught that “being green” is being superior, and thus allows you to lecture the rest of the world. Green supremacy.
In fact, comparing a true climate protection believer to a skeptic in Germany is like comparing a saint to a miscreant. That’s what the green movement is aiming at.
Is it any wonder we recently saw a professor at the University of Graz calling for climate skeptics to be executed?
My, what a tolerant, enlightened and open-minded movement climate change has become. And what a wonderful education for our children.
Now for you children in Hamburg, Germany, be sure to do something for the climate today…just like they do in Britain…no pressure, really:

For first-time viewers of that sick little clip above, please be aware that it was produced by green activists 2 years ago, with the full enthusiasm of green groups all in an effort to coerce people to be green and to prevent the end of the world, as predicted by the PIK Mayan calendar.

"Driving fast on a clear road is for many people one of the pleasures of modern life. It seems to express all the feelings of power and autonomy that the daily grind so cruelly denies us. Speed limits then become just another petty restriction to be shoved aside by people glorying in their proper freedom. But now, it seems, all this is to come to an end. A directive approved by the European commission, which will apply in the UK whether or not we leave the EU, will require all new cars sold after 2022 to contain devices that will discourage drivers from speeding, either by limiting the effect of the accelerator pedal or simply by nagging them as seatbelt warnings do today. This technology already exists and was in fact widely welcomed by the motoring press when it appeared on the mass market Ford Focus. Once it becomes mandatory in all new cars though, we can expect resistance to increase. It is almost impossible to construct a good argument against the technological enforcement of existing law, but this won’t stop people trying. One motoring journalist has already suggested that drivers will be so frustrated to find others are observing the speed limit that they will overtake them recklessly – and that will of course be the fault of the new technology, not the overtaking driver.  Speed limits are held to be an infringement of personal liberty in a way that only some drug laws are, and they are at present even more widely flouted. This is bad for two reasons. The most obvious is safety. Speed does kill. Other things being equal, a collision will be more dangerous at higher speeds. Arguments about driver skill are irrelevant here. For any given degree of skill, higher speeds give less time to react. Then there is the environmental argument: so long as cars are powered by non-renewable resources, whether directly or indirectly, the extra energy they use when driving faster must contribute to climate change. From the driver’s point of view, these are irrelevant externalities but everyone, driver or not, must also live on this burning planet. Perhaps the best arguments are those that concentrate on the hazards of automation more generally. There is a recognised tendency for drivers to put too much trust in automated systems, or to be bored into inattention by their apparent reliability. This has led to a couple of fatal crashes in the US. But those were the result of systems that offer to steer the car as well as to control its speed. It is difficult to imagine such problems of lethal boredom arising on the crowded twisty roads of Europe. The speed limitations are only part of the package of measures proposed. They may not even be the most important. It’s possible that the most significant will be the mandatory introduction of data recorders, like aeroplane black boxes, which can be interrogated after crashes to find their cause. The data will be for the most part anonymised and temporary, but this will help to make both cars and drivers safer."

Back when I was a boy in the 1960s and 70s, northern New England was as conservative as could be. My home state of Vermont (which is French for “green mountain”) was George Aiken and Winston Prouty country. Back then the revolutionary Yankee-spirit of Ethan Allen, fighter for freedom, was alive – but rapidly dying.
Vermont has long since been overrun by the politically-correct from New York, Massachussetts, New Jersey and other deep blue areas, and has been turned into a socialist cesspool with one of the highest property tax rates in the country and socialist Senator Bernie Sanders.

This all makes the latest news from sister state New Hampshire (home of the White Mountains) all the more encouraging. New Hampshire was also once very conservative – so much so that it’s official motto is still “Live free or die“. Its governor from 1973 to 1979 was Republican “Ax-the-Tax” Medrim Thomson. But New Hampshire too succumbed the same political fate as Vermont, turning deep blue.
But who knows! Maybe the “live free or die” spirit is making a comeback. Let’s hope so. The latest news seem to indicate so. Fox News writes in a piece called:
One Giant Leap Forward -New Hampshire has smacked down Cap & Trade”
The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly — 246 to 104 – to become the first state to move to repeal an already up-and-running global warming cap-and-trade energy tax scheme.
The Granite State’s repeal appears headed for a similarly veto-proof repeal in the State Senate that will make Governor John Lynch powerless to stop it.”
Emphasis added. Big things often start in New Hampshire – especially presidential things. Let’s hope the Senate makes it something big there, too. New Hampshire’s cap & trade scam is known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which originated in New Jersey. Its stunning defeat in New Hampshire was led by conservative House Speaker William O’Brien, who, according to Fox News, said (emphasis added):
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has always been a backdoor tax increase on the citizens of New Hampshire. RGGI is a perfect example of the cost of regulation to the public. Rarely has a program been as transparent in its attempts at income redistribution.”
The big beneficiaries of RGGI are politically correct corporations and special interest groups. The big losers are consumers. The rejection of cap & trade in New Hampshire sends a strong signal nationally. Fox News writes:

At the national level, it cements the extremely strong opposition to cap-and-trade in New Hampshire and therefore colors how the issue will play in the Republican presidential primaries. In 2008, both parties nominated pro-cap-and-trade candidates for president, and again this year there are a number of pro-cap-and-trade Republicans vying for the nomination. They will have a difficult time explaining to voters why a program that has failed and been overwhelmingly rejected at the state level should be taken national.”
Don’t you love the smell of climate-napalm? Cap & trade gets crushed.
This should lead us to recall how Newt Gingrich cozied up on a couch with Nancy Pelosi in support of regulating carbon. There have been reports about naughty Newt launching a presidential campaign for 2012. Sorry Newt, but you belong on the scrap heap along with Pelosi. You’re not getting my vote.
New Hampshire is a lovely state, especially the northern part with its Presidential Range, which includes Mt. Washington – where the world’s highest ever wind velocity on the planet, 231 miles per hour, was recorded – a climate extreme back in the 1930s when CO2 was only about 320 ppm. New Hampshire is really worth a visit. Vermont is also a beautiful state, but visiting there means you’ll be leaving your money into the wasteful hands of greenie-socialists. Go to New Hampshire instead.
And don’t forget this:

"Every April, rocket-shaped, yellow, nine-inch reproductive shoots of field horsetail (Equisetum arvense), tipped with small cones, erupt through this patch of waste ground beside Mill Road car park on the bank of the river Tyne. They’ll soon wither, after they’ve released their payload of spores. Then forests of green, corrugated stems and whorls of thread-like leaves, shaped like miniature Christmas trees, will rise from their creeping underground stems.  It’s a prehistoric scene that could have been repeated annually since the Carboniferous period, a living reminder of geological events that produced coal, once the mainstay of the local economy. Equisetum is considered to be the most durable plant genus, a survivor of extreme climatic events with an evolutionary history stretching back 300m years, to tropical swamps where its ancestors reached tree-like proportions. Its stems accumulate silica and decay slowly, leaving exquisite fossils. Coal trimmers who, until 50 years ago, loaded holds of colliers a mile upriver from here at Dunston Staiths, shipping 140,000 tonnes of coal each week in the early 20th century, would have had no trouble in matching fossil imprints in their cargo with today’s plants on the quayside. The plant’s tenacious underground stems, almost impossible to eradicate and so infuriating to gardeners, must be one reason why horsetails have survived so long. But when I took a fertile shoot home to examine under a microscope, another became obvious. Overnight, the cone released thousands of spores, each about a 20th of a millimetre in diameter. I scraped some on to a microscope slide and, magnified 400 times, could see that each had four arms wrapped around it. These slender structures, freed at last from confinement and experiencing dry air for the first time, uncoiled into long threads, appropriately called elaters, providing aerial buoyancy to carry their spore away on a gust of wind. The genus Equisetum has already weathered three great mass extinctions that wiped out vast swathes of life on Earth; now, burning coal from those Carboniferous swamps has contributed to climate change and it may be on the threshold of another. But it’s well prepared, with tough subterranean stems and billions of airborne spores that will surely always find safe landfall somewhere."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNote there is no mention at all of “man-made” here.In the coming weeks Russian scientists plan to publish the results of their work on their investigation on the cause of the extremely hot 2010 Russian summer. This was reported yesterday in the German edition of Ria Novosti here.
The study was conducted by the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control (Rosgidromet), headed by Alexander Frolow, and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Both organizations analyzed the summer weather anomaly.
Ria Novosti writes:
According to Frolow, the situation was influenced by a group of causes, among them a stubborn high pressure area and an unfavorable combination of ocean temperature anomalies. The situation in the European part of Russia was worsened by dry winds coming from other regions.
According to estimates by the scientists, this weather  anomaly was caused 20% by global climate change.
Note there is no mention in the Ria Novosti report of “man-made climate change” – only “climate change”. Since climate is always changing naturally, in sync with other cycles like ocean and solar cycles, evidence of a human greenhouse gas fingerprint as the cause would seem to be impossible to discern.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis blog here is not a casino for high rollers. In fact, it’s not a casino at all. Yet, one warmist reader robhon left a comment here proposing a bet which I find quite interesting. Here’s what he proposes:
I’m taking bets with deniers that the decade from 2010 to 2019 will end with at least 7 of the warmest years on record (again, global temperature… you choose the data set, UAH, GISS, RSS, HadCRU…). So, if you genuinely believe that we are headed for a cooling trend, put your money where your mouth is. I will.”
I think what he wants to say is that the next decade will be warmer than the one we just finished. The next decade to me is 2011 – 2020. I propose the following:
I pledge to bet USD 50.00 (fifty US dollars) that the decade of 2011 – 2020 will be cooler globally on average than the decade 2001 – 2010. We will simply take the average of both decades and compare to see which is higher. I suggest using either UAH or RSS, or a composite of both satellite datasets.
Here’s how it looks so far:

You warmists are all saying it’s going to get warmer. What are you waiting for? Man, I can see that trendline just zooming right on up through the next decade – can’t you?
I’m even going to open this bet up for everyone, with all proceeds going to a charity like Children’s Hospice International.
All proceeds will go to a children’s charity.

Anyone who wishes to pledge a sum (min $5) will be able to send an e-mail to me and I will make a list of all those particpating and post it here. That total amount will then need to be matched by robhon and his warmist pals. We can place a limit so that it doesn’t get out of hand. The bet has to be accepted by February 1, 2011.
Anyone who wants to join in for a good cause, make your pledges by then. And then we will see if robhon is ready to go for it.
What do you say amigo?
If the 2011/20 decade averages to be warmer than 2001/10, then I will concede that the earth is indeed warming. But if the next decade turns out to be cooler or the same, then you will have to concede that the theory that CO2 is driving the climate is bunk.  We can work out the details in the days and weeks ahead.
Heck, the PIK ought to be the first to step up. Mr Rahmstorf made such a bet 2 years ago – and says he won!
Looking foraward to hearing your prompt reply.
P Gosselin
PS: I’ve I sent an e-mail to robhon to let him know.
=================================================
UPDATE:  Folks, the bet is on! Robhon has accepted, see his comment! He certainly is exuding quite a bit of confidence. Crap! Now I wish Dec. 2010 had been much warmer!

"The Greens are positioning to torpedo a key element of Labor’s new climate policy in the event Bill Shorten wins the federal election in May, telegraphing strong opposition to heavy polluters using international permits to meet their emissions reduction targets. The thumbs-down from the Greens, who will likely be the critical Senate bloc post-election in the event of a Labor victory, comes as the politically influential motoring lobby has also signalled it will push back on Labor’s proposal to introduce vehicle efficiency standards for light vehicles that would bring Australia broadly into line with carbon pollutions standards for cars in the US.  The Australian Industry Group, which represents some of Australia’s heavy emitters, also argued the 45% emissions target proposed by Labor would represent a “heavy lift” for many parts of the economy and “would be workable only if they were delivered in tandem with commitments to avoid trade distortions, allow many sources of flexibility and facilitate major low-carbon investments”. Labor on Monday, on budget eve and only days before the calling of the election, unveiled the final tranche of its climate policy. The policy includes more stringent pollution-reduction requirements for heavy industry, a new vehicle emissions standard imposed on car retailers, and new targets to increase the share of electric vehicles in the transport fleet. The Morrison government went on the political offensive immediately, likening the measures to a carbon “tax”. The prime minister claimed Labor’s beefed-up pollution requirements for big emitters would force companies to purchase international carbon credits, “sending money offshore to foreign carbon traders – carbon credits from Kazakhstan”. The Greens’ climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, used similar language to Morrison: “We cannot outsource our emissions reduction obligations to a pig farm in Ukraine.” Bandt said international offsets were “fake action because Australian polluters will buy overseas permits from other countries but keep polluting at home. International offsets delay climate action in Australia. More coal will be burnt at home and the transition to 100% renewables will be delayed”. Labor defended the decision to deploy permits as part of the abatement options. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said the government needed to explain why it supported Australian businesses trading in international markets, but not international carbon markets. “What we need are cuts in pollution, whether they are from the Australian carbon farming sector or overseas robust credible markets or the electricity sector – the important thing is for cuts in pollution to be achieved … in the most cost-effective and efficient manner possible,” Butler said. A pitched backroom lobbying campaign has prevented governments imposing vehicle emissions standards in Australia for years. The Australian Automobile Association warned on Tuesday “a poorly designed standard will drive up the cost of cars”, despite government modelling indicating vehicle efficiency standards would actually deliver billions of dollars in fuel savings for consumers. Labor has proposed a pollution regulation that will bring Australian cars in line with 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre, but will consult on the timeline for phasing in the change. The AAA remains opposed to a model that would mirror standards in the European Union or the US and has successfully argued for years that the needs of Australian drivers are unique. On Monday the AAA said it supports the introduction of an emissions standard that recognises the “unique needs and preferences of Australian motorists”, but that a “poorly-designed standard” would drive up the cost of cars and petrol.  The issue of vehicle efficiency standards has been politically toxic, with attempts by the current government to introduce them derailed by the National party and the motoring and petroleum lobbies. The consequence of that is Australia now lags behind the rest of the world in introducing standards that would help deal with the country’s second-highest source of emissions – the transport sector. One motor lobby, the NRMA, has taken a different position to the AAA and says Australia is so far behind it will have to look at banning internal combustion engine vehicle sales within the next decade. Labor has also proposed a national electric vehicle target of 50% of all new car sales by 2030. Other industry groups on Monday said they wanted to see more detail on how the opposition plans to implement its climate policies if it wins government in May. The Ai Group’s chief executive, Innes Willox, said proposed pollution requirements for different sectors under a beefed-up safeguard mechanism would need to be achieved through low-cost abatement anywhere in the domestic economy, as well as through credible international options. He warned assisting industries exposed as a result of the transition to a low-carbon economy could be difficult when many currently weren’t defined as emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries under government arrangements. Willox also said that options for low- and zero-carbon transition in industry needed to be more tangible. “The proposed Strategic Industries Fund could be useful, though important detail is lacking on coverage, level of matching and more,” Willox said. “In short, we should not underestimate how difficult the trade-offs would be between the expectations of different industries and other stakeholders. Close consultation with the breadth of affected industries would be essential to deliver on such ambitious goals.” Environment groups, meanwhile, said the package was a substantial step forward on climate but still fell short on issues including the need to replace coal-fired power and reduce deforestation. Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said: “There is still a cognitive dissidence in our national debate about the climate damage the coal we dig up and send overseas is causing. No party can claim to be truly serious on climate change until it stops Adani and develops a strategy to accelerate the transition away from coal.”  The Australia Institute’s Richie Merzian said the policy had the potential “to actually reduce emissions in line with a credible and achievable emission reduction target of 45% by 2030”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the statement issued by the New York Times itself:
The Times is discontinuing the Green blog, which was created to track environmental and energy news and to foster lively discussion of developments in both areas. This change will allow us to direct production resources to other online projects.”
Why do we suppose this is? Didn’t this part of the Times bring yet more respect and credibility to one of America’s most renown dailies – especially now that”we are all facing a planetary crisis“?
Perhaps a recent Twitter post by NYT environment reporter Andrew Revkin can answer that question. It appears the green pages of the Gray Lady were turning out to be more of an embarrassment than anything. As is the case with any operation that gets shut down, it is because either there’s no longer a demand for it, or other sources are simply doing a much better job delivering.
Recently Andrew Revkin, for example, implied that recent volcano activity was probably the explanation for the stop in global warming over the past years. There’s got to be some explanation. After all, we all know it just can’t be the sun. Here’s what Revkin tweeted:

You can link to the study’s abstract here. Every time they pull the aerosol joker. But even Gavin Schmidt was not impressed by Revkin’s adventurism. Here’s what Schmidt tweeted back:

Yes, indeed it was probably a good time to end the Green blog show, and to “direct production resources to other online projects“.

I thought the Green Police video was a bit dark, but this latest video takes British dark humour to a whole new level. Warning: surreally graphic! (clip is morbidly sarcastic).

Don’t be disturbed by this dear readers. Really, there’s no pressure in the message here. Just a friendly little remnider from your friendly http://www.1010global.org/ that we can all do our little part to save the planet. Of course you don’t need to.

Seriously, looking at the reactions at the other sites and comments, I see a lot of people using this to put thenselves high up on the moral pedestal, overdone indignation and grandstanding. Heck, you’d think the exploding people in the video were real people reading some of the comments. Sure the clip is in bad taste. But it’s just heavy, dark humour. Arguments could be made about the underlying message.
Will the video backfire? Definitely yes.
I think the Greenpeace hooded punk video is far worse. Here we have a kid that is brainwashed and trained to really hate (no humour there at all – pure hatred). Anyway, we see an emerging pattern of violent eco-activism.

Now that’s a clip to get upset about.

Share this...FacebookTwitterReaching an agreement in Cancun is out of reach. Representatives are desperate, and so they will go through every motion to give the appearance they are doing something  – anything. They are obligated to go through the formalities of trying, after all.
Der Spiegel reports here that Germany’s Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen is now singing a whole new tune. Instead of singing the blues, he’s now whistling Dixie! And that likely through his you know what. Der Spiegel wrote yesterday:
The German environment minister, it would seem, is tired of issuing dark warnings of impending climate change disaster. ‘In Germany, we have begun to see things in a different light in recent years,’ Norbert Röttgen said on Wednesday during his first appearance at the UN climate summit in Cancun, Mexico. ‘People in business, in politics and in the society at large no longer see climate change as a threat, but as an opportunity and a challenge.’
Suddenly it’s no longer a threat, and now climate change will bring us opportunities. Obviously leaders have realised that people are not being scared into acceptong policy anymore, and so now the new tactic is to try to lure them into policy with pretty pictures.
Face it, the panic tactic has failed. Climate change is 10,000 times more boring than watching grass grow. It’s a very slow process. Indeed it would take a human an entire lifetime to even notice today’s sea level rise rate. That’s why the tactic of pretty pictures and nice stories is now being tried.
Röttgen claims:
Our strategy of investing in renewable energies and energy efficiency proved itself successful in times of economic and financial crisis.

If we approach our target in an efficient manner, we will have created 500,000 additional jobs by 2020 and will spend over €20 billion ($27 billion) less on energy imports.”
Sounds good on the surface. But what is not mentioned is that consumers would be forced to buy up expensive renewable energy at, let’s say, 35 cents a kwh instead of importing it for 3 cents a kwh – or producing it domestically with conventional methods for 4 cents a kwh. In the end, its the poor consumer who would get screwed, and man-made climate change would still remain a fairy tale.
Don’t expect this new rosy facade put on by Röttgen to sway positions, which have long since been decided and cemented. Der Spiegel writes:
China, however, continues to resist concrete targets for cuts in its greenhouse gas emissions. Early in the week, there were some reports from the talks in Cancun that China may be prepared to compromise. Deputy Chinese climate negotiator Liu Zhenmin said on Monday, however, that such reports resulted from a “misunderstanding.” Pledges from Beijing, he said, are “voluntary” and “non-negotiable.”
Non-negotiable. And as far as the USA is concerned any bill reaching Congress would be DOA.
For those of you out there still worried that leaders might do something really stupid, and actually sign something – stop worrying. Merkel hasn’t jumped on any jet to Cancun, and she isn’t going to. Cancun was pronounced dead before it even got started.
Parading the dead body that is Cancun through the conference may make it look like it’s alive, but it’s still dead. Time to bury it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe situation for German global warming activists is getting ever more hopeless by the hour. Are we witnesing the death of one of the greatest hoaxes of all time? Now that large, major media outlets are putting the CO2 scam under the spotlight, and revealing the CO2 lies, sales of Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s skeptic book are skyrocketing.
Number 12 on the overall Amazon.de bestseller list - and still rising.
The new book has skyrocketed up to No. 12 on the overall Amazon.de bestseller list. This really increases the chances that a publisher for an English version book will soon be found.
The warmists can say all they want – once undecided readers read just a quarter of the book, they will already be convinced that there indeed will not be any climate catastrophe. All the facts and data are there – presented so that laypersons can understand it. Global warming in Germany will soon be kaput!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA shot just before the conference started
Just got back, and here’s a recap of the conference, which I wrote on the train.
Yesterday’s first speaker was Vincent Courtillot, who spoke  about consensus. As soon as debate is abandoned, he says, then science stops. Overall he says the debate has to open up, and that it is surely poisoned by politics. I thought he gave an excellent speech.
Next, because Fred Singer couldn’t attend, we heard a 10 minute audio-message he had recorded earlier, where in it he said that there is no evidence of man made global warming, and that sea level rise for the next 90 years will rise around 18 cm, and not 1.5 m as the Propaganda Institute for Klima (PIK) claims. Singer also said he sees waning political will. He thinks the climate issue will be settled in five years. I think he’ll be right.
Prof Nir Shaviv 
Nir Shaviv then explained solar activity and climate, showing that the link between solar activity, cosmic rays and cloud formation is pretty much in the bag. CERN will be soon releasing results on this, too. Oceanic warming is not due to CO2, but to solar radiation. In fact, sea level rise rate correlates with the solar cycles, which I found interesting. Yet, in all presentations, the scientists cautioned against confusing correlation with causation. In summary, Shaviv theorises that the sun modulates the oceans, which in turn modulate the atmosphere (climate). The lag between solar activity and impact on climate was said to be about 3 years. Thus we ought to start seeing the impacts of the current low solar activity that has set in since about 2008.
Looking out the window, I’d say it’s about right!
The next presentation by Henrik Borchert complimented Shaviv’s presentation, supporting the solar link, which I think is the obvious place to look if you are going to look for what really drives climate. During many of these presentations, the CO2-driver theory was shown to have no merit, and was discarded every time. No wonder they don’t want to debate it.
Bob Carter
Bob Carter gave one of the most interesting talks, where he put the current warming in geological context. Conclusion: Nothing unnatural with today’s changes is detetctable. A later mathematical presentation by Horst-Joachim Lüdecke confirmed the same.
One point I found interesting was that most of today’s animals have their orgins from about 5 million years ago, meaning they’ve survived the wide climate variations of the ice ages, which means all the scare talk about biodiversity not surviving one or two degrees of temperature change is pure bunk. The only ones with a problem with a degree or two are the whiny warmists. They rest of the planet will be fine with it.
Lots of focus on proxies
Günter Ederer 
One of the most entertaining and interesting speeches came from veteran German journalist Günter Ederer, who has lots of contacts and thus has excellent insights as to what is going on. If you have the chance to hear him speak – don’t pass it up. He mentioned during the break that he will be coming out with a new book, and for sure it will be an interesting one. For Ederer: “The IPCC is not interested in science.” Indeed Ederer makes it clear where this is all taking us – some place really ugly.
Jan Veizer focused on sun evapo-transpiration and produced data and charts clearly showing that CO2 is not the driver. Also the claim that there is no correlation between solar irradiance and temperature over the last years was fabricated, and thus the solar theory cannot be discarded. They adjusted the solar irradiance data with no justification. Veizer presented a number of correlations showing the sun is the driver.
Why would that be difficult to believe?

I liked his analogy where he compared to CO2 to Lichtenstein. If warmists were economists, they would try to boost the entire European economy by stimulating the economy of tiny Lichtenstein. That’s pretty much how they want to control the climate.
Meteorologist Klaus-Eckhardt Puls, 3rd from left.
One presentation I enjoyed, and one that throws in lots more uncertainty, was by Ian Pilmer, a geologist. Fascinating was the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of volcanoes below the sea level and many under Antarctica, and not a bit of data has been collected on any of these. These emit huge amounts of CO2.
The best one! The most interesting presentation was made by meteorologist Klaus-Eckhart Puls. His lively, fast-paced presentation drove nails into the coffin of the AGW notion. First he showed that North Sea sea levels have been rising at the same rate for four hundred years now. NO SIGN OF ACCELERATED SEA LEVEL RISE! He also showed that the Sahara is shrinking as plant life is encroaching more and more. 300,000 sq km of trees were added over the last 20 years (as recently reported in FOCUS). He also debunked all the hyped up media claims of more storms and stronger this or that. His presentation had a good dose of humour and will be really worth watching when EIKE posts it.
During the break
The conference then ended with presentations by Dieter Ameling, Lutz Peters and Michael Limburg. Regrettably I couldn’t stay for the closing speech because trains don’t wait.
From a political and economic standpoint, the consensus is that the German government’s environmental and green economy policies are going to take Germany to hell in a hand basket – and quickly. But, being a guest here, I’ll refrain from commenting.
One speaker did point out that in communist times, you couldn’t say anything because they were always listening. But today, you can say anything you want, because they’ve stopped listening!
Now the big disappointment
I went there with high expectations because I kept hearing from the real climate scientists, who claim absolute knowledge, that the sceptics are funded by Big Oil. So I was hoping to go to Berlin Denier Conference and get some of that Big Oil money too.
But much to my dismay, the oil executives weren’t even there, and so I wasn’t able to close a disinformation for funding agreement. What crap! So I spoke to the gents at Science Sceptical, a German blog, and they also have to go without. So my dream of getting millions for doing this blog have completely vanished. All this blogging has been for nothing – fooled again by the warmists. When will I ever learn not to trust them?
Anyway, if there are any oil executives out there reading this blog, please note that I’m now seriously considering changing sides – and going where the big money is :).
Finally, my apologies for any misspelled names.

Steffen Hentrich of the Liberal Institute of the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundtaion for Freedom
Steffen Hentrich of the Liberal Institute at the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation for Liberty blasted the 10:10 No Pressure clip, calling it a manual for climate terrorism. Read here in German.
Here the term “Liberal” is the so-called “classic liberal, and not to be confused with the kind one finds in the USA.
He warns that the windmills turning in the wind and shiny solar panels on roofs are the harmless stage for a not-to-be excluded eco-dictatorship that would have zero respect for humanity.
Here are some excerpts of his comments I translated in English:
What do we do with people who do not wish to join in the climate protection movement propagated upon us by environmental activists and politicians? You just blow them up and justify it by claiming these few non-conformists are nothing when compared to the 300,000 people who have supposedly already died because of climate change so far. For this number there is no scientific basis, just climate models.

Just 65 years after the end of National Socialism, under whose dehumanizing ideology millions of human beings were murdered in the most brutal manner, and 21 years after the fall of communism, where its collective Weltanschauung claimed just as many lives, and only 9 years since the attacks on the WTC, which claimed thousands of lives because of religious fanaticism, a radical environmental movement today does not even bother to hide how it would like to deal with people who do not agree with its end of the world scenarios and prefer to opt out of its simplistic world rescue program.
Unfortunately the German mainstream media, big cheerleaders of the climate protection madness, have been completely silent thus far. Surely they are shocked by the clip’s content but are keeping a low profile. They’ve had three days now. Shame shame.
Where is that model of democracy and human rights which Germany has been since the end of WWII? Tragically many have been just too caught up in the eco-zealotry.
Steffen Hentrich in one of the few who has stood up and publicly denounced the clip and its message in Germany.
(He is also a regular contributor to the online Freie Welt daily.)

Der Spiegel
Stern
Die Welt
Focus
FAZ
For example I just called and spoke to a gentleman at Der Spiegel. The man I spoke to claimed he was not aware of the story. I actually had to spell “10:10 No Pressure” to him. “Is it written with numbers or letters?” he asked. In general he was not very friendly acted completely bored and arrogant about it. Indeed, a very touchy subject at Der Spiegel.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHat tip Ron de HaanSo far it’s been a really cold winter for much of Europe, and so you’d think we’d be due for a little relief. Think again!
Although western Europe will enjoy some milder temps this weekend, it isn’t going to last long. Already next week the bitter cold will be back. This is just the kind of winter weather that not only paralyzes economic activity, but also wreaks havoc on streets and highways – freeze-thaw-freeze cycles that rip asphalt surfaces apart. Expect major damage this winter and huge potholes later on.
Joe Bastardi’s latest video Europe Gets Hit by Extreme Cold is not good news. By Tuesday night the cold will spread over Central and Western Europe. Bastardi:
By the time we get to the latter part of next week and on into the Christmas week, this is a severe event, no question about it.
We’re looking at a top 5 or 10 cold December.
I feel we should warn you, things are going to be real nasty in the next 2 weeks, and perhaps 3 weeks.”
To me this is okay. All them warmist representatives thinking they were going to enjoy sun, beach and warmth in Cancun found themselves shivering there in 100-year record cold. And now they can come back and disembark from their planes and into the cold reality in Europe, and wonder where all the warming is.
Hint: it’s in the models and your dumb heads, and nowhere else.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow about just appeasing the gods with human sacrifices? That could work too.I just heard an interview on German NDR Info public radio with Mojib Latif, of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. Of course he was brought on to say that the “monster” Yasi “killer” cyclone hitting Australia and the “mega-blizzard” pounding the US and Canada are due to global warming.
The adjectives I use here are what the media today are using. Normally I just let this rubbish go, but he made a couple of points I feel are worth discussing and are indicative of the sad state to which the climate science field has devolved today.
The radio moderator asked him what’s behind these weather extremes? To me, Latif’s answer makes no sense. Maybe much of the audience is not familiar ENSO’s and so maybe that’s why Latif and the media keep getting away with it every time. His answer in a nutshell:
The mega storms can be traced back to the current La Nina, which is a cold surface temperature phenomena in the equatorial Pacific region. But behind that, is global warming.
That’s what he claimed. The weather extremes are caused by cool Pacific waters, which are consistent with global warming. He also reiterated the theory that global warming leads to more extreme storms, even though there is no data to support this. Call it the missing storms. They’re somewhere, and that they can’t be found is a travesty.
Actually, those who are not ignorant in the field know that the opposite is occuring – there are fewer storms today. What’s drastically higher is the media strom hype.
Accumulated Cyclone Energy is near a 30-year low. Where are the missing storms?
The second point I found amazing is Latif’s recommendation when asked if adaptation to climate change would work as a way to cope with extreme weather events. I haven’t yet found an audio link to the radio interview, so I’ll provide what he said in a nutshell:
Adaptation in the end will not work. It will be necessary for man to limit the earth’s temperature rise.”
And how does man regulate Mother Nature? By reducing CO2 emissions of course. That’s the rain dance that will appease the weather gods and make the big storms go away.
Hard to believe this guy is a scientist.

Der Spiegel reports on the growling-ever-louder Indonesian Merapi volcano in an article titled: Geologists Warning of Mega-Eruption of Merapi. Hat-tip to reader Ike.

The Merapi eruptions are becoming more violent – and the big bang could be just ahead. The Indonesian volcano has been spewing 800°C ash clouds for days.

//-->




According to Der Spiegel, 122 people have been killed, most on Friday. “Merapi is among the most dangerous volcanoes,” says geo-scientist Volker Steinbach of the German Federal Administration for Geoscience and Raw Materials (BGR). Der Spiegel adds:
Friday’s eruption is its worst this decade, says the chief geologist of the Energy Administration, Raden Sukhyiar, in the “Jakarta Post”. The biggest known eruptions occurred in 1006, 1369, 1786, 1822, 1872 – destroying a large number of villages – and 1930 when 1300 people perished.
Investigations of the volcano have revealed that an unprecedented Magma reservoir lurks underneath it, says Birger Lühr, a volcano researcher at the GFZ in Potsdam, Germany.
A rough estimate indicates that there is three times more magma than what was ejected by the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815 – the biggest eruption in the last 10,000 years, which led to a cooling of the climate globally.
Geoscientists aren’t sure what to make of this huge magma reservoir. As Der Spiegel reports, they are hesitant to make predictions of catastrophe (That’s only done in climate science, even though the odds are far less).

Word of a ‘mega-eruption’ is making the rounds among scientists. But apparently they are avoiding the use of the word to avoid being labelled preachers of disasters. ‘We can only speculate what the volcano will do,’ says Birger Lühr. Merapi is hardly predictable.

History shows, however, that volcanoes in Indonesia have a worrisome potential for catastrophic eruptions. Nature cannot be controlled. It can only be coped with.

Share this...FacebookTwitterItaly is about to join the growing list of European countries cutting back subsidies to solar and wind energy, so reports the online Berlin TAZ.
A complete stop to solar energy and deep cuts in wind energy: Italy’s government passed a decree that could spell an abrupt end in the recently started renewable energy boom.”
This comes at the heels of a number of countries cutting back on solar subsidies throughout Europe – mainly due to their high costs to consumers and technical problems integrating these sources into the existing infrastructure.
Economics Minister Paolo Romani says that Italian citizens have had to pay 6 billion euros in subsidies so far. The solar subsidies were originally planned for the period from 2011 to 2013, but now will remain in effect only for systems installed before June 1, 2011. The law also stops solar plants with a capacity of over 1 MW from being built in the open countryside due to “landscape protection issues”.
Other countries like Spain have also implemented similar stops to the overly expensive renewable energy sources.
Italian subsidies had guaranteed operators of small-scale systems €0.47/kwh and large scale systems €0.34 /kwh for feeding the energy into the grid. Italy will also reduce subsidies paid to wind power. The leftist TAZ writes:
Here subsidies will be cut by 22%, and done so retroactively and thus apply to systems that are also in operation. This would deal a fatal blow. When the government redefines the subsidy rates whenever and however it feels, it makes reliable investment plans impossible.”
Good riddance to the eyesores that have only drained the pockets of consumers. More reading:
– Austerity – Pulling the plug on Europe’s green subsidies
– Germany cuts solar subsidies
– Danish wind-subsidies to be cut
– Spain cuts solar subsidies

Trash washes up in Tanzania. (Photo credit: Loranchet / Wikipedia)
We’ve heard about a giant patch of garbage supposedly floating out in the Pacific, yet another unmistakable sign of the scourge that man is to the planet. Read NatGeo here and The Independent here and NPR here, just to name a few.
It turns out that it’s all a huge exaggeration.
Caught red-handed again! Who can believe these media organizations any longer? Sadly this is routine procedure when reporting on climate change and evironment.
Wikipedia here calls it the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and describes it as the Pacific Trash Vortex, which is estimated to be an area the size of the state of Texas to one larger than the continental United States.
There’s just one problem, though. Wikipedia writes: 
Despite its size and density, the patch is not visible from satellite photography.”
Hmmm. Well, there’s a good reason for that. One reason is likely because it’s a heck of a lot smaller than what we have been led to believe. Today Jürgen Schönstein has a piece at science blogs titled The garbage patch is smaller than feared. Schönstein writes that marine biologist Assistant Professor Angel White of Oregon State University has come to the conclusion that the size and growth of the patch is “grossly exaggerated by the media”:



<!--

The amount of plastic out there isn’t trivial. But using the highest concentrations ever reported by scientists produces a patch that is a small fraction of the state of Texas, not twice the size.”
You can read the Oregon State Univsersity press release here. Well, you might say, Texas is a big place and even a small fraction is a lot. The press release writes:
The studies have shown is that if you look at the actual area of the plastic itself, rather than the entire North Pacific subtropical gyre, the hypothetically “cohesive” plastic patch is actually less than 1 percent of the geographic size of Texas.”
Simple mathematics tells us that the media exaggerated the patch size by a factor of more than 200. I’m not saying there isn’t problem with marine pollution. It’s just nowhere near as bad as we are told, like many other things – climate to name one.
In the end, pick up your trash and dispose of it properly. Don’t litter! White says:
If there is a takeaway message, it’s that we should consider it good news that the ‘garbage patch’ doesn’t seem to be as bad as advertised,” White said, “but since it would be prohibitively costly to remove the plastic, we need to focus our efforts on preventing more trash from fouling our oceans in the first place.”
One final note: Have you ever compared the aftermath of a Tea Party demonstration to the aftermath of a save-the-planet type of demonstration in terms of garbage left behind? That pretty much tells you who the real big slobs are. The same can be pretty much said about their carbon footprints too, i.e. think Gore, Hollywood, UN bureaucrats, “climate scientists” and activists flying all over the globe and living high on the hog.

German ZDF public television (Germany’s BBC you could say) had this piece of propaganda where the anchorman tells his viewers:
For years they had a drought that made the land infertile and brought water-intensive agriculture to an end. Back then they prayed for rain, and now they’ve gotten it – and exactly how climate scientists had predicted it. Not as a relief, but as a new catastrophe.”
Well, it’s not unusual for that region to cycle between drought and flooding, which is all mainly caused by ocean cycles (not CO2). According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) ENSO report dated Dec. 22, 2010:
La Niña periods are generally associated with above normal winter, spring and summer rainfall, particularly over eastern and northern Australia. Night-time temperatures during La Niña periods are historically warmer than average and Tropical Cyclone occurrence for northern Australia is typically higher than normal during the cyclone season (November-April).”
Certainly the ZDF was not referring to these scientists. Floods are not new to the region. They’ve happened before. Read it all here.
NTZ reader Matti Vooro quotes the BOM here (after researching BOM records):
Flooding, unlike drought, is often quite localized, and therefore not as closely tied to broad-scale controls like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. However the La Niña years of 1916, 1917, 1950, 1954 through 1956, and 1973 through 1975, were accompanied by some of the worst and most widespread flooding this century. It can safely be said that, over much of Australia, flooding is more likely than usual during La Niña years, and less likely in El Niño years, though heavy rain and flooding often accompany the breakdown of El Niño in late summer or autumn.”
The graphic below shows that major Australian flood episodes are a function of the Southern Oscillation Index:

The BOM writes:
Extended periods of high SOI in 1916/17, the mid-1950s, and the early to mid-1970s, were periods of widespread, frequent flooding.”
Take the great Roper river flood of 1940, for example. The BOM writes:
This event was all the more remarkable because preceding conditions over the Roper River catchment had been very dry; in fact the river had stopped running for the first time in living memory during December 1939.”
The BOM writes that a tropical depression formed and dumped as much as 700mm of rain in six days.
Another example is The Big Wet – January 1974. BOM:
The year 1973 was one of the wettest known over much of Australia, and in keeping with the strong La Niña event that prevailed, the 1973/74 northern wet season started early. By the end of 1973 large areas of the country were saturated. Then came January 1974, which featured probably the biggest continent-wide drenching since European settlement, inundating vast areas of the country.”
Also take a look at the Katherine Flood of 1998. Tropical cyclone Les dumped 400-500mm of rain on areas of the Katherine, Roper and Daly River catchments. The BOM writes:
Such rainfall amounts falling over catchments already saturated from heavy rain earlier in the month had a dramatic impact. By the 27th the Katherine River had risen to more than 20 metres – the largest flood in Katherine’s history, eclipsing the previous record (set in 1957) by 0.7 metres.
You can go back in history and find floods that have been far worse. What what you won’t find was a media that ran around blaming it all on the sins of man to the extent done done today.

"Donald Trump’s choice to run the World Bank has moved swiftly to allay fears that his appointment will lead to a softening of the organisation’s approach to climate change. In his first day at the helm of the Washington-based institution, David Malpass said helping developing countries cope with global warming would remain central to the bank’s mission.  Malpass also said there would be no change in the bank’s refusal to lend for new coal-fired power plants, despite Trump’s strong support for US coal producers. “Climate change is a key problem facing people,” Malpass said. “It presents specific problems and we are addressing them through adaptation and through meeting our climate change action plan. My expectation is that the bank continues the direction it has been pursuing in terms of those goals.” Malpass was appointed unopposed last week, continuing a tradition that the US gets to choose the president of the World Bank while the Europeans appoint the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. But there were concerns, both among the bank’s staff and campaign groups, that the former US Treasury official would adopt a growth-at-any-cost approach that would downplay the organisation’s recent environmental focus. Bank sources said there was relief when, in an address to staff, Malpass mentioned climate change twice and called the challenge “immense”. The World Bank’s climate change action plan has pledged to increase lending in poor countries vulnerable to global warming, warning that failure to act risks pushing an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030. Asked at a press briefing about his views on the bank’s anti-coal policy, Malpass said: “The World Bank board and the governors have established a policy on that. I don’t expect a change in that policy.” He added: “The mission of the bank is urgent. There are 700 million people living in extreme poverty and that’s 700 million too many. I want to continue with the mission to alleviate and eliminate extreme poverty and the mission of shared prosperity.” Malpass said his first visit as bank president would be to sub-Saharan Africa later this month and it was worrying that the world’s poorest countries were being affected by the slowdown in the global economy seen since the middle of 2018. “It’s very important that global growth be faster. It is a key part of meeting the challenge on poverty and shared prosperity.” In addition to tackling the problems of climate change, Malpass said it was important that developing countries had robust private sectors and encouraged women to take a full role in the economy. The new World Bank president said there would be an evolution in its relationship with China but no dramatic change. As it grew richer, China would borrow less from the bank and contribute more capital. There had been a shift in the bank’s lending towards lower-income countries with greater needs and away from middle-income countries, Malpass said. “China has not been singled out but the expectation is that countries that have done better will be reducing their lending from the bank.”"

The Austrian online Der Standard reports here that Spanish scientists at the University Almeria have determined that the average European emits 2 tonnes of CO2 annually just though eating habits and excretion, this in a study appearing in the International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment.
The lead author of the study Amadeo Fernandez-Alba writes:
The entire food cycle has an impact on the climate. The treatment of sewage water contributes to this and thus must be taken into account.
According to Der Standard:
He urges consumers to not only think about health and pleasure when buying food, but also to pay attention to the environment.
The researchers studied the entire food cycle of an average Spanish man and the CO2 produced. The result was two tons per person, which is 20% of the average European’s total output. The worst for the climate are meat and milk products. Most of the greenhouse gases are emitted during the food production process – especially agriculture.

Dr Fernandez Alba says that fruits and vegetbles are the best . but they too can be problematic. The researchers say:
Consumers orient themselves less and less on seasonal production. Instead they increasingly want their strawberries and asparagus year-round. In addition, an increasing amount of tropical fruit is being consumed. That increases Co2 emissions from transport immensely.
Human excrement taken into account for the first time
For the first time, the researchers also studied greenhouse gases produced by human excrement. It turns out that this by-product is in second place not that far behind food production in GHG emissions. The scientists say:
The culprits here are mainly nitrogen and phosphorous amounts, and also gases that are produced by sewage treatment plants.
Expect Europe to start regulating our eating habits and inspecting what goes through the toilet – soon. Poor Europe has got nothing better to do.

"When the colonists arrived in Australia, they saw themselves as conquering both the continent’s land and its people. In many respects, they didn’t differentiate between the two. The Bible commands believers (in Genesis 1:28) to “replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth”.  That injunction informed terra nullius. The settlers never believed Australia empty. They knew of its Indigenous inhabitants. But they didn’t believe the natives practised agriculture – and without agriculture (that “subjugation of the land”) the continent could, they thought, only be a wilderness. The remarkable, slow-building success of Bruce Pascoe’s book Dark Emu has done much to educate white society about how wrong the settlers were. Indigenous people did practise agriculture – they just did so in a different way. The “wilderness” that the settlers saw actually represented the work of Indigenous people over tens of thousands of years, systematically and consciously burning to encourage certain plants and animals, and discourage others. It was only because of human labour that the land, as Bill Gammage notes in The Biggest Estate on Earth, reminded explorers and colonists of the manicured parks treasured by English noblemen. The work of Pascoe and others should matter to all Australians because of its implications for racial justice. But it also offers hope in the midst of the current environmental emergency. At the frontier, the settlers understood themselves at the front line in a battle between (white) people and nature. On one side stood civilisation, knowledge, culture, religion and everything else that distinguished humanity from other species; on the other lay a wilderness, desolate spiritually and physically. Later, many environmentalists simply reversed that polarity. Seeing the destruction wreaked by industrialisation, they judged the cities stultifying rather than ennobling. Nature mattered, they thought, because of its uncontamination by humanity. “In wildness,” explained the pioneering American naturalist Henry David Thoreau, “is the preservation of the world.” That kind of Romanticism spurred many of the great environmental battles in Australian history. During the crucial struggle to prevent the Franklin Dam, for instance, the Wilderness Society argued that “the advocates of wilderness are linked by an intuitive conviction that to destroy these last fragments of wild Earth is akin to destroying ourselves”. From where we are today, the problems with that well-meaning rhetoric become far more apparent. In the Australian context, an environmentalism that defends “wilderness” negates Indigenous history and unwittingly revives terra nullius. Furthermore, as Emma Marris argues in her book Rambunctious Garden, it leads, in the 21st century, to a deep pessimism. “We cling,” she writes, “to fragments of ‘virgin’ or ‘old growth’ forests, to the ‘last great places’, the ever-rarer ‘intact ecosystems,’ but they slip through our fingers. Like slivers of soap, they shrink and disappear. And we mourn. We are always mourning, because we can’t make more of such places. Every year there are fewer of them than the year before.” In the era of the Anthropocene, with the presence of humanity felt all across the planet, wilderness – if by that we mean land untouched by people – no longer exists. That’s why it’s liberating to recognise that it never really did. In every continent, humanity has always shaped nature, just as nature has always shaped humanity. In Britain, many of the most beautiful “ancient woodlands” were deliberately planted centuries ago as a source of timber, fuel or game, just as the distinctive English moors resulted from tree-felling during the Bronze and Iron Ages. “The pristine wilderness notion,” Marris continues, “is a historically created idea about what ought to count as nature, and there is no reason why we can’t change it … And we do change it, a heretofore unthinkable, exciting and energising thought occurs: we can make more nature. We can make things on Earth better, not just less bad.” Indigenous history, in particular, demonstrates that we don’t need to assume an eternal antagonism between humanity and nature. We can change how we relate to the world, the specific form of our engagement with the planet. As Pascoe argues, Aboriginal people collectively controlled their metabolism with nature, using custom, culture and law to regulate burning, hunting, planting and other forms of labour. The colonists replaced that ancient system with a capitalist agriculture driven by the imperatives of individual enrichment. As a result, as Eric Rolls explained in A Million Wild Acres, “thousands of years of grass and soil changed in a few years”, and the parklike meadows vanished. Crucially, the incredibly rapid destruction wasn’t the consequence of population pressures or industrialisation in a still very small and underdeveloped colony. What mattered was an economic shift: the destruction of a system that carefully regulated the human metabolism with nature, and the implementation of a system that rewarded those who looted the environment for individual gain. Indigenous history shows there’s nothing inevitable about the environmental carnage being unleashed now. Aboriginal Australians lived on the continent for at least 50,000 years – and that human presence improved nature rather than diminished it. We urgently need to learn from that. Sure, we can’t return to the world that existed prior to 1788. But we have access today to science that makes it possible to understand – and thus control – our metabolism with nature in ways that were previously available. We don’t have to accept the anarchy of a capitalist production that’s done so much damage in so brief a time. We need, as a matter of urgency, a planned and democratic alternative. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist • Comments on this article have been pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is on the topics that have been written about in the article"

I ventured into the French websites and found this jewel of meteorological ignorance at the French sceptic site rechauffement mediatique.org. See video here Radio Canada (broadcast in October).
Featured in the piece is veteran Quebec meteorologist Jocelyne Blouin at Radio-Canada.
Last September (er, late summer) Blouin joined a Dutch expedition to southwest Greenland with journalists, tourists and meteorologists in order to observe firsthand the devastating impacts of “climate change” on Greenland. The video report of this expedition in French, with parts in English, just couldn’t be funnier. You think AIT was bad science?
Day 1
The expedition begins in southwest Greenland at Kangerlussuaq and takes the team 40 km inland to the Russel Glacier, where they set up camp 660 m above sea level. Ms Blouin comments:
It’s weird. It’s not even cold with temperatures near 0°C even though it’s the start of winter.
Last I heard, mid September is still late summer, and so it shouldn’t be a surprise that “it’s not even cold” and that they only have to wear parkas, mittens and ski hats. And isn’t it strange how these journalists only venture out to such places at times the ice is at a minimum?
Day 2
The team walks to a moulin where the ice is 200 to 300 m thick, and they act surprised that in late summer water is flowing down into it. Also someone explains that volcanic soot and pollution aerosols trapped in the ice serve to accelerate melting. Blouin adds:
The ice is filled with crevices – a sure sign that the ice is moving a lot. It’s incredible.
Then Blouin again mentions the melt. Remember – it’s late summer in Southern Greenland! Blouin laments:
The whole time you hear running water. You can even hear it running in the crevices. There’s way too much water.
Later in the day they return to camp “full of emotion”.
Day 3

The guide explains (in English) how the glacier works like a bulldozer and how the spot they are standing on was covered with ice 10 years earlier.
Again, at the end of summer, they are surprised that water is running. Moreover, they are astonished to see pieces of the leading edge of the glacier breaking off and falling into the lake. Just a week earlier the lake was much higher. But because ice blocking the outlet had melted (in the summertime), much of it emptied out. Blouin describes what she sees:
Everywhere the glacier is retreating.
You can hear it groaning and cracking. Water is running non-stop. It’s too hot. At this time of the year water is supposed to freeze. The glaciers are supposed to be sleeping. Yet you hear it moving – cracking.
Day 4
Back on terra firma, the team is in discussion.
– You can discuss it for years and years, but that won’t solve the problem!
– We just want to stop the discussion and do something! Act!
Blouin adds:
The others want to convince the sceptics. Everyone agrees. Global warming is causing damage and here in Greenland, we have the direct proof.
The guide adds:
This summer is probably the warmest in Greenland ever recorded. It’s the beginning of what’s to come.
And later makes an emotional plea:
That’s all you need to know, indeed. Look at the glaciers! they can tell you what will happen. And what these glaciers are telling me and the public is that you can’t deny global warming. It’s impossible!
Sorry dear Mr Guide and Ms Meteorologist Blouin,  it’s not all we need to know. There’s a lot more to it. You could start by finding out why they call it “Greenland” in the first place.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote here about an expedition that included a Canadian meteorologist/journalist Jocelyne Blouin whose documentary tried to convince us that a single receding glacier at a single location in Greenland over the last 10 years was “direct proof “of climate change and so was justification to “act now”. The target of the documentary of course was to spread panic and heighten the level of urgency.
Wondering just what might be going on up there in that part of Greenland, I decided to check the weather out records of stations located around Kangerlussuaq (3)67.0°N, 50°40’W.  The following is a map of Greenland with the locations I looked at. Kangerlussuaq where Blouin’s film was made, is no. 3.
Given the fact that Kangerlussuaq has a sizable airport, one would think it would have a weather station and weather records. But GISS appears not use it as a station. Therefore I checked the GISS temperature records of locations near Kangerlussuaq.
First I checked Jakobshavn (1), which is further north. We see that the GISS series stopped in 1980. Note how the temperature follows the AMO, and that temperature rose  from 1900 to 1940, but then cooled!

Next is Angmagssalik (2) in Southeastern Greenland. Here we have a complete temperature record and see rapid warming from 1900 to 1940 as well, and then followed by cooling, and then warming over the last 30 years. The temperature trend is in sync with the AMO. Hardly looks like a continuous steady rise to me. Smoothing would show that it was a tad warmer in the 1930s and 40s.

Next is Egedesminde (4) The temperature chart starts only at 1950, where a cooling trend continues until about 1990. Suddenly the temperature spikes upwards. Looking at Google maps, this station seems to have a lot of new buildings and asphalt in the vicinity. I haven’t been able to locate the station or Stevenson screen, which is likely near the airport.

The next station near Kangerlussuaq is Godthab Nuuk (5), which is a little south and bit more west. Except for a warm 2010, the overall trend is cooling. Rapid warming has occurred since 1995. Again, looking at the airport, where perhaps the station is placed, one sees a lot of asphalt, buildings and other potential heat sources. Overall, though, the chart shows no man made global warming.

The next temperature record is Ivigut Greenland (6), which is a ways down south. Unfortunately this series ends back around 1968. But again we see the warming from 1900 to 1940, and then the start of cooling – all in sync with the AMO.

Summary
All surrounding stations show a warm time back around 1940, and a warming trend beginning around 1980 or 90, which may be due to station siting issues. All stations seem to be heavily impacted by the AMO. The claim that there is a CO2 cause, as Blouin asserts, and that the warming is unusual has no merit. Also ice cores show that Greenland was very warm 900 years ago, during the MWP.  In short: Madame Blouin est plein merde.

"Media outlets and politicians routinely refer to the “flood” of Central American migrants, the “wave” of asylum seekers, the “deluge” of children, despite the fact that unauthorized migration across the US borders is at record lows in recent years. Comparing human beings to natural disasters is both lazy and dehumanizing, but perhaps this tendency to lean on environmental language when describing migration is an unconscious acknowledgement of a deeper truth: much migration from Central America and, for that matter, around the world, is fueled by climate change.  Yes, today’s Central American migrants – most of them asylum seekers fearing for their lives – are fleeing gangs, deep economic instability (if not abject poverty), and either neglect or outright persecution at the hands of their government. But these things are all complicated and further compounded by the fact that the northern triangle of Central America – a region comprising Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, and the largest sources of asylum seekers crossing our border in recent years – is deeply affected by environmental degradation and the impacts of a changing global climate. The average temperature in Central America has increased by 0.5C since 1950; it is projected to rise another 1-2 degrees before 2050. This has a dramatic impact on weather patterns, on rainfall, on soil quality, on crops’ susceptibility to disease, and thus on farmers and local economies. Meanwhile, incidences of storms, floods and droughts on are the rise in the region. In coming years, according to the US Agency for International Development, countries in the northern triangle will see decreased rainfall and prolonged drought, writ large. In Honduras, rainfall will be sparse in areas where it is needed, yet in other areas, floods will increase by 60%. In Guatemala, the arid regions will creep further and further into current agricultural areas, leaving farmers out to dry. And El Salvador is projected to lose 10-28% of its coastline before the end of the century. How will all those people survive, and where will they go? This September, I travelled to El Salvador to report on the impacts of the US government’s family separation policy. I’d been to El Salvador many times before, but never to the Jiquilisco Bay, a stunning, shimmering and once abundant peninsula populated by mangroves and fishing communities and uncountable species of marine life. It is also one that, like many places in El Salvador, and like many places in the world, is also imperiled by climate change. Rising sea levels are destroying the mangrove forests, the marine life that relies on them, and thus the fishermen who rely on that marine life to feed themselves and eke out a meager economy. I met a man there named Arnovis Guidos Portillo, a 26-year-old single dad. Many people in his family were fishermen, but they were able to catch fewer and fewer fish. The country’s drought and devastating rainfall meant that the area’s farming economy, too, was suffering. The land was stressed, the ocean was stressed, and so were the people. Arnovis got into a scuffle one day at a soccer game, which placed him on a hitlist with a local gang. He had been working as a day laborer here and there, but the drought meant there was less work, and it was hard to find work that didn’t require crossing into rival gang territory. If he did, he would be killed. So he took his daughter north to the United States, where border patrol agents separated them for two months, locking them up in different states and with zero contact. Violence and environmental degradation are inextricably linked, and both lead to mass migration. An unstable planet and ecosystem lends itself to an unstable society, to divisions, to economic insecurity, to human brutality. When someone’s home becomes less and less livable, they move elsewhere. Wouldn’t each and every one of us do the same? This week, the New Yorker’s Jonathan Blitzer published a series of pieces about the impacts of climate change in the Guatemalan highlands, where farmers are struggling to grow crops that they have been farming there for centuries. “In most of the western highlands,” Blitzer wrote, “the question is no longer whether someone will emigrate but when.” A few years ago, I reported from Guatemala’s dry corridor, several hours away from where Blitzer was reporting, where persistent drought had decimated the region’s agriculture, and particularly the coffee crop, on which roughly 90% of local farmers relied. It was a wildly different landscape from the one Blitzer described, but it faced the same problem: if you live in an agricultural zone, come from a long line of farmers and can’t reliably harvest your crops any more, what else is there to do but leave? It’s abundantly clear that climate change is a driver of migration to the US – we have the data, we have the facts, we have the human stories. Still, the Trump administration has done nothing to intervene in this root cause. In fact, the US government has systematically denied the existence of climate change, rolled back domestic regulations that would mitigate US carbon emissions and thumbed its nose at international attempts – such as the Paris accords – to curb global warming. Now, in his latest futile, small-minded and cruel attempt to cut migration off at the neck (something we know is not possible – an unhealthy societal dynamic must be addressed at the root, just like with a struggling tree or crop), Donald Trump announced last week that he would cut all foreign aid to the northern triangle. It’s a punitive move, and one that – just like building a wall, separating families, locking people up indefinitely, and refusing asylum seekers entry across the border – is a petty intimidation tactic that will do nothing to actually curb forced migration. In fact, cutting aid to Central America will do quite the opposite, for as much waste and imperfections as there are in international aid, aid in Central America has been vital for creating community safety programs, job skills development and government accountability standards. It has also helped with drought mitigation and supporting climate-resilient agricultural practices. In other words, foreign aid to Central America – a place unduly hit by climate change – is supporting the kind of climate change resiliency that will keep people from having to leave in the first place. Because people really don’t want to leave their homes for the vast uncertainty of another land, particularly when that land proves itself again and again to be hostile to migrants’ very existence. People don’t want to be raped along the route north, or die in the desert, or have their child ripped away from them by the border patrol, or be locked up indefinitely without legal counsel, without adequate medical care, with no idea what will happen to them and when. Who would risk this if things were OK back home? People like Arnovis leave because they feel like they have to. Eventually Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials convinced Arnovis to sign deportation papers with the promise that, if he did, he would be reunited with his daughter and returned to El Salvador. But he was shooed on to a plane back home without her. It took a tremendous amount of advocacy, but, after months locked up in the US, she, too was returned home. They are now back together, which is a good thing, but the fundamental problem hasn’t changed: he can’t find work. His society is ill. So is the planet, and the land and sea all around him. Today, there are 64 million forced migrants around the world, more than ever before. They are fleeing war, persecution, disaster and, yes, climate change. The UN estimates that by 2050, there will be 200 million people forcibly displaced from their homes due to climate change alone. Migration is a natural human phenomenon and, many argue, should be a fundamental right, but forced migration – being run out of home against one’s will and with threat to one’s life – is not natural at all. Today, whether we choose to see it or not, climate change is one of the largest drivers of migration, and will continue to be for years to come – unless we do something about it. If we want people to be able to stay in their homes, we have to tackle the issue of our changing global climate, and we have to do it fast."
