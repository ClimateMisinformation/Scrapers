"More than a billion tonnes of potentially toxic, bleach-like waste is produced and piled in landfills every year, with often devastating effects. And yet most people haven’t even heard of these “alkaline wastes”. We want to change this. Our research has identified nearly two billion tonnes of alkaline residues that are produced in the world each year, most of which can contaminate groundwater and rivers if not proper managed. We should be doing much more about the problem – these wastes can even be put to good use. Alkaline waste can be solid or sludgy. It mostly involves slags, ashes or muds formed as a byproduct of steel, aluminium or coal power plants, waste incineration or the construction industry. All these wastes are different, but what they have in common is that they rapidly create bleach-like solutions when they meet rainwater.   Often it’s simply stored in piles or sent to landfill. This isn’t safe. The waste can form toxic dust that blows into the atmosphere, while rain that lands on top can filter through, picking up toxic chemicals and producing caustic “leachates” that can flow out into rivers and groundwater. Alkaline leachates have a toxic effect on aquatic life (we wouldn’t want to swim through bleach, either). It raises the water pH and metal concentrations, and consumes oxygen. Once this stuff has been produced it’s hard to stop. Steel mills can be a source of alkaline leachates even 30 years or more after closure. Water with pH higher than 12 (somewhere between soapy water and bleach) has now leaked from one chromite waste tip for more than 100 years. It’s hard to determine the exact link between contamination and problems for plants and animals, but alkaline waste can clearly cause harm. Studies have found ash from coal plants has killed geese and made tree swallows smaller and less fertile. Perhaps the most severe case of alkaline waste poisoning happened in 2010, when a dam failed at an aluminium refinery in Ajka, Hungary. This released a million cubic metres of “red mud”, a byproduct of aluminium production with a pH level of around 13 in this case – similar to oven cleaner. The red mud inundated 1,000 acres of agricultural and urban land and was transported more than 120km down the Marcal river to the Danube, “extinguishing” all life in the tributary. The flood drowned ten people and left many more with severe chemical burns. We can treat alkaline leachates through aeration or by adding acid to neutralise it but this is expensive. We need sustainable alternatives. One promising proposal involves constructing wetlands in and around polluted sites, where the marshy ground, the plants and the associated microorganisms restrict the contamination.  Many attempts have been made to find ways of reusing these wastes but none of them are practical enough to stop landfill disposal. Alkaline wastes have been used in road construction, concrete, cement and plasterboard, for example.  Adding these wastes to the soil can reduce acidity, so usage as phosphate fertiliser is also common, while labs are testing whether it can be used in wastewater treatment. It can even help the fight against climate change. Chemicals in the wastes such as calcium and magnesium react with carbon dioxide and remove it from the atmosphere, storing it as a stable mineral. This form of carbon sequestration essentially mimics natural weathering processes and could be a safe and permanent storage option since only acid or extreme temperatures of 900°C or more can release this CO2. It could even help offset some of the emissions from the energy-intensive industries that create alkaline wastes in the first place. In fact, if all materials that contain silica (cement, construction and demolition wastes, slag, ash and combustion products) were used for sequestration they could take 697-1,218 megatonnes of  CO2 out of the atmosphere each year.  Steel slags alone could capture 170 megatonnes per year, while the red mud stored worldwide could capture 572 megatonnes. If all the red mud produced in a year was carbonated, 3–4% of the aluminium industry’s global CO2 emissions could be captured. Red mud has already sequestered 100 megatonnes of CO2 worldwide from the late 19th century to 2008 – without the industry even trying. Boosting this number could allow for some real downward pressure on its emissions. Recent studies have shown alkaline wastes also contain large quantities of metals we would like to recover for recycling. Some are critical in terms of supply, or essential to new green technologies. For example vanadium, used in offshore wind turbines, lithium and cobalt for vehicle fuel cells, and rare earth elements crucial for solar power systems.  The obvious solution: try to unify the needs of resource recovery and remediation, by developing treatment methods for alkaline leachates that recover critical elements soluble at high pH, suppress dust production, increase carbon sequestration and treat the pollution caused.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Germany-based International Business Forum for Regenerative Energies (IWR) here writes that the country will fail to reach its 2020 climate targets, despite tens of billions of euros invested in green energies such as wind and solar, and all its incessant green pontification.
An expert commission appointed by the government recently released its 5th Monitoring Report on the Energiewende (transition to renewable energies), which examined the progress being made by the German government.
Result: There has been no progress. Failure.
Germany had given itself the target of reducing CO2 emissions 40% by 2020 compared to levels in 1990 (just before the shutdown of East Germany’s rundown, energy-inefficient, communist-planned economy).

Chart source: UBA Umweltbundesamt (Federal Office of the Environment). 
According to the 170-page Monitoring Report, Germany had seen a CO2 savings of 27.2% as of 2015. But the commission, made up of four experts, sees current German efforts as totally inadequate if it wishes to reach the 40% mark by 2020.
Indeed German CO2 emission reductions have stalled over the last 7 years (see chart above), despite 3 warmer than normal winters.

The country’s CO2 emissions in fact rose by 1% in 2015.
The commission concludes that there’s “a great need to act” if Germany wishes to reach its target. However, the recent action by the German government in fact appears to be just the opposite. Efforts to cut back on efforts to expand wind and solar power recently have been watered down. Moreover a surge of nearly a million refugees will only serve to boost demand for energy.
Overall the commission sees only a very low probability, near zero, of the country in fact reaching the target.
The IWR writes that the result “is no surprise” and that it already had been expected back in 2013. According to IWR Director Dr. Norbert Allnoch:
Achieving the climate targets by 2020 back then was already an illusion.”
Allnoch criticizes that he sees no way of reaching the targets. In a nutshell the German government is simply not doing anywhere near enough, and that it is really not anywhere near as serious about the endeavor as the country likes to have others believe it is.
Germany obviously has no intentions of fulfilling the Paris Agreement, and that all its talk about cutting greenhouse gas emissions is mostly bluff and moral grandstanding.
True the country has spent tens of billions of euros in its effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but as the last 7 years show, there’s been no result. This is probably very discouraging and painful to accept — and quite embarrassing.

"The city of Paris was recently on high flood alert after a deluge of rain. Parisians looked on with increasing concern as the River Seine continued to rise, the water levels creeping up the legs of the Zouave statue on the Pont d’Alma bridge in central Paris, which has served as an unofficial flood gauge since the devastating 1910 floods in the city. Thankfully, the immediate threat to Paris appears to be receding, although many other towns along the Seine are experiencing widespread flooding.  This year’s particularly severe flooding on the Seine demonstrates how complex the relationship between rainfall and flooding is. It also harks back to a critical development in the history of flood hydrology and the water cycle: because it was the Seine’s rise and fall, in response to heavy rain, that inspired one of the great breakthroughs in hydrology. In the late 17th century, a French scholar called Pierre Perrault estimated the flow of water in a tributary of the River Seine and compared it to rainfall across the river’s catchment area. In doing so, he demonstrated for the first time that rainfall was all you needed to account for the flow of water in large rivers. His revolutionary work “De l’origine des fontaines” was published in 1674. Although no specific accounts exist, it is not hard to imagine Perrault taking inspiration from the spectacle of the Seine in Paris rising up the piers of its bridges in response to rainfall, as we’ve witnessed lately. This link between rainfall and river flow in Paris was confirmed in 1686 by the French physicist Edme Mariotte, who quantitatively measured the velocity in the Seine near the Pont Royal by observing the passage of boats and debris on the current. It is difficult to overstate how revolutionary the ideas of Perrault and Mariotte were. When Perrault published his book, the ancient Greek theory of the four essential elements (earth, air, fire and water) still dominated. This stated that everything was composed of a mix of these elements, with the relative proportions included in an object imbuing it with its specific characteristics.  The accepted theory of river flow, meanwhile, was that sea water entered underground caverns, where it evaporated with the heat of the earth and fed springs, feeding into rivers once again. Rainfall was seen as insufficient to provide the water needed to drive the flow of great rivers. Floods were seen as something unpredictable like earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, out of human control and not connected to processes within river catchments. Indeed, it has been argued there were no further substantial advances in quantitative hydrology in the century after Perrault and Mariotte. As well as discovering the link between rainfall and flooding, Perrault also introduced the idea of infiltration (precipitation soaking into the soil), baseflow (infiltration driven groundwater flow which maintains the river flow in the absence of rainfall), temporary storage of flood water on floodplains, bank storage, and laid the foundations for what would subsequently be formulated as the hydrological cycle. Because we now accept the link between rainfall and river flow as a matter of course, the link to flooding can appear deceptively simple. But the current flood event on the Seine illustrates how record rainfall doesn’t necessarily lead to record flooding.  This winter has seen double the normal rainfall for January, and the combined December and January rainfall has set a 50-year record.  When rainfall occurs over a prolonged period of time it saturates the land and causes future rainfall to transfer much more quickly into the river network. River catchments can be thought of as having a sort of “memory”, in which the effects of preceding events subtly change how the river system will respond to future ones. And so in the case of flooding, the sequencing and magnitude of rainfall events is often more important than absolute volumes.  It would appear that although this winter has been very wet, and has reportedly made the water levels in the Seine rise very quickly following storms, there has not yet been a late winter rain storm of sufficient size to cause large flooding in Paris. The current concern would be a repeat of the pattern from the record 1910 floods in Paris. In early 1910, the catchment of the River Seine was already saturated following heavy rainfall the preceding December. The River Seine had risen following this rainfall before dropping again, leading people to believe the threat of flooding was over. But in January there followed a large, prolonged rainfall event in the waterlogged upper catchment; this water quickly transferred into the river system and led to widespread flooding in Paris. It was not the magnitude of the rainfall event that led to this record flooding in Paris, rather it was the sequencing and timing of the rainfall within the context of a wet winter. With the immediate flood risk receding this year, there remains a danger that heavy rainfall in the next few weeks could lead to a rapid response and rise in river levels in the Seine, both in Paris and elsewhere. And so having spent the last few weeks nervously watching the Seine, the people of Paris will now be casting their eyes to the sky and hoping for a relatively dry February."
"Take a trip around Lantau island in Hong Kong and you might see something surprising: a pod of pink dolphins. Technically, they’re known as Chinese or Hong Kong white dolphins and are a variety of the Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins or Sousa chinensis of South-East Asia and Australia. Similar in size to the more common bottlenose variety, the Chinese dolphins are born black and then gradually change colour to grey and then white as they get older. But sometimes the adults appear a bright shade of pink. This is due to the presence of blood vessels located very close to the skin that help the animal stay cool. Like all dolphins, they have a layer of blubber to help them keep warm in the ocean. But when they are in warm tropical waters they actually need to lose heat by passing blood through the surface blood vessels. So when they get hot this cooling mechanism kicks in and they appear pink – just like us with flushed cheeks after exercise on a hot day. Pink dolphins are also found in the Amazon river in South America. They are known as boto dolphins, and are so coloured for the same reason. However, boto adults become more pink over time as their skin is rubbed away. For this reason males are pinker than females because they are more frequently aggressive with one another, basically exposing the blood vessels as time goes on. The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is listed in the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species as having an unfavourable conservation status. Research in the late 1990s found only a small population of around 200 remaining in the waters around Hong Kong and conservationists say there are now even fewer. They tend to stay in the inshore waters and are not migratory, limiting themselves to an area of around 100km2. This means they are vulnerable to the full range of human activities that take place around Hong Kong, which is one of the busiest ports in the world. As well as being caught in fishing nets and struck by ships, they are also disturbed by the noise from shipping and marine construction, which interferes with their communication, hunting and causes hearing damage. Recently, the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society warned that plans to expand the city’s island airport and build a bridge to nearby Macau could drive the population away completely. They are also vulnerable to pollutants from sewage and industry that are discharged into the area’s rivers and coastal waters. We judge the health of UK seaside bathing waters by the concentration of faecal coliform bacteria. We consider taking in just 200 coliforms on a single occasion unacceptable, yet the Hong Kong dolphins are ingesting over 100 times that amount daily. In Hong Kong, water dredging and the disposal of contaminated sediments is releasing further contaminants. Mercury, organochlorine, pesticide, flame retardant and butyltin (now banned from use in antifouling paint) concentrations in Hong Kong dolphin tissues have been found to be much higher than from populations further afield. With this in mind it’s difficult to be optimistic about the future of these pink dolphins. Sadly, they may follow the fate of the baiji, the Chinese Yantze river dolphin, which was declared functionally extinct following dam-building, ship collisions and pollution."
"There is one thing, still, that we all agree on. Trees. Everybody loves trees. In theory, anyway. So long as the trees don’t interfere with a prime view, or foundations, or a luxury housing development, like the ancient – but inconvenient – Bethnal Green mulberry in London, which Crest Nicholson got permission to dig up. Or the massacred Sheffield planes. Or the 30 Thameside trees that Boris Johnson and Joanna Lumley hoped to fell, as twin visionaries of the Garden Bridge (failed, at a public cost of £43m). But the collective dendrophilia means that imperilled trees, like tragic puppies and kittens, make headlines. As the Daily Mail has illustrated, a demonstrable affection for trees does more than bring different factions together, it advertises, on the part of the tree enthusiasts – in this case the Rothermeres – a reverence for nature and the planet that does not, even from the creatives who bring us Mail Online, look instantly risible. The organisation is running an inspirational “tree angel” campaign, urging readers to help plant a million more trees, with a view to beautification and addressing climate change: “Britain is committed to becoming a ‘net zero’ emitter of greenhouse gases by 2050 – and to do this we will need to plant millions more trees.”  The good news continues. Celebrities and influencers, including Lumley, queue up to commend the Mail and proclaim their own love of trees. “Trees are our ancestors and protectors,” said Ms Lumley, which must gladden the trees’ hearts. Better one sinner that repenteth. Prince Charles is another supportive name, taking time between pointless flights and shuttling between his seven or so homes, to endorse a scheme that represents a “major opportunity”, he says “to help lock up the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and prevent global warming”. Perhaps more persuasively, Clive Anderson, president of the Woodland Trust, has congratulated the paper on its lurch into planet-saving: “I am all for trees.” Before the election, the prime minister, having left the Channel 4 climate debate to a more capable ice block, found time to assure Mail readers that their tree planting would be “a vital part of our response to climate change”. And especially vital for the party – endorsed by the Mail – that is committed to spending £28.8bn on road-building: ie encouraging, not restricting, transport emissions. Following the Conservative victory, no tree angel need worry about frequent-flying levies, or public transport nudges, or disincentives on acquiring a new, pay-later, SUV that emits a quarter more CO2 than a medium-sized car. Last week, financing packages were cited as one reason that sports utility vehicles outsell electric cars in the UK by 37 to one, and threaten our ability to fulfil EU emissions targets. Globally, SUVs are the second biggest cause (after power) of the rise in CO2 emissions. The beauty of organised tree planting as a demonstration of environmental concern is its essential conservatism. No behavioural changes are involved. People will still let your thuggish SUV out at city junctions. Actually, planting trees for the planet is the probably the closest most of us will ever come to feeling like the frequent flier and busy package holiday escort Stanley Johnson. We may not be able to spell Pinocchio or spawn a Boris, but with one sapling and a trowel we can experience what it is to call oneself a committed conservationist without sacrificing anything larger than a plastic straw. Learn from Stanley. After sucking up to some Extinction Rebellion protesters, the supposed conservationist said he saw no need to stop flying. Ever. “I justify my flying pretty often on the basis I’m going there to do some speech about the environmental problems or write about the animals.” Admirers of Stanley could argue that his shamelessness is no worse than Prince Charles’s serial hypocrisies, and may be more honest than claiming, as celebrities repeatedly do, that their emissions have been rendered harmless by tree planting or some other mysteriously purifying scheme. Long since George Monbiot tellingly compared offsetting with the medieval sale of indulgences, their popularity as a flygskam cure seems undimmed, including among the most prominently agonised. The model Bella Hadid confides, for instance, that she has recently donated 600 trees to obliterate three months’ worth of flying. Paul McCartney offsets. So does EasyJet. Greenpeace described the airline’s scheme as “jumbo-sized greenwash”. It’s not clear that offsetting, even if the relevant projects do not fail, is as effective in reducing aviation emissions as frequent flyer levies would be, or even social pressure to fly less. Why would the proposal that emissions can be magicked away by new trees not be used to validate yet more flying and more complacency about industry emissions, neutered and otherwise? The Mail’s angel campaign, basically a seasonal offsetting special, looks similarly unlikely to threaten the status quo, especially from a paper that remains a safe space in which to argue (with supporting quotes from the coal baron Matt Ridley) that global warming could be “a boon”. The campaign’s lead endorser, the prime minister, produced the election’s weakest manifesto on the climate crisis. In fact, it’s difficult to imagine a conservation campaign with more appeal to phony or reluctant environmentalists. Much as soaring sales of SUVs make “a mockery” of the push for electric cars, according to the UK Energy Research Centre’s Prof Jillian Anable, inaction or lack of seriousness on their CO2 emissions exposes the limitations of tree planting. “We have been sleepwalking into the [SUV] issue,” she said. “We must start to phase out the most polluting vehicles immediately.” That said, all credit to the Mail, formerly one of the world’s least tree-friendly communities, for its model exercise in greenwashing. If it leads to less in-house denigration of Greta Thunberg – “a somewhat distressed kid having a textbook teenage strop” (Sarah Vine) – so much the better. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate records from ice cores indicate that abrupt, global-scale warming events with amplitudes of up to 10°C (in the Greenland region) were reached within as little as 50 years dozens of times during the roughly 100,000 years between the last interglacial (~120,000 years ago) and the current interglacial period (11,700 years ago to present).  That’s equivalent to a rate of up to 2.0°C per decade of “natural” global warming.  CO2 concentrations remained flat and low (~180 parts per million) throughout these warming (and cooling) periods, commonly referred to as Dansgaard-Oeschger events.  Schmidt and Hertzberg (2011) provide a summary and (modified) illustration of what these abrupt climatic shifts affecting the “Earth’s climate system” may have looked like.
Schmidt and Hertzberg, 2011
“Unlike the relatively stable climate Earth has experienced over the last 10,000 years, Earth’s climate system underwent a series of abrupt oscillations and reorganizations during the last ice age between 18,000 and 80,000 years ago (Dansgaard 1984, Bond et al. 1997, 1999). …There are twenty-five of these distinct warming-cooling oscillations (Dansgaard 1984) which are now commonly referred to as Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, or D-O cycles. One of the most surprising findings was that the shifts from cold stadials to the warm interstadial intervals occurred in a matter of decades, with air temperatures over Greenland rapidly warming 8 to 15°C (Huber et al. 2006). Furthermore, the cooling occurred much more gradually, giving these events a saw-tooth shape in climate records from most of the Northern Hemisphere.”

In contrast to these abrupt and profound warming events in the paleoclimate record, the IPCC indicated in their 5th report (2013) that the surface temperature of the Earth rose by 0.78°C between 1850 and 2012.   That’s a warming rate of a little less than 0.05°C per decade.
IPCC AR5 (2013):
“The total [global temperature] increase between the average of the 1850–1900 period and the 2003–2012 period is 0.78 °C, based on the single longest dataset available.”
Of course, this 1850-2012 warming period (0.78°C in 160+ years) occurred while CO2 concentrations rose from 280 parts per million (ppm) to nearly 400 ppm.
Putting these records together, it can therefore be concluded that global-scale warming and cooling events occur naturally at rates and amplitudes several times greater (multiple degrees per decade) than what has occurred since 1850 (<0.05°C per decade), and thus climate change in the modern period does not even come close to falling out of the range of what can and does occur naturally.  Also, it can be concluded that CO2 concentration changes have historically not been well correlated with abrupt temperature changes either in the paleoclimate record nor during significant portions of the modern period.
Below there are 8 scientific papers published in 2016 referencing these abrupt climate changes, some of which indicate a “global footprint” or “global signature” or “global distribution” of these warming and cooling events.
Hewitt et al., 2016
“Many northern hemisphere climate records, particularly those from around the North Atlantic, show a series of rapid climate changes that recurred on centennial to millennial timescales throughout most of the last glacial period. These Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) sequences are observed most prominently in Greenland ice cores, although they have a global signature, including an out of phase Antarctic signal. They consist of warming jumps of order 10°C, occurring in typically 40 years, followed generally by a slow cooling (Greenland Interstadial, GI) lasting between a few centuries and a few millennia, and then a final rapid temperature drop into a cold Greenland Stadial (GS) that lasts for a similar period. … [S]teady changes in ice-sheet runoff, driven by the AMOC, lead to a naturally arising oscillator, in which the rapid warmings come about because the Arctic Ocean is starved of freshwater. The changing size of the ice sheets would have affected the magnitude and extent of runoff, and we suggest that this could provide a simple explanation for the absence of the events during interglacials and around the time of glacial maxima.”
Rasmussen et al., 2016

Press release (sciencedaily): “Extreme climate changes in the past Ice core records show that Greenland went through 25 extreme and abrupt climate changes during the last ice age some 20,000 to 70,000 years ago. In less than 50 years the air temperatures over Greenland could increase by 10 to 15 °C. However the warm periods were short; within a few centuries the frigid temperatures of the ice age returned. That kind of climate change would have been catastrophic for us today.  Ice core records from Antarctica also show climate changes in the same period, but they are more gradual, with less severe temperature swings.”
Jensen et al., 2016
“Proxy data suggests a large variability in the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice cover during the Dansgaard Oeschger (DO) events of the last glacial. However, the mechanisms behind these changes are still debated. … Based on our analysis, we suggest that the variability of the subpolar gyre during the analyzed DO event can be explained by internal variability of the climate system alone. Further research is needed to explain whether the lacking amplitude in the Nordic Seas is due to the model deficiencies or if external forcing or some feedback mechanisms could give rise to larger SST variability.”
Agosta and Compagnucci, 2016
“The climate in the North Atlantic Ocean during the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) —roughly between 80,000 years before present (B.P.) and 20,000 years B.P., within the last glacial period—is characterized by great instability, with opposing climate transitions including at least six colder Heinrich (H) events and fourteen warmer Dansgaard–Oeschger (D-O) events. … The various theories on the causes include factors internal to the dynamics of ice sheets, and external factors such as changes in the solar flux and changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The latter is the most robust hypothesis. At certain times, these ice sheets released large amounts of freshwater into the North Atlantic Ocean . Heinrich events are an extreme example of this, when the Laurentide ice sheet disgorged excessively large amounts of freshwater into the Labrador Sea in the form of icebergs. These freshwater dumps reduced ocean salinity enough to slow down deep-water formation and AMOC. Since AMOC plays an important role in transporting heat northward, a slowdown would cause the North Atlantic Ocean to cool. Later, as the addition of freshwater decreased, ocean salinity and deep-water formation increased and climate conditions recovered. During the D-O events, the high-latitude warming occurred abruptly (probably in decades to centuries), reaching temperatures close to interglacial conditions. Even though H and D-O events seemed to have been initiated in the North Atlantic Ocean, they had a global footprint. Global climate anomalies were consistent with a slowdown of AMOC and reduced ocean heat transport into the northern high latitudes.”
Olsen, 2016
“The most frequent abrupt stadial/interstadial changes retained from the marine sediments are known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles, and appear every 1-2 kyr. These cycles are characterized by abrupt short-lived increase in temperatures (10 ± 5°C) followed by gradual cooling preceding the next rapid event. A second millennial scale feature detected in the sediments record is cooling events culminating significant iceberg discharges analogous to Heinrich events. Mechanisms triggering abrupt changes display uncertainties, but leading hypothesis is attributed to modifications in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and deep-water formation initiated by freshwater input.”
Mayewski, 2016
“The demonstration using Greenland ice cores that abrupt shifts in climate, Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, existed during the last glacial period has had a transformational impact on our understanding of climate change in the naturally forced world. The demonstration that D-O events are globally distributed and that they operated during previous glacial periods has led to extensive research into the relative hemispheric timing and causes of these events. The emergence of civilization during our current interglacial, the Holocene, has been attributed to the “relative climate quiescence” of this period relative to the massive, abrupt shifts in climate that characterized glacial periods in the form of D-O events.”
Bogotá-A et al., 2016
“We reconstructed upper forest line (UFL) positions between ~2000 and ~3400 m elevation and the most abrupt temperature shifts ranged up to 10 °C/100 yr at Terminations II and III. Regional vegetation change is mainly driven by eccentricity (100 kyr) and obliquity (41 kyr) cycles, while changes in local aquatic vegetation show variability in the obliquity and precession (21 kyr) bands. Millennial-scale climate variability reflecting Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) climate cycles in the upper part of the record, continues in this penultimate intergalcial–glacial cycle strongly suggesting that this variability has a persistent character in Pleistocene vegetation and climate dynamics.”
Shao and Ditlevsen, 2016
“The glacial climate is dominated by the strong multi-millennial Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) events influencing the long-time correlation. However, by separately analysing the last glacial maximum lacking DO events, here we find the same scaling for that period as for the full glacial period. The unbroken scaling thus indicates that the DO events are part of the natural variability and not externally triggered.”

"Is Prince Charles right to connect climate change to Syrian conflict and terrorism? Yes and No. In an interview with Sky News, recorded before the Paris terror attacks, Prince Charles suggested there was a direct link between climate change, the Syrian conflict and, ultimately, terrorism. The heir to the British throne said there was: Very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria was a drought that lasted for about five or six years, which meant that huge numbers of people in the end had to leave the land because water ran out, their crops failed and so on. And increasingly they came into the cities, already full of Iraqi refugees. And this combined created a very difficult situation.  He then called on the public to deal with the problem causing it: climate change “because the conflict very often comes from movement of people as a result of not being able to survive”. For anyone taking a systemic view of the world, it seems self-evident that droughts can have significant social and economic impacts on communities and entire countries, potentially leading to conflict. As historian Mike Davis has argued, severe weather events have contributed to the shaping of the entire modern world system. So, when Britain’s right-wing press portrays Charles’ link between climate change and conflict as “controversial”, then it seems to be another example of climate sceptics burying their heads in the sand, not wanting to face up to the realities of the 21st century. There is indeed significant evidence that the 2007−2010 drought in Syria was made worse by climate change. A study in the journal PNAS found it caused “widespread crop failure and a mass migration of farming families to urban centers”. The authors, researchers at Columbia and the University of California, analysed century-long trends in precipitation, temperature, and sea-level pressure in the region, and concluded that the drought was a “consequence of human interference with the climate system”. Of course, conflict always has multiple causes, but climate change, they argued, featured strongly in the Syrian case. Johan Rockström, the executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and lead author of the influential planetary boundaries model, recently confirmed this link between climate change and Syria’s civil war and other civil unrest, making his case for the world to take urgent action on cutting carbon emissions. This is not something radical to say, but obvious. As Prince Charles also mentioned in his interview, even the “Pentagon has actually started to pay attention to this”. In a report released earlier this year, the US Department of Defense did indeed say that: Global climate change will aggravate problems such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership and weak political institutions that threaten stability in a number of countries. But this is precisely where the problem with Charles’s argument begins. When Charles says that Syrian climate migrants came into cities “already full of Iraqi refugees”, then he should also acknowledge that the UK government – as well as the Pentagon of course – played a vital role in creating the refugee crisis in the Middle East that has existed ever since the Iraq invasion in 2003. So if we take a systemic view of the current Syrian civil war, then it is not enough to only look for environmental root causes. We equally need to look at the historical trajectories that have created unprecedented socio-ecological tensions in the Middle East region for centuries. For example, we should acknowledge the role the Middle East has played in the UK’s and US’s energy security, quenching a thirst for cheap oil throughout the 20th century. The West’s mingling in Middle Eastern politics, often directly or indirectly involving armed conflict and economic interests, is one of the root causes of the current Syrian tragedy. It is also important to not simply naturalise drought. Droughts have always existed in humanity’s history, and people have developed all sorts of ingenious ways of coping with little water. Droughts are not just made worse by climate change, but also by the way scarce water resources are managed, increasingly for profit. As Lyla Mehta has argued, what is important is to understand people’s basic capabilities when using water, as well as questions of politics, equity and justice. Yes, water shortages are already made worse by climate change, but equally let’s consider the political economy of water, which has played a significant role in the Middle East for many decades. So, Charles is right to point to the need to see the root causes of the Syrian conflict. Yes, climate change is an important factor, which will only get worse if the world’s leaders do not take radical action at the climate summit in Paris. But let’s not forget history. The current crisis has to be seen in the context of centuries of wars and conflict, often involving vested political and economic interests of the West. Finger pointing at climate change by environmentalists, whether by Prince Charles or Johan Rockström, is at best simplistic. At worst it is a wilful misrepresentation of the historical realities and concrete political and economic relations that lead to conflict."

Over the past weeks NTZ has assisted in a comprehensive analysis of a large body of climate science literature. At this point I can only say that the results have one climate science’s central claims going down in flames.
Tomorrow the results of that analysis will be published and once again it will reveal science that was shoddily, sloppily and deceptively done, and thus produced a totally erroneous conclusion.
It involves a higher profile actor in climate science.
As we all know climate science over the years has been filled with nutty predictions, bogus claims and outright dubious science. Over the years the field has been hopelessly politicized – taken over and corrupted by activists and bureaucrats who seem to stop at nothing to twist and warp the science to get the results they want to see, and those they feel the public only should see.
One example is the infamous hockey stick chart by Mann et al, 1998, which through the tenacious scrutiny of Steven McIntyre, was shown to be flawed and was later (stubbornly) dismissed by the scientitfic community. Another shown to be flawed is the 2013 Cook et al “97% consensus” paper.
Tomorrow another will be revealed to be of the same dismal quality, and it involves one author who has long been known for bold stuff.
Stay tuned!

"Yes, it’s dark. Darker, arguably, than at any point since the second world war. We have a government not of conservatives but of the radical right, who will now seek to smash the remaining restraints on capital and those who accumulate it. They will take their sledgehammers to our public services and our public protections. They cheated and lied to assist their victory; they will cheat and lie even more to implement their programme. They are led by a man who has expressed overtly racist views, who won’t hesitate to stir up bigotry and xenophobia whenever he runs into trouble, scapegoating immigrants, Muslims, Romany Gypsies and Travellers, the poor and the weak. They will revel in outrage and affront, using every attack on common decency to normalise the unacceptable. This government has no vision for the country, only a vision for the oligarchs to whom it is bound, onshore and offshore.  So I don’t want to minimise the scale and horror of what we face. But documenting it is one task; the other is resisting it. Here, roughly and briefly, is an outline of how we might begin. I am as tired and shocked and frazzled as you are, so please forgive me if I have missed some essential elements. First, we must park the recriminations and blame. We need to be fully occupied fighting the government and its backers, not fighting each other. Solidarity is going to be crucial over the coming months. We should seek, wherever possible, to put loyalty to party and faction aside, and work on common resolutions to a crisis afflicting everyone who wants a kinder, fairer, greener nation. All the progressive manifestos I’ve read – Labour, Green, SNP, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru – contain some excellent proposals. Let’s extract the best of them, and ideas from many other sources, and build an alliance around them. There will be differences, of course. But there will also be positions that almost everyone who believes in justice can accept. I believe we need to knit these proposals into the crucial missing element in modern progressive politics: a restoration story. A powerful new narrative is the vehicle for all political transformations. While all the progressive parties in the UK have proposed good policies, none of them have told a story that exactly fits the successful narrative template. Let’s work together to craft the story of change. We should use the new story, and the proposals this narrative vehicle carries, to build mass resistance movements, taking inspiration from – and building on – highly effective mobilisations such as the youth climate strikes. We will draw strength from the movements in other nations, and support them in turn. A major part of this resistance, I believe, must be the reclamation of a culture of public learning. Acquiring useful knowledge requires determined study. Yet we have lost the habit of rigorous learning in adulthood, once seen as crucial to social justice. This makes us vulnerable to every charlatan who stands for election, and every lie they amplify through the billionaire press and social media. Those who govern us would love to keep us in ignorance. When they deride “elites”, they don’t mean people like themselves – the rich and powerful. They mean teachers and intellectuals. They are creating an anti-intellectual culture, to make people easier to manipulate. Let’s reinvigorate the workers’ education movements. Let’s restore a rich public culture of intellectual self-improvement, open to everyone. Knowledge is the most powerful tool in politics. We must expose every lie, every trick this government will play, using social media as effectively as possible. We must use every available tool to investigate its financial relationships, interests and strategies. We should use the courts to sue and prosecute malfeasance whenever we can. But while all this is happening, more and more people will fall through the cracks. I recognise that charity is no substitute for justice, and we can never fully compensate for the failures of the state. Even so, we must enhance the support and giving networks for the people this government will neglect or attack. No one should have to face the coming onslaught alone. We will create, to the greatest extent possible, a resistance economy. This means local cooperative networks of mutual support, which circulate social and material wealth within the community. The astonishing work of Participatory City, with Barking and Dagenham council in London, shows us one way of doing this. We will find each other and ourselves through volunteering, which provides the most powerful known defence against loneliness and alienation, helps support the people this government will abandon, and can defend and rebuild the living world. We will throw everything we have into defending our public services – especially the NHS – from the government’s attempts to degrade or destroy them. There will be many public service failures over the coming years, as a result of cuts and “restructuring”. Let’s remember where blame for these failures will lie: not with the massively stressed and overloaded practitioners, but with those who made their jobs impossible. The long-standing strategy of governments such as this is to degrade these services until we become exasperated with them, whereupon, lacking public support, they can be broken up and privatised. Don’t fall for it. Defend the overworked heroes who keep them afloat. No one person should attempt all these things. We will divide up the tasks, but always in the knowledge that we’re working together, with mutual support through the darkest of times. Love and courage to you all. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"Rural Fire Service members have been warned about crowdfunding for protective masks “without the appropriate authority” amid growing concern about resourcing levels of the state’s firefighting volunteers. As fire crews battle more than 100 blazes across New South Wales, volunteers have been warned by the organisation’s leadership against using social media to crowdfund for equipment.  In an operational memo sent to brigade leaders on Wednesday, RFS deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said the organisation’s leadership was “concerned” that crowdfunding campaigns were being set up “without the appropriate authority”. “NSW RFS firefighters are provided all necessary tools and equipment to undertake their work. This includes fire appliances and associated hoses, nozzles and all personal protection equipment including respiratory protection,” Rogers wrote in the memo. “The cause promoted through some of these fundraising efforts has been to purchase P3 masks. “The NSW RFS provides disposable P2 fire resistant masks to members. This provides a practical solution for managing exposure to bush fire smoke, when taking into account other risks.” Several firefighting crews across the state have begun using crowdfunding sources and social media sites such as Facebook to appeal for funds to buy equipment. Copacabana on the NSW central coast and Ingleside in Sydney’s north both started grassroots campaigns appealing for funds to buy more face masks. This week Joe Arena, the treasurer of the Copacabana brigade, wrote on Facebook that the crew were “horrified” they have had to use RFS-issued P2-grade dust masks. He said the crew was “completely exhausted” from battling blazes in the Hawkesbury region of the central coast but that volunteers “have no choice but to go out and fight fire with what we have”. “In defence of the RFS, these are unprecedented conditions on a scale no one could have anticipated,” Arena wrote. That message has now been deleted and replaced with a thank you message from the brigade. It comes amid increasing concern about the resourcing of the volunteer firefighting force after a ferocious start to the bushfire season in which six people have been killed and more than 720 homes destroyed since last month. Much of the concern relates to the protective masks given to firefighters. The Rogers memo cited a 2018 guideline published by the Australian Fire and Emergency Services Council which found P2 masks “remains the most practical” option and that P3 masks provided an “equivalent” amount of protection. However, Rogers conceded that report “doesn’t take into consideration factors identified such as maintaining a face seal, breathing resistance and maintenance”. “For the service to consider changing any of its provided firefighting equipment and apparel, we would require a full and comprehensive scientific research and evaluation process,” he wrote. One RFS volunteer and physician, who asked to remain anonymous, told Guardian Australia that while well-fitted P2 masks were “somewhat effective”, there were “a lot of problems” using them in a fire ground where “getting a good fit is difficult”. “As an experienced physician I have been dismayed at the level of smoke inhalation that I have had to endure in the last few weeks,” he said. “The elastic straps frequently break. The mask becomes ineffective, and difficult to breathe through when wet, which is inevitable in a short time due to spray and sweat. Furthermore, fitting a separate mask and goggles over spectacles and then fitting a helmet leads to a tangle of straps, which is infuriating and potentially dangerous. “While that might be manageable with regular mask replacement in a two-hour incident, it is unsatisfactory during 12-hour shifts, much of it in heavy smoke. Fire and Rescue have much better respiratory protection for professional firefighters.” On Thursday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced an $11m funding injection into the country’s aerial firefighting forc, after previously having rejected calls for more help for firefighters, saying they “want to be out there”. But at a press conference later he said his office had raised the issue of crowdfunding with the NSW government, but seemed to dismiss social media fundraising as “misinformation”. “Of course, that type of equipment is provided by the state government, and I would expect that these sorts of needs would be met out of those resources and they should be,” he said. “I have noticed that over the course of these fires, and on social media, there have been lots of things … that are said and one of the issues that I’ve engaged with when I’ve gone into these incident response and control centres is what they often have to do is counter a lot of the misinformation and a lot of the commentary that has been provided on social media, which can cause unnecessary anxiety in communities.” But Guardian Australia has been contacted by several RFS volunteers who have expressed concerns about resourcing. Doug Rowley, captain of the Byron Bay RFS station, said his brigade was using donations to purchase facemarks with a two-stage filter because of shortages in supply. “The safety of our firefighters is paramount. The RFS will say the same thing: the first and major consideration in anything we do is the safety of our firefighters,” he said. “But it’s a moot point as to whether or not you’re getting the appropriate level of support from the RFS in terms of the consumable items. “I went to the store to get the facemarks … and there were none. This store is designed to service six brigades – it’s probably equivalent to three garages [in size]. It’s absurd.” Another RFS volunteer, Stewart, said standard issue equipment was often the “bare minimum”. “It meets the basic standards but it’s not the best,” he said. “I’ve spent nearly $2,000 alone on upgrading my PPE to a higher standard – helmets, better goggles, things like equipment pouches, head-mounted torches, which aren’t standard issue or where the standard issue is the most basic. “This is the heart of the issue: the people that volunteer and are in the RFS by their very nature just get on and do it, this-is-what-we-do kind of people.” The RFS has been contacted for comment."
"For almost all of our species’ 200,000-year history, man’s relationship with the Earth was no different to that of any other animal. All their energy was provided directly by the sun. Sunlight captured by plants using photosynthesis was converted into food and fuel. They ate roots, fruits and grains (and animals that also ate roots, fruits and grains) to provide their bodies with energy. They burned wood to keep themselves warm and fat to provide light at night. It was a successful strategy for survival and over tens of thousands of years the human population spread across six continents. However, locked in to this natural solar cycle, there was a limit to how many people their lifestyle could support, and the total number of inhabitants fluctuated below 500m depending on disease, wars and food supply. Then, 350 years ago, everything changed. We began to supplement our energy needs with coal and oil (humans had been using coal since pre-historic times but not on a large scale). This was still energy from sunshine, but this time millions of years old. In less than two centuries the human population exploded, doubling in size to 1 billion people. It has continued to grow ever since, but the rate of change has increased significantly. It took 100,000 years to reach the first billion people: today we are adding a further billion every 12 years. The result is a huge squeeze on all natural resources. Over the next two decades we will witness huge increases in demand for energy, food and water – a perfect storm. This is our fourth century of exponential population growth. In the past, humans coped by burning more fossilised sunshine in the form of coal, oil and gas, and expanding the amount of land under cultivation or using more artificially-produced fertiliser. But those solutions simply won’t work any more, not least because of anthropomorphic climate change caused by the release of carbon dioxide from the combustion of those fossil fuels. Our remaining stocks of fossilised sunshine are harder to get at and we are running out of fresh water and new places we can farm. A new study by colleagues of mine found that one-third of the world’s arable land has been lost to pollution and erosion over the past 40 years. Looking to the future, the key question is not simply: “How many people are there going to be?” but rather: “How are they all going to live?” In 2012, the Royal Society sought to address this issue in a publication called People and the Planet. This report’s frank conclusion was that in the developed and emerging economies, consumption has reached unsustainable levels and must be reduced immediately. It claims that the increase in population will “entail scaling back or radical transformation of damaging material consumption and emissions and the adoption of sustainable technologies. This change is critical to ensuring a sustainable future for all.” We have been here many times before. The whole of human history is essentially the story – albeit usually on a local scale – of population growth and increasing competition for resources. Since ancient times wars have been fought over land, water, food, fuel, metals and other natural capital, while many civilisations have also faced destruction as a result of disease, famine and shortages. Where we have overcome these challenges in the past it is invariably ingenuity and innovation that have provided the solution. And we will require those same qualities in abundance, because we have never had to tackle problems of this magnitude before, nor on a global scale. Achieving this goal is possible and realistic, but it will not be easy. It will not happen by accident and it will bring changes for all of us, both in the way that we live and in what we consume. It is without doubt the biggest challenge of our age. This statement is not intended to belittle the impact of climate change, but the repercussions of global warming will play out over decades; we have some time to adapt and respond to the consequences. In contrast we are already living with the results of explosive population growth: rising fuel and food prices, wars, immigration, famine, energy shortages and economic uncertainty. These issues affect us all today and all are a direct consequence of adding one million people to the population of the world every five days. Big problems usually require radical solutions, but there are genuine grounds for optimism. Fundamentally, we need to reconnect the global economy with the sun and live within our means, just as we did in the past. Capturing a single hour of the sunlight that reaches the Earth – a tiny fraction of our star’s output – would meet our global energy needs for a whole year. Harnessing the power of the sun will allow us to meet the increasing food and energy needs of the world’s population in the context of an uncertain climate and global environment change. Sustainable routes to food and energy security can be found, but time is of the essence and the clock is ticking."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s largest circulation daily, BILD, recently wrote an article titled: The Multibillion Euro Madness With The Energiewende, which looks at the profound failure of Germany’s transition to renewable energies and the government bowing to the green energy lobby.
The BILD article refers to a recent German ARD public television documentary.
“Exploding costs”
BILD begins by bringing up the fact that many wind parks are built in places where there really isn’t that much wind to start with, and that in general “costs for the Energiewende are exploding” and it’s the landowners where the turbines are sited who are making money hand over fist. In the end the consumer picks up the tab for what many see as a rampant, crony-capitalist scheme that is benefitting only a select and elite few (who are already well off).
The result for the rest of the people are huge costs and no benefit of any type.
Bild writes:
Indeed what the lobby sold as a contribution to the rescue of the climate is foremost one thing: a multibillion-euro business!”

Bild also cites examples of how the industry is corrupt to the very core, citing internal e-mails from Germany’s number 1 environmentalist group BUND and showing how the activist organization “is doing the lobbying work for the wind industry. Of bird species that are chopped up by rotating blades, it is best not to speak about it.”
Even the BUND director admits that many of its members are active in the wind industry.
Bild writes in bold letters:
The losers are people who have little money. Single mother Nina Albig has two jobs, her power bill has double since 2008: 90 euros.”
Nina Albig tells BILD that she’s desperate and has no idea where to get the money to pay for the high costs. BILD writes that the government’s idea to revamp the country’s spiralling-out-of-control Energiewende is a good first step, but that there’s one obstacle: “The Lobby”. BILD quotes a top Green party official Anton Hofreiter, who shouted at a demonstration that was in large part attended by employees of the green energy industry who were bussed in free of charge: “We need wind turbines to rescue or planet.”
In the end BILD reports that the government bowed to The Lobby and decided to further expand wind energy, thus ratcheting up the pain consumers are having to endure. BILD summarizes:
The consumers will be asked to cough it up. That means all of us.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterI doubt many are focused today on climate and energy right now, so today I have a few thoughts on the election.
Sorry, Hillary, but I was not able to cast my vote for you: too many scandals, too much corruption, bad positions on fundamental issues and too many phony promises.
You are really just a pawn of Wall Street, Big Media, Hollywood, globalists, the Saudis and Soros. My message to you:

Concerning the election itself, I learned the hard way back in 2012. A few signs that Romney would win got the best of my optimism and I ended up disappointed. Obama won handily.
This time I’m staying sober about the outcome of this election. Trump is the clear underdog, as he’s up against a formidable line-up comprising the string-pullers mentioned above. It is truly unbelievable that he has gotten as far as he has.

What indicates Hillary will win?
1. She is leading (slightly) in the polls.
2. The electoral college favors her as well. She only needs to pick up a few of the toss-up states.
3. Voter fraud favors her.
Some glimmers of hope for Trump:
1. He’s well within striking distance.
2. He appears to have mobilized the base: impressive huge rallies nationwide.
3. Polls are often wrong/manipulative.
4. Republicans tend to turn out on election day.
In the end, the election will be probably decided in the swing state counties with large ghettos (Dade, Broward, Cuyahoga, Philadelphia, etc.) where there are signs of rampant voter fraud of the sort we see in banana republics. Moreover there is little to discourage the fraud from being carried out, like who is going to do anything about it? The DOJ?
Those who put up with banana republic elections ought not wonder why they find themselves living in banana republic conditions.
But who knows, Trump just may pull it off. It’s up to GOP voters to turn out.
My advice to those long suffering in these ghettos: Why do you keep voting for the same hucksters, election after election? How many more decades will it take before you realize you’ve been swindled?

Share this...FacebookTwitterFifteen international scientists recently collaborated to assemble one of the most comprehensive analyses of temperature and ice sheet changes for Greenland and the Canadian Arctic ever produced.  Briner et al., (2016) synthesized over 100 records from a large and accumulating database to publish “Holocene climate change in Arctic Canada and Greenland” in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews.
The results are not good news for those who wish to maintain that today’s Greenland Ice Sheet is losing ice area at an unprecedentedly accelerated rate, or that modern temperature values for the Arctic region are dangerously high.  Greenland’s Ice Sheet has a larger ice extent now than it has had for most of the last 7,500 years; only the Little Ice Age period (~1300-1900 A.D.) had more ice mass.   And both regions (Canadian Arctic and Greenland) are still 1 to 2°C colder now than they were just a few thousand years ago.
The Greenland Ice Sheet Is Now At Nearly Its Highest Extent In The Last 7,500 Years
In the climate alarmism world, the Greenland Ice Sheet has been cooperating with the ice-is-melting-faster-than-ever paradigm for decades.   For headline-creators who warn of “ominous” and “catastrophic” rates of change — and how humans are to blame for most of it —  the Greenland Ice Sheet has been losing mass at “unprecedented” rates since the 1990s.  For example:  The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing 110 million Olympic size swimming pools worth of water each year.  … ‘The Arctic Is Unraveling,’ Scientists Conclude After Latest Sobering Climate Report – Unprecedented warming has sent the Arctic into uncharted territory, says latest NOAA report … Alert! Greenland’s Ice Now Melting At Catastrophic Speed
But what does  “unprecedented” actually mean with regard to ice loss or temperature change in the Arctic?  Effectively, precedence only extends back to the beginning of the 20th Century in most cases.  Some may only extend precedence back to the 1961-1990 period, which is the baseline for nearly all surface mass balance estimates.   So ice is said to be melting faster than any time since 1900, or since 1961-1990.   But consider that in 1900, with centuries of solar minima and large-scale volcanic eruptions leading to plummeting Little Ice Age temperatures,  the Greenland Ice Sheet had accumulated more ice and expanded its margins more than at any time in the last 7,500 years.  And as the 15 scientists contributing to Briner et al. (2016) reveal in this encapsulating graph from the paper, the Greenland Ice Sheet’s surface area has only negligibly retreated from that high point (~1900).  Today’s ice sheet extent is still among the highest of the Holocene.

Briner et al., 2016     “The Greenland Ice Sheet retracted to its minimum extent between 5 and 3 ka [5,000 and 3,000 years ago], consistent with many sites from around Greenland depicting a switch from warm to cool conditions around that time.”
Taking a closer look at what this graph depicts, we first of all can clearly see that Greenland’s ice sheet reached its much-lower-than-now  minimum extent between 6,000 and 2,000 years ago, with the absolute lowest levels between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago.  This millennial-scale ice sheet recession took place at a time when an anthropogenic influence was non-existent, and when CO2 levels were safely in the range of 260 ppm – about 140 ppm lower than today’s levels (400 ppm).
And as mentioned above, it is also clearly discernible that the modern Greenland Ice Sheet extent has not only not fallen outside the range of natural variability, it barely even falls below the coldest centennial-scale periods of the last 10,000 years (the Little Ice Age).  Here is a much closer look (with annotations) at the last ~1,500 years of Greenland Ice Sheet area changes as shown in Briner et al. (2016):

Greenland and Canadian Arctic Temperatures Were 2°C Warmer Than Now For Most Of The Last 10,000 Years
Not only did Greenland’s ice sheet margins experience far greater retreat and higher melt rates during most of the last 7,500 years, but Greenland’s (and the Canadian Arctic’s) temperatures were also much warmer than today’s during the Holocene too.  Below are some of the summarizing comments from Briner et al. (2016) describing the temperature changes for this region.  Again, these much warmer temperatures occurred while CO2 levels were in the 260 ppm range.
“The temperature decrease from the warmest to the coolest portions of the Holocene is 3.0 ± 1.0 °C on average (n = 11 sites).  … The temperature record, which integrates all seasons, shows rapid warming from the onset of the Holocene until ~9.5 ka [9,500 years ago], relatively uniform temperature at the millennial scale until ~7 ka [7,000 years ago], followed by ~3.5 °C temperature decline to the Little Ice Age [1300-1900 C.E.], followed by ~1.5 °C warming to today.  [Today’s Greenland Ice Sheet temperatures are 2.0 °C colder than the Early and Middle Holocene] .  The record also shows centennial-scale variability on the order of 1-2 °C, and a ~3 °C temperature oscillation during the 8.2 ka event.”
“Reconstruction results [Canadian Arctic] showed that summers warmer than today (~1 to 2 °C) prevailed prior to 4-3 ka [4,000 to 3,000 years ago]. … At Qipisarqo Lake [Greenland], pollen data indicate a sharp increase in July air temperature of 3-4 °C at 7.5-7.0 ka [7,500 to 7,000 years ago] and higher temperatures until 5.5-5.0 ka [5,500 to 5,000 years ago]. After 5 ka [5,000 years ago], a progressive cooling of 1-2 °C is inferred.”
Another synopsized graph from the paper depicting the temperature changes for each region of Greenland and the Canadian Arctic yields a clear and decisive verdict: modern Arctic-region temperature changes are not unusual or unprecedented.

Other New Papers Confirm That Modern Temperatures, Ice Loss Not At All Unusual For the Arctic Region
In the last few decades, the interior of the Greenland Ice Sheet has been melting at a slower rate than it did for 95% of the last 9,000 years according to scientists publishing in the journal Science.  This finding is similar to the aforementioned conclusion that the ice extent for the Greenland Ice Sheet is now higher than it was for more than 90% of the last 7,500 years, rendering recent “losses” relatively insignificant and well within the range of natural variability.
MacGregor et al., 2016 [press release] (Greenland Ice Sheet)
“[I]ce flow in its [the Greenland Ice Sheet’s] interior is slower now than the average speed over the past nine millennia.”
“[T]he interior of the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] is flowing 95% slower now than it was on average during the Holocene [the last 9,000 years].”

Fortin and Gajewski (2016) find that the central Canadian Arctic has not warmed in the last 150 years, and that the region was 3°C warmer than now just a few thousand years ago.

Fortin and Gajewski, 2016 (Canadian Arctic)
“A study of chironomid remains in the sediments of Lake JR01 on the “Boothia Peninsula in the central Canadian Arctic provides a high-resolution record of mean July air temperatures for the last 6.9 ka …. Biological production decreased again at ~ 2 ka and the rate of cooling increased in the past 2 ka, with coolest temperatures occurring between 0.46 and 0.36 ka [460 and 360 years ago], coinciding with the Little Ice Age. Although biological production increased in the last 150 yr, the reconstructed temperatures do not indicate a warming during this time. … Modern inferred temperatures based on both pollen and chironomids are up to 3°C cooler than those inferred for the mid-Holocene.”

Other Recent Reconstructions Of Greenland, Canadian Arctic Climate Also Do Not Indicate ‘Unprecedented’ Modern Changes

Levy et al., 2013  (Greenland Ice Sheet)

Andersen et al., 2004 (North Iceland Shelf, East Greenland, Vøring Plateau SSTs)
“Our results show that the Nordic Seas circulation system is highly sensitive to the large-scale insolation [surface solar radiation] changes as the general Holocene climate development follows closely the Northern Hemisphere insolation. … Century-scale surface current variability for the Holocene is shown to be 1 – 1.5°C for the Vøring Plateau and East Greenland shelf, and 2.5– 3°C on the North Ice-land shelf. … The first cooling [East Greenland Shelf SSTs] from 2400 to 2000 cal years BP was introduced by a 1.5°C temperature drop starting at 3000 cal years BP which culminated in an SST low around 2100 cal years BP. The second cooling occurred around 300 cal years BP and preceded a rapid warming [during the 1700s A.D.] , where SSTs rose with more than 1.5°C within 70 years. The third cooling took place in the second half of the last century. Until the last three centuries, SST variability atthis site has been 1°C, while SSTs varied with amplitudes of 1.5– 2°C during the last 300 years.”

Remember The Larger Context For Claims Of ‘Unprecedented’ Arctic Change
Geologist Dr. Don Easterbrook offers a cogent summarizing perspective on the modern levels of relative Arctic quiescence.
Easterbrook, 2016
“In the past 500 years, Greenland temperatures have fluctuated back and forth between warming and cooling about 40 times, with changes every 25–30 years. … Comparisons of the intensity and magnitude of past warming and cooling climate changes show that the global warming experienced during the past century pales into insignificance when compared to the magnitude of profound climate reversals over the past 25,000 years. At least three warming events were 20–24 times the magnitude of warming over the past century, and four were 6–9 times the magnitude of warming over the past century.”
So the next time we read a headline that uses words like dangerous and catastrophic and unprecedented to refer to Arctic temperatures or ice mass losses, let’s remember that the far larger context strongly suggests that modern changes in the Arctic are comparatively minor, even negligible.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s leading climate alarmism site “Klimaretter” (Climate Rescuer) recently fretted that the German government has quietly watered down the country’s climate protection policy and targets for the coming decades.
In short, Germany is walking away from its climate protection commitments declared in Paris.
The site describes Germany’s plan to reduce CO2 emissions by 2050 as now being “non-concrete, watered down and without substance“. Klimaretter reports that as the draft policy has gone through the Chancellors Office “a number of targets for transportation, agriculture or buildings have been eliminated” and that the government intends to adopt an “open path” for reducing greenhouse gases.
The German site writes that the country’s Ministry of Envinonment’s once highly ambitious climate protection plan – forged with the help of climate scientist Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber – has since been greatly weakened:
The draft policy was made public for the first time and is now headed for a vote. Many critics already expected the original text to get greatly softened up. Now it’s official.”

The initial draft has been so strongly watered down that klimaretter writes that there is “not much of it left“. Gone are:

the requirement to end coal power
any mention of taxes on fossil and heating fuels
duties on building heating systems
requirements for reducing the consumption of meat

Another thorn in the eye of climate protection activists, writes the alarmist klimaretter: “The preamble of the draft now includes a statement that the German government wishes to place ‘central attention’ on maintaining the competitiveness of the German economy’” The plan itself is to only serve as a “compass“, and not as mandatory targets.
Declared targets “in serious danger”
German Greens and leftists are fuming over the hefty changes. Klimaretter quotes: Eva Bulling-Schröter, spokesperson of the Linke (Communist) Party:
Now at the latest it has to be clear that with this government Germany’s declared climate targets of reducing CO2 emissions 40% by 2020 and 95% by 2050 are in serious danger.”

"Former Irish president Mary Robinson is one of the world’s leading voices on climate justice. Appearing at the UN climate summit in Paris, Robinson has argued for warming to be kept within 1.5°C, to protect the nations most at risk from the effects climate change. She has also campaigned for women to be front and centre in the negotiations, citing their increased vulnerability in a warming world. Robinson was President of Ireland from 1990-97, after which she was appointed United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. She has been a UN Special Envoy for Climate Change since 2014. She is president of the Mary Robinson Foundation – Climate Justice, and a member of The Elders, a group of world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela which lobbies on peace initiatives and human rights. Six of The Conversation’s top experts from around the world put their questions to Robinson about climate justice, women’s rights and the progress being made in Paris. Her answers reveal optimism about the negotiations, a concern about the link between radicalisation and climate change and a challenge to the world’s biggest fossil fuel emitters. Yves Petit, Université de Lorraine: What do you think the risk is of climate change aggravating conflicts between nation states? I do not think this is just a risk. I feel it is already a reality. Climate change is a threat multiplier – it exacerbates poverty and water scarcity, it compounds food and nutrition insecurity and it makes it even harder for poor households to secure their rights.  During the opening day of the COP21 climate talks, I was particularly taken by the words spoken by Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister of Tuvalu, in offering his condolences to the people of France on the terrorist attacks of November 13. He said that the global community must target the root causes of these barbaric attacks, including “the lack of opportunity to do good”. People without such opportunity are easily drawn to ideologies that they see as striking out against the system that limits their prospects of living full lives.  In a world where climate change exacerbates the stresses of daily life on people already disenfranchised by poverty or social standing, radicalisation is very likely. We are seeing more and more evidence emerging of the links between conflict and climate change.  The recurrent drought in Syria towards the end of the last decade, which destroyed harvests and forced rural communities to migrate to the urban areas, is now seen as a key aggravating factor in the lead-up to the civil war that has eviscerated the country. Research on other conflicts seems to indicate that higher temperatures and extreme precipitation correlate with greater incidence of conflict. We are now seeing world leaders recognise the security threat posed by climate change. US president Barack Obama has said that climate action is a security imperative and UK prime minister David Cameron has described it as an issue of national security.  I appreciate this message may be effective in a world so sensitised to security issues as ours is today. However, it saddens me that action would be motivated by the worst aspects of human nature, rather than the best – immediate climate action will help save the people and cultures of small island states like Tuvalu. Surely this should be motivation enough. Cathy Alexander, University of Melbourne: It seems that it’s people on lower incomes with fewer resources who have the most to lose from climate change, while they have to face well-resourced commercial interests who may wish to block climate policies. How can citizens who are not well-resourced successfully push for climate action, and overcome a lack of financial backing? There are many inequalities that must be overcome if the world is to successfully turn the tide on climate change. These start in the rooms where the negotiations are taking place – countries with great resources have a structural advantage over poorer countries that face personnel and capacity constraints. These asymmetries mean that the concerns of some of the world’s most vulnerable citizens are sometimes not even heard in negotiations.  In recent weeks we have seen hundreds of thousands of citizens around the world march for climate justice, standing in solidarity with those people whose lives are being devastated by the impacts of climate change and calling for real leadership to avert this crisis. The truth is that we are all in this together – climate change confronts us with the reality of our interdependence. I believe that there is a growing awareness of our role as global citizens in the face of climate change and that the movement growing out of this is becoming an irresistible one. This movement will only accelerate as the impacts of climate change become more apparent. There are no interests, commercial or otherwise, that can block the will of a global movement of people calling for real action, regardless of how well-resourced they may be. Gail Whiteman, Lancaster University: As a leading political thinker on climate justice, and a grandmother, who are your heroes and what gives you hope at COP21? I often think that when Eleanor Roosevelt was drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights she could never have imagined that human-induced climate change might force whole countries to go out of existence. But that is the reality we face today. In Geneva in early March, I participated on a panel at the Human Rights Council with Anote Tong, president of the Pacific Island state of Kiribati. He described vividly the threat to his people’s very ability to remain on their islands posed by climate change. He has bought land in Fiji as a precaution, but if he has to move, what becomes of the identity, sovereignty and heritage of a small island people? Another woman who fought for human rights, gender equality and sustainable development was my dear friend Wangari Maathai. She understood that meaningful development could not take place without both environmental sustainability and respect for human rights. As the world moves to take action on climate change, we must ensure that in saving the planet we don’t trample on the rights of people made vulnerable by poverty or social standing. The value of a human rights framing for the new climate agreement has been recognised by the Climate Vulnerable Forum, initially a group of 20 countries on the front lines of climate change – a number that is likely to expand to 43 by the end of the climate talks. I was very happy to be a part of the third high-level meeting of the Climate Vulnerable Forum where the member states declared that they will aim to achieve full decarbonisation of their economies and run their countries on 100% renewable energy by 2050. This is the type of leadership we need from all nations – this gives me hope. Catherine Gautier-Downes, University of California, Santa Barbara: What role do you think women from both developed and developing nations can play in the years to come in helping achieve the substantial emission reductions that are necessary for warming to remain below 2°C?  Women across all sectors of society are already leading the way in efforts to build resilience and adapt to the impacts of climate change, and they are demonstrating their unity, collective ambition and willingness to act with urgency, regardless of their societal or political position. Women’s agency plays a significant role in driving climate action and their participation in the climate debate is a key factor for a fair and equitable climate agreement. Too often, women are categorised as vulnerable with little acknowledgement that they are already offering solutions. They offer hope for successful adaptation and low carbon development through critical knowledge, experience, and the unique role they play in agriculture, food security, income generation and management of natural resources. It is not only emissions reductions where women have a vital role to play. They must also be included in the design, planning and implementation of adaptation strategies. Climate change exacerbates existing social inequalities, leaving women disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts. Women’s voices must be heard and their priorities supported as part of the global response to climate change. There are many strong examples of how women are already leading the way in the fight against climate change. The Solar Sister project is tackling energy poverty through empowering women with economic opportunity. It is delivering the transformative benefits of clean energy technology to remote communities in rural areas throughout Uganda, Tanzania and Nigeria. James Dyke, University of Southampton: One of the arguments against reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other human-produced drivers of climate change is that to do so would be to apply a powerful brake on economic development. Is that true - should we prioritise poverty alleviation over climate change mitigation? I think this is a false dichotomy. I think if we were to pursue an “either/or” approach to these two great challenges of our time we would achieve neither.
The reality is that development is the priority for poorer countries, and they will pursue the path most likely to lift their citizens out of poverty. If affordable, sustainable development pathways are not made available, developing countries will turn to fossil fuels based development as the only option available to them – who could blame them? My foundation recently commissioned a piece of research called Zero Carbon, Zero Poverty the Climate Justice Way. This indicates that achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050 is compatible with achieving the right to development, with a shift to sustainable development, poverty eradication and a more equitable and inclusive model of development. However, this requires all countries to participate in the transition on the same timescale.  Of course this transition would require leadership from all countries, but the leadership would differ depending on a country’s circumstance. Developed countries would have to rapidly peak and reduce their emissions, while also delivering their commitments to enable climate action in developing countries. Developing countries would have the greater challenge – they would have to forge new, sustainable development pathways.  This has never been achieved before and would require unprecedented levels of support from the international community. It is only by acting in global solidarity, motivated by enlightened self-interest, that our leaders steer us on a path to a safer world. Britta Renkamp, University of Cape Town: What is an example of partnerships for climate justice really working out and why? How can this knowledge help other cases worldwide? I would offer two examples of partnerships that are both working out and providing a framework for others to follow. In February, the climate negotiations were hosted in Geneva on account of some construction work at their usual home in Bonn, Germany. This provided a unique opportunity to bring the climate community and the human rights community together to discuss the incorporation of human rights into climate action. My foundation hosted a climate justice dialogue with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which brought climate negotiators together with their Human Rights Council counterparts for the first time.  At the event, Costa Rica announced their intention to develop the Geneva Pledge on Human Rights and Climate Action. The pledge is a voluntary initiative undertaken by countries to facilitate the sharing of knowledge between human rights and climate experts at a national level. Initially, 18 countries signed up and the pledge was announced in the closing plenary of the Geneva negotiation session. Today, the pledge has 29 signatories. Another example of partnerships in action for climate justice comes from Malawi, where an initiative to deliver access to clean energy to the very poorest households is bringing together government, civil society and donors.  In 2012 I visited Malawi and discussed the potential of coupling renewable energy access and social protection with the government officials and bilateral donors. The government of Malawi has since set a target of delivering two million energy-efficient cookstoves to households by 2020.  In conjunction with Irish Aid and Concern Universal, the government is piloting a project to deliver cookstoves to the poorest households, using a social cash transfer delivery mechanism. By the end of 2015 the programme will have reached 8,400 homes. The programme will then be scaled up to 320,000 homes by the end of 2016, and should be on course to reach the two million household target.  Social protection systems can deliver at scale if supported by genuine political will and appropriate financing. Adopting this approach for delivering sustainable energy solutions could drastically reduce energy poverty."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome days ago we wrote about how Germany was headed to Marrakesh without any plan on how it would meet its “climate targets”.
This of course promised to be a huge embarassment for a country that liked to massively boast about being a leader in fighting climate change.
Merkel’s government and leading ministers had to endure quite a beating by the media, and apparently caved in and have since reached a compromise with climate alarmist minister of environment Barbara Hendricks. They’re coming to Marrakesh with a Climate Plan 2050 after all.
“Hardly any substance…watered down”
Daniel Wetzel at the online national daily Die Welt here reports, however, that the plan has “hardly any substance” left in it, and:
What resulted was a light version: Many requirements have been crossed out or watered down. Those who profit are industry and power plant operators.”
That of course means that German consumers, who have been hard hit by the “Energiewende” (transition to renewable energies) through skyrocketing electricity costs and grid instability, can breath a sigh of relief: Germany is in fact only lukewarm when it comes to combatting the “most serious threat to mankind”.
“Nebulous text”

Also deleted from the Climate Plan 2050 is a minimum price for CO2 emissions trading, and what remains, according to Wetzel, is a nebulous “strengthening of price signals of emissions trading“.
“Completely hollowed out”
Wetzel adds that the German Greens and environmentalists have slammed the new Climate Plan 2050, calling it “completely hollowed out” and that it “will not fulfil the requirements of the Paris climate agreement“.



 &amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=”https://ww251.smartadserver.com/call/pubjumpi/10034/(wirtschaft_story)/4460/S/1/Wetzel-Daniel;Digitalteam;Klimaschutz?” target=”_blank”&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=”https://ww251.smartadserver.com/call/pubi/10034/(wirtschaft_story)/4460/S/1/Wetzel-Daniel;Digitalteam;Klimaschutz?” border=”0″ alt=””&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;gt; 


Yet, despite all the shortcomings in the latest draft, Wetzel believes that the plan will in fact be praiseworthy when it arrives in Marrakesh later this week, writing:

Hardly any counry has bothered drawing up a reduction plan that goes so far out into the future.”






No effect on emissions so far
One reader at Facebook commented that Germany’s climate fight so far has been a farce, and that it has caused far more damage than good. The reader writes that over the first 9 months of this year, Germany has in fact consumed 0.3% more energy than it did over the same period a year earlier, concluding: 
The German Energiewende is meaningless for the climate. […]. Nonetheless, Germany’s most beautiful landscapes continue to be destroyed by wind turbines – a crime against nature.”
And then there are the astronomical financal costs.

"The EU will attempt to revive the world’s flagging attempts to tackle the climate crisis with a historic proposal from Brussels to halve emissions by 2030, and reach net zero carbon by mid-century. Wednesday’s announcement is seen as the vital first step towards gathering a “coalition of ambition” among key countries to fulfil the pledges of the 2015 Paris agreement, which is in danger of languishing amid deadlocked UN talks.  Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European commission, writing in the Guardian on Tuesday, said: “Science is telling us we are running out of time. The new European commission is wasting no time. Our goal is to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, slowing down global heating and mitigating its effects. This is a task for our generation and the next, but change must begin right now – and we know we can do it.” The proposals will be aired on Wednesday lunchtime in Brussels followed by a debate in the EU parliament, and the 2030 target will be a signal of intent rather than a formal commitment at this stage. But negotiators are keen to take a strong position in the final days of the UN talks in Madrid, which have lacked much sense of urgency. Her intervention – seen as a game-changer by experts – comes as the talks on implementing the Paris agreement stalled, with nations wrangling over small print on details such as carbon markets. Negotiators have largely ignored the key question hanging over these talks: how to ensure governments strengthen their targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with scientific advice. Current targets under the 2015 Paris accord would lead to more than 3C of warming, which would cause irreparable harm and violate the core Paris goal of holding global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to hold to 1.5C. Global temperatures have already risen about 1.1C. To fulfil the pledges they made in Paris, nations must step up in the next year with new targets for emissions for 2030. Global carbon emissions are now 4% above the levels they were in 2015 when the Paris accord was signed. According to scientific advice, to stay within 1.5C the world must begin cutting emissions in the next year and reduce them by more than 7% a year for the next decade. In becoming the first major economic bloc to propose a 2030 and 2050 goal, the EU is hoping to galvanise other key countries such as China and India into making similar commitments to curb greenhouse gases by 2030, and so rescue the Paris agreement. While 68 other countries have also come forward with 2030 pledges, most are small economies and the world’s big emitters – the US, China, India, Japan and others – have remained on the sidelines. The US is in the process of withdrawing from Paris, though the Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg led a delegation in Madrid promising to continue action on the climate. All eyes are now on China, as the EU will try to woo Beijing with promises of trade negotiations and the lure of joint investments. There may be sticks as well as carrots: Frans Timmermans, the EU vice president, said he would be “at the disposal of any country that wants to talk to us” about targets, but added the EU would “not hesitate” to impose measures such as carbon tariffs on imports from countries without strong Paris commitments. The EU’s move was hailed as a potential “game-changer” by David Waskow, international climate director at the World Resources Institute. “This announcement could have a galvanising effect for numerous other countries to step up their efforts to tackle climate change.” Todd Stern, former White House climate chief at the Paris negotiations, commended the EU’s move: “What the world most needs right now is a clear recognition of the scale and speed of decarbonisation we need, a clear plan to produce that transformation, and the political will to do what it takes. Europe has always been a climate leader and looks ready to take that leadership to the next level.” Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and the French official who led the Paris agreement, said: “[This will] have a major impact. If one of the largest economies and largest trading bloc moves to climate neutrality by 2050, this sends a strong signal to markets and players across the globe.” The commission’s proposals still face opposition from a few countries – Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary – that are concerned over economic losses from moving away from coal, and the proposals on emissions cuts for 2030 may take time to finalise. Von der Leyen promised €100bn funding for a “just transition” to help countries. Green campaigners also want to see higher targets for 2030, and want the EU to confirm its commitments sooner. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, told the Guardian: “To be truly credible and consistent with staying below 1.5C, the EU needs to commit to increasing its 2030 commitment to 65% [emissions cuts]. This is what’s needed to be taken seriously by China in the lead-up to the EU-China summit in autumn next year.” Green campaigners are also worried that the EU will not finalise its commitments until late next year, but the Commission is confident that by signalling its intent now it can form alliances with other key countries to come up with the joint pledges needed at next year’s crunch conference in November in Glasgow. That is the deadline for new commitments on emissions to fulfil the Paris accord."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krueger at German skeptic site Science Skeptical here writes that in 2015 global CO2 emissions reached another new all-time record high, despite all the elaborate climate conferences and hundreds of billions of dollars invested in curbing global “greenhouse gases”.
Krueger asks: What have all the climate conferences brought us since the first UN conference took place in Berlin in 1995?
Over the past 20 years global fossil fuel CO2 emissions have skyrocketed some 50%, from 22.2 billion tonnes per year to 33.5 billion tonnes in 2015. The 2015 figure was a new record high, defying the prognoses of experts who had expected to see a trend reversal by now. See the following charts:

13 UN climate conferences have not led to any reduction in CO2 emissions. The reductions achieved by Russia and Europe were more than completely eliminated by China and India alone – never mind the other developing countries.
Krueger asks: What about Germany?
He writes that Germany recently signed on to the Paris Agreement with not a single Parliamentarian voting against it. This means that Germany commits itself to reduce its CO2 emissions by 95% by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels). However, Germany has not cut its CO2 emissions at all over the past 7 years, despite the last 3 winters being mild ones.
Krueger sums up:
Despite Germany accounts for only 3% of the world’s CO2 emissions, and has not had any reduction in CO2 emissions since 2009, a reduction of a few percent by Germany will mean very little.”

Over the last few years, the United Nations has been conducting an online poll, asking the world’s citizens —well, those fortunate enough to have access to electrical power, a computer, and the internet — what is most important to them, what concerns them most, or what issue they view as the highest priority for action.
In all, there are 16 priorities to choose from, ranging from phone and internet access to building more roads, protecting rivers and forests, better health care, etc.
Over 9.7 million people across all nations and age groups and educational and income levels have voted so far.  And, shockingly, of the 16 listed priorities for action, “Action taken on climate change” ranks a distant 16th, or last.
The world’s citizens are more concerned about access to paved roads and phones than they are about taking action to combat the greatest threat facing mankind.

Sadly, even citizens of wealthy countries couldn’t care any less than they do about climate change as an issue.  In the U.S., for example, in a Gallup poll ranking the levels of concern about 15 pre-selected, randomly-ordered national problems, “Climate Change” again comes in a distant last place.
 

Just yesterday, a poll conducted by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and reported by the Associated Press revealed that 43% of American citizens would refuse to pay more than $1 a month to fight climate change — though we’re not exactly sure what fighting climate change means.  And the refusal to pay rises as the relative cost of fighting the climate rises: 61% would refuse to pay even $10 a month, about 70% would refuse to pay $20 a month, and 80% of Americans would refuse to pay $50 a month.
Are More Alarming Studies Needed To Elicit Belief, Concern?

Perhaps there aren’t enough alarming studies linking climate change to personal catastrophes to generate more public concern about climate change as an issue.
Maybe there needs to be more analysis that says Antarctica will soon be the only place on the planet to live if we don’t start fighting climate change.  That could garner enough attention to move up a notch or two in the polls.
Beer is quite popular nearly world-wide.  What if there were more stories that affirm global warming will make beer taste worse?   It might make a difference.
Just about everyone loves a savory steak dinner.  If scientists can again demonstrate that global warming makes steak taste worse, that might stir the public to join in the climate change fight.
Music soothes the soul.   If music sounds worse because of global warming, scientists could emphasize this over and over again.  This could be persuasive — especially among the youths.
Dogs are humans’ best friends.  Observers have found, though, that global warming leads to boredom and even depression in dogs.  If the link between warmer temperatures and dog depression becomes more widely known, some dog-lovers might be willing to pay up.
When it comes to alarming the public about the consequences of climate change, the status quo hasn’t been working.  More alarmism must be needed.
After all, we’re facing the greatest threat in the history of mankind — and people across the world care much more about roads and phones and internet access than they do about the end of life as we know it on this planet.

"This week in Queensland, Anthony Albanese has been devastating in exposing the lies, hypocrisy and absurdity of the National party’s election “promise” to build a new coal-fired power station. That even the idea of building such a power station hasn’t demolished the economic environmental and political credibility of the Morrison government tells you a lot about what is wrong in Australian politics today. But how do we square the circle on the broader coal debate? Internationally, the debate between those who think it’s time we talked about fossil fuel supply (think Adani, the Keystone XL pipeline or the Canadian oil sands) and those who want to keep the focus on fossil fuel demand (think talk of targets, trajectories and closing down coal power stations) has been brewing for some time.  But there’s no need to fight. Alfred Marshall was the economist who invented what we now think of as supply and demand curves. He was once asked whether it was supply or demand that determined price – his response was that it was like asking if it was the upper or lower blade of the scissors that did the cutting. There is nothing in an economics textbook that says we need to choose between focusing on the supply of fossil fuels or the demand for them. In fact, economics textbooks suggest that when it comes to a big problem like climate change, we should cut with both arms of the scissors. The good news is if we are willing to take a new look at old arguments, we can develop win-win solutions to problems that can sometimes seem unresolvable. As Albanese has said, it’s important to differentiate between thermal and coking coal. That’s true, and when we do, we can see that none of the new mines such as Adani being proposed in the Galilee Basin produce coking coal. But if we go further down the road of arguing that not all coalmines are created equally, we can find even more common ground. If, for example, we distinguish between existing coalmines and proposed coalmines, we can develop policies which effectively “grandfather” our treatment of the mines we already have while imposing much tougher rules on proposed new ones. The opposition leader is right to say it would be economically reckless to close down all existing coalmines overnight. But that doesn’t mean that it is economically or environmentally responsible to open up new coalmines in regions that have never mined a tonne of coal. Once we separate calls to stop opening new coalmines from calls to shut all coalmines down tomorrow, a range of economic and political possibilities present themselves – the most important of which is that by preventing any increase in the supply of coal from new coalmines, we can actually keep the price of coal higher, keep the existing mines operating for a bit longer, and in turn, keep the existing coal workers in existing coal regions working longer. Put simply, new coalmines in far north Queensland don’t help existing coal communities, they hurt them. The Morrison government often tells us that if we frack more gas, the price will fall and if we build more coal-fired power stations electricity prices will fall, but they don’t talk much about what would happen if Australia opened up the Galilee Basin and doubled our coal exports. That’s because the answer is that it would push the world price of coal down and the world’s consumption of cheaper coal up. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal. When it comes to exportable coal, Australia has a bigger share of the traded coal market than Saudi Arabia has of the world oil market. Our supply decisions matter. A lot. Back in 2011, Queensland suffered from catastrophic flooding, and the floods disrupted Queensland’s coal export facilities. The world price of coal shot up for the same reason that the world price of oil shot up when terrorists attacked Saudi Arabia’s largest oil refinery this year. Supply decisions affect price. Flooding the world coal market with an extra 200 million tonnes of Galilee Basin coal will push the price of coal down, down, down, along with production and employment at other Australian coalmines. But don’t take my word for it. Adani’s own evidence to the Queensland land court showed employment in other Australian mines would contract. The Port of Newcastle has argued publicly that new coalmines in Queensland will lead to coal job losses in the Hunter. Even Joel Fitzgibbon was quoted saying that the economic warnings about the impact of the proposed new mines in Queensland’s Galilee Basin on the Hunter coal industry were “absolutely correct”. Again, once we distinguish between the economic impacts of opening new mines from the economic impacts of shutting existing ones, the political landscape looks quite different. Similarly, once we understand that supply and demand interact, the policy case for focusing on both fossil fuel supply and fossil fuel demand makes a lot more sense. But rather than plan a gradual transition out of coal by allowing existing mines to wind down on schedule over the coming decades, the New South Wales, Queensland and federal governments are offering a wide range of subsidies to build new ones. Subsidising new coalmines is a poor way to fund our schools and hospitals and it’s an even worse way to help existing coal communities. As Queensland’s Treasury has said, “spending on mining related infrastructure means less infrastructure spending in other areas, including social infrastructure such as hospitals and schools”. It gets worse. The NSW government’s policy for setting coal royalties states: “Royalty rates are set to encourage present and future exploration and development of mineral resources.” And so keen to open new coalmines is the Queensland government that they a have offered a “royalty holiday” for the coal itself which would amount to an enormously expensive “dig now pay later” scheme. Of course, that assumes that Adani will be around in the future to pay later. But the consequence of this interstate “competition” to attract new coalmines is that Australian taxpayers, and the world’s climate, pays a high price. But with absurdity comes opportunity. Imagine if Australia had a national plan to manage the decline in coal, a decline that even the coal industry accepts will come “in the decades to come”. Imagine if instead of subsidising new mines to come and compete with existing coalmines, we tried to protect existing coal communities and the environment at the same time. If such a plan was based on economics, not spin, it could be simple and cheap: Step 1 – Stop building new coalmines – you can’t transition out of coal while you are still building new coalmines. Step 2 – Admit the obvious: new coalmines push down prices and threaten jobs in existing coalmines. Step 3 – Keep existing mines open for longer by preventing new ones from opening. That’s the fairest way to help existing coalminers in existing mines and an easy way to help the climate. Step 4 – Increase the very low coal royalties and raise a lot more revenue from existing mines (for context, Saudi Arabia has a tax rate on oil companies of 85% – and no lack of foreign oil companies). Step 5 – Fund regional development from the increase in revenue that will accompany higher royalty and company tax revenues. We just need NSW, Queensland and the commonwealth cooperating to help existing communities instead of competing to help foreign coal companies establish new ones. Step 6 – Ban robot trucks and robot trains. What’s the point of causing climate change from mines that don’t even employ anyone in regional areas? With faith in politics at record lows, temperatures, pollution and bushfire damage at record highs, it’s a brave politician who hopes that the issue of coal exports will fade away like the Sydney Opera House behind its new shroud of smoke. Sure, it’s hard to imagine states cooperating with each other for the benefit of their citizens, but now more than ever Australia needs some blue sky thinking. • Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute"
"BHP has bucked shareholder pressure to quit the Minerals Council of Australia and will remain a member of the lobby group despite disagreeing with it over the importance of putting a price on carbon emissions. After a review of its membership of industry associations, first revealed by Guardian Australia, BHP has decided not to leave any of them.  The move comes despite almost 30% of shareholders last month voting in favour of a resolution that would have forced BHP to quit the Minerals Council and other industry bodies that hold positions on global heating at odds with the company’s. Australia’s biggest super fund, AustralianSuper, has also attacked the Minerals Council’s position as “not strong enough”. “We will continue to work with the MCA to ensure that, where it is undertaking advocacy, this remains consistent with its stated policy,” BHP said in its review of industry organisations, released on Thursday. However, BHP said it will again review its membership of the NSW Minerals Council before 30 April because of its recent attacks on zero emissions targets. It said the NSW body’s formal position on resolving the “energy trilemma” of delivering cheap and reliable power while reducing emissions was acceptable. “In recent times, however, the NSWMC has used language and arguments that suggest the association believes emissions reduction should be deprioritised relative to, or is incompatible with, affordability and reliability,” BHP said. BHP said it will also remain a member of Coal21 after the group agreed to limit its activities to research into low-emission coal technology. In August, Coal21 planned an $4.5m ad blitz to “invoke national pride” in coal, but BHP said that the following month it supported a change to the organisation’s constitution curbing such activities. It said it had resolved most of its differences with the US Chamber of Commerce after the body issued a new statement supporting the Paris agreement to keep global heating below 2C. However, it still had “material differences” on policy with the chamber and three other bodies: the American Petroleum Institute, the Mining Association of Canada, and the NSW Minerals Council. At BHP’s annual general meeting in November, the activist investor group Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) called on BHP to quit industry bodies that have a long-term track record at odds with the company’s support of emissions reduction. Dan Gocher, the ACCR’s director of climate and environment, said the company’s report was “a vindication of BHP shareholders’ concerns in the worst way possible”. “BHP has asked shareholders to hold fire until the end of the year, and then released an impotent review in which the company refuses to bring any of its industry groups to heel,” he said. “The investors who backed BHP’s board now look foolish and weak, in the midst of a catastrophic climate-related bushfire crisis in Australia. “This only amplifies our concerns about incoming CEO Mike Henry’s proximity to the worst of the fossil fuels lobby in Australia.”"
"Little green men feature heavily in movies about aliens. But why aren’t humans green? And why can’t we photosynthesise like plants? It would, after all, save us a whole lot of bother. The most familiar green organisms are, of course, plants. Plants are green because their cells are packed with internal organelles – organs within cells –  called chloroplasts, which are the centres of photosynthesis. These chloroplasts have a rather interesting evolutionary history, as they were once free-living cyanobacteria, independent of plants.  Cyanobacteria are famous for inventing photosynthesis, a process that harnesses the energy in sunlight to make sugar from water and carbon dioxide. But as any inventor can tell you, if you have a great idea then pretty soon everyone else will want a piece of it.  In an astonishing piece of insight, Lynne Margulis realised that the chloroplasts inside plants were domesticated cyanobacteria that had been captured early in the evolution of the plant lineage. It appears that a unicellular ancestor of the land plant engulfed a cyanobacteria, but rather than digesting it, realised that it was a useful acquisition.  But even more fundamental to the functioning of all higher organisms is a second organelle called the mitochondrion. Margulis realised that this too was once a free-living bacterium – in this case one that could harness the chemical energy locked up in sugary substrates such as glucose. So the cells of plants are really chimeras – a single organism made up of the original host plus two captured bacteria. This theory is known as the endosymbiotic theory. Ownership of a chloroplast brings an enormous and immediate benefit. Animals only have mitochondria, which allow them to oxidise glucose and harness the resulting chemical energy to fuel their metabolism. But they have to find a source of glucose. And that means dedicating a substantial part of their day to locating, subduing and consuming food. Plants on the other hand don’t have to bother. They can simply use their chloroplasts to make their own glucose, which they can then pass to the mitochondria to release chemical energy as and when it is required. So surely everyone else is missing a trick. If plants can bypass finding glucose, then surely animals could too. In fact, many animals have done exactly this. The chloroplast was just too good an invention and many other organisms managed to beg, borrow or steal a chloroplast, mainly from free-living unicellular algae that already had one. This process is known as secondary endosymbiosis to distinguish it from the primary endosymbiotic event, in which the original plant ancestor engulfed a free-living cyanobacterium. It’s not entirely clear why secondary endosymbiosis appears to have occurred many times, while the primary endosymbiosis occurred only once; although recently scientists have discovered a second example of a primary endosymbiosis in the making. In this case the host is a strange amoeba called Paulinella, which appears to be domesticating a cyanobacteria from the new and hence recreating the ancient event that gave rise to the land plants.  The transfer of the chloroplast around the tree of life by secondary endosymbiosis has given rise to a whole host of ecologically important organisms, most of which are unicellular. These organisms, for example, diatoms, dinoflagellates and euglenids, are unknown to most of us and arise from independent acquisitions of a chloroplast from an alga.  Perhaps most interesting of all for our story, these unicellular photosynthesising organisms have themselves been taken up by multicellular animals. These symbioses have evolved independently many times and the relationship between the host and the photosymbiont can take many forms.  For example, there are incredible green sea slugs that steal chloroplasts from the algae on which they graze. The slugs can’t maintain the chloroplasts in working order for long, so they need a constant supply and there’s still debate about whether the chloroplasts are really essential for the slug’s existence. At the other end of the spectrum, many marine organisms such as corals, giant clams and sea squirts are totally dependent on their symbionts and will perish without them. So, if slugs and sea squirts can all benefit from photosynthesis, why can’t we? The answer lies in considering the energy budget of a large active multicellular animal such as a human being. Every day an adult human requires its own body weight in a molecule called ATP, which stores the chemical energy released from the oxidation of glucose.  To produce roughly 60kg of ATP, a typical adult woman therefore requires around 700g of glucose per day. Given the maximum known rates of photosynthesis in higher plants and assuming that the surface area of an adult woman’s skin is around 1.6 m2, a woman with green skin could produce a highly disappointing 1% of her daily demand for glucose through photosynthesis. So to meet her energy demands, a photosynthesising woman would have to have a lot more skin. Indeed, roughly a tennis court’s worth.  We must therefore reluctantly conclude that either aliens look substantially weirder than they are currently portrayed in movies or that the photosynthesis that has potentially evolved on other planets colonised by little green men is seriously more efficient than the one that evolved here."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany is in shock after yesterday’s terrorist attack on a Berlin Christmas market, which is a stark symbol of German culture. The latest figures show 12 dead and 48 injured – some seriously. Also the Polish driver of the hijacked truck allegedly was killed.
Already accusations are flying back and forth, with some on the right claiming Merkel bears some responsibility for the attacks by allowing a tsunami of immigrants to flood across Germany uncontrolled in 2015. Meanwhile Merkel proponents and the media are accusing the right of exploiting the tragedy for political gains.

Influential U.S. conservative Drudge Report featured Tuesday Angela Merkel as having “blood on her hands”.
Amid the tragedy there’s the horrible irony that just some three months ago German national daily Die Welt here published a piece with the title:
‘Truck drivers wanted’ – Merkel gives refugees tips”
Die Welt reported that Merkel was working hard to “rapidly integrate the refugees” and called on industry to get involved. Merkel said that refugees would be able to trade in their driver’s licenses for a German one for 500 euros, but that of course loans need to be offered to help them finance it. Paying back the loan should be no problem, Merkel said:
When one earns, he can then pay this 500 euros back. Everywhere truck drivers are being sought.”
Merkel’s idea, it seems, is to give tens of thousands of Middle Eastern refugees driver licenses for semis.
The latest attacks is just the most recent in a series that have plagued the country since the recent wave of refugees.
Just two days ago, on Sunday, a Munich woman was raped and nearly beaten to death while jogging in the famous English Garden. The police were shocked by the sheer brutality of the attack. Currently there is no evidence linking the attack to a migrant.

In November, a 24-year old was attacked and raped in Munich as well.
Just weeks earlier the highly publicized case of the rape and murder of a 19-year-old medical student at the hands of a teenage Afghan refugee sparked outrage against the “open door” asylum policy of Chancellor Angela Merkel. The student was the daughter of EU parliamentarian and had done volunteer work for refugees.
Other terrorists attacks have occurred, with 4 being stabbed on a train earlier this year.
In one of Germany’s worst attacks, hundreds of women were sexually assaulted, attacked or robbed at New Year’s eve festivities in Cologne.
The UK tabloid “The Sun” here presents a summary of this year’s bloody attacks in the country.
Price for earlier policy negligence
The media, who are cozily in bed with Germany’s ruling grand coalition government, have been falling all over themselves praising the “calmness and professionality” of the authorities in dealing with the aftermath of the attack. Indeed they have done an excellent job. But one gets the sense that the praise is being used to distract the public’s attention from the government’s initial immigration policy failure and fiasco that led to the uncontrolled tsunami of “refugees” in the first place back in 2015.
Germany’s heightened security threat and overall anxiety would not exist today had it not been for the German government’s and EU’s border negligence.
Germany’s sense of security now violated
Germany’s sense of freedom and security have been violated. Citizen’s have had to change their habits and attitudes with respect to public safety. Citizens, especially women, no longer feel safe outside after dark and are opting to stay home. And those that wish to continue on as before now must summon up the courage to do so, knowing full well that public places and events are now targets. The carefree days are over, squandered by Merkel’s misguided do-gooding.
Increasingly Merkel is coming under massive fire for a string of policy failures over the past years that include the refugee crisis, renewable energy flop, Greece bailout, frayed relations with Russia and Turkey, European Union collapsing, and the slander of dissident views.

Share this...FacebookTwitterModels and experts of every type have had plenty of setbacks making forecasts for chaotic systems. Recent examples include the election results and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman’s prediction that the US market would dive in response to the election of Trump (it in fact went on and set a new all-time record high).
If anything has lost its worth, it’s the value of Krugman’s Nobel Prize
Recently German weather site Wetterfrosch posted at Facebook that the US NOAA had been forced to correct its previous Europe seasonal forecast for the coming winter.
Earlier the NOAA had forecast a mild winter, but now the American meteorologists are foreseeing a “significantly much colder than normal month for Scandinavia and Russia“.
For the time being, the NOAA is sticking to its mild winter forecast for Central Europe. However, German meteorologist Dominik Jung has doubts on that mild outlook, warning that there is a real possibility of getting hit by cold blasts from Siberia.
The central European forecast over the next week sees continued colder than normal weather. Earlier in the week large parts of Germany were hit by snowfall and frosty temperatures. November temperatures so far are well below normal.

Recent computer models show massive regions of cold having spread over Russia and Canada and now threaten to whip Europe over the weeks ahead. Interestingly the cold has split over the high Arctic and produced a mild pocket over the pole – due to a blocking pattern over the past few weeks which is expected to continue well through November.
The following chart shows the GFS 850 hPa temperature outlook for November 14, cropped from meteociel.fr. Note the warm pole:

Three days ago The Telegraph here reported: “Freezing temperatures are likely to hit Britain this winter as the polar vortex above the Arctic moves south bringing bone-chilling weather in the run up to Christmas, the Met Office has predicted.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s centre-left online weekly Die Zeit recently blared that Hurricane Matthew was “the strongest in 10 years“, and cited a scientist from the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).

Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski. Image cropped at Twitter.
The climate alarmist Die Zeit of course wants to have its readers believe that Matthew and all its destruction are because of climate change. To tell us why Matthew was “so strong”, Die Zeit journalist Alina Schadwinkel interviewed PIK scientist and Columbia University professor Anders Levermann.
Levermann implores that climate is a non-chaotic system
First Levermann tells Die Zeit how in order for a hurricane to form, it needs warm sea surfaces and the right atmospheric conditions. Strangely Levermenn then seems to be confused about what the nature of the climate system really is:
Unlike the climate, weather is chaotic and we do not know the entire atmosphere.” […] A forecast beyond three days is an enormous meteorological success.”
Here he seems to want to tell us that climate is not a chaotic system! One has to wonder if he really knows what he is talking about.

Much remains poorly understood
On El Niño’s impact on hurricanes, Levermann concedes that much remains poorly understood regarding the Pacific equatorial oceanic phenomenon, saying that “in El-Niño years there are less hurricanes. Why that is so also remains unclear.”
Stronger storms in the future due to warming
When asked if hurricanes will become more frequent in the future because of climate change, Levermann tells Die Zeit that they don’t know, but adds: “When such a storm occurs, it will be stronger because global warming provides more energy for the storm.”
Spiegel science journalist (and trained geologist) Axel Bojanowski reacted at Twitter to the claims made in the Levermann interview at Die Zeit, tweeting:
Sad that some climate scientists are claiming that hurricanes are getting stronger because of climate change.”
Moreover, Levermann also says that hurricanes cannot be ruled out for Europe in the future, and that they likely will form outside of the regular hurricane season as well!

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome kudos to Die Welt for publishing the opinion piece by one of the rare remaining fighters for liberty in Germany, Henryk Broder.

Leading German politician Volker Kauder (photo) of the CDU party aims “to ban lies from the Internet” thus suggesting the establishment of a Ministry of Truth. Image cropped from volker-kauder.de/index.html, CDU. 
With the stunning anti-establishment results coming from Brexit and the US presidential election, and the surging populist right wing parties across Europe, it is not an overstatement to say that the old continent’s established political class is in a state of sheer panic. And they are now reacting with disturbing proposals: policing the Internet for lies.
“Climate deniers” on trial?
Broder is now asking at Die Welt: “Are we getting a Ministry of Truth? Will ‘climate deniers’ be soon put on trial?”
The basis for the proposed Internet intervention is, of course, the claim that Internet users are too stupid to recognize “true” information and thus they unwittingly accept Russian “propaganda”, for example, as facts. Responsible for the distribution of false information are especially the large social media platforms such as Facebook, Youtube and Twitter – and so a clamp-down is necessary and overdue.
Leading politician Volker Kauder of Angela Merkel’s CDU party recently wrote in an opinion piece in Welt am Sonntag: “If the Internet continues to lie, then it’s over with freedom.”
Readers are free to interpret that sentence as they wish. I certainly would not take it lightly, however.
Government as keepers of the truth? “Wishful thinking”
First Broder calls Kauder’s belief that traditional news sources such as “governments, parties and associations” are neutral and doing a good job of informing the public as “wishful thinking” and he reminds readers that these elements too are also driven by their own self interests and commit the sins of “defaming critics, spreading untruths and distorting reality”.
A major target of Internet control are “climate deniers“. Broder writes:
The use of the term “climate denier’ is a nice example for this type of demagogic self-appraisal. It sounds similar to ‘Holocaust denier’ and suggests the affirmation of a crime against humanity; when in fact no one denies there is climate and that it changes  – as it has for millions of years.
The question that remains is what is man’s share and whether the travelling Climate Conference circus can agree on an end to climate change. Just asking that question today is heresy.”

Broder then criticizes Kauder’s statement that “criticism is a part of democracy, even when it’s harsh and caustic, but that it must not be ‘vulgar’“, and asks who shall judge what is what?
I have a suspicion. Could it be that the vulgarity of the citizens results from the feeling that they are being screwed and deceived by politicians, if I may express this in vulgar terms? Is it possible that this feeling may not be without justification?”
Flipside of the contempt shown by the elites
German politicians such as Kauder also are lashing out at the brutalization witnessed in the public discourse, especially in the Internet. However Broder argues that it is simply the flipside of the contempt shown by politicians, citing German Green party honcho Claudia Roth who insulted protesters directly to their face at a rally in Dresden earlier this year. Broder writes that Roth ought not be surprised when protesters angrily shouted “piss off” in response.
Now Kauder is calling for a body of laws for regulating the Internet, claiming that that the discussion has gone on long enough. He openly proposes fines for site operators who spread “lies”.
Banning lies would mean banning the occupation of politician
In summary Broder thinks it all smacks of “megalomania” and that what Kauder proposes sounds like “more surveillance, more state, more protection for politicians and fewer rights for citizens“.
Broder warns of the dangers of arbitrarily determining what is a lie, and what isn’t. Will claims that the refugee and euro policies are a failure and that the German Energiewende will crash and burn qualify as lies too and thus be subject to punishment?
Broder then brings up the subject of politicians and their habit of constantly telling lies:
And if the government plans to ban all lies, then won’t it mean a de facto ban for the occupation of politician?”
Clearly politicians such as Kauder have not thought this out at all. We suspect what is driving the latest political initiative is not the lies that are circulating in the Internet, but rather the inconvenient truths they don’t want us to see. Ultimately George Orwell’s Ministry of Truth was in fact “The Ministry of Public Deception.”
History shows it’s a bad idea
Too often societies have been burned in history by those who claimed to be the keepers of the truth. Yet everyone knows that anyone making that dubious claim is very likely an outright liar, and is in fact just the desparate loser in the forum of open public debate.
Germany’s mainstream politics are looking more and more dangerous by the day (if I may be so vulgar). Little wonder that neglected and insulted voters are finding “alternatives” increasingly attractive.

====================================================
By Schneefan
Already in August, is the year 2016 a bit cooler than the year 1998, according to satellite data from UAH. That situation remains the same as September saw a reading of +0.44°C.
The global 2m temperatures with a deviation of +0.38°K eased off slightly from the August reading of 0.42°K, see the following chart:

The above UAH chart shows the monthly deviations from the mean (blue line) of the global temperatures of the lower troposphere at 1500 meters altitude (TLT) and the 13-month running average (red curve). Due to a powerful globally time-shifted El Niño event beginning in the summer of 2015, there was a record string of months from November to March. There was a strong retreat from April to June, with temperatures stagnant near 0.44°K over the past 3 months. Source: UAH Global Temperature Update for September 2016: +0.44°CC.
What follows is a direct comparison of the January – August period for both 1998 and 2016 El Niño years:

The upper table shows the direct comparison of the global monthly UAH deviations from the mean for 1998 and 2016. The lower table shows that 2016, from January to August is now 0.06°K lower than 1998. Source: Global Temperature Report: August 2016.
Thus 1998’s lead is maintained when September is included, as there was no change.

After the temperature fall in May and June, the global cooling has taken a pause since July when observing the unfalsified global satellite data of the UAH. 

The UAH temperatures in the tropics for June show a record two month drop since satellite measurements began in 1979.

„…In the tropics, there was a record fast 2-month cooling of -0.56°C, just edging out -0.55°C in June 1998 (also an El Nino weakening year).“

Using the unfalsified data for the first alf of the year, it is clear that 2016 is not the hottest year on record so far, and that it probably will not become the record year!
There is of course a chance that 2016 could finish equal or even a bit warmer than 1998, as Dr. Roy Spencer shows with last month’s chart:

The arrow on the right side shows the temperature development that would be necessary for 2016 to reach 1998. Source:  UAH Global Temperature Update for September 2016: +0.44°C.
So what can we expect for the remainder of the year?
In October 2016 the retreat in global temperatures should resume because the global cooling La Niña is strengthening. Also the current strong retreat in sea surface temperatures (SSTA) in the main El Niño region 3.4 is clear to see:

The above plot shows the daily SSTA in the El Niño 3.4 region as a deviation from the WMO 1981-2010 mean. The data are from NOAA/CDAS (Climate Data Assimilation System). The value as of 3 October 2016 is  -0.94°K, well into La Nina territory. Source: www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/ocean/.

Beginning in 2003, software engineer William Connolley quietly removed the highly inconvenient references to the global cooling scare of the 1970s from Wikipedia, the world’s most influential and accessed informational source.
It had to be done.  Too many skeptics were (correctly) pointing out that the scientific “consensus” during the 1960s and 1970s was that the Earth had been cooling for decades, and that nascent theorizing regarding the potential for a CO2-induced global warming were still questionable and uncertain.
Not only did Connolley — a co-founder (along with Michael Mann and Gavin Schmidt) of the realclimate.com blog — successfully remove (or rewrite) the history of the 1970s global cooling scare from the Wikipedia record, he also erased (or rewrote) references to the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age so as to help create the impression that the paleoclimate is shaped like Mann’s hockey stick graph, with unprecedented and dangerous 20th/21st century warmth.
A 2009 investigative report from UK’s Telegraph detailed the extent of dictatorial-like powers Connolley possessed at Wikipedia, allowing him to remove inconvenient scientific information that didn’t conform to his point of view.
“All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions. Acolytes whose writing conformed to Connolley’s global warming views, in contrast, were rewarded with Wikipedia’s blessings. In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.“
After eviscerating references to 1970s global cooling scare and the warmer-than-now Medieval Warm Period from Wikipedia, and after personally rewriting the Wikipedia commentaries on the greenhouse effect to impute a central, dominant role for CO2, Connolley went on to team up with two other authors to publish a “consensus” manifesto in 2008 that claimed to exp”ose the 1970s global cooling scare as a myth, as something that never really happened.
Peterson, Connolley, and Fleck (2008, hereafter PCF08) published “The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus” in Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, hoping to quash once and for all  the perception that there were scientists in the 1960s and 1970s who agreed the Earth was cooling (and may continue to do so), or that CO2 did not play a dominant role in climate change.
The Concoction Of ‘Consensus’ Achieved Via Exclusion
The primary theme of PCF08 can be summarized in 4 succinctly quoted sentences from the paper:
“[T]he following pervasive myth arose [among skeptics]: there was a consensus among climate scientists of the 1970s that either global cooling or a full-fledged ice age was imminent. A review of the climate science literature from 1965 to 1979 shows this myth to be false. … During the period from 1965 through 1979, our literature survey found 7 cooling, 20 neutral, and 44 warming papers. … There was no scientific consensus in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an imminent ice age. Indeed, the possibility of anthropogenic warming dominated the peer-reviewed literature even then.”
William Connolley and colleagues claimed that the determination of scientific “consensus” regarding global cooling and the influence of CO2 on climate during the 1970s could be divined by counting scientific publications that fell into arbitrarily-defined categories which allowed them to intentionally exclude hundreds of papers that would undermine the alleged myth-slaying purpose of the paper.
The PCF08 authors decided that when “quantifying the consensus” (by counting publications), a scientific paper could only be classified as a “cooling” paper if it projected that future temperatures would (continue to) decline, or that a “full-fledged ice age was imminent.”   Papers published during the arbitrarily chosen 1965-’79 era that affirmed the climate had already been cooling for decades, that this cooling wasn’t a positive development, and/or that the effects of CO2 on climate were questionable or superseded by other more influential climate change mechanisms … were not considered worthy of classification as a “cooling” paper, or as a paper that disagreed with the claimed “consensus” that said the current (1960s-’70s) global cooling will someday be replaced by CO2-induced global warming.
Of course, the global cooling scare during the 1970s was not narrowly or exclusively focused upon what the temperatures might look like in the future, or whether or not an ice age was “imminent”.  It was primarily about the ongoing cooling that had been taking place for decades, the negative impacts this cooling had already exerted (on extreme weather patterns, on food production, etc.), and uncertainties associated with the causes of climatic changes.
By tendentiously excluding 1960s and 1970s publications that documented global cooling had been ongoing and a concern, as well as purposely excluding papers that suggested the climate’s sensitivity to CO2 forcing is weak or questionable relative to other mechanisms, the authors could brazenly claim that there were only 7 papers published in the scientific literature between 1965 and 1979  that disagreed with the “consensus” opinion that global warming would occur at some point in the future (due to CO2 increases).  According to PCF08, there were 44 papers that fell into the latter warming-is-imminent-due-to-CO2 category from 1965-’79, ostensibly entitling them to claim that dangerous anthropogenic global warming projections “dominated” the scientific literature even then.

As will be shown here, the claim that there were only 7 publications from that era disagreeing with the presupposed CO2-warming “consensus” is preposterous.  Because when including the papers from the 1960s and 1970s that indicated the globe had cooled (by -0.3° C between the 1940s and ’70s), that this cooling was concerning (leading to extreme weather, drought, depressed crop yields, etc.), and/or that CO2’s climate influence was questionable to negligible, a conservative estimate for the number of scientific publications that did not agree with the alleged CO2-warming “consensus” was 220 papers for the 1965-’79 period, not 7.  If including papers published between 1960 and 1989, the “non-consensus” or “cooling” papers reaches 285.
Again, these estimates should be viewed as conservative.  There are likely many dozen more scientific papers from the 1960s-’70s cooling scare era that would probably fall into the category of a “cooling” paper, but have not yet been made available to view in full online.
But let us say that the PCF08 claim is true, and that there were indeed only 44 papers published between 1965-’79 that endorsed the position that the Earth’s climate is predominately shaped by CO2 concentrations, and thus the Earth would someday start warming as the models had suggested.   Interestingly, if we were to employ the hopelessly flawed methodology of divining the relative degree of scientific “consensus” by counting the number of papers that agree with one position or another (just as blogger John Cook and colleagues did with their 2013 paper “Quantifying the Consensus…” that yielded a predetermined result of 97% via categorical manipulation), the 220 “cooling” papers published between 1965-’79 could represent an 83.3% global cooling consensus for the era (220/264 papers), versus only a 16.7% consensus for anthropogenic global warming (44/264 papers).
The 1970s Global Cooling Scare Was Not Mythological
In reviewing the available scientific literature from the 1960s-’80s, it is plainly evident that there was a great deal of concern about the ongoing global cooling, which had amounted to -0.5°C in the Northern Hemisphere and -0.3°C globally between the 1940s and 1970s.
Of course, this inconvenient global-scale cooling of -0.3°C between the 1940s and 1970s has necessarily been almost completely removed from the instrumental record by NASA (GISS) and the MetOffice (HadCRUT).   After all, the observations (of cooling) conflicted with climate modeling.  Overseers of the surface temperature datasets (such as the MetOffice’s Phil Jones or NASA’s Gavin Schmidt)  have recently adjusted the -0.3°C of cooling down to just hundredths of a degree of cooling.   NASA GISS, for example, has reduced (via “adjustments”) the global cooling down to about -0.01°C between the 1940s and 1970s, as shown below.  It is likely that, during the next few years of adjustments to past data, the mid-20th century global cooling period will disappear altogether and mutate into a warming period.

For those who actually experienced the non-mythological cooling scare during the 1960s and 1970s (that has since been made to disappear from graphs), the consequences of the -0.5° Northern Hemispheric cooling  (especially) were frequently discussed in scientific publications. There were geoengineering strategies proposed by scientists to melt Arctic sea ice.   Droughts and floods and extreme weather anomalies/variability were blamed on the ongoing global cooling.   Glaciers were advancing, even surging at accelerated rates during this period.  Sea ice growth and severe Arctic cooling meant that the oceans were much less navigable.  Crop growth and food production slowed as the Earth cooled, which was of great concern to world governments.  Severe winters in the 1960s and 1970s led many climatologists to assume that the Earth was returning to an 1800s-like Little Ice Age climate.  Observations of mammals migrating to warmer climates during the 1960s and 1970s due to the colder temperatures were reported in scientific papers.
Synonyms for the 1960s-’70s climate cooling conditions commonly used in the literature were words such as deterioration, recession, detrimental,  and severe.  In contrast, warming periods such as during the warmer Medieval times or the warm-up during the first half of the 20th century were referred to positively, or as optimum (i.e., the Medieval Warm Period was referred to as the “Little Optimum”).
According to Stewart and Glantz (1985), in the early 1970s it was the “prevailing view” among scientists that the Earth was headed into another ice age.  It wasn’t until the late ’70s that scientists changed their minds and the  “prevailing view” began shifting to warming.   This is in direct contradiction to the claims of PCF08, who allege warming was the prevailing view among scientists in the 1960s and early 1970s too.  Furthermore, as recently as 1985, it was still acknowledged that “the causes of global climate change remain in dispute.”
Stewart and Glantz, 1985
“The conclusions of the NDU study might have been predicted from a knowledge of the prevailing ‘spirit of the times’ (i.e., the prevailing mood in the science community) when the first part was conducted. This was an interesting time in recent history of climate studies. One could effectively argue that in the early 1970s the prevailing view was that the earth was moving toward a new ice age. Many articles appeared in the scientific literature as well as in the popular press speculating about the impact on agriculture of a 1-2°C cooling. By the late 1970s that prevailing view had seemingly shifted 180 degrees to the belief that the earth’s atmosphere was being warmed as a result of an increasing CO2 loading of the atmosphere.  … The causes of global climate change remain in dispute.  Existing theories of climate, atmospheric models, and actuarial experience are inadequate to meet the needs of policymakers for information about future climate.”
According to scientists reporting to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (1974), 22 of 27 forecasting methods predicted a cooling trend for the next 25 years, and “meteorological experts” were thinking an 1800s climate was around the corner, with the concomitant return to monsoon failures, shorter growing seasons, and “violent weather”.
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency,1974
Potential Implications of Trends in World Population, Food Production, and Climate
“According to Dr. Hubert Lamb–an outstanding British climatologist–22 out of 27 forecasting methods he examined predicted a cooling trend through the remainder of this century.  A change of 2°-3° F. in average temperature would have an enormous impact.  … A number of meteorological experts are thinking in terms of a return to a climate like that of the 19th century.  This would mean that within a relatively few years (probably less than two decades, assuming the cooling trend began in the 1960’s) there would be brought belts of excess and deficit rainfall in the middle-latitudes; more frequent failure of the monsoons that dominate the Indian sub-continent, south China and western Africa; shorter growing seasons for Canada, northern Russia and north China.  Europe could expect to be cooler and wetter. … [I]n periods when climate change [cooling] is underway, violent weather — unseasonal frosts, warm spells, large storms, floods, etc.–is thought to be more common.”
The Selective Emphasis On Particular Scientific ‘Facts’ To Advance An Agenda
It is rather ironic that the below quote impugning the motives of “skeptics” by Connolley and his co-authors (PCF08) appeared in a paper that insisted the 1970s concerns about global cooling never really happened from a scientific standpoint, and their “proof” that it never really happened is that they could only manage to locate 7 scientific papers (via selection bias) that supported this “contrarian” view:
PCF08:
“Underlying the selective quotation of the past literature is an example of what political scientist Daniel Sarewitz calls ‘scientization’ of political debate: the selective emphasis on particular scientific ‘facts’ to advance a particular set of political values.  In this case, the primary use of the myth is in the context of attempting to undermine public belief in and support for the contemporary scientific consensus about anthropogenic climate change by appeal to a past “consensus” on a closely related topic that is alleged to have been wrong.”
William Connolley may have successfully erased the Medieval Warm Period and 1970s cooling concerns from the pages of Wikipedia.  He may have successfully written over 5,400 original Wikipedia articles in an attempt to persuade the public to believe in a dominant role for humans and CO2 in causing climate changes.  But the internet has a long and expansive memory, and  it is unforgiving when opportunists and activists attempt to dupe the public by concocting false narratives and employing the very same practice of “scientization” they hypocritically claim to deride.
285 Scientific Publications Affirming A Global Cooling/Weak CO2 Influence ‘Consensus’
Again, there were at least 285 scientific publications that did not agree with the alleged CO2-warming “consensus” opinion during the 1960s to 1980s.  The list is divided into several sub-sections:
Cooling Since 1940, Forecasts for Continued Cooling/Ice Age (156 papers)
Dubious Human Influence on Climate, Low CO2 Climate Sensitivity (44 papers)
Rising CO2 Leads to Cooling (7)
Uncertainties, Lack of Climate Understanding, Climate Modeling Problems (30)
Miscellaneous Questionable Human, CO2 Influence on Climate (12)
Non-CO2 Climate Change Mechanisms (26)
Warmer past despite lower CO2 (10)
The complete list of 285 Global Cooling/Weak CO2 Influence papers from the 1960s to 1980s  can be found using the below links:
Part 1
Part 2
Part 3
For those who may lack the time (or interest) to view the full list of 285, a summarized version of 35 sample papers are listed below.  Keep in mind that these 35 sample publications represent  less than 1/8th of the total volume of papers published during that era, affirming the position that concerns about global cooling were quite real, widespread, and scientifically-supported.
35 Sample Global Cooling/Low CO2 Climate Influence Papers
Cimorelli and House, 1974
“Between 1880 and 1940 a net [global] warming of about 0.6°C occurred, and from 1940 to the present our globe experienced a net cooling of 0.3°C. … [I]t has since been found that the rate of temperature increase decreases with increasing CO2 and increases with increasing particulates. Therefore, global particulate loading is of foremost concern. … [A]n increase in man-made global particulates by a factor of 4.0 will initiate an ice-age. In order that we safeguard ourselves and future generations from a self-imposed ice-age it is necessary that we effectively monitor global concentrations of particulate matter.”
Angell and Korshover, 1978
“[T]he 1976 surface temperature equated the global record for the lowest temperature set in 1964; but even so the trend in global temperature since 1965 has been small compared to the 0.5°C decrease during 1960–65.”
Schultz, 1972
“The nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) have been moving northward in the Great Plains region from the late 1800s to the 1950s but now seem to be retreating from their lately acquired northern range. The armadillos have a nontypical homoiothermic blood system which makes them fairly vulnerable to cold climates.”
Wendland, 1977
“The cooling from about 1950 to 1974 is ~0.3°C (Brinkmann, 1976).  Moran (1975) suggests that the recent drought of peninsular Florida is largely due to decreased frequencies of tropical storms, associated with the general atmospheric and oceanic cooling since about 1940 (Wahl and Bryson, 1975).”
Nelson et al., 1975
“Concern about climatic change and its effects on man has been increasing. Climatic changes affect the production of food and the allocation of energy resources. … Even with the temperature corrections included, Indiana June, July and August mean temperatures showed a decrease of approximately 3°F [-1.7°C] from 1930 to 1976.”
Douglas, 1975
“According  to the academy  report on climate, we may be approaching the end of a major interglacial cycle, with the approach of a full-blown 10,000-year ice age a real possibility.”
Bray, 1971
“Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide content was concluded to have had an ambiguous climatic influence and may be less important than sometimes considered. Several studies have suggested increased turbidity has produced a recent global cooling trend.”
Willett, 1974
“[T]he author is convinced that recent increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide have contributed much less than 5% of the recent changes of atmospheric temperature, and will contribute no more than that in the foreseeable future.”
Ellsaesser , 1974

“The 1968 AAAS Symposium on Global Effects of Environmental Pollution initiated a flood of papers supporting monotonically if not exponentially increasing pollution. The particulate increases were usually cited as at least contributing to the post 1940 cooling and possibly capable of bringing on another  ice age.”
Schneider, 1974
Introduction: “In the last century it is possible to document an increase of about 0.6°C in the mean global temperature between 1880 and 1940 and a subsequent fall of temperature by about 0.3°C since 1940.  In the polar regions north of 70° latitude the decrease in temperature in the past decade alone has been about 1°C, several times larger than the global average decrease.  Up till now, past climatic changes (except possibly those of the last few decades [of cooling temperatures]) could hardly have been caused by man’s activities.”
Collis, 1975
“It is not clear how such favorable and relatively consistent conditions are related to the higher temperatures in this century or the peaking of temperatures around 1940.  The reversal of this warming trend, however, could mark the beginning of a new ice age as some climatologists have indicated.  It should be noted, though, that even if we are in fact heading for another ice age, many years or decades will elapse before this will become apparent”
Gilchrist, 1983
“Unlike some other pollutants introduced into the atmosphere by Man, carbon dioxide is naturally occurring and non-toxic. The direct effect of increased concentrations may be beneficial notably because it will tend to increase the rate of photosynthesis in plants. On the other hand, there may be deleterious effects through its influence on climate but this is still unproven and we cannot be certain whether, on a global scale, it will on the whole be harmful or beneficial. … The problem of determining the effect of increased carbon dioxide on climate is difficult, the more so because there are some essential aspects of the physical basis of climate that are not well understood”
Magill, 1980
“Recent anomalous weather conditions of the 1970s have revealed the possibility that significant aberrations in global climate have and are occurring with serious consequences.  The 1970s have seen a generally overall greater variability and instability of global weather.  Regions in Asia, Central America, and Africa have witnessed a higher frequency of monsoon failure which has led to a prevalence of severe drought conditions and an extension of desert boundaries.  Whereas in other parts of the globe, severe flooding has been recorded. … Records of past climates have indicated that a greater variability of climate is generally synonymous with a major cooling trend in temperatures.”
Bryant, 1987
Conclusions: “The scenario of a CO2-warming globe contains many uncertainties.  The warming of the atmosphere is not an established fact, and even if it was there may be no need to invoke increased atmospheric CO2 or other ‘greenhouse’ gases as the cause when such warmings have been a part of our temperature time series historically.”
Gordon, 1981
“Since about 1968/69 the glacier fronts have advanced by up to 158 m following a marked climatic recession [cooling] during the 1960s and early 1970s.”
Kukla, 1972
“A new glacial insolation regime, expected to last 8000 years, began just recently. Mean global temperatures may eventually drop about 1oC in the next hundred years.”
Williamson, 1975
“Between 1000 and 1300 average summer [Arctic] temperatures were about 1°C higher than today, with the mean annual temperature higher by perhaps 4°C in a largely ice-free Arctic. … [B]etween 1900 and 1940, the most striking temperature gains occurring in the Arctic winter… an average rise of more than 8°C keeping her seas ice-free for seven months of the year instead of barely three months less than a century before. … Since about 1958 the reduced heat transport via the warm air sectors of the depressions has permitted an increase in pack-ice off northern and eastern Iceland to a condition comparable with the 1880s, and Polar Bears Thalarctos maritimus have been able to cross from Greenland for the first time for half a century (Marshall 1968). This relapse from warmth continued into the 1970s with one winter, 1962/63, as devastating over the English Midlands and south as anything experienced since 1740 (Manley n.d., Lamb 1966, Booth 1968). People asked, are we on the threshold of another long climatic recession?”
Robock, 1978
“Instrumental surface temperature records have been compiled for large portions of the globe for about the past 100 years (Mitchell, 1961; Budyko, 1969). They show that the Northern Hemisphere annual mean temperature has risen about 1°C from 1880 to about 1940 and has fallen about 0.5 °C since then … Climate change may be a natural internal feature of the land-oceanic-atmosphere (climate) system.  … Three runs were made testing anthropogenic effects of CO2, aerosols and heat. … One could sum the anthropogenic effects for each region, which would show almost no effect in the NH and warming in the SH. … Because the magnitudes of the effects are small, and may cancel, it cannot be concluded that these high correlations show that man has produced climate change.”
Karl et al., 1984
“An appreciable number of nonurban stations in the United States and Canada have been identified with statistically significant (at the 90% level) decreasing trends in the monthly mean diurnal temperature range between 1941–80.”
Newell, 1974 
“At the present the imbalance is thought to correspond to a natural cooling of the ocean, which will lead to the next Ice Age.”
Barrett, 1978
“In particular, detection of an anthropogenic influence through statistical analysis alone requires a long run of data of good quality and careful attention to measures of significance. It is most important to avoid the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy that a trend of a few years’ duration or less, following some change in human activities, can be attributed to that change even when no sound physical causal relationship is evident.”
Bulatov and Zakharov, 1978
Changes in the amount of multi‐year ice in arctic seas during the current cooling trend
“[T]he southern boundary of old ice was up to 100 miles farther south to the west of the divide, and up to 100 miles farther north to the east. The significance of these changes with regard to navigation conditions is self‐evident.”
Post, 1979
“Concern over the vulnerability of a heavily populated world to climatic fluctuations affecting harvests and world food supply has emerged only recently.  This concern has been stimulated by anomalous weather patterns beginning with the colder winters in Europe and North America in the 1960s, the Indian monsoon failures and droughts in the Soviet and Chinese grainlands in that decade and since, and the drought which continued for many years in Africa and brought chaos to the Sahel and Ethiopia.  But, despite the computer revolution in meteorology, no generally accepted theory of climatic change to inform the future exists at this time.”
Dunbar, 1976
“[T]he measured increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, according to the most recent computations, would not be enough to have any measurable climatic effect.”
Fletcher, 1969
SPECIFIC SCHEMES FOR CLIMATE MODIFICATION
Ice Free Arctic Ocean The largest scale enterprise that has been discussed is that of transforming the Arctic into an ice free ocean.
Bering Strait Dam  The basic idea is to increase the inflow of warm Atlantic water by stopping or oven reversing the present northward flow of colder water through Bering Strait.
Deflecting the Kuroshio Current   It has been proposed that the narrow mouth of Tatarsk Strait be blocked by a giant “water valve” to increase the warm inflow to the Sea of Okhotsk and reduce the winter ice there.
Eichenlaub, 1971
“Evidence derived from the carefully screened temperature record at Eau Claire, Mich., and from radiosonde data at [A] return to the temperature and circulation features of the early and mid-19th century in the eastern United States may be underway. … All 3 mo[nths] show temperature declines since the height of the recent climatic optimum during the 1930s.  July temperatures have decreased about 3.5°F since the decades beginning with the early 1930s, and August temperatures have decreased about 3°F since the decades beginning with the late 1930s and early 1940s.”
Holdren and Ehrlich, 1971
Global Ecology: Readings toward a rational strategy for man [pgs. 76,77]
“A final push in the cooling direction comes from man-made changes in the direct reflectivity of the earth’s surface (albedo) through urbanization, deforestation, and the enlargement of deserts.  The effects of a new ice age on agriculture and the supportability of large human populations scarcely need elaboration here. Even more dramatic results are possible, however; for instance, a sudden outward slumping in the Antarctic ice cap, induced by added weight, could generate a tidal wave of proportions unprecedented in recorded history.”
Lamb, 1966
“The large-scale circulation of the atmosphere during the current decade has produced patterns that had never been seen earlier in this century, but which seem to represent a recurrence of a regime that prevailed over long periods before 1895.  … On this evidence, something like the climatic regime of the years since 1960 should probably be expected to persist till the end of the century or beyond”
Newell and Dopplick, 1979
“Estimates of the atmospheric temperature changes due to a doubling of CO2 concentration have be with a standard radiative flux model.  They yield temperature changes of >0.25 K.  It appears that the much larger changes predicted by other models arise from additional water vapor evaporated into the atmosphere and not from the CO2 itself. … It is important to stress…that CO2 is not the main constituent involved in infrared transfer.  Water vapor plays the major role and ozone is also of importance.”
Benton, 1970
“In the period from 1880 to 1940, the mean temperature of the earth increased about 0.6°C; from 1940 to 1970, it decreased by 0.3-0.4°C. Locally, temperature changes as large as 3-4°C per decade have been recorded, especially in sub-polar regions.  … The drop in the earth’s temperature since 1940 has been paralleled by a substantial increase in natural volcanism. The effect of such volcanic activity is probably greater than the effect of manmade pollutants.”
Skeeter, 1985
“In 1970, Mitchell stated that by the late 1960s global temperatures had fallen 0.3°C from the peak in the 1940s, approximately one-half of the prior rise.  …  Summaries by Schneider and Dickenson, Kalnicky, Robuck, Roberts, and Agee all report Northern Hemisphere temperatures declines by at least 0.5°C since the 1940s. In summary, Gribbin states ‘In worldwide terms, we are in a situation where the earth is cooling more quickly than it warmed up earlier this century.’  From the above it is clear that the general consensus in the recent literature is that there has been a cooling in the Northern Hemisphere since the early 1940s.”
Kondratiev and Niilisk, 1960
On the question of carbon dioxide heat radiation in the atmosphere
“The dependence of atmospheric heat radiation on CO2 and H2O contents and also on temperature vertical distribution is investigated with the help of the radiation chart.  It is shown that the heat radiation of the atmosphere almost doesn’t depend on variations of carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere.”
Hustich, 1978
“The climatic ‘improvement’ of the late 1930’s had, as was expected, given way to a colder trend in the 1950’s and 1960’s … Dunbar (1976, p. 190) writes that he finds it “difficult to believe that either Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, water vapour, freon, or any other substance produced by man’s efforts is going to compete seriously with Nature in changing our climate”.  … Heino’s diagrams illustrate the exceptional nature of the climatic improvement experienced in the 1930’s, but they also show clearly the slow deterioration which set in in the 1950’s. The 1960’s constituted climatically a rather unfavourable decade from man’s point of view”
Wahl and Lawson, 1970
“Lamb (1966) had already suggested that it appears likely that we have passed the height of the warming episode in the first half of this century and are now reverting to a pattern characterized by lower zonal flow and intensification of the trough/ridge systems, essentially a reestablishment of the climatic character of the last century.”
Libby, 1970

WEATHER MODIFICATION BY CHANGING CO2 CONTENT OF ATMOSPHERE [p. 48]
Item: American Scientist, January-February 1970, p. 18, “‘Though dire effects on climate of an increase in CO2 have been predicted, they are far from being established. The cycle is not really understood; carbon dioxide may well prove to be the least objectionable or the only beneficial addition to the atmosphere from industrial sources'”

"World leaders are meeting in Spain to decide whether or not to bother with preventing the destruction of the earth, like people in a vehicle speeding toward a cliff deciding whether to brake or swerve or just chat about other things. Powerful senior citizens in the United States – Trump, Giuliani, Biden – are trading playground insults, and the middle-aged people who make a lot of decisions about how to handle this emergency seem incapable of thinking beyond the singularly imagination-killing criterion of short-term profit. I began writing this column at a Youth v Apocalypse demonstration in San Francisco. The protest, which was led by teens, of course, as well as some of the 20-something members of the Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion, took place in front of Black Rock, the world’s largest investor in fossil fuels. There was a little cluster of mothers at the demonstration too, with babies and toddlers whose life expectancy, barring catastrophes, extends into the 22nd century. It was a Fridays for Future demonstration taking place all over the world, with half a million mostly young people in Madrid.  Sometimes I think that our species was for most of its history a child: it had limited capacity to harm and thus limited responsibility to do no harm. We could kill each other, but we did it without napalm and nuclear weapons that kill a lot of other things. We could think small because we acted small, mostly; we were altering the earth with hunting, grazing, farming, foraging, building, but most of our traces would vanish and most of our impact left no lasting damage. With the industrial revolution and its reliance on fossil fuels and with technologies capable of changing the earth on a more profound scale, childhood harmlessness faded into the past for those who wielded those powers and used those tools and benefitted from it all. Humans ceased to be human-scale, but our imaginations and ethics lagged behind our impact. We have for two centuries been in a sort of wild adolescence, too reckless and impatient to pay attention to consequences or to listen to the Rachel Carsons and Vandana Shivas when they point out that there are consequences. Because, really, environmentalism has been to no small degree about shouting “don’t break that” and “clean up your room” at corporations and governments. We are on the brink, and part of what that brink is, I believe, is the necessary end of that adolescence. As a species we must act with restraint in the face of consequences, must consider the other species with us now, those of our own not yet born, and those currently facing ultimate climate vulnerability around the world from floods, fire, sea level rise, crop failure, superstorms and more. We must expand our imaginations and act on that bigger understanding of our place in the world and our impact on the future. That means making radical changes, like our homes and transit being powered by renewables, our government not plotting more extractivism. It means leaving fossil fuels in the ground, where they belong. We need to remind ourselves why these changes are necessary: that the earth is finite, that actions have consequences, that they go beyond the horizon of what we can see and hear, in time and space, that those who come after us have rights we can’t just annihilate. We must make sweeping changes by the end of the coming decade, and we must stick to them afterward by remembering why they matter. What is striking in this moment is that such maturity is largely the property of the young. Many of the significant grownups in the room of climate chaos are 16 or 20 or 27, Greta and the thousands of youths like her who are less visible but no less committed, the teens from Nigeria to Alaska doing their utmost for the climate. But because they are truly young, they control no shares, have no votes, sit on no boards: they need us as we need them. They are the leadership in this moment, the people who are thinking about 2100, the people who are ready to change everything, the people who understand the gravity and scale of the catastrophe. They are the people who have never experienced a below-average temperature on Earth, who have the capacity to recognise we are in an emergency. There is wisdom in youth, in its lack of attachment to the status quo that is not their status quo, and in its ability to imagine profound change. There have been farsighted altruistic people in every generation, but there are signs of a wider evolution of imagination that is taking place among the young. We see that profound change in new ways of dealing with conflict, with rejecting competition and capitalism, new understandings of what is possible and ethical. We see the children are mature and too many old people are juvenile (though bless Jane Fonda at 81 for her #FireDrillFriday protests). Juvenility and maturity are no longer categories attached to how long you’ve been on Earth, but how far you see and how much you care. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist"
"Humanity faces an existential threat. Forests burn from America to Australia. Deserts are advancing across Africa and Asia. Rising sea levels threaten our European cities as well as Pacific islands. Mankind has seen such phenomena before, but never at this speed. The recently flood-hit communities in areas around England know all too well the cost and damage that extreme weather can cause.Science tells us that we can still stop this epidemic, but we are running out of time. The new European commission is wasting no time. On Wednesday, we present the European Green Deal.  Our goal is to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, slowing down global heating and mitigating its effects. This is a task for our generation and the next, but change must begin right now – and we know we can do it. The European Green Deal is Europe’s new growth strategy. It will cut emissions while also creating jobs and improving our quality of life. It is the green thread that will run through all our policies – from transport to taxation, food to farming, industry to infrastructure. We want to invest in clean energy and extend emissions trading, but we will also boost the circular economy and preserve biodiversity. The European Green Deal is not just a necessity: it will be a driver of new economic opportunities. Many European firms are already going green, cutting their carbon footprint and discovering clean technologies. They understand that there are planetary limitations and European companies of all sizes understand that everyone has to take care of our common home. They also know that if they discover the sustainable solutions of tomorrow, this will give them an advantage. What businesses and others need from us is easy access to financing. To pull this off, we will deliver a sustainable European investment plan, supporting €1 trillion of investment over the next decade. In March, we will propose the first European climate law to chart the way ahead and make this irreversible: investors, innovators and entrepreneurs need clear rules to plan their long-term investments. While we will promote transformation in how we produce and consume, live and work, we must also protect those who risk being hit harder by such change. This transition must work for all or it will not work at all. I will propose to set up a just transition fund to mobilise, together with the leverage of the European Investment Bank and private money, €100bn in investment over the next seven years. We will make sure that we help those European regions that will have to take the biggest steps, so that we leave no one behind. Across Europe, people young and old are not only asking for climate action, they are already changing their lifestyle: think of the commuters who use bikes or public transport, parents who choose reusable nappies, companies that renounce single-use plastics and bring sustainable alternatives to the market. Many of us are part of this global movement. Climate action protests have seen thousands take to the streets around Britain. But away from the cameras, campaigns such as the Great British Beach Clean organised by the Marine Conservation Society remove tonnes of litter from British coastlines annually. Nine European citizens out of 10 ask for decisive climate action. Our children rely on us. Europeans want the EU to act at home and lead abroad. People around the world are meeting in Madrid for the UN conference on climate, to discuss collective action against global heating. The European Green Deal is our response. It is a deal by Europe, for Europe, and a contribution to a better world. Every European can be part of the change. • Ursula von der Leyen is president of the European commission"

As the authors point out, and as the graph above shows, in the areas where the waters warmed (light red shaded), glacier retreat was observed to be most pronounced (blood red points).  In the regions (Bransfield Strait) where the ocean waters cooled (blue shaded), glaciers were in balance and even advanced (blue points).  Citing this strong correlation between regional ocean warming/cooling and regional glacier retreat/advance, the authors concluded that the long-held assumption that atmospheric and surface  warming (presumably driven by greenhouse gases) was what primarily caused Antarctic glaciers to recede is not supported by the evidence.  Instead, it is the temperature of the ocean waters that “have been the predominant control on multidecadal glacier front behavior in the western AP.”
Cook et al., 2016
“Here, we identify a strong correspondence between mid-depth ocean temperatures and glacier-front changes along  the ~1000-kilometer western coastline. In the south, glaciers that terminate in warm Circumpolar Deep Water have undergone considerable retreat, whereas those in the far northwest, which terminate in cooler waters, have not. Furthermore, a mid-ocean warming since the 1990s in the south is coincident with widespread acceleration of glacier retreat. We conclude that changes in ocean-induced melting are the primary cause of retreat for glaciers in this region. … [S]everal recent studies of Arctic glaciers have concluded that calving rates are strongly dependent on ocean temperatures. Until now, the role of the ocean (as opposed to the atmosphere) as the dominant driver of glacier frontal retreat on the western AP has not been considered…. We conclude that ocean temperatures below 100-m depth have been the predominant control on multidecadal glacier front behavior in the western AP.”
It should be pointed out that the decadal-scale changes in the heat content of the layers of abyssal vs. surface Southern Ocean are entirely consistent with what is expected with natural variability.  As scientists Latif et al. (2013) explain:
“During phases of deep convection the surface Southern Ocean warms, the abyssal Southern Ocean cools, Antarctic sea ice extent retreats, and the low-level atmospheric circulation over the Southern Ocean weakens. After the halt of deep convection, the surface Southern Ocean cools, the abyssal Southern Ocean warms, Antarctic sea ice expands, and the low-level atmospheric circulation over the Southern Ocean intensifies, consistent with what has been observed during the recent decades.”
Referencing these natural heat changes and their climatic consequences,  the ocean depth where there has been significant warming in the region of  the AP in recent decades is primarily confined to  the 150 to 400 m layer as  identified by Cook et al. (2016).   As the below graph  from the paper shows, not only did the northern  section of the 0-400 m layer not warm (as shown in the green/blue coloration areas), most of the 0-100 m layer for the AP region did not warm either.  So the ocean warming for the AP has been primarily confined to the bottom half to three-quarters of the region, and only in the 150 to 400 m layer, not the 0-100 m layer, where it has been too cold to melt ice.

This lack of warming – and, in fact, cooling – in large sections of the oceanic and land-based Antarctic Peninsula region has been documented in other scientific studies.  For example, Turner et al. (2016), in their paper entitled, “Absence of 21st century warming on Antarctic Peninsula consistent with natural variability,” have documented that the surface temperatures for the Antarctic Peninsula – which are often attributed to greenhouse gas forcing – have not warmed overall since the late 1970s, and in fact they’ve undergone a significant cooling trend for the last 1 1/2 decades.

Turner et al., 2016
“Here we use a stacked temperature record to show an absence of regional [Antarctic Peninsula] warming since the late 1990s. The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate, with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer.”
Furthermore, Jones et al. (2016) have found that surfaces temperatures for the Southern Ocean – which surrounds the entire Antarctic continent – have dropped significantly since the late 1970s, as they show in the graph from their paper.

Of course, as the ocean surface near Antarctica has continued to cool for going on 4 decades now, this has led to a significant  net growth in the overall sea ice area surrounding Anarctica, as also documented by Jones et al. (2016).

As further evidence that Antarctica as a whole has not been cooperating with climate models and the assumption that carbon dioxide is a significant determinant of glacier, sea ice, and temperature variability, Jones et al. (2016) conclude by saying that “climate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends” and that “natural variability overwhelms the forced response in the observations.”
Jones et al., 2016
“Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. Most observed trends, however, are not unusual when compared with Antarctic palaeoclimate records of the past two centuries.
“[C]limate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends. This suggests that natural variability overwhelms the forced response in the observations, but the models may not fully represent this natural variability or may overestimate the magnitude of the forced response.”
There are even graphs from the Jones et al. (2016) paper that show that West Antarctica, coastal East Antarctica, and the Antarctic Plateau have not undergone an obvious warming trend in the last 200+ years.

In fact, other recent studies also indicate that not only the AP, but the entire Antarctic continent’s temperatures have been stable to cooling slightly since the 1970s, and that, contrary to climate modeling, glaciers have been advancing more than they’ve been receding, or that ice melt volume has been declining (ice is melting less, not more) since the 1970s.
For example, like Cook et al. (2016) cited above, Kuippers Munneke et al. (2012) also conclude that atmospheric or surface warming (due to greenhouse gases, presumably) is not controlling glacier melt, but instead “a picture emerges in which the ultimate fate of ice shelves is governed by oceanic forcing from below“.

“None of the regions in Antarctica show a statistically significant trend in melt volume over the period 1979–2010. … Of the four Antarctic Peninsula stations that have an air temperature record for 1979–2010, only Faraday exhibits a statistically significant warming trend in summer temperature for that period.  A reconstruction of [Antarctica] near-surface temperature….leaves DJF [December-February] temperature trends for 1979–2010 insignificant over nearly the entire continent, and mostly suggests statistically insignificant cooling along the coastal margins. This finding also seems consistent with RACMO2 DJF near surface temperatures, which show no statistically significant trends for 1979–2010 in any of the areas that experience melt. … A picture emerges in which the ultimate fate of ice shelves is governed by oceanic forcing from below.”

For East Antarctica, not only have surface temperatures been cooling since the early 1960s, a significant majority of glaciers have been advancing, not retreating, since about 1990.
Miles et al., 2013
“Here we present multidecadal trends in the terminus position of 175 ocean-terminating outlet glaciers along 5,400 kilometres of the margin of the East Antarctic ice sheet, and reveal widespread and synchronous changes. Despite large fluctuations between glaciers—linked to their size—three epochal patterns emerged: 63 per cent of glaciers retreated from 1974 to 1990, 72 per cent advanced from 1990 to 2000, and 58 per cent advanced from 2000 to 2010.”

Of course, none of these observed non-warming, glacier-advancing trends for Antarctica are compatible with assumptions about anthropogenic forcing, or the increase in CO2 emissions.  In fact, scientists have even found that increasing CO2 concentrations has a net cooling effect, not a net warming effect, on central Antarctica.
Schmithüsen et al., 2015
“For this region [central Antarctica], the emission to space is higher than the surface emission; and the greenhouse effect of CO2 is around zero or even negative, which has not been discussed so far. We investigated this in detail and show that for central Antarctica an increase in CO2 concentration leads to an increased long-wave energy loss to space, which cools the Earth-atmosphere system.  For most of the Antarctic Plateau, GHE-TES [greenhouse effect as measured by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer] is close to zero or even slightly negative; i.e., the presence of CO2 increases radiative cooling.”
So instead of an anthropogenic influence on trends in Antarctica, scientists are increasingly publishing papers documenting that the Antarctic climate is strongly dominated by natural factors (ENSO, SAM, planetary waves, etc.), not human activity.  Even Eric Steig, avid defender of the CO2-dominated climate, recently acknowledged in a blog comment (#26) that “the evidence that the current retreat of Antarctic glaciers is owing to anthropogenic global warming is weak.”
Below are a tiny sample papers documenting a natural dominance over the Antarctic climate, and concluding that “detecting an anthropogenic signal … is challenging”.  Unfortunately, these are the scientific papers that don’t get much attention, as they don’t endorse the humans-are-causing-dangerous-glacier-melting narrative that garners most of the headlines.
Previdi and Polvani, 2016
“[O]bservations indicate that there has been no significant change in Antarctic SMB [surface mass balance] in recent decades. We show that this apparent discrepancy between models and observations can be explained by the fact that the anthropogenic climate change signal during the second half of the twentieth century is small compared to the noise associated with natural climate variability. Using an ensemble of 35 global coupled climate models to separate signal and noise, we find that the forced SMB increase due to global warming in recent decades is unlikely to be detectable as a result of large natural SMB variability. However, our analysis reveals that the anthropogenic impact on Antarctic SMB is very likely to emerge from natural variability by the middle of the current century, thus mitigating future increases in global sea level.”
Bracegirdle et al., 2016
Predicting the Antarctic climate using climate models
“Climate models are the main tool for making quantitative estimates of how Antarctic climate may change over the 21st century. There is high agreement on some aspects of the predictions provided by models, but improvements in understanding are needed in key components of the Antarctic climate system, such as sea ice and coastal ocean-ice shelf processes. In the near term (on timescales of a few years) the climate change signal is small compared to natural cycles (associated with phenomena such as El Niño), the remote impacts of which on the Antarctic atmosphere are difficult to predict. In the longer term (on multi-decadal timescales) the reliability of climate model predictions is limited by uncertainty over human emissions pathways, the realism of climate models, and feedbacks between other elements of the Earth System (e.g. ice sheets).”
Hobbs et al., 2016
“Over the past 37 years, satellite records show an increase in Antarctic sea ice cover that is most pronounced in the period of sea ice growth. Detecting an anthropogenic signal in Antarctic sea ice is particularly challenging for a number of reasons: the expected response is small compared to the very high natural variability of the system; the observational record is relatively short; and the ability of global coupled climate models to faithfully represent the complex Antarctic climate system is in doubt.”
Yeo and Kim, 2015
“ENSO is the most prominent coupled mode involving atmospheric and oceanic variability over the tropical Pacific and exerts strong impacts on the climate over the extra-tropics through the excitation of a large-scale atmospheric wave train. … The ENSO-induced atmospheric teleconnection, in turn, modulates Antarctic sea ice as well as sea surface temperature (SST) in the Southern Ocean through alteration of the surface energy fluxes. … SAM [southern annular mode] yields a clear local impact on the SH climate. For example, locally enhanced low-pressure anomaly to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula during a positive SAM [southern annular mode] phase results in advection of warm air and subsequent warming in the Antarctic Peninsula.”
Clem and Renwick, 2015
“We demonstrate that a significant September trend towards increased convection (reduced OLR) in the poleward portion of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) is statistically related to Rossby wave-like circulation changes across the southern oceans. … OLR-related changes are linearly congruent with around half of the observed total changes in circulation during September and October, and are consistent with observed trends in South Pacific sea ice concentration and surface temperature over western West Antarctica and the western Antarctic Peninsula.”
Irving and Simmonds, 2015
“Large precipitation anomalies in regions of significant topography (e.g. New Zealand, Patagonia, coastal Antarctica) and anomalously warm temperatures over much of the Antarctic continent were also associated with strong planetary wave activity. The latter has potentially important implications for the interpretation of recent warming over West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.”
Garfinkel et al., 2015
“Correct representation of the SSTs changes is important for the Northern Hemisphere, while correct representation of stratospheric ozone changes is important for the Southern Hemisphere. The ensemble-mean trend (which captures only the forced response) is nearly always much weaker than trends in reanalyses. This suggests that a large fraction of the recently observed changes [in sea surface temperatures, ozone] may, in fact, be a consequence of natural variability and not a response of the climate system to anthropogenic forcings.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt has by now become common practice for just about any and every unusual weather occurrence, extreme temperature anomaly,  or seismic event to be somehow, someway linked to the human practice of using energy derived from fossil fuels.   No hurricane, flood, drought, storm, wildfire … is spared from potential anthropogenic implication.
Last week, a named hurricane (Hermine) that ultimately devolved into a tropical storm landed along the Florida coast — the first landfall in 11 years.  As expected, the usual suspects  reflexively blamed the storm on humans.
When a volcano erupts, the headliners are quick to point out that humans have made volcanic eruptions more likely.
When wildfires consume the landscape, human-caused warming is claimed to be fueling them.
In one year, human-caused warming can be said to be a cause of catastrophic drought in Texas.
“2011 Texas drought was 20 times more likely due to warming, study says” 
A few years later, human-caused warming leads to catastrophic flooding in Texas.
“A new study directly links human-caused global warming to the [2015] catastrophic flooding in Texas and Oklahoma this spring.”
Even shifting plates beneath the Earth’s crust (earthquakes) can be creatively connected to human-caused climate change.
Those who may dare to question the link between  humanity’s growing oil, gas, and coal consumption and a weather or  tectonic event are swiftly called “climate deniers,” and the substantive discussion that never happened (and was never going to happen) ends then and there.
In the 1970s, extreme weather events were blamed on global cooling
Interestingly, in the 1970s it was common for severe weather anomalies (for example, the deadly catastrophic drought plodding throughout the continent of Africa) to be linked to the global cooling occurring at that time.  In 1974, NOAA acknowledged that many climate scientists had linked the drought and other extreme weather anomalies to the -0.5°C drop in temperatures that had occurred from the 1940s to 1970s.
NOAA, 1974
“In the Sahelian zone of Africa south of the Sahara, the countries of Chad, The Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Upper Volta are enduring a drought that in some areas has been going on for more than six years now, following some 40 previous years of abundant monsoon rainfall. And the drought is spreading—eastward into Ehtiopia and southward into Dahomey, Egypt, Guinea, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, Tanzania, and Zaire. … Many climatologists have associated this drought and other recent weather anomalies with a global cooling trend and changes in atmospheric circulation which, if prolonged, pose serious threats to major food-producing regions of the world. … Annual average temperatures over the Northern Hemisphere increased rather dramatically from about 1890 through 1940, but have been falling ever since. The total change has averaged about one-half degree Centigrade, with the greatest cooling in higher latitudes. A drop of only one or two degrees Centigrade in the annual average temperature at higher latitudes can shorten the growing season so that some crops have to be abandoned. … [T]he average growing season in England is already two weeks shorter than it was before 1950. Since the late 1950’s, Iceland’s hay crop yield has dropped about 25 percent, while pack ice in waters around Iceland and Greenland ports is becoming the hazard to navigation it was during the 17th and 18th centuries. … Some climatologists think that if the current cooling trend continues, drought will occur more frequently in India—indeed, through much of Asia, the world’s hungriest continent. … Some climatologists think that the present cooling trend may be the start of a slide into another period of major glaciation, popularly called an “ice age.”
But, like now, there were still a collection of scientists willing to reconsider the common-knowledge “beliefs” of the time.  For example, Boer and Higuchi (1980) investigated the “belief” that more extreme climate variability accrued as temperatures cooled, concluding that the climate had not undergone significantly more extreme shifts in weather patterns and events during the mid-20th century global cooling period.
Boer and Higuchi, 1980
“In recent years there has been increasing concern about climatic change and variability and its influence on man and his activities.  This concern has been formally expressed in a WMO statement on climate change and variability (WMO, 1976).  Many studies concerning climate change have been undertaken.  Most studies have concentrated on long-term trends in temperature.  … There appears to be a general belief that the climate has become more “variable” in recent times.  For instance, there is the suggestion that “since the 1940’s and 1950’s . . . the atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere appears to have shifted in a manner suggestive of an increasing amplitude of the planetary waves and of greater extremes of weather conditions in many areas of the world” (GARP, 1975, p. 16). … The results of this study do not support the contention that the climate has become significantly more variable, nor do they support a connection between variability and either mean temperature or north-south variation of temperature.”
Modern scientists also question the assumption that more warming means more variability
Likewise, today’s peer-reviewed scientific literature is teeming with examples of scientists who don’t appear acquiesce to the humans-cause-more-extreme weather-and-climate-events alarmism.
What follows below is a compilation of scientific papers published within the last year that do not support the popular contention that the Earth’s climate and weather (and seismic activity) have become more variable and more extreme in recent decades, or that warmer temperatures are necessarily associated with more variability and potential catastrophe.  Instead, these papers indicate that the modern (20th, 21st century) climate is, and has been, remarkably stable, with significantly less extreme variability than in previous centuries and millennia.
For example, the scientific literature reveals natural global-scale climate warmings of multiple degrees per decade routinely occurred in the recent past.  Greenland typically warmed at amplitudes of about 10.0°C in a matter of about 40 years during the last glacial — while CO2 levels remained stable and low (180 ppm) throughout.  In contrast, the IPCC has concluded that the Earth has warmed at a rate of about 0.05°C per decade since 1850, or while CO2 levels have risen from 280 ppm to 400 ppm.
Scientists have also found the frequencies of storms and tsunamis have decreased during the 20th, 21st centuries; the frequencies and intensities of hurricanes have decreased in the last several decades; and there are far fewer wildfires today than centuries ago.  Furthermore, scientists have found no  significant trends (even decreases) in extreme precipitation events in recent decades compared to past centuries; drought frequencies and intensities are stable or decreasing; tornado occurrence has remained stable or decreased since 1950; climate models are too “unreliable” to simulate variability or extremes in weather patterns; and a warming climate is a more stable climate.
In other words, these papers do not support the popular assumption that just about every adverse weather event can be linked to global warming in general, or human activity in particular.
More weather instability/extremes, much higher climate change rates in cold periods than warm periods
Mayewski, 2016
“The demonstration using Greenland ice cores that abrupt shifts in climate [i.e. warming amplitudes of full degrees C per decade], Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, existed during the last glacial period has had a transformational impact on our understanding of climate change in the naturally forced world. The demonstration that D-O events are globally distributed and that they operated during previous glacial periods has led to extensive research into the relative hemispheric timing and causes of these events. The emergence of civilization during our current interglacial, the Holocene, has been attributed to the “relative climate quiescence” of this [warm] period relative to the massive, abrupt shifts in climate that characterized glacial periods in the form of D-O events“
Hewitt et al., 2016
“Many northern hemisphere climate records, particularly those from around the North Atlantic, show a series of rapid climate changes that recurred on centennial to millennial timescales throughout most of the last glacial period. These Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) sequences are observed most prominently in Greenland ice cores, although they have a global signature, including an out of phase Antarctic signal. They consist of warming jumps of order 10°C, occurring in typically 40 years, followed generally by a slow cooling (Greenland Interstadial, GI) lasting between a few centuries and a few millennia, and then a final rapid temperature drop into a cold Greenland Stadial (GS) that lasts for a similar period. … [S]teady changes in ice-sheet runoff, driven by the AMOC, lead to a naturally arising oscillator, in which the rapid warmings come about because the Arctic Ocean is starved of freshwater. The changing size of the ice sheets would have affected the magnitude and extent of runoff, and we suggest that this could provide a simple explanation for the absence of the [abrupt climate change] events during [warm] interglacials and around the time of glacial maxima [coldest climates].”
Rasmussen et al., 2016
“Extreme climate changes in the past Ice core records show that Greenland went through 25 extreme and abrupt climate changes during the last ice age some 20,000 to 70,000 years ago. In less than 50 years the air temperatures over Greenland could increase by 10 to 15 °C. However the warm periods were short; within a few centuries the frigid temperatures of the ice age returned. That kind of climate change would have been catastrophic for us today.”
Agosta and Compagnucci, 2016
“The climate in the North Atlantic Ocean during the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) —roughly between 80,000 years before present (B.P.) and 20,000 years B.P., within the last glacial period—is characterized by great instability, with opposing climate transitions including at least six colder Heinrich (H) events and fourteen warmer Dansgaard–Oeschger (D-O) events. … During the D-O events, the high-latitude warming occurred abruptly (probably in decades to centuries), reaching temperatures close to interglacial conditions. Even though H and D-O events seemed to have been initiated in the North Atlantic Ocean, they had a global footprint. Global climate anomalies were consistent with a slowdown of AMOC and reduced ocean heat transport into the northern high latitudes.”
Pratte et al., 2016
“The highest dust fluxes in the Baie bog were recorded from 1750–1000 cal. BP to 600–100 cal. BP and occur at the same time as periods of high variability in the macrofossil record (i.e. successive layers dominated by Sphagnum or Ericaceae). The timing of these events in the dust and macrofossil records also corresponds to documented cold periods. These two periods have been identified as episodes of climatic instability, which could have been caused by changes in the wind regime.”
Degeai et al., 2015
“A comparison with North Atlantic and Western Mediterranean paleoclimate proxies shows that the phases of high storm activity occurred during cold periods, suggesting a climatically-controlled mechanism for the occurrence of these storm periods. Besides, an in-phase storm activity pattern is found between the Western Mediterranean and Northern Europe. Spectral analyses performed on the Sr content revealed a new 270-year solar-driven pattern of storm cyclicity. For the last 3000 years, this 270-year cycle defines a succession of ten major storm periods (SP) with a mean duration of 96 ± 54 yr. Periods of higher storm activity are recorded from >680 to 560 cal yr BC (SP10, end of the Iron Age Cold Period), from 140 to 820 cal yr AD (SP7 to SP5) with a climax of storminess between 400 and 800 cal yr AD (Dark Ages Cold Period), and from 1230 to >1800 cal yr AD (SP3 to SP1, Little Ice Age). Periods of low storm activity occurred from 560 cal yr BC to 140 cal yr AD (SP9 and SP8, Roman Warm Period) and from 820 to 1230 cal yr AD (SP4, Medieval Warm Period).”
Frequencies of storms and tsunamis have decreased during the 20th, 21st centuries
Dezileau et al., 2016
“Storms and tsunamis, which may seriously endanger human society, are amongst the most devastating marine catastrophes that can occur in coastal areas. Many such events are known and have been reported for the Mediterranean, a region where high-frequency occurrences of these extreme events coincides with some of the most densely populated coastal areas in the world. In a sediment core from the Mar Menor (SE Spain), we discovered eight coarse-grained layers which document marine incursions during periods of intense storm activity or tsunami events. Based on radiocarbon dating, these extreme events occurred around 5250, 4000, 3600, 3010, 2300, 1350, 650, and 80 years cal BP. No comparable events have been observed during the 20th and 21st centuries. The results indicate little likelihood of a tsunami origin for these coarse-grained layers, although historical tsunami events are recorded in this region. These periods of surge events seem to coincide with the coldest periods in Europe during the late Holocene, suggesting a control by a climatic mechanism for periods of increased storm activity.”
Frequencies and intensities of hurricanes have decreased
Chang et al., 2016
“Extratropical cyclones cause much of the high impact weather over the mid-latitudes. With increasing greenhouse gases, enhanced high-latitude warming will lead to weaker cyclone activity. Here we show that between 1979 and 2014, the number of strong cyclones in Northern Hemisphere in summer has decreased at a rate of 4% per decade, with even larger decrease found near northeastern North America. Climate models project a decrease in summer cyclone activity, but the observed decreasing rate is near the fastest projected. Decrease in summer cyclone activity will lead to decrease in cloud cover, giving rise to higher maximum temperature, potentially enhancing the increase in maximum temperature by 0.5 K or more over some regions. We also show that climate models may have biases in simulating the positive relationship between cyclone activity and cloud cover, potentially under-estimating the impacts of cyclone decrease on accentuating the future increase in maximum temperature.”
Williams et al., 2016
“Bayesian age–depth models, derived from eight AMS radiocarbon dates, suggest that the frequency of typhoon strikes was 2–5 times greater from 3900 to 7800 cal. yr. BP compared to 0–3900 cal. yr. BP. Possible explanations for this variability in the typhoon record are that typhoons were more frequent and/or more intense in Southeast Asia in the mid-Holocene because of climatic changes associated with the Mid-Holocene Warm Period or that the record reflects site sensitivity changes resulting from a mid-Holocene sea-level highstand.”

More tropical cyclones in a cooler climate?
“Recent review papers reported that many high-resolution global climate models consistently projected a reduction of global tropical cyclone (TC) frequency in a future warmer climate, although the mechanism of the reduction is not yet fully understood. Here we present a result of 4K-cooler climate experiment. The global TC frequency significantly increases in the 4K-cooler climate compared to the present climate. This is consistent with a significant decrease in TC frequency in the 4K-warmer climate.”
Fewer wildfires today than centuries ago
Doerr and Santín, 2016
“Wildfire has been an important process affecting the Earth’s surface and atmosphere for over 350 million years and human societies have coexisted with fire since their emergence. Yet many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem, with widely held perceptions both in the media and scientific papers of increasing fire occurrence, severity and resulting losses. However, important exceptions aside, the quantitative evidence available does not support these perceived overall trends. Instead, global area burned appears to have overall declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago. Regarding fire severity, limited data are available. For the western USA, they indicate little change overall, and also that area burned at high severity has overall declined compared to pre-European settlement. Direct fatalities from fire and economic losses also show no clear trends over the past three decades.”
No trends (decreases) in extreme precipitation events in recent decades compared to past centuries
Tozer et al., 2016
“The reconstruction shows that significantly longer and more frequent wet and dry periods were experienced in the preinstrumental [19th century and earlier] compared to the instrumental period [20th, 21st centuries]. This suggests that existing drought and flood risk assessments underestimate the true risks due to the reliance on data and statistics obtained from only the instrumental record.”
Pausata et al., 2016
“Following the devastating droughts that ravaged the Sahel in the 1970–1980s, many efforts have been directed at investigating climate variability in Northern Africa, focusing on vegetation–climate feedbacks and the dynamics of the West African Monsoon (WAM) system (Charney et al., 1975 and Giannini et al., 2003). However, the past millennia have witnessed much larger precipitation changes than those seen in recent decades. One of the most dramatic changes in the WAM began around 15000 yr BP, when increased summer precipitation led to an expansion of the North African lakes and wetlands.”
van Wijngaarden and Syed, 2016
Changes in annual precipitation over the Earth’s land mass excluding Antarctica from the 18th century to 2013
“The trends for precipitation change together with their 95% confidence intervals were found for various periods of time. Most trends exhibited no clear precipitation change [from the 1700s to present]. The global changes in precipitation over the Earth’s land mass excluding Antarctica relative to 1961-90 were estimated to be: -1.2. ±. 1.7, 2.6. ±. 2.5 and -5.4. ±. 8.1% per century for the periods 1850-2000, 1900-2000 and 1950-2000, respectively.  A change of 1% per century corresponds to a precipitation change of 0.09. mm/year.”
Yadava et al., 2016
“We developed the first boreal spring precipitation reconstruction for the western Himalaya covering the last millennium (1030–2011 C.E.). … The precipitation reconstruction revealed persistent long-term spring droughts from the 12th to early 16th century C.E. and pluvial from the late 16th century C.E. to recent decades. The late 15th and early 16th centuries (1490–1514 C.E.) displayed the driest episode, with precipitation being ∼15% lower than the long-term mean. The early 19th century (1820–1844 C.E.) was the wettest period of the past millennium, with mean precipitation ∼13% above the long-term mean. The reconstructed boreal spring precipitation from the western Himalaya revealed large-scale consistency with hydrological records from westerly dominated regions in Central Asia, indicating synoptic-scale changes in atmospheric circulation during the major part of the Medieval and Little Ice Age periods.”

“Time series of US daily heavy precipitation (95th percentile) are analyzed to determine factors responsible for regionality and seasonality in their 1979-2013 trends. …. Analysis of model ensemble spread reveals that appreciable 35-yr trends in heavy daily precipitation can occur in the absence of forcing, thereby limiting detection of the weak anthropogenic influence at regional scales.
Analysis of the seasonality in heavy daily precipitation trends supports physical arguments that their changes during 1979-2013 have been intimately linked to internal decadal ocean variability, and less to human-induced climate change.”
van der Wiel et al., 2016
“[T]he observed record and historical model experiments were used to investigate changes in the recent past. In part because of large intrinsic variability, no evidence was found for changes in extreme precipitation attributable to climate change in the available observed record“
Drought frequencies and intensities are stable, decreasing
Cheng et al., 2016
“The results thus indicate that the net effect of climate change has made agricultural drought less likely and that the current severe impacts of drought on California’s agriculture have not been substantially caused by long-term climate changes.”
Hofmann et al., 2016
Abrupt mid-Holocene megadrought in northwestern Montana
“One of the best studied examples of historic drought in North America includes the 1930s Dust Bowl event (Woodhouse and Overpeck, 1998) that heavily impacted agriculture in the Great Plains region and that is well represented in lake sediment records in North America (e.g. Alley et al., 2003). Interestingly, lake sediment records that contain a signal of the Dust Bowl event (e.g. Alley et al., 2003) also show that such events occurred more frequently and on a higher magnitude throughout the late Holocene (Laird et al., 1996).”
Stahle et al., 2016
“Nationwide drought is predicted to become more common with anthropogenic climate change, but the MXDA reconstructions indicate that intense “All Mexico” droughts have been rare over the past 600 years and their frequency does not appear to have increased substantially in recent decades.”
Dai and Zhao, 2016
“How drought may change in the future are of great concern as global warming continues. In Part I of this study, we examine the uncertainties in estimating recent drought changes. … Consistent with reported declines in pan evaporation, our calculated potential evapotranspiration (PET) shows negative or small trends since 1950 over the United States, China, and other regions, and no global PET trends from 1950 to 1990. Updated precipitation and streamflow data and the self-calibrated PDSI_pm all show consistent drying during 1950–2012 over most Africa, East and South Asia, southern Europe, eastern Australia, and many parts of the Americas. While these regional drying trends resulted primarily from precipitation changes related to multi-decadal oscillations in Pacific sea surface temperatures, rapid surface warming and associated increases in surface vapor pressure deficit since the 1980s have become an increasingly important cause of widespread drying over land.”
Tornado occurrence has remained stable since 1950
Guo et al., 2016
Variability of Tornado Occurrence over the Continental United States since 1950
“The United States experiences the most tornadoes of any country in the world. Given the catastrophic impact of tornadoes, concern has arisen regarding the variation in climatology of U.S. tornadoes under the changing climate. … Based on the 64-year tornado records (1950-2013), we found that the trends in tornado temporal variability varied across the U.S., with only one-third of the continental area or three out of ten contiguous states (mostly from the Great Plains and Southeast, but where the frequency of occurrence of tornadoes is greater) displaying a significantly increasing trend. The other two-thirds area, where 60% of the U.S. tornadoes were reported (but the frequency of occurrence of tornadoes is less), however, showed a decreasing or a near-zero trend in tornado temporal variability. Furthermore, unlike the temporal variability alone, the combined spatial-temporal variability of U.S. tornado occurrence has remained nearly constant since 1950.”
Unreliable climate models do not simulate variability or extremes – warming stabilizes the climate
Bellprat and Doblas-Reyes, 2016
Attribution of extreme weather and climate events overestimated by unreliable climate simulations
“The framework illustrates that unreliable climate simulations are prone to overestimate the attributable risk to climate change. Climate model ensembles tend to be overconfident in their representation of the climate variability which leads to systematic increase in the attributable risk to an extreme event. Our results suggest that event attribution approaches comprising of a single climate model would benefit from ensemble calibration in order to account for model inadequacies similarly as operational forecasting systems.”
Ljungqvist et al., 2016
“[T]he intensification of the twentieth-century-mean hydroclimate anomalies in the simulations, as compared to previous centuries, is not supported by our new multi-proxy reconstruction. This finding suggests that much work remains before we can model hydroclimate variability accurately, and highlights the importance of using palaeoclimate data to place recent and predicted hydroclimate changes in a millennium-long context.”
(press release)
According to a new study, the Northern Hemisphere has experienced considerably larger variations in precipitation during the past twelve centuries than in the twentieth century. Researchers from Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland have found that climate models overestimated the increase in wet and dry extremes as temperatures increased during the twentieth century.
Gaucherel and Moron, 2016
“‘Tipping points’ (TPs) are thresholds of potentially disproportionate changes in the Earth’s climate system associated with future global warming and are considered today as a ‘hot’ topic in environmental sciences. In this study, TP interactions are analysed from an integrated and conceptual point of view using two qualitative Boolean models built on graph grammars. They allow an accurate study of the node TP interactions previously identified by expert elicitation and take into account a range of various large-scale climate processes potentially able to trigger, alone or jointly, instability in the global climate. Our findings show that, contrary to commonly held beliefs, far from causing runaway changes in the Earth’s climate, such as self-acceleration due to additive positive feedbacks, successive perturbations might actually lead to its stabilization.”
Greve and Seneviratne, 2015
“Substantial changes in the hydrological cycle are projected for the 21st century, but these projections are subject to major uncertainties. In this context, the ‘dry gets drier, wet gets wetter’ (DDWW) paradigm is often used as a simplifying summary. However, recent studies cast doubt on the validity of the paradigm and also on applying the widely used P-E (precipitation-evapotranspiration) metric over global land surfaces. Here we show in a comprehensive CMIP5-based assessment that projected changes in mean annual P-E are generally not significant, except for high-latitude regions showing wetting conditions until the end of the 21st century. Significant increases in aridity do occur in many subtropical, but also adjacent humid regions. However, combining both metrics still shows that ca. 70% of all land area will not experience significant changes. Based on these findings we conclude that the DDWW paradigm is generally not confirmed for projected changes in most land areas.”

Within the last 1,000 years, global-scale surface temperatures underwent a warm period during Medieval times, centennial-scale cooling during the 14th to 19th centuries, and another warm period since the early 20th century.   According to scientists publishing in the peer-reviewed scientific literature within the last several months (2016), these long-term thermal changes are well correlated with long-term variations in solar activity, namely the Medieval Solar Maximum (Medieval Warm Period), Spörer, Maunder and Dalton Minimums (Little Ice Age), and Modern Grand Maximum (20th Century).   Scientists Zharkova and colleagues (2015) provide a cogent summary with a user-friendly graphic denoting the solar changes and their correspondence with warming and cooling trends.
Zharkova et al., 2015
“The longest direct observation of solar activity is the 400-year sunspot-number series, which depicts a dramatic contrast between the almost spotless Maunder and Dalton minima, andthe period of very high activity in the most recent 5 cycles [1950s – 2000s], prior to cycle 24. … The records show that solar activity in the current cycle 24 is much lower than in the previous three cycles 21–23 revealing more than a two-year minimum period between cycles 23 and 24. This reduced activity in cycle 24 was very surprising because the previous five cycles were extremely active and sunspot productive forming the Modern Maximum.  … We predict correctly many features from the past, such as: 1) an increase in solar activity during the Medieval Warm period; 2) a clear decrease in the activity during the Little Ice Age, the Maunder Minimum and the Dalton Minimum; 3) an increase in solar activity during a modern maximum in 20th century.”

Usoskin et al., 2016
“The corrected series is provided as supplementary material in electronic form and displays secular minima around 1800 (Dalton Minimum) and 1900 (Gleissberg Minimum), as well as the Modern Grand Maximum of [solar] activity in the second half of the twentieth century. The uniqueness of the grand maximum is confirmed for the last 250 years.”
Usoskin et al., 2014
“[T]he modern Grand maximum (which occurred during solar cycles 19–23, i.e., 1950–2009) was a rare or even unique event, in both magnitude and duration, in the past three millennia. Except for these extreme cases, our reconstruction otherwise reveals that solar activity is well confined within a relatively narrow range.”

Below is a list of 18 peer-reviewed papers published in 2016 that support the position that changes in solar activity are well correlated with warming and cooling periods for the last millennium.
Sanchez-Sesma, 2016
“Solar activity (SA) has non-linear characteristics that influence multiple scales in solar processes (Vlahos and Georgoulis, 2004). For instance, millennia-scale solar oscillations have been recently detected, like those of about 6000 and 2400 years, by Xapsos and Burke (2009) and Charvátová (2000), respectively, with important and interesting influences in the near, past and future climate. These millennialscale patterns of reconstructed SA [solar activity] variability could justify epochs of low activity, such as the Maunder minimum [Little Ice Age cooling], as well as epochs of enhanced [solar] activity, such as the current Modern Maximum [20th century warming], and the Medieval maximum [Medieval Warm Period] in the 12th century.  … We can conclude that the evidence provided is sufficient to justify a complete updating and reviewing of present climate models to better consider these detected natural recurrences and lags in solar processes.”
Miettinen et al., 2016
“The results demonstrate both abrupt changes and a clear centennial-bicentennial variability for the last millennium. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) between 1000 and 1200 CE represents the warmest ocean surface conditions of the SE Greenland shelf over the late Holocene (880 BCE-1910 CE). MCA in the current record is characterized by abrupt, decadal to multidecadal changes, such as an abrupt warming of ~2.4 °C in 55 years around 1000 CE. [0,5 Temperature changes of these magnitudes are rarely observed in other proxy records from the North Atlantic. … A cool phase, from 1200-1890 CE, associated with the Little Ice Age (LIA), ends with the rapid warming of aSST and diminished aSIC in the early 20th century. The phases of warm aSST and aSIC minima on the SE Greenland shelf and solar minima of the last millennium are antiphased, suggesting that solar forcing possibly amplified by atmospheric forcing has been behind the aSST variability on the SE Greenland over the last millennium.”
Lyu et al., 2016
“The reconstructed April–July MMT series exhibited six cold and seven warm periods. The longest cold period lasted from AD 1645 to 1677 (33 years), with an average temperature of 0.5 ◦C below the mean value.The longest warm period, however, lasted from AD 1767 to 1785 (19 years), and the average temperature was 0.69 ◦C above the mean value (Table 4). Four cold (1605–1616, 1645–1677, 1911–1924, and 1951–1969) and warm (1795–1807, 1838– 1848, 1856–1873, and 1991–2008) periods were consistent with other results of tree-ring reconstructions in northeast China (Shao and Wu, 1997; Yin et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2015). In addition, two cold periods (1645– 1677 and 1684–1691) were consistent with the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715), an interval of decreased solar irradiance (Bard et al., 2000). … The three temperature series exhibited significantly low temperature periods during the 1950s–1970s, which coincided with a slight decrease in solar activity from AD 1940 to 1970 (Beer et al., 2000; Fig. 7).”
“[P]revious studies suggest that climate change in northeast China was also linked to the solar activities and global land–sea atmospheric circulation during certain pre-instrumental periods (Chen et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013). It is generally accepted that the climate warms during periods of strong solar activity (e.g., the Medieval Warm Period) and cools during periods of low solar activity (e.g., the Little Ice Age; Lean and Rind, 1999; Bond et al., 2001).”
Zhu et al., 2016
“During the period 1875–1955, late summer temperature fluctuated less strongly than before or thereafter. In general, the average length of cold periods was shorter than that of warm periods. The cold period of 1869–1877 was the longest and coldest cool period had a mean of 17.63°C. The longest warm period extended from 1655 to 1668, and the warmest period in AD 1719–1730 had a mean of 20.37°C. However, we should point out that the rapid warming during the 20th century was not especially obvious in our reconstructed RLST.”
“[S]even cold periods and three warm periods were identified during the past 368 years (Fig. 4d). All the cold periods were during the Maunder (1708–1711) or Dalton (1818– 1821, 1824–1828, 1832–1836, and 1839–1842) solar minima periods, except for the cold periods of 1765–1769 and 1869–1877 (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999), which indicated that RLST [mean maximum temperature] variations in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ] might be driven by solar activity.  … Warm periods of 1719–1730 and 1858–1859 both had more sunspots (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999) and lower volcanic forcing (Fig. 7b).”
“[S]ignificant multidecadal- and centennial-scale cycles of our temperature reconstruction might include the signs of solar activity, such as the Gleissberg cycles (Peristykh and Damon, 2003), Suess cycles (Braun et al., 2005), Bruckner cycles (Raspopov et al., 2004), and Schwabe cycles (Braun et al., 2005). The Maunder (ca. AD 1645–1715) and Dalton (ca. AD 1790–1840) solar minima periods were generally associated with temperature depressions (Eddy, 1976), and the Damon (ca. AD 1890– 1920) solar maximum period occurred in a relatively warm period, which further confirmed that late summer temperature variation in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ] might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b).”

Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2016
“The dominant warm and arid conditions during the MCA [Medieval Climate Anomaly, 900-1300  CE], and the cold and wet conditions during the LIA [Little Ice Age, 1300-1850 CE] indicate the interplay of the NAO+, EA+ and NAO- , EA- [positive/negative North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic phases], respectively. Furthermore, the higher solar irradiance during the [“warm conditions”] RP [Roman Period, 200 BCE – 500 CE] and MCA [Medieval Climate Anomaly, 900-1300 CE] may support the predominance of the EA+ [positive East Atlantic] phase, whereas the opposite scenario [“colder temperatures”] during the EMA [Early Middle Age, 500-900 CE] and LIA [Little Ice Age, 1300-1850 CE] may support the predominance of the EA- [negative East Atlantic] phase, which would favour the occurrence of frequent and persistent blocking events in the Atlantic region during these periods.”

Chambers, 2016
“The so-called ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) of the 15th–19th centuries [1400-1900 AD] is a fascinating period of time, for many reasons. … [I]t includes evidence for glacier re-advance – in northern Europe, particularly, to positions not otherwise (or seldom) reached within the mid–late Holocene (McCarroll, 1991; Matthews and Shakesby, 1984; Nesje, 2009) … [I]t follows the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and precedes the period of recent ‘Global Warming’, and therefore, it post-dates the Medieval Solar Maximum, encompasses up to three solar minima (Spörer, Maunder and Dalton) (Grove, 1988), and precedes the ‘Contemporary’ (namely, late 20th century) Solar Maximum (Hoyt and Schatten, 1997; Pan and Yau, 2002); (4) there are multiple hypotheses as to the cause of its onset (cf. Miller et al., 2012), although it is widely considered that reduced solar activity is the cause of at least its most intense phases (cf. Mauquoy et al., 2002) …. [R]ecent work implies an in-phase relationship between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres [the Little Ice Age was global in extent] (Chambers et al., 2014; Simms et al., 2012).”
Voarintsoa et al., 2016
“Multiple proxies … from Dante Cave [southwestern Africa] indicate a linkage between changes in hydroclimate in northeastern Namibia and changes in solar activity and changes in global temperatures. The record suggests that during solar minima and globally cooler conditions (ca. 1660–1710 and ca. 1790–1830 [Little Ice Age]), wetter periods (reflecting longer summer seasons) in northeastern Namibia were linked to advances of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the Inter-Ocean Convergence Zone (IOCZ) southwestward.”
Gogou et al., 2016
“We provide new evidence on sea surface temperature (SST) variations and paleoceanographic/paleoenvironmental changes over the past 1500 years for the north Aegean Sea (NE Mediterranean). …  Reconstructed SSTs show an increase from ca. 850 to 950 AD and from ca. 1100 to 1300 AD [Medieval Warm Period]. A cooling phase of almost 1.5 °C is observed from ca. 1600 AD to 1700 AD [Little Ice Age]. This seems to have been the starting point of a continuous SST warming trend until the end of the reconstructed period, interrupted by two prominent cooling events at 1832 ± 15 AD and 1995 ± 1 AD. … Internal variability in atmospheric/oceanic circulations systems as well as external forcing such as solar radiation and volcanic activity could have affected temperature variations in the north Aegean Sea over the past 1500 years. The marked temperature drop of approximately ∼2 °C at 1832 ± 15 yr AD could be related to the 1809 ΑD ‘unknown’ and the 1815 AD Tambora volcanic eruptions.”
Andres, 2016
“Reconstructions of historical climate changes indicate that surface air temperatures decreased over the preindustrial last millennium. Conflicting explanations have been proposed for the cause of the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) in the early part of the last millennium to the Little Ice Age (LIA) near its end. The possible causes include volcanic emissions, total solar irradiance (TSI) variations, greenhouse gas concentration fluctuations and orbital forcing variations. In the present paper, we demonstrate that all of these climate forcings contribute significantly to simulated surface air temperature and sea ice concentration changes over this period. On the other hand, simulated ocean heat content appears to respond significantly only to volcanic and TSI [total solar irradiance] variations.   In simulations at T85 resolution, TSI [total solar irradiance] reductions and volcanic emissions together generate significant increases in sea ice extent in the Barents Sea, which we find to be responsible for most of the temperature reductions over north-western Europe.”
Bauchi Danladi and Akçer-Ön, 2016
“Due to the variability of the Little Ice Age (LIA) and Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA), several climatic forcing mechanisms have been invoked to enlighten the issue. The focus of this study is on the influence of the solar activity proxy (Total Solar Irradiance) during the LIA and MCA in a high altitude Lake Salda in south-western Anatolia.  … [T]he sediment records cover the last millennium. We have observed the effect of the solar activity throughout the LIA and MCA in Lake Salda, with wet and dry spells corresponding to high and low TSI respectively. In addition, the Dalton Minimum, Maunder Minimum, Spörer Minimum, Wolf Minimum, the Medieval Maximum and the Oort Minimum have been observed.”
Li et al., 2016
“Our results support the view that over the past millennium, on a multi-centennial timescale, the moisture variations in ACA [arid Central Asia] were generally out-of-phase with those in the region affected by the Asian summer monsoon. The humid, unstable LIA [Little Ice Age] climate in ACA [arid Central Asia] may have been associated with changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and/or with variations in solar irradiance.”
Chae and Park, 2016
“We present a multi-proxy record (pollen, microscopic charcoal, carbon-isotopic composition [δ13C], organic content, and particle size) of the late-Holocene climate change and human impact from central-eastern South Korea. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA), the most recent major climate events, have not been accurately investigated by paleolimnological studies in Korea, mainly due to a lack of undisturbed sediments and indifference to the past climate change. Our pollen records show late- Holocene centennial climate variations characterized by the successive solar minimums of the Oort, Wolf, Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton. We find paleoenvironmental evidence for shifting cultivation associated with serious droughts and consequent famines during the early 19th-century Dalton minimum. Our interpretation of human activities is well supported by Korean historical documents describing socioeconomic suffering induced by LIA climate deteriorations [cooling].”
Xing et al., 2016
“The comparison between MDVM reconstructed temperature and the variation of external forcing (solar activity and volcanic activity) is shown in Fig. 5. The smoothed MDVM reconstruction exhibited a general agreement with the variation of the reconstructed total solar irradiance (TSI), and the correlation between the two series during the common period 849–2000 AD was significant (r = 0.498, edf = 34, p<0.01). Specially, the records shared high correlation coefficients in the epochs of the solar maximum (i.e. during the Medieval and Modern age), but poor correlation around 1500–1700 AD when the Spörer Minimum and Maunder Minimum occurred. It was similar to some other dendrochronological researches concerning the relation with solar activity. The relatively cold conditions between the two warm peaks around AD 1000 and 1100 seemed to be related to the Oort Minimum. …. Therefore, the temperature reconstructions based on the MDVM method agreed well in general with the characteristic variations of the solar and volcanic forcings.”
“It is quite plausible that the long-term climate variations in the past millennium have been largely linked to the periodical solar activity … According to mainstream opinions, the LIA type events were probably attributed to a combination of solar minima and volcanic eruptions.”
Hanna, 2016
“Temperature reconstructions from Simpson Lagoon also show similarities with regional and pan-Arctic climate records over the last few millennia, with evidence of temperature departures correlative with noted climate events (i.e., Little Ice Age, Medieval Climate Anomaly). In addition, temporal variability in sediment sourcing to the lagoon, determined using a multi-proxy approach (i.e., granulometry, elemental analysis, clay mineralogy), broadly corresponds with temperature fluctuations, indicating relative increases in fluvial sediment discharge during colder intervals and decreased river discharge/increased coastal erosion during warmer periods. This paleoclimate variability may be driven by variations in solar output and/or shifts in the regional ocean-atmosphere circulation patterns (e.g., the Aleutian Low).”
Weißbach et al., 2016
“Compared to single records, this stack represents the mean δ18O signal for northern Greenland that is interpreted as proxy for temperature. Our northern Greenland δ18O stack indicates distinctly enriched [warm] δ18O values during medieval times, about AD 1420 ± 20 and from AD 1870 onwards. The period between AD 1420 and AD 1850 has depleted [cold] δ18O values compared to the average for the entire millennium and represents the Little Ice Age. The δ18O values of the 20th century are comparable to the medieval period but are lower than that about AD 1420.  …. The solar activity and internal Arctic climate dynamics are likely the main factors influencing the temperature in northern Greenland.”
Camenisch et al., 2016
“Climate reconstructions from a multitude of natural and human archives indicate that, during winter, the period of the early Spörer Minimum (1431–1440 CE) was the coldest decade in Central Europe in the 15th century. The particularly cold winters and normal but wet summers resulted in a strong seasonal cycle that challenged food production and led to increasing food prices, a subsistence crisis, and a famine in parts of Europe. As a consequence, authorities implemented adaptation measures, such as the installation of grain storage capacities, in order to be prepared for future events. The 15th century is characterised by a grand solar minimum and enhanced volcanic activity, which both imply a reduction of seasonality.”
Yndestad and Solheim, 2016
“In 1890´s G. Spörer and E. W. Maunder (1890) reported that the solar activity stopped in a period of 70 years from 1645 to 1715. Later a reconstruction of the solar activity confirms the grand minima Maunder (1640-1720), Spörer (1390-1550), Wolf (1270-1340), and the minima Oort (1010-1070) and Dalton (1785-1810) since the year 1000 A.D. (Usoskin et al. 2007). These minimum periods have been associated with less irradiation from the Sun and cold climate periods on Earth. An identification of a three grand Maunder type periods and two Dalton type periods in a period thousand years, indicates that sooner or later there will be a colder climate on Earth from a new Maunder- or Dalton- type period. …. The result shows that the TSI variability and the sunspots variability have deterministic oscillations, controlled by the large planets Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, as the first cause. A deterministic model of TSI variability and sunspot variability confirms the known minimum and grand minimum periods since 1000. From this deterministic model we may expect a new Maunder type sunspot minimum period from about 2018 to 2055. The deterministic model of a TSI ACRIM data series from 1700 computes a new Maunder type grand minimum period from 2015 to 2071. A model of the longer TSI ACRIM data series from 1000 computes a new Dalton to Maunder type minimum irradiation period from 2047 to 2068.”
Büntgen et al., 2016
“Climatic changes during the first half of the Common Era have been suggested to play a role in societal reorganizations in Europe and Asia. In particular, the sixth century coincides with rising and falling civilizations, pandemics, human migration and political turmoil. … Here we use tree-ring chronologies from the Russian Altai and European Alps to reconstruct summer temperatures over the past two millennia. We find an unprecedented, long-lasting and spatially synchronized cooling following a cluster of large volcanic eruptions in 536, 540 and 547 AD, which was probably sustained by ocean and sea-ice feedbacks, as well as a solar minimum. We thus identify the interval from 536 to about 660 AD as the Late Antique Little Ice Age.”

===================================
The global cooling weather phenomenon La Niña in the equatorial Pacific is steadily increasing in strength – and the NOAA has not recognized this: NOAA Cancels La Niña Watch While La Niña Conditions Exist.
The NOAA has even removed its “La Niña-Watch” last week from its ENSO weekly reports even though the sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the main Niño-area 3.4 around August 31 had -0.7 K.

The plot SSTA in the Niño area from 1990 to early September 2016. The end of August/early September 2016 was clearly in the La Niña range at a value of -0.7 and thus has plummeted by more than 3°C since March. Source: NOAA Cancels La Niña Watch While La Niña Conditions Exist
The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is considered as the two-month leading indicator for the development of the easterly trade winds at the equatorial Pacific, and thus for the development of the ENSO. The 30-day index shows the difference between the surface atmospheric pressure between Tahiti and Darwin (Australia).
Currently it’s at +10.6 and thus clearly in the La Niña range of over +7 and rising steeply:

30-day SOI of the Australian BOM weather office over the pastz 2 years. Mid September 2016 the value was 10.6, well into La Niña range. That’s the highest level in over two years: La Niña is here and will be around for awhile. Source: www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/
The warm surface water of the Pacific is driven westwards topwards Australia, and thus bringing cooler water from the depths to the sea surface: Cold upwelling is created and leads to the La Niña.

The SOI shows a clear La Niña path for at least the coming two months.
The cold upwelling phase can also be seen (at least by most of us) through the measured/calculated subsurface temperatures down to 300m depth at the equatorial Pacific:

Despite these clear indications in both the atmosphere and in the water at the equatorial Pacific region, the ENSO models remain completely in dispute over the development up to November.

Arctic Sea Ice Rebounds
Meanwhile Japanese climate blogger Kirye here keeps us up to date on Arctic sea ice, which missed setting a record low this year by a long shot. Kirye presents the following DMI interactive chart:

And if one looks at the area trend over the past 10 years, there has been no decline at all. Moreover a large region of Arctic sea ice is now quite thick – far from being disappeared. Compare today’s Arctic sea thickness to that of 2008, for example.
Currently the ice area is well over 4 Wadhams (1 million sq kilometers) thick. (One reader suggested using “Wadhams” as a unit for sea ice area in order to honor Peter Wadhams’s spectacularly failed prediction of an ice free Arctic by now.)

"Youth climate activists have called for a global strike on Friday to protest that human rights and social justice have been sidelined at the UN climate talks in Madrid, where governments look set to wrap up two weeks of negotiations without a breakthrough on the pressing issue of greenhouse gas reduction. Campaigners have been frustrated not only at the slow progress of the talks but also that groups representing women, indigenous people and poor people have struggled to have their voices heard within the conference halls where the official negotiations are taking place, even while 500,000 people took part in a mass protest in the streets outside last Friday.  “Human rights and gender equity are at the heart of what we are talking about on the climate,” said Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights and president of Ireland. “This is about people and people’s livelihoods. Gender and social justice have an enormous impact on what people face from climate [breakdown]. If we don’t have these issues included we are going to make enormous mistakes.” She said progress had been made on a gender action plan that was promised as part of the 2015 Paris agreement, but that some countries were still reluctant to include the language of human rights in official UN outcomes from the talks. Fridays for Future, the movement that coalesced around the world after Greta Thunberg’s solo school strikes, said the summit “has failed us. On 13 December, local Fridays for Future groups will strike because the outcomes of COP25 [the name for the UN meeting] are not only insufficient, but a painful image of how little the politicians care about the planet.  “We stand in solidarity with indigenous people, people from the global south, and people already suffering from the climate crises.” For almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC. The UK will host Cop26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time to limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the Cop26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions. The negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations. Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The Cops, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives Cop decisions global authority. Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent Scores of activists were temporarily banned from the conference centre after an incident on Wednesday afternoon when police escorted out a group of protesters made up mainly of women and indigenous people from areas affected by climate breakdown, who had staged a brief disruption. On Thursday, the UN allowed them to return. The UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), which organises the talks, put out a joint statement with some NGOs saying that after the “unfortunate security incident” all sides had agreed to follow the established guidelines on peaceful demonstrations and respect the need to safeguard all participants.  The UN said: “The UNFCCC secretariat remains committed to the inclusiveness and openness of the process and looks forward to strengthening the working relationship with observer organisations.” Angela Valenzuela of Fridays for Future, one of the protesters involved, said the actions were an illustration of the difficulties for women, indigenous people and workers, at talks that can seem dominated by government officials and corporate vested interests. She said: “The doors closed in our faces were a very powerful metaphor for what is happening here and what has happened for the last 25 years [of climate negotiations].” People of colour also faced exclusion, added Ta’Kaiya Blaney, of the Tla’amin Nation in Canada, who was also involved in the protest. “Indigenous people are on the frontline of climate chaos but we contribute far less in emissions than rich countries,” she said.  “We represent areas [such as forests] that absorb carbon [dioxide]. Women of colour are often the most impacted, and we are requesting that these issues such as gender and human rights are raised here. Too often we are on the receiving end of violence at home.” The Women and Gender Constituency, made up of 29 women’s organisations, drew parallels between what they said was “excessive force and shoving” used by police to eject protesters from the vast conference halls on the outskirts of Madrid, and the risks and violence environmental defenders face. “We want to highlight that women environmental rights defenders continue to be on the front lines to save the planet, especially indigenous, black and those from the global south, and yet are harassed, threatened and persecuted by those in authority in their own countries and elsewhere.” While protesters were pondering how best to make their point as the Friday evening deadline for the negotiations approached, the conference halls were still thronging with business executives and representatives of corporate groups, many hosting receptions, cocktails and dinners for financial backers, institutions and government officials. The talks are taking place in Madrid because the Chilean government, still officially in charge of the conference, had to abandon year-long plans to hold them in Santiago after riots broke out over inequality. A small number of Chilean protesters have made it to the Spanish capital. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said powerful business interests enjoyed easy access to the talks, and to behind-the-scenes meetings with national delegations. “They are inside government writing the rules, like the fossil fuel industry,” she said.  “They can afford to run these big advertisements and have these meetings. Inside the conference, there is a sense of business-as-usual – that if we tweak things at the edges, we will be fine. But it’s not true. If we want system change, which is what we need, that is not going to come from inside [the conference] – it can only come from outside.” Some campaigners see capitalism as an inescapable part of the climate crisis, and have argued that free-market-based economics cannot solve the problem it has created. Al Gore, former US vice-president, rejected that view, and said the overthrow of current economics was not necessary to tackle the climate challenge. He said: “We need reforms, there is no question about that. But alternatives to capitalism were characterised by environmental abuses in the 20th century. I think the answer is reform, and not the discarding of capitalism.” Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, said social justice and development were inseparable from the climate emergency, and that governments needed to regard both in forming plans to tackle the crisis. “Climate change is causing new inequalities,” he said. “But by rebuilding the global economy in a low-carbon fashion, governments could also address issues such as jobs, skills, education, health and social development.” In putting forward their plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions, scheduled for next year before a crunch climate conference in Glasgow in November, governments should address these issues explicitly, he said. “This is probably the greatest opportunity we have to get investment on the scale that is needed and deliver multiple development benefits at once,” Steiner said. “This is not sorcery – this is intelligent, smart systems planning.”"
"On Monday, ahead of a visit to Queensland coalmining communities, Anthony Albanese announced that there would be no ending of coal exporting under a Labor government. Here is the text of an alternative speech the Labor leader could have given that day instead. Today we witness an unprecedented situation as a people and as a nation. Our country is burning and there is no end in sight, nor will there be an end unless we have the courage to face the truth. Our country is burning because it is warming up and drying out, and these things are happening because of a climate crisis for which human beings all over the world are responsible. We cannot escape our responsibility to act on these truths. Last election we lied to Australia because we lied to ourselves. We thought we could run with the hares and hunt with the hounds. But in the end, the hares didn’t believe us and the dogs came for us. It was not possible to say we were serious about addressing the climate crisis and yet promise $1.5bn to subsidise the development of the Beetaloo gas basin as we did during the election. It strained belief of both our supporters and opponents that we could be for Adani and not for Adani. In truth we were too much for ourselves. All we achieved was to entrench the fossil fuel industry as our most powerful vested interest. Today that industry has as its handmaiden the most authoritarian government in our history. It attacks journalistic freedom, derides those who question it, uses parliament as a forum for lies and criminalises democracy. Today fires burn over an extraordinary 2.1m hectares in New South Wales alone and yet, despite the lies, our carbon emissions are rising. In the greatest city in our country Australians are choking and falling sick with the resultant pollution that make its air rank among that of the worst polluted cities in the world. Our beaches are black with soot, our towns are running out of water, and yet we are opening new coalmines and gasfields. Where is our prime minister? Where is the leadership the country is crying out for? Agreeing with the government, staying mute on the great issue of the day is not clever politics. It is capitulation. It is collaboration. It is, finally, criminal. My policy will not be to out-Nero Nero Morrison. That is his crown of ash, his name, his infamy, his shame and his destiny. But it will not be mine. And so from today our position is no longer ambiguous. Our policy means only one thing: to stay alive. Today, in the smog and suffocating filth of Sydney, at a moment of despair for all Australians, I am announcing that our policy of appeasement of the coal industry ends here and now. Today I say to the fossil fuel industry this: we will no longer gift you endless billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money in subsidies and tax breaks, only in order to see the Australian people’s gift repaid as more fire, worse drought, rising seas, more floods, increased cyclones, soot in our lungs and despair in our souls. Today I am announcing that if Labor is elected to government there will be a moratorium on all future coal and gas projects. Because if we don’t we will by 2030 be the sixth-largest producer of carbon emissions in the world. We are already the largest per-capita carbon polluter. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning These simple, terrible facts shame us. Worse, we now are paying their terrible price. That is why today I am announcing that if we should win government we will end all thermal coal and gas exports. This will be a complex process but that process begins the day we take power. I could pretend that it’s not against the rules of the Paris accord to export fossil fuels, that we have only committed to a reduction of carbon emissions in our own country. But such an argument is either a nonsense made in bad faith or shows no understanding of the science underlying the accord, an ignorance so profound as to be implausible. It is only consistent with a party which values neat tricks of language over the substance of public good. And under my leadership we will not be that party. I could argue that if we do not sell our coal, others will step in and fill the hole in the market. It is the seductive excuse of the pusher, the smuggler, the slaver. It is the argument of every criminal enterprise. Are we a people who make no distinction between a criminal act and knowingly aiding a criminal act? No, we are not that people. I could lie that there is a distinction between domestic emissions and international exports. But scientifically there is none. Science makes clear that the problem doesn’t stop at our borders; that the problem is shared, that the horrific consequences are shared, and that the solutions must also be shared. Far from being a crucial distinction, it is cowardice posing as realism. The coal cuddlers say that we are insignificant in the world. They have no belief in Australia. I do. I believe we are something, and that we can be something more. Australia can be, as it once was, a leader in the world. We are a significant country. If we take this step it increases the pressure on every other coal-producing country to hasten the transition out of fossil fuels. It allows us to resume our place at the seat of civilised nations, rather than as the dirty rogue nation we are becoming. It permits us to argue with the force of example for recalcitrant countries to join the coalition of the clean. The hard people of my party argue that the realpolitik of Australia in 2019 means carrying Queensland coal communities. And they are right. But that doesn’t mean lying to them. If Labor supports the Paris deal – which we do – that means zero emissions by 2050. If that is achieved globally what future is there for the thermal coalmines of Australia and their communities in 30 years? Closure in 30 years or less. It is the cruellest hoax for politicians to tell these communities they have a future in coalmining when they do not. The new coalmines that the Morrison government wishes to greenlight will be automated, roboticised and short-lived. They will be zombie workplaces whose promise of jobs are hollow. They will exist only for the greed of their owners. Any leader with a shred of decency would be seeking to work with these communities to find the best and most just ways for them to find good jobs in a new economy. And that’s what I intend to do. Today I am announcing that I am going to visit the coalmining communities of Queensland. They deserve to know the truth, and it will be my difficult task to tell them that no matter who they vote for, thermal coalmining is ending. It is ending because the market for coal will collapse – at first, as it already is, slowly – and then catastrophically and completely. I could pretend these things are not so. I could lie as so many politicians have and will. But I respect the good, hardworking people of these communities and, with them, we will begin the hard work now of ensuring that the end of coalmining is not a catastrophic collapse but a just transition that guarantees good futures with good jobs. They will not be left behind. It is well known that my hero and mentor was Tom Uren. Uren was a political realist. But he also believed in principle. At the great historic juncture of Australian history, when Menzies’s idea of Australia, backward, reactionary, was firmly in place, Uren marched at the head of the young, as a leader of the Vietnam moratorium movement, to change Australia. It’s time for Labor to once again walk with those young people on the street demanding action. To the prime minister I say this: join with us to fight this terrifying problem. It is not a Liberal problem or a Labor problem or a Green problem. It is a practical problem. It is a threat to our very future as a society, as an economy and perhaps even to us as a species. It is the greatest threat in our history. Whatever our beliefs, we are choking on the same smoke. Whoever we voted for we face the same water restrictions and, in more and more of our towns, no water. Across parties, classes and regions we are possessed of the same fear. The fire that now consumes our country doesn’t discriminate whose home it destroys or who it kills because of politics. And in fighting this horrific force nor should we. Human beings have collectively made this problem, and only collectively can we solve it. Let me be clear. There is no other way. The climate crisis no longer just means the Great Barrier Reef and our ancient forests will die. It means we will suffer too. The climate crisis no longer means our children will experience shorter and more difficult lives. It means we will too. It means our homes becoming uninsurable. Our agricultural sector shrivelling. Our fisheries vanishing. Our economy unravelling. Clean air and water becoming increasingly scarce. I say this not to panic you but to alert you to the scale of the challenge. I cannot tell you where we will end up. The hour is late, the situation is dire and we have left action to the last moment. I can promise you only this: that I will fight shoulder to shoulder with you in the hope of a better tomorrow. And I ask only this in return: will you join with me?

"The hottest day on record in the UK, on 25 July this year, caused the deaths of more than 200 additional people than usual, according to official figures that underline the deadly impact of the climate crisis. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said more people died on 25 July than any other day in the three months from July to September this year as the thermometer hit a record-breaking 38.7C (102F). On a normal day in July, there are about 1,150-1,200 recorded deaths in the UK, but when the temperature spiked, the rate rose to 1,404.  There were also higher-than-average deaths the day after the record-breaking temperature, with 1,331 people dying on 26 July. In total, the heatwave, although relatively brief compared with others in recent years, is likely to have caused more than 900 deaths, according to academics. Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics said: “These figures probably understate the full picture. We expect the final figures from Public Health England in January to show that even more people died.” The scorching temperatures that also broke records across Europe were particularly distressing for vulnerable older people, especially those with pre-existing respiratory or cerebrovascular diseases. Ward said the data indicated deaths started to rise every day the temperature went above 28C. “Every day that temperatures are above 28C is a threat to people with respiratory diseases,” he said. The ONS did not directly attribute the excess death rate to the climate emergency, although it said there was a clear link between extreme heat and the number of deaths. “When comparing the number of deaths per day in 2018 with the five-year average, we can see that some days have more deaths than we would expect. The comparatively high number of deaths occur mainly on days that are defined as heatwaves by Public Health England,” it said. The ONS added that after a rise in deaths, there was a period when deaths tended to be lower than the five-year average. “Extreme heat seems to have an impact on the number of deaths, but across the summer period as a whole, the number of deaths is similar to previous years,” it said. Ward said more action needed to be taken to prevent heat-related deaths, particularly in housing design. “The Committee on Climate Change reported in July this year that we have a real problem of homes that are not well adapted to heat, in particular care homes,” he said. “It is clear that the incidence of heatwaves is increasing, both in frequency and intensity, directly as a result of climate change. But we are still building homes that are not taking into account global heating.” Air conditioning was not the answer, he said. “All air conditioning does is dump the heat out on the streets, it doesn’t get rid of it. And most people can’t afford to install and run air conditioning. It’s not a solution, instead it makes it worse and worse. But there are simple things people can do – such as keeping curtains shut during the height of the sunshine, and opening them in the evening,” Ward said. Last year, a cross-party committee of MPs said the UK was “woefully unprepared” for deadly heatwaves. The MPs said the government had ignored warnings from its official climate change adviser, and that without action, heat-related deaths would triple to 7,000 a year by the 2040s."

"Victor Kossakovsky’s Aquarela is an absorbing and disturbing spectacle, a sensory film about the climate crisis, and it begins with what might be the soundtrack to the end of the world – a persistent tinkling, crackling, trickling. This is the noise of the ice melting in Greenland and Siberia. Kossakovsky starts by following a rescue crew whose job is to save cars and people who have fallen through the ice, because these people simply do not understand that it is no longer safe to drive across it. Their rescuers’ voices rise in something like panicky resignation: “What are you doing here? Can’t you see the ice is melting?” We watch cars being dragged out of the icy – actually, not so icy – waters by people who are (terrifyingly) in danger of going through the ice themselves. If this had been in a fictional film, the apparent metaphor about fossil fuel use might have been condemned as too obvious.  Then, as if following an inexorable meteorological logic, the film’s melt narrative shows us the ice cliffs and glaciers starting to collapse, and then the rising water levels represented by oceans roiling like lava. We go to places such as Venezuela, where landscapes are flooded, a Ballardian drowned world, and then to Miami, where storms lash what should be placid consumer avenues and shopping malls. Aquarela is an excellent film, but there are flaws, which are arguably flaws in the grammar of modern documentary film-making. There is no voiceover, and the locations of the film are only indirectly revealed in the closing credits. I would have preferred to see these places signposted more clearly, because this is relevant information and, without it, these images might become too abstract and lose their immediacy. I also wondered if some of the extended footage showing the stormy Atlantic was earning its keep. But it’s a movie on a powerfully ambitious scale. Its subject could hardly be more relevant. • Aquarela is released in the UK on 13 December."
"With 190 states taking part in the Paris climate talks, there are clearly some for whom the outcome matters more than others. There are the small states, such as Kiribati and the Marshall Islands, for which a deal to reduce global emissions and curb climate change is a matter of survival. Then there are the big players, such as China, the US, Russia and the EU, upon which a deal will rely.  But there are a number of states taking part for which economic crisis at home is their overriding concern. Within the EU bloc, in countries such as Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal the on-going economic turmoil is of enormous importance. These countries are all still suffering from the fallout of austerity measures imposed by the EU. Since the start of the eurozone crisis, the Greek economy has shrunk by 25%, the Spanish by 15%, while the Italian and Portuguese economies seem unable to recover and sustain positive growth levels. Meanwhile, domestic demand in these countries is not enough to accelerate economic growth. Similarly, investment is very thin on the ground, as their enfeebled institutions cannot guarantee that investors will get their money back.  An agreement on climate change could assist these countries with managing their economic problems and reinventing their economies as environmentally friendly ones. Massive investment in solar and wind energy for example could protect them from highly volatile coal, oil and gas prices. Technological advancements in these renewable energy sources now make this possible as new and improved materials have reduced the cost of investment and improved the performance of wind and solar energy. What is more, such investment would lead to new jobs and industries and enable some, especially Greece and Spain, to control their high unemployment rates.  The sins of the past do not leave much room for optimism on this front, however. It seems that the institutions in these four countries, weakened by deregulation, corruption and judicial bias, lack the ability to implement a series of environmental measures needed to combat climate change effectively. Data on environmental violations in these countries support this view.  Over the last year alone, Italy was fined a record €40m for failing to properly manage the dumping of illegal waste; Greece was charged €10m for lax waste management; Spain was dragged to the EU Court of Justice for the same reason; while Portugal has been accused of inadequate wastewater treatment.  But it’s not just the economically weak countries who are struggling to enforce the necessary measures to combat climate change. The same might hold true for the European Commission and other EU member states, which are better placed to enforce climate change legislation than Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain. Weak economic growth across the eurozone might force countries with fragile GDP rates, such as the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Finland to seek less ambitious targets too. Questions have also been asked about the commitment of the EU as a whole to tackling climate change. The European Commission’s emphasis on growth under Jean-Claude Juncker’s leadership and the merging of the climate change department with that of energy under a new vice-president for Energy Union indicate that climate change might not be a priority. If we combine the EU’s economic problems with other equally important matters, such as the continuing refugee crisis and recent terrorist attacks, many EU member states will be preoccupied at this climate conference. The bloc’s ability to promote a transition towards low-carbon economies might therefore be limited.   This contradicts the EU’s ambitious funding program, Horizon 2020, which has the goal of transforming the economy through responsible research and innovation. It also casts doubt on the prevalent narrative in the EU which focuses on austerity measures as the catalyst for future growth.  Not only has austerity stifled growth, but it has also prevented the EU from effectively managing the many issues it currently faces and assuming its role as leader in the international political arena. A stronger focus on the goals of COP21 would not only have a wider benefit, but sustainable investment could also help kickstart Europe’s economies too."
"An issue as controversial as fracking is bound to lead to some emotional debates. Lively protests in the UK against the onshore oil extraction technique have led to arrests and one even saw designer Vivienne Westwood drive a tank up to David Cameron’s country home. Yet we shouldn’t assume that the adverse public reaction to the shale gas industry is just an emotional response. Averil MacDonald, the chair of oil industry body United Kingdom Operators Group (UKOOG), recently claimed that women were less likely to support fracking than men because they followed their instinct rather than facts. This idea leads to the assumption that information cannot alter the emotive public perception that has already been built. But my research suggests this is not the case and that the public are actually hungry for more information about fracking. Emotion and intuition do play a natural role in assessing risk. The amount of risk we perceive is often linked to the degree of dread or fear we experience as part of the automatic feelings we associate with a word or thing. (Consider your different reaction to the words “cancer” and “Christmas”.) This is an inescapable reaction that enables us to make initial quick decisions in a complex and often uncertain world.  Such intuitive responses are particularly relevant to the issue of fracking because of potential risks such as earthquakes and water contamination by methane or chemicals. These can conjure up very clear pictures of damage, many of which carry high levels of dread/fear. Being able to picture the possibility of such damage can often overpower the fact that the probability of such damage occurring may be low. And when a risk is imposed on people, such as when a shale gas exploration site is not supported by locals, their intuitive reaction is likely to be higher. But emotional responses only form a part of risk perception and do not operate in isolation. Information processing also plays a key role. Research has shown that the less we know about a risk and the more uncertain it is the more we fear it. This highlights just how important this relationship is. My own ongoing PhD research into people living close to current/proposed fracking sites in the UK suggests that locals feel that there is a considerable lack of information available on the risks associated with fracking. The majority of those I’ve surveyed have been really keen to receive information and build an informed opinion. But, where this information isn’t available, there is a likelihood that information gaps will be filled by more emotive based claims leading to higher levels of concern or fear. Information becomes even more important when you consider that people who feel an activity is bad are more likely to automatically judge the associated risks as high and benefits as low (based on their initial emotion-based response). But this relationship can be altered with information. Where information reduces the perception of risk, the perception of benefit goes up (and vice-versa). This clearly shows that information and emotion are operating in parallel in shaping risk perceptions. As a result, claiming that there is no point in producing information on the basis that it does not alter emotionally informed perceptions is incorrect. For the examples of genetically modified food and nanotechnology, information has been found to have significant potential to increase the public acceptability of risk. Opposition to fracking is often considered to stem from a lack of scientific understanding. Often we assume that by absorbing scientific information, the public will automatically accept the risks because information enables them to “understand” the issue. While information is of undoubted value in shaping risk perceptions, in many previous scenarios where information has been made available to “educate” the public it has actually generated further concern and public debate. A recent government survey suggested that this was particularly relevant to fracking. The study found that there was more opposition than support among those who know a lot about fracking (54% vs 32%), know a little about it (35% vs 27%), and those who are aware of it but don’t really know what it is (23% vs 13%). So, if emotion does not act as a total block to the influence of information, why does information often fail to decrease perceptions of risk? My study has found that perceptions of fracking risks are closely connected to the social context in which they develop. This means that while science tends to separate out technical risks and provide information on them, many of the concerns present among local people stem from wider social concerns. These include worries over monitoring and enforcement, a lack of trust in the shale gas industry and associated regulators. If the information aimed at educating the public simply dismisses these concerns, it fails to fully address the risks that are shaping public perceptions and so will have little impact."
"In the late 1960s a good chunk of the world’s brightest minds and fanciest labs were devoted to one thing: space exploration. When NASA’s funding peaked in 1966 the organisation employed 400,000 people and consumed more than 4% of the US federal budget. Three years later, after less than a decade of serious investment, man was on the moon. These days NASA spending makes up just 0.5% of the same budget. Scientists who once would have designed rockets or tested spacesuits have largely moved into the private sector.  The space race might be a thing of the past, but the basic economic model still makes sense: massive, targeted investment in research & development remains the best way to make startling technical leaps forward and solve mankind’s greatest challenges.  The Paris climate talks have so far seen two major pledges to this end. A group of 20 major countries – representing 75% of the world’s emissions – have promised to double their clean energy research over five years. To complement this, Bill Gates has announced a coalition of top business figures committed to achieving a low carbon economy through investing “patient capital” in these new technologies. This follows calls earlier this year for a Global Apollo Programme to address climate change. In absolute terms, there is lots of money involved. However, total R&D makes up just 3.6% of the US budget in 2015, and spending on renewable energy makes up less than 4% of that. That’s a little more than US$5 billion out of the total US$134.2 billion R&D expenditure. Compared to the effort and outlay to put a man on the moon, this is orders of magnitude smaller.  But the problem today is much bigger. Governments must be more proactive and, in line with recent research, we should use public money to direct millions of scientists and engineers towards solar power, electric transport or better batteries. It won’t deliver a “man on the moon” moment, but this investment is the only way to truly end our dependence on fossil fuels. This is recognised and addressed in part by “Mission Innovation”, but in order to understand why this is still not enough, it is helpful to understand recent advances in our understanding of the economics of innovation. Many influential economists such as Yale’s William Nordhaus or Harvard’s Gregory Mankiw, want to fight climate change with a carbon tax. The problem is taxes do a better job of preventing bad things than encouraging better replacements.  Standard economics simply considers greenhouse gas emissions as an “externality” – an economic consequence experienced by a party who did not choose to incur it. Negative side effects such as pollution can be addressed by putting a price on them and forcing those responsible to pay – if your factory produces emissions, it’ll cost you. This is the idea behind carbon taxes. It is assumed that, by making polluting technologies relatively more expensive, the market will adjust, generating low-carbon innovations. But innovation isn’t as simple as this. In particular, the development and spread of new technologies depends on what has gone before and you can’t simply expect a jump into renewable energy, for instance, when everything is geared towards fossil fuels. This idea of “path dependence” is fundamental to understanding technological change. Inventors tend to build on existing knowledge, and infrastructure already in place means new technologies often incur high switching costs – just think of the advantage regular vehicles have over electric ones thanks to pre-existing petrol stations. And since the telephone is worthless unless you have someone to call, the value of a new technology may also depend on the number of people who use it. This is what economists call the “network effect”. All this momentum pushes us to continue with dirty technologies. Even a relatively high carbon tax may lead to firms seeking to make products and processes more efficient, rather than the riskier and more expensive process of changing things entirely. Take cars, for instance. Thanks to various environmental regulations you can now buy a vehicle that does more than 90 miles per gallon – but the big carmakers still haven’t truly embraced electric. This sort of efficiency improvement may reduce emissions in the short run but eventually there are no more incremental gains to be had and further decarbonisation will require completely new technologies. These technologies will then be even more expensive, with path dependence even more deeply ingrained. This is carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in is one of the key insights of recent work in “directed technical change” by MIT economist Daron Acemoglu and colleagues. They find the most cost-effective way to address climate change is early action on both fronts: pricing carbon and supporting low-carbon innovation. Acemoglu and co differ from traditional economic models of climate change by properly considering how new technology emerges, instead of treating it as an “exogenous” process that suddenly arrives like manna from heaven.  Early policy intervention is crucial. It can change the path of innovation from “dirty” (carbon-intensive) to “clean” (low-carbon) and then once clean innovation gains a sufficient advantage it can be left alone, as profit-maximising firms will pursue clean innovation in their own interests. If markets left to themselves will continue to merely pump out “innovations” along certain pathways, then it is up to the state to play a more direct role in starting a “greentech” revolution. Mariana Mazzucato, in her book The Entrepreneurial State, argues that major advances in tech from the internet to nanotechnology to pharmaceuticals were born either directly from government research or because governments made the risky investments necessary for the private sector to act.  The good news is that not all money is the same, and those behind Mission Innovation and the Breakthrough Energy Coalition seem to have read Mazzucato. They explicitly reference “patient capital” which can reduce the risk of uncertain technological investments. There is no question this is a major step in the right direction. Governments certainly need to price carbon, but they should also act as entrepreneurs and market-creators to kickstart innovation for the green growth of the future. If we are underspending on this by orders of magnitude, then doubling is not nearly enough."
"Bushfires in New South Wales and Queensland have emitted a massive pulse of CO2 into the atmosphere since August that is equivalent to almost half of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, Guardian Australia can reveal. Analysis by Nasa shows the NSW fires have emitted about 195m tonnes of CO2 since 1 August, with Queensland’s fires adding a further 55m tonnes over the same period. In 2018, Australia’s entire greenhouse gas footprint was 532m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Experts say the pulse of CO2 from this season’s bushfires is significant, because even under normal conditions it could take decades for forest regrowth to reabsorb the emissions. But scientists have expressed doubt that forests already under drought stress would be able to reabsorb all the emissions back into soils and branches, and said the natural carbon “sinks” of forests could be compromised. The figures were provided to Guardian Australia by Dr Niels Andela, a scientist at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center and a collaborator in the Global Fire Emissions Database. The GFED uses data from satellites that have detected fire hot spots and combines it with historic estimates of emissions from fires. Andela stressed the estimates did come with large uncertainties, as the methodology was still under development, but he said it was “widely applied”. More than 2.7m hectares of land has been burned in this NSW bushfire season, with authorities warning there will be more fires with little prospect of rain in coming months. Separate GFED data provided to Guardian Australia on “active fire detections” from Nasa satellites shows the remarkable early start and large extent of fires in the NSW fire season compared with the past 15 years. Andela said CO2 emissions from fires in grasslands and savannas are absorbed in only a few years, but it can take many decades for forested areas to regrow and absorb CO2 that was lost in blazes. He said fires could also shift vegetation patterns of ecosystems that were already under stress. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Forests are regarded as a store – or sink – for carbon, by taking up CO2 as they grow and storing it as carbon in branches and soils. Dr Pep Canadell, of the CSIRO climate science centre and the executive director of the Global Carbon Project, said: “This pulse of fire emissions should indeed be of concern. Any additional carbon emissions to the atmosphere, with no guarantee that it will be removed back by regrowing vegetation in a later stage, is of concern, particularly in an Australia under climate change. “Thus, it is important to understand both risks – the emissions from fires but also the potential long-term loss of CO2 sink capacity of the terrestrial vegetation due to the incomplete recovery of burned landscapes due to permanent degradation. These emissions are very significant.” He said the long-term average of emissions from fires in Australia was about 380m tonnes of CO2 per year, but he said NSW was a minor contributor to this total, with most emissions coming from the Top End, “where thousands of savanna fires take place every year”. He said that in an average year, emissions from NSW would contribute no more than 5% to the Australia-wide total. In Australia’s greenhouse gas inventory, the government reported 340m tonnes of emissions from “wildfires” each year for the whole country from 2013 to the latest reporting year of 2017. Emissions from bushfires are considered to be neutral because when forests regrow after fires, they absorb a similar amount of CO2 as they did when they burned. But Canadell said this was “most likely an optimistic view of the world” because it didn’t consider that many burned areas never recovered to their prefire state “and therefore never end up accumulating as much carbon as they had before.” He said in some cases, such as the Tasmanian fires of 2015, peat that was burned “may take thousands of years to recover the carbon if the climatic conditions are suitable – the latter an unlikely assumption under the rapid climate changes we are already observing and are predicted.” Prof David Bowman, a fire ecologist at the University of Tasmania, said that under normal conditions the regrowth would reabsorb the CO2. But he said the ongoing drought, combined with climate change, meant conditions were not normal. “Drought-stressed trees recover less well – carbohydrates reserves are exhausted – and under climate change tree growth may be slow and fires more frequent, meaning less tree biomass and even loss of forest cover. “This is a nasty negative feedback cycle of a biosphere carbon sink becoming a source [of carbon].”"
"The majority of genetically modified (GM) crops are now cultivated in the developing world. In 2014, around 53% of the 182m hectares (nearly two million square kilometres) of GM crops were grown in these countries. In reality, though, the “developing world” is a catch-all for many different countries. Brazil and Argentina are way out in front, planting nearly 70m hectares of GM soy, maize and cotton. India has 11.6m hectares of GM cotton alone. China has a broader spread but much smaller quantities, while in sub-Saharan Africa, there are 2.7m hectares of GM soy, maize and cotton in South Africa, and 0.5m hectares of cotton in Burkina Faso. Bangladesh is the latest addition to the so-called GM nations.  By far the most common GM crops are those that can tolerate herbicides. They suit the large “mono-cropped” farming systems found in the US, Argentina and Brazil. Among smallholdings, notably in India, China and South Africa, the biggest GM crop is Bt cotton, which incorporates a toxin that kills pests. It has been at the centre of the debate about the extent to which GM can help the poor.  Poorer countries might also benefit from crops being developed to resist drought, heat, frost and salty soil – drought-tolerant maize is seen as a promising answer to “climate-smart” farming in Africa, for instance. Also promising are crops with enhanced nutritional value, such as vitamin A-enriched golden rice. These remain in development, though.  One big problem with GM in the developing world is that successes claimed for certain crops already in farmers’ fields have become conflated with expectations around other different technologies not yet ready for release. This has happened with Bt cotton and golden rice, for instance, and has helped to create the false impression that golden rice is ready for market.  Bt cotton’s own benefits to the poor meanwhile look shaky on closer examination. In the most detailed study to date on smallholder farms in India, China and South Africa in 2009, Dominic Glover of the Institute of Development Studies found that much of its performance depends on the locally adapted cotton varieties with which it needs to be crossed.  Good yield also needs favourable soils and irrigation – “the very things the poorest farmers typically lack”, according to Glover. This all requires appropriate investments in infrastructure and institutions. He concluded that while some farmers have benefited, “others, especially smaller and poorer farmers have not”. Success depended on much more than “new genes inserted into a crop plant”.  Nevertheless a roll call of high-profile champions based in richer countries continue to push the idea that GM crop technology is inherently pro-poor, held back only by overburdensome regulation and irrational opposition. Their opponents argue fiercely to the contrary.  Opposition to GM crops in developing countries is often misunderstood in this hostile climate. Contrary to popular belief, local resistance is not coordinated “by Greenpeace” but grounded in local realities. Probably the best known was Zambia’s 2002 rejection of GM food aid during a food crisis. Where global GM debates revolve around health and environmental risk, Zambia’s decision was primarily about maintaining control over agriculture. In truth, debates about whether GM crops or any single technology are “good for the poor” or can “feed the world” are becoming tired. They tend to discuss GM technologies as if they can be isolated from the wider socioeconomic and political context. In Mexico, for example, smallholder farmers’ opposition to GM maize has been shaped by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and policies favouring market liberalisation, and reductions in state assistance.  Similarly in India, Bt cotton uptake has occurred against a backdrop of market liberalisation. Farmers have had to cope with fluctuating prices and the challenges of accessing credit as state subsidies have been removed. Crucially, this has all coincided with changes to agrarian social structures that have have meant that unlike in the past, these new risks have fallen on individual households rather than communities. All this is lost on a globalised GM crop debate in which both sides have used the tragedy of farmer suicides to “land a few blows”.   For much of sub-Saharan Africa, the context is the G7 New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition in Africa (known as the “New Alliance”). This cooperation framework was launched by USAID and aims to “accelerate responsible investment in African agriculture and lift 50m people out of poverty by 2022”. This is supposed to help smallholders in particular, but in reality it looks to be about facilitating the regulatory wishes of agribusiness.  The Mozambique country agreement, for example, commits to “systematically ceasing to distribute free and unimproved [non-commercial] seeds to farmers except in emergencies”. While not technology specific, this clearly advantages producers of commercially produced GM or hybrid seeds over local varieties. Rather than endlessly debate the pros and cons of GM in isolation, we need to turn our attention to these framework agreements. If GM crops are to be extended in developing countries in ways that benefit the poor, paying close attention to international development and investment frameworks currently under formation is just as important as understanding the relative merits of technologies themselves.

"As world leaders meet in Paris to tackle carbon emissions, here in the Amazon we are watching forests burning unchecked, releasing carbon into the atmosphere, destroying sensitive ecosystems and making breathing difficult. There are forests fires in the Amazon every year, but 2015 is exceptional. We’ve been investigating the issue in the rainforest around Santarém, a city on the south bank of the Amazon, 800km from the sea. For the past five weeks we have woken up under a thick veil of smoke. For days we are barely able to see the sun. On many days last week visibility was less than 50 metres and the sun, once yellow, would rise red – if at all.   Even our clothes and our hair smell constantly of smoke. We have been living in the middle of a 24-hour barbecue in the middle of the world’s largest tropical forest.  The El Niño phenomenon is contributing to this year’s increased temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns, which means a more intense dry season across large swathes of the usually-humid tropics. Widespread fires in south-east Asian peatland forests have released huge amounts of smoke and made the air so polluted that Indonesia set up evacuation ships for affected people. These fires are estimated to have emitted more carbon in just a few weeks than the entire German economy over a whole year. Although fires in the Amazon region have attracted much less attention than in Indonesia the situation is still alarming. In November alone, the Brazilian Amazon experienced 18,716 fires according to satellite data. They are are mainly started by farmers to clear areas of fallow or to get rid of weeds in pastures. However, planned fires often escape the targeted area, invade surrounding forests and burn the vegetation.  These escaped fires may appear small and harmless but rainforests, unlike savannahs or temperate forests, have not co-evolved with periodic fires. This makes them particularly vulnerable. As a result, human-induced fires can kill up to 50% of the larger trees and most of the small-stemmed ones.  

The authors visit the aftermath of a recent fire in the Amazon.
 We still don’t know how long it takes for a tropical rainforest to recover from fires, both in terms of biomass and biodiversity – they might never be able to regain their former glory. This is exactly one of the aims of the joint UK-Brazil research project that has brought us to the Amazon. What we do know is that all those dead trees open a number of gaps in the forest canopy, which allow more light and wind to reach the forest floor. The forest then becomes hotter and drier and more prone to burn once again. Fires are also used to burn the downed forest, so newly deforested areas can be cleared of all remaining vegetation and used for agriculture. When only one hectare of forest, an area equivalent to that of a football pitch, is chopped down and burned, roughly 300 tonnes of carbon are lost. In terms of carbon dioxide emissions, this is the same as a new car going around the world 61 times. This all adds up. In the past year, 583,100 hectares of the Brazilian Amazon were deforested. That’s a lot of cars.  The smoke and fires have made life very uncomfortable. Yet for local people there is no escape. The smoke cloud that daily covers the region has serious consequences for human health, which led 12 Amazonian cities to declare a state of emergency back in October. Task forces have been assigned to combat fires, but resources are thin and the region is too vast. Almost all fires are left to burn themselves out. This year’s El Niño has shown how vulnerable the world’s largest tropical forest can be to extreme droughts. And recent forecasts have shown that such events are likely to triple by 2100. If 2015 can be used as an example, we are to expect more forest fires and much greater carbon emissions from tropical forest countries.  If world leaders at the UN climate conference are serious about limiting global warming to 2°C, they must learn from this hazy present, acting immediately to protect the remaining forested areas in the humid tropics. Otherwise, we can expect a fiery future."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThree years ago, when the Rosenthal et al. (2013) paper was made available online from the journal Science, there was a bit of a stir among the purveyors of the humans-control-climate-with-their-CO2-emissions paradigm. Climate activist Michael Mann, for example, was ostensibly quite unhappy that a Medieval Warm Period (with +0.65°C warmer-than-now intermediate [0-700 m] ocean temperatures) was prominently identified in the paper’s abstract, and that both the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age were characterized as “global events” in the summary.  These conclusions served to undermine his own tree-ring hockey-stick reconstructions that effectively made the inconvenient Medieval Warm Period disappear.  None of the graphs from the paper depicted anything resembling a “hockey stick” for recent decades, which is probably why Mann claimed the paper was “suspect” and contained “a number of inconsistencies” and “debatable assumptions and interpretations”.
Indeed, the Rosenthal et al. (2013) ocean heat and temperature reconstruction depicted the last few centuries as still among the coldest of the last 10,000 years, with 21st century temperatures (2000-2010) slightly (just ~0.3°C)  above the coldest years of the Holocene (the Little Ice Age), and a full 2.0°C colder than during the Early and Middle Holocene (10,000 to 6,000 years ago), when CO2 concentrations were in the 260 ppm range, or 140 ppm lower than today.
Below is an encapsulating graph from the 2013 paper with annotations.  Notice that the amplitude and rapidity of the natural (pre-1950) warming and cooling phases sometimes exceed + or – 1°C per century, and how the post-1950 anthropogenic (presumed) warming is effectively undetectable and/or indistinguishable from natural variability.

Not inclined to disappoint those advocating for the anthropogenic climate change paradigm, the Rosenthal et al. scientists obligingly granted one single appeasing sentence, offering that the“modern rate of Pacific OHC change is, however, the highest in the past 10,000 years.”  Got that?  The increase in ocean temperatures in recent decades (reported by the IPCC to only be “about 0.015°C per decade” for the 0-700 m layer between 1971-2010) is claimed to be much faster than any other period during the Holocene.

“It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0 to 700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010. …  The warming rate is 0.11°C per decade in the upper 75 m, decreasing to about 0.015°C per decade by 700 m.”  (IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 3, page 263)

So how did Rosenthal et al. leap to their conclusion? By oddly deciding that it is scientifically defensible to directly compare an 8,000-year-long trend to a 55-year trend (1955-2010) — which, statistically, is much like comparing an 8-month-long El Niño-dominated temperature anomaly to a 37-year-long temperature trend.   In other words, Rosenthal and co-authors were able to claim an unprecedented modern warming rate by cherry-picking an extremely short-term period (1950s-present) and by simultaneously ignoring all the other short term (<100 years) trends (from their own reconstructions) that greatly exceeded modern temperature changes in both rapidity and magnitude (as the graph above illustrates).
Interestingly, Bova et al. (2016) recently found that during the Holocene there were short-term “natural” ocean warming trends that achieved amplitudes of more than “2.0°C within 200 years” at the 0-1000 m depth, which is about 5 to 10 times the rate of warming (more than 0.1°C per decade) compared to the 0.015°C per decade warming rate in recent decades (1971-2010) at the shallower 0-700 m depth.
Rosenthal and colleagues were nonetheless able to get away with claiming that modern ocean temperature changes are among the fastest of the Holocene in their 2013 paper, which is likely what allowed the paper to be published in Science.  And thus a seemingly throwaway sentence necessarily became the “take-home conclusion” for Michael Mann and his ilk.
A New Rosenthal (2017) Paper
A new Rosenthal et al. (2017) paper has many similar features to the 2013 version with some important differences.
Seemingly in response to those who claimed their last paper didn’t represent the global oceans well enough, the authors added Atlantic Ocean proxy records to their last Pacific Ocean reconstruction that extended from the North Pacific to Antarctic.  Again they concluded that their coverage represents global ocean temperatures:

“[W]e assume that our records represent the World Ocean and thus are comparable in volume with the current estimates (Levitus et al., 2012).”

Perhaps because of the lone positive coverage from Mann and other activists that it afforded them the last time they mentioned it, Rosenthal and co-authors once again claim in this paper that their cherry-picked short-term (55 years) warming rate (now 0.033°C per decade [0-700 m] for 1955-2010 instead of 0.015°C per decade for 1971-2010 as indicated by the IPCC) greatly exceeds the overall 8,000-year trend (from 10,000 years ago to 2,000 years ago) of “0.002°C per decade”.   They also compare the same 55-year trend to a 400-year trend (1200 to 1600 A.D.)  Just as directly comparing a -1.2°C temperature drop over an 8 month period to the overall 3+ decade satellite temperature trend would be an abominable misrepresentation, comparing a 55-year trend to a 400-year trend or an 8,000-year trend is, to put it bluntly, statistical malpractice.

“Levitus et al. (2012) report a mean ocean warming of the 0-700 m ocean layer of 0.18°C between 1955 and 2010, corresponding to ~0.033°C per decade. To obtain a first order comparison, we assume that our records represent the World Ocean and thus are comparable in volume with the current estimates (Levitus et al., 2012). Assuming the intermediate depth ocean (0-700 m) cooled between 10 and 2 Ka by ~1.5 °C we calculate a cooling rate 0.002°C per decade. Similarly, considering the intermediate depth ocean (0-700 m) cooled by ~0.5 °C between 1200 and 1600 CE we calculate a temperature change of -0.013 °C per decade. In both cases these rates are smaller than the modern rates even when applying the observed IWT changes to the whole ocean (as opposed to just the Pacific as was done in Rosenthal et al. (2013).”

‘Global’ Sea Surface Temperature Reconstructions
Let’s consider the sea surface temperature reconstructions.  Notice the annotations indicating when humans presumably began influencing temperatures (after 1950) with their CO2 emissions.   As shown, all or nearly all the warming in the last few centuries took place prior to the era of presumed anthropogenic influence.  Instead of CO2 emissions, some other forcing mechanism needed to have caused the large magnitude and rapidity of ocean temperature changes.

Holocene Ocean Heat Reconstructions
The new (or reconditioned) graphs of ocean heat content ( 0-700 m) are no better, and perhaps worse, than the sea surface temperature reconstructions when it comes to depicting the negligibility of the anthropogenic influence.




The Alleged Anthropogenic Influence Effectively Begins Only After 1950
The reason why we only include the post-1950 period as the era of the presumed anthropogenic influence on ocean temperatures is simple: anthropogenic CO2 emissions were effectively flat and negligible prior to 1950 … after which they exploded.

In fact, the IPCC claims that the net radiative forcing from all combined anthropogenic sources was “more than 1.5 W m-2” between 1951-2011.

“Over the period 1951–2011 the  trend in anthropogenic forcing is almost 0.3 W m–2 per decade and thus anthropogenic forcing over this period is more than 1.5 W m–2.”   IPCC AR5 Chapter 8, page 699

As Rosenthal et al. (2017) note, the total net radiative forcing from all anthropogenic influences since 1750 has been 1.6 W m-2, which leaves almost no room for humans to have had more than a modest (~0.1 W m-2) impact on climate prior to 1950.

“It is generally assumed that the effects of direct forcing through the last millennium were relatively uniform in both hemispheres, much like the effects of the recent increase in GHG though with substantially smaller impact compared with the estimated total anthropogenic radiative forcing of 1.6 ± 0.8 W/m2.”

So if nearly all the radiative influence on ocean temperatures from human activity took place after 1950, and if nearly all the abrupt and far more pronounced ocean temperature changes (warmings and coolings) took place prior to 1950, this would imply that there are other factors driving warming and cooling trends besides anthropogenic forcing (CO2).  Rosenthal et al. seem to reluctantly admit in the paper that the models of radiative forcing don’t seem fully capable of explaining the Holocene’s rapid temperature changes.

“Here we review proxy records of intermediate water temperatures from sediment cores and corals in the equatorial Pacific and northeastern Atlantic Oceans, spanning 10,000 years beyond the instrumental record. These records suggests that intermediate waters [0-700 m] were 1.5-2°C warmer during the Holocene Thermal Maximum than in the last century. Intermediate water masses cooled by 0.9°C from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age. These changes are significantly larger than the temperature anomalies documented in the instrumental record. The implied large perturbations in OHC and Earth’s energy budget are at odds with very small radiative forcing anomalies throughout the Holocene and Common Era. … The records suggest that dynamic processes provide an efficient mechanism to amplify small changes in insolation [surface solar radiation] into relatively large changes in OHC.”

However, they do not admit that the glaring lack of a post-1950 leap in temperature change depicted in their graphs seriously calls into question the dominance of anthropogenic forcing on ocean temperatures relative to natural variation and unforced net ocean heat changes.

"SeaWorld in California has announced that it will be phasing out killer whale shows from 2017. The move comes in response to public criticism over the treatment of the whales, heavily influenced by the documentary Blackfish. Concern over the welfare of captive killer whales raises a much broader question of whether there are animal species that should never be kept in captivity. Many people are concerned about apes and elephants, for instance, because they have highly developed cognitive abilities such as autonoetic consciousness – the ability to see their life as a continuous story. Back in the 1990s the Great Ape Project set about trying to give apes equivalent rights to humans, which would technically mean that they could not be held in captivity as this would count as unlawful imprisonment. In recent years a number of court cases have attempted to have apes and other species classified as non-human persons under the law.  If a judge accepted this proposition then an animal could be given locus standi meaning that its rights could be represented in a court of law in much the same way as a child can be represented by a lawyer. This happened in Argentina in 2014, when a judge ruled that an orangutan called Sandra at Buenos Aires Zoo was being unlawfully deprived of her freedom. After legal appeals, Sandra will now be sent to an animal sanctuary in Brazil. So how can we decide if a species should ever be kept in captivity? Philosophers would first apply the “basic needs test”, which questions whether all of the animal’s physiological needs for survival are being provided. That is: does the animal have enough food, water and the correct kind of shelter? All zoos around the world should be meeting this need; if they don’t, their animals would die.  Of course there may be species in the wild whose basic needs are not sufficiently well known for this test to be passed. No mountain gorillas have ever been kept successfully in captivity, for instance, perhaps due to the problems of providing them with an adequate diet and climate. Equally just because a species can potentially be kept comfortably in captivity doesn’t mean they should be, especially when badly-run zoos or negligent owners are involved. This leads us onto the second test that philosophers would apply, called the “comparable life test” – is the life of an animal in captivity at least as good as it would experience in its natural habitat?  This test is much more difficult to measure because here we are also concerned with the animal’s psychological well-being and so cannot use simple measures such as longevity or reproductive output. Some species, such as elephants, have much shorter lives in captivity, whereas chimpanzees live much longer. Tigers will breed under the most appalling of animal welfare conditions, so much so that they can be farmed, whereas gorillas are very sensitive to their conditions.   Animal welfare is a notoriously difficult thing to measure because it varies not only species by species, but individual by individual. This comparable life test is further complicated by the fact that the wild environment is a place where animals suffer from hunger, thirst, disease and social pressure to name but a few negative aspects. Presently the keeping of wild animals in captivity in the UK, the US and many other countries around the world adheres to the concept of the five freedoms: • Freedom from fear and distress. • Freedom from hunger and thirst. • Freedom from thermal and physical discomfort. • Freedom to express natural patterns of behaviour. • Freedom from pain, injury and disease. Clearly many wild animals don’t experience these freedoms so it could be argued that, on these terms, captivity is better than the wild for some species. Animals themselves might occasionally agree: take the female southern tamandua, or collared anteater, at Belo Horizonte Zoo in Brazil that on several occasions escaped from its enclosure to find a mate in the local forest and then once pregnant returned to the zoo to raise its offspring.  The freedom to express natural patterns of behaviour is normally the most impinged in captivity, but scientists still debate its importance. Is a captive giraffe that does not spend its days looking out for hungry lions necessarily suffering? No. Whereas a captive chimpanzee with no opportunity to groom and be groomed will clearly suffer. Again there is no simple answer in terms of animal welfare. The principal question for me is whether a species can be kept in captivity without significant psychological suffering. If science can prove the answer to this question is “no” then the animal should never be kept in captivity.  However, what if the species was threatened with imminent extinction in the wild – should we take the remaining individuals into captivity? This was done with the Californian condor to take part in a captive breeding programme for future reintroduction, and the species was saved with hundreds of individuals now back in their natural habitat. Or perhaps we should allow the last representatives of the species to go extinct – leaving them to an unpleasant death in the wild."

Share this...FacebookTwitterKenneth Richard’s post from yesterday on how a small group of alarmist scientists tried to whitewash away the global cooling scare of the 1970s has been making some waves.
Not only was it made the top headline at Climate Depot, but also James Delingpole at Breitbart London here has written a scathing piece about the fraudulent, totalitarian tactics used by the climate alarmists to erase history and to rewrite it.

Breitbart writes:
Everyone knows that before the global warming scare began in the 1980s, scientists were much more worried about global cooling and the coming ice age.

Now the full extent of these activists’ skullduggery has been uncovered by researcher Kenneth Richard, writing at No Tricks Zone.“
Delingpole writes that the cover-up of the global warming consensus of the 1970s and 80s was so extensive that a Google search yields little on scientists being concerned over global cooling and that it “makes a mockery of Jimmy Wales’s oft-expressed desire to reduce Wikipedia’s outrageous left-wing bias.”
He also slams William Connelley for abusing “his Wikipedia administrator status by rewriting thousands of Wikipedia articles in order to give them the ‘correct’ alarmist spin.”
Climate science, in Delingpole’s view, has become so corrupt that he concludes his piece by stating that “the main requirement for thriving in the world of climate science is the personality of a psychopath.”

"The Paris climate talks hope to set out how we can reduce the amount of carbon we’re pumping into the atmosphere. But emissions cuts alone may not be enough. Atmospheric CO2 is the blanket that keeps our planet warm and any further emissions will mean more global warming. Observations in recent years show that warming is accelerating, that polar ice and glaciers are all melting, that sea level is rising … it all looks rather bleak. Could we directly engineer the climate and refreeze the poles? The answer is probably yes, and it could be a cheap thing to achieve – maybe costing only a few billion dollars a year. But doing this – or even just talking about it – is controversial. Some have suggested there is a good business case to be made. We could carefully engineer the climate for a few decades while we work out how to reduce our dependency on carbon, and by taking our time we can protect the global economy and avoid financial crises. I don’t believe this argument for a minute, but you can see it’s a tempting prospect.  One option might be to reflect some of the sun’s energy back into space. This is known as Solar Radiation Management (SRM), and it is the most viable climate engineering technology explored so far. For instance we could spray sea water up out of the oceans to seed clouds and create more “whiteness”, which we know is a good way to reflect the heat of the sun. Others have proposed schemes to put mirrors in space, carefully located at the point between the sun and the Earth where gravity forces balance. These mirrors could reflect, say, 2% of the sun’s rays harmlessly into space, but the price tag puts them out of reach. Perhaps a more immediate prospect for cooling the planet is to spray tiny particles high up into the stratosphere, at around 20km altitude – this is twice as high as normal commercial planes fly. To maximise reflectivity these particles would need to be around 0.5 micrometres across, like the finest of dust.  We know from large volcanic eruptions that particles injected at high altitude cool the planet. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines is the best recent example. It is estimated that more than 10m tonnes of sulphur dioxide were propelled into the high atmosphere and it quickly formed tiny droplets of sulphuric acid (yes, the same stuff found in acid rain) which reflected sunlight and caused global cooling. For about a year after Pinatubo the Earth cooled by around 0.4℃ and then temperatures reverted to normal. I was involved recently in the SPICE project (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering) and we looked at the possibility of injecting all sorts of particles, including titanium dioxide, which is also used as the pigment in most paints and is the active ingredient in sun lotion. The technology to deliver these particles is crazy – we looked at pumping them in a slurry up to 20km into the air using a giant hose suspended by a huge helium balloon. A small-scale experiment was cancelled because even it proved too controversial, too hot. Imagine if we demonstrate that this technology can work.   Politicians could then claim there was a technical “fix” for climate change so there would be no need to cut emissions after all. There are so many problems with climate engineering. The main one is that we have only one planet to work with (we have no Planet B) and if we screw this one up then what do we do? Say “sorry” I guess. But we’re already screwing it up by burning more than 10 billion tonnes of fossil fuels a year. We have to stop this carbon madness immediately.   Engineering the climate by reflecting sunlight doesn’t prevent more CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere, some of which dissolves in the oceans causing acidification which is a problem for delicate marine ecosystems.  There is therefore a strong imperative to remove the 600 billion tonnes of fossil carbon that we’ve already puffed into the air in just 250 years. This is known as Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR).   We must work fast to cut our carbon emissions and at the same time we should explore as many climate engineering options as possible, simultaneously. However while reflecting sunlight may be an idea that buys us some time it is absolutely not a solution for climate change and it is still vital that we cut our emissions – we can’t use climate engineering as a get-out clause."

=====================================
With their (fake) warnings that a Trump presidency would lead economic markets into turmoil, the Democrats and media critics have got to be feeling a little embarrassed. The opposite is actually occurring.

Image cropped from: www.donaldjtrump.com/
Personally I haven’t seen anything like this since Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s, after the US had been through years of economic malaise. Trump is proving to be a real mover and shaker. Let’s look at some recent developments.
IBM
For starters, the news is out that technology giant IBM just announced it plans to hire 25,000 workers over the next 4 years and spend 1 billion dollars in training. Moreover, the Daily Mail reports: “The IBM jobs investment news came before the highly anticipated meeting Wednesday between Trump and the leaders of several major technology companies.” Expect more similar announcements in the weeks and months ahead.
Dow Chemical
Dow Chemical announced in a press release that it would invest in a “new, state-of-the-art innovation center” in Midland, Michigan. The innovation center will support approximately 200 research and development jobs in Michigan, including 100 newly created jobs while repatriating 100 jobs from other Dow facilities throughout the globe to Midland.
Carrier
Long cited by Trump as an example of industry leaving the US, air conditioner manufacturer Carrier now pledges to keep some 1000 jobs in the US, Fox News reports here. This news comes after the company told workers earlier in the year that it would be closing its plant and moving production to Mexico. Fox calls it a signal and that “more companies may follow.”
SoftBank

In another jobs and investment coup, the Washington Post reported earlier how President-elect Trump had just announced that Japanese telecom and internet conglomerate SoftBank would invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 new jobs. That’s significant.
Foxconn
In the same article above, the WaPo also noted analysts speculate that Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple’s iPhones, could be responsible for the additional $7 billion in investment and 50,000 new jobs. However, Foxconn could not be reached for comment.
Ford
Politico reported recently that a Ford plant would now stay in Kentucky: “Donald Trump bragged …that the chairman of Ford Motor Company called him personally to inform him that the auto maker would be keeping one of its plants in Kentucky instead of moving it to Mexico.”
US Steel
US Steel Chief Executive Mario Longhi told that his company may be restoring up to 10,000 jobs in the United States, Fortune reports here.
Stocks record high
With the flurry of positive economic announcements in the wake of Trump’s election, stocks reacted and recently hit new high, wrote Marketwatch.com. Analysts say there’s still plenty of room for upward movement.
“Optimism skyrocketed like never before”
CNBC reports here that economic optimism has “skyrocketed like never before“. It writes:  “The election of Donald Trump has brought with it a surge in optimism in the United States over the economy and stocks not seen in years.”
So what’s happening? They say that nothing is as successful as success, and once it starts rolling, it just feeds on itself. This is what is happening now, and Trump has not even taken office yet.

"One possible future – a glimpse of our children’s fate if the climate keeps changing faster than our efforts to address it. Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields that no longer grow. Political disruptions that trigger new conflict, and even more floods of desperate peoples seeking the sanctuary of nations not their own. The words above were not found in an ActionAid or Oxfam briefing at the Paris climate talks. They come from US president Barack Obama’s address to the conference on its opening day last Monday, as he described one possible future under climate change. These images could become reality if there are insufficient reductions in carbon emissions. There are very real limits to adaptation that will be surpassed. In the language of the negotiations, these types of impacts are called “loss and damage”. Many observers equate loss and damage to liability and compensation. But in fact, the current loss and damage agenda has little to do with determining monetary compensation.  Prominent elements instead include issues of migration, displacement, and human mobility. A key demand of the developing countries’ group – the G77 and China – is to establish a climate change displacement facility in the Paris agreement, which could coordinate work on climate change displacement, including assisting in developing arrangements for emergency relief and assisting in providing for organised migration and planned relocation. The loss and damage agenda also includes addressing “slow onset events”: sea level rise, rising temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat, salinisation, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification. In 2013, the UNFCCC – the UN body that organises the annual climate conference – created the Warsaw International Mechanism for loss and damage associated with climate change impacts, with a mandate that will need to be periodically reviewed. Now in the context of the Paris negotiations, there is substantial desire on the part of the G77 and China to both expand the mandate of the current mechanism and give it a more permanent status. Inclusion of loss and damage is a firm red line for many developing countries, in particular the small island states and least developed countries. They have clearly stated that there will not be an agreement in Paris if the final text does not include a relevant provision. On the other side of the issue, members of the Umbrella Group (the United States and allies such as Australia, Canada, and Norway) and the European Union have been  opposed to the inclusion of loss and damage in the agreement.  The strong red lines on both sides of the issue have led to loss and damage being one of a small number of difficult issues set aside to be resolved in the final week of the conference. Other issues of such prominence include finance, differentiation (who has to do what), ambition (setting a long-term temperature goal), and response measures (what to do when measures to address climate change hurt fossil fuel-dependent economies). It is around this small number of highly charged issues that the package of the final deal is likely to be constructed – comprising the political trade-offs that will make it possible, or not, to conclude negotiations here successfully. Developed countries’ determination seemed very firm before the Paris meeting. The United States in particular had been very clear that it did not want a separate provision for loss and damage in the agreement. But recently there have been indications that developed countries might be softening their stance. It is not particularly surprising that they might want to avoid the public relations and diplomatic problems associated with complete opposition to a major demand of small island states and least developed countries.  US special envoy for climate change, Todd Stern, told a press conference at the summit: “From the president on down, the US is quite focused on this issue and I think that we’ll land it.” But Stern also stressed: “We won’t accept the notion that there should be liability and compensation for loss and damage, that’s a line that we can’t cross.” For at least the past few months, rumours have been circulating that the United States could live with the inclusion of loss and damage in the agreement, if there were a clause included that specifically excluded liability and compensation – that loss and damage was about everything but compensation for impacts of climate change.  That’s an interesting approach. Certainly many countries have been strongly suggesting that loss and damage is about much more than compensation – the migration and slow onset agendas are really quite important. But it is also a potentially dangerous approach, with a threat that specific reference under the climate regime excluding compensation for climate impacts may have repercussions  in other arenas such as the International Court of Justice. So now in the final stretch towards an agreement, as surprising as it seems, it appears that all parties would like to see loss and damage included in the agreement – from the United States to the small island states and least developed countries. The devil, as always, is in the details."
"One of the most expensive and sought after animals on the wildlife black market is still under the radar – the helmeted hornbill (Rhinoplax vigil) of South-East Asia. The devastating and growing illegal trade in the beak or “casque” of this bird is driving it to the brink. The trade was responsible for the recent reclassification of this spectacular species, skipping two whole categories from “near threatened” to “critically endangered”. Run largely by organised criminal groups, the trade is mainly centred in Indonesia, which is also the area where one of the largest populations of the helmeted hornbill and the largest area of its habitat is located.  The hornbill’s casque has many names, including “golden ivory” or “golden jade” because it is similar to elephant ivory, and can be carved in a similar fashion. The casque is made of the protein keratin, the same key component as your hair and nails or a rhino’s horn. Online it is referred to as “red ivory”, alongside code-words like “white” for elephant ivory and “black” for rhino horns, all three of which are monitored by the Environmental Investigation Agency. The helmeted hornbill is unique because its casque is not completely hollow or spongy like other hornbills; in fact, the upper part is solid, and has been adapted for aerial jousting. This bird has a long history of being hunted by humans. Traditionally, the casque is harvested in low numbers for tribal medicine, for instance by the Orang Asli people in Malaysia where it is carved into rings and used to detect poison. These days, by far the largest demand comes from China, where hornbill ivory can fetch up to five times as much as true ivory on the black market, costing around US$4-8 per gram, or up to US$1,000 for a single casque. Dating back to the Ming dynasty, the Chinese have used hornbill ivory to make decorative carvings and beads, which serve as luxury products to display wealth. It is also ground up and sold for traditional medicine. There is also a smaller trade in hornbill feathers, adding to the pressure on the species. Helmeted hornbills mostly eat fruit, especially figs. They are an important seed disperser across South-East Asia’s lowland tropical forests, which are under heavy pressure from deforestation. So in addition to hunting, this hornbill may be losing important nesting sites and food sources. It is also particularly vulnerable as it has a relatively low reproductive rate of around one chick a year. The red ivory trade is not new, but it has been becoming increasingly widespread over the years. Exact numbers are hard to come by but back in 2013, hornbill expert Yokyok Hadiprakarsa, found that around 500 birds were killed each month in one Indonesian province alone. As demand rises for alternatives to elephant ivory for vanity products, competition for hunters to find these increasingly scarce birds also rises – there was even a report of hunters using an AK-47 assault rifle rented from local police officers to catch the birds. Although the trade centres around Indonesia, as populations of hornbills decrease, the fear is that this is likely to shift to other areas where the hornbill can still be found, such as Malaysia or peninsula Thailand. This is a task for researchers who will have to identify the most important populations of this species for conservation efforts, as well as the extent of the trade and hunting hotspots. Reducing the demand for luxury hornbill products would be a logical next step, in addition to further law enforcement to stop hunters, and remove red ivory products from the market. Meanwhile, in the forests of South-East Asia, Hadiprakarsa and his team continue their work. Let’s hope the helmeted hornbill’s next classification is not “extinct”."

"Dutch military police have begun forcibly removing a group of climate protesters at Schiphol airport, in Amsterdam, after they refused to leave during a demonstration organised by Greenpeace. Hundreds of protesters attended the demonstration on Saturday calling on the international air hub to adopt a plan to curb greenhouse emissions. The group had been allowed to protest outside the building only, but they broke that restriction, arguing that citizens’ rights to peaceful protest should not be restricted.  Protesters waved banners saying “Tax the plane, take the train” and chanted slogans of “climate justice”, while Greenpeace activists told the crowd: “Schiphol is one the biggest airports in Europe and yet they still want to expand it. That’s not normal!” In a peaceful protest, hundreds of activists came to the airport to demand a climate action plan for Schiphol. https://t.co/6PDbgszvkr One protester reportedly chained himself to a pillar during the demonstration, which took place in the hall that leads to the arrivals and departures section of the airport. Dozens of police from the Marechausse, the force that guards Dutch borders, began removing the protesters one at a time, dragging or carrying those who resisted. “After multiple warnings to leave Schiphol Plaza peacefully, the Marechausse has now begun arresting Greenpeace protesters,” the force said in a statement. A Schiphol spokesman, Hans van Kastel, said no flights had been disrupted by the demonstration. In its call for people to attend the protest, Greenpeace said on its website: “We’re in the middle of a climate crisis, but the big polluter Schiphol is being allowed to keep growing and polluting even more.” Schiphol, which is owned by the Dutch state, says it does have a climate plan, which includes cutting emissions on the ground by using electric vehicles."
"With the food system accounting for up to a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, anything that reduces its impact will make a big difference to the climate.  It is a system riddled with inefficiencies and waste. Humans don’t simply eat food straight out of the ground, of course. It’s harvested, stored, processed – or fed to animals who are in turn slaughtered and processed – and finally packaged and delivered. Each of these stages uses energy, which means emissions.  In very rough terms, the world grows about 6,000 calories per person a day in edible crop harvest. That is about three times the 2,000 calories a day that end up getting to be eaten by humans. This would be enough to feed everyone if we shared it round perfectly, which we don’t, so some people go hungry while others eat more than is good for them.  So what happens to the massive 4,000 calories per day gap between field and fork and what has this got to do with going vegetarian or even vegan? Here, again in rough numbers, is how the missing calories can be accounted for: About 900 are agricultural waste, much of which is simply left in the ground. Supply exceeds demand or the crop is deemed not able meet customer standards. About 500 go to biofuels. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is something we need to keep a very close eye on if we are ever to achieve a low-carbon world. If free market forces were allowed to do their thing we could see a huge shift from food crops to more profitable fuels, at the expense of nutrition in poorer countries. Around 600 calories are then lost in post-harvest waste. This is mainly an issue in developing countries and is inherently solvable, at face value, through the provision of such things as sealed containers to keep food dry. So far in the story from field to plate there is still a plentiful 4,000 calories per day left for feeding people. Around 1,700 of these are fed to animals. The animal diet is further supplemented with a substantial amount of grass, some but not all of which is grown on land that could alternatively be used to grow yet more human food.  Animals – some more than others – add an intrinsic inefficiency into the food chain, using up energy for such things as walking around and keeping warm (per kilo of meat, poultry do a lot less of less of this through their lives than cows, making chicken a significantly more efficient energy source than beef). A mere 500 calories per person per day come back out of the animal food system as meat and dairy foods. So the inefficiency of our meat and dairy diet leads to a loss of 1,200 calories per person per day, excluding any grassland that could be used for edible plant crops. And meat consumption is rising fast in developing countries. To finish off the story, around 800 calories are lost to processing, distribution and household waste, of which the biggest element is household waste in developed countries – the homes of most of the people reading this are included here. Inadequate sharing of the remaining 2,000 that humans actually eat means that some people end up obese while others are hungry. Seen in this way, the world food system looks to be brimming with opportunities for improvement. If we can get organised – which of course is not at all easy – we ought to be able to use new technologies and deploy best practices to increase yields, as well as cutting out most of the 2,300 calories that are wasted. Even with a rising population – and even with climate change adversely affecting land fertility in some areas – we ought to be able to feed everyone while improving biodiversity and increasing the biofuel output somewhat.  Our animal intake puts a huge and growing pressure on the food and land system. If the world went vegan overnight we might be able to feed several billion more people and double biofuel production, even without tackling waste or improving yields.  We need to be asking how plants can become more aspirational foods than cows. But if we are still going to eat meat, stick to chicken which has only about one-tenth of the carbon footprint per kilo of Brazilian beef. This is partly because a chicken is a more energy-efficient meat producer, partly because chickens don’t ruminate, or chew the cud (which emits methane, roughly doubling the footprint of a cow) and partly because chicken farms are less strongly associated with deforestation.  Our studies of the footprint of UK dietary choice have shown that going vegetarian might cut the greenhouse gas footprint by 25%. However the same reduction can also be made through modest actions split across what for most UK people are the three most important things you can do to cut your food carbon: reduce meat, switch type of meat and, of course, cut waste."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere have been a number of reports that Germany will ban the internal combustion engine (ICE) by the year 2030, i.e. in just 14 years. This has been already voted on by Germany’s Federal Council (Bundesrat).
Although 14 years can be plenty of time to usher in a technical revolution (e.g. think of how much technology changed from 1976 to 1990), it will not be anywhere enough time for Germany to overcome the huge technical and financial obstacles it faces in achieving the lofty target.
Already today leading German media outlets are dumping cold water on the news. For example online flagship national daily Die Welt comments here that the aim is nothing but a “fairy tale”, writing:
The discussed ban of cars with internal combustion engines by 2030 will not come. CSU politicians Seehofer and Dolbrindt are going to see to that.”
Even Germany’s leading Green Party politician Winfried Kretschmann, Minister of the state of Baden Württemberg, home to auto giant Daimler Benz, is opposed to a specific deadline. Die Welt writes that a number of leading politicians are not in favor of any deadline for abolishing ICEs, meaning there is no consensus to drive the ambitious project.
Another obstacle is the EU government in Brussels, which is responsible for regulating automobiles in Europe, thus making a go-it-alone by a single country impossible.
A further obstacle is the total lack of infrastructure for electric cars. According to Stefan Bratzel, Chief of the Center of Automotive Management (CAM):

We first need the necessary infrastructure, the charging stations, and enough power plants to supply clean electricity before cars with internal combustion engines can be replaced. That is not possible by 2030.”
Moreover, these “clean energy power plants” have been facing increasingly fierce opposition lately, as Germany’s landscapes have been spoiled by wind parks and consumers are angered by skyrocketing electricity prices, and industry concerned about an unstable power grid and the prospects of blackouts. It’s a fact that the installation of new wind energy capacity in Germany fell by almost 20% in 2015, from the high set in 2014.
In the ICE ban scheme, the state would not allow the registration of automobiles with internal combustion engines by 2030. The Bundesrat insists that the 2030 deadline is necessary if the country ever hopes to meet the target of a CO2-emissions-free transportation sector by the year 2050.
Minister of Transport: “utter nonsense”
Also Forbes Magazine here quoted Germany’s Minister of Transport, Alexander Dolbrindt, who called the German initiative “utter nonsense”. Forbes comments:
The ICE ban remains a dream of the more rabid among the proponents of all-electric transportation.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIce and cold were supposed to be a thing of the past, global warming theorists insisted some years ago. But that hasn’t been true.
The problem is that the natural factors clearly dominate, and the experts had forgotten all about them. Winters with snow and ice are just as likely as they ever were in the northern hemisphere. This year could even get brutal.
Meteorological analyst wobleeibtdieerderwaermung here delivers his latest updated forecast for the European winter, borrowing from Weatherbell.com here and others.

Forecast from 30 November 2016 for the northern hemisphere for December 2016 through February 2017. shows that the winter risks being an icy one for global warming infatuated Europe and USA.
Chances for white Central Europe Christmas above average
The Arctic polar vortex is expected to split in mid December and is forecast to usher in a larger wintery pattern, thus improving the chances for a snowy Christmas for Germany and Europe, the German site reports:
The stratospheric models form the ECMWF (Europe) and GFS (USA) today are in rare agreement with a dipolar of the polar vortex in mid December.”

ECMWF projected geopotentials at 150 hPa (approx. 14 km altitude, lower stratosphere) of 7 December 2016 for 17 December 2016. The vortex over Canada is the stronger of the two. A powerful cold trough of the polar vortex (Rossby waves) lies across Eastern Europe, pumping in very cold polar air. A powerful high extends from the Azores all the way to the North Pole (+).

The following chart shows the GFS December 8, 850 hPa (ca. 1500m) forecast for the northern Hemisphere for December 19:

A major low pressure system centered over eastern and southern Europe could lead to a cold and moist polar air mass moving over Europe, leading to widespread snowfall. Source: http://old.wetterzentrale.de/topkarten/fsavneur.html.
The calculated change in the stratosphere will impact the general weather pattern in the underlying troposphere, with blocking highs over the eastern north Atlantic and lows over southern and eastern Europe. This would be the start of an intense winter weather pattern with widespread snowfall over large parts of Europe and Germany around December 19.
Temperature forecast for December 19:

Crystal-balling out to Christmas Eve
The GFS model forecast of December 8, 2016 shows an extensive low over southern Scandinavia pumping in cold moist air to Europe, which would bring widespread snow (see chart below). Source: http://old.wetterzentrale.de/html.

Of course readers have to keep in mind that these forecasts two weeks out are very speculative, and so it’s too early to place your bets. The patterns are unstable and it is impossible to predict where the cold polar air plunges will actually happen. Central Europe could get hit head-on, or we might luck out and get hit head-on by a southern warm air mass. Personally I prefer the cold snowy version for Christmas.
PS: The latest GFS model runs show seasonal temperatures for Central Europe in the days leading up to Christmas, with temperatures hovering around the freezing point.

"Sweden’s deputy prime minister, Åsa Romson, hit the front pages when she broke down in tears at a press conference announcing reductions in the number of refugees the country would take. She had been forced into a corner by her Social Democratic coalition partners, opposition parties, and other EU states which had failed to match Sweden’s welcoming refugee policy. It was a bitter defeat for a governing party that makes much of its progressive credentials. Tanking in the polls, Romson’s Green Party has looked weak in government since becoming the minority coalition partner after last year’s election. The Paris climate negotiations could yet become its greatest victory, however. Romson, who is also the environment minister and lead Swedish negotiator in Paris, recently authored an editorial in The Guardian boasting about her country’s green achievements. By 2030 Sweden aims to have an entirely fossil-free road system and a completely decarbonised energy system. It is also targeting a circular economy – the buzz term for a low-waste system that keeps resources in circulation for as long as possible. Her country’s approach is a win-win for rich and poor, she claimed, and needs to be followed elsewhere. She wrote: We believe there is still time to act. If the world phases out the use of fossil energy quickly in favour of renewables, considerable ground will be gained, not only in terms of the climate. It all sounds extremely impressive, and is part of the much bigger progressive story that has long helped Sweden inspire other nations. In different ways, the Nordic countries have all achieved an unusually peaceful transition from unequal early 20th-century economies to technologically advanced welfare-based societies with high standards of living.  Sweden is now hoping to achieve something comparable with the environment in Paris.  It believes its domestic policies are breaking the apparently inextricable link between two key features of the last 200 years of global development – carbon emissions and economic growth. The Swedes speak from experience: since the mid-1990s domestic emissions in Sweden and its Nordic neighbours have declined 17% against a 45% rate of economic growth. As Romson explained: For many years we have used effective policy levers that put a price on carbon, using a carbon dioxide tax accompanied by political leadership that supports the emergence of climate-smart innovations. Sweden is also at the apex of rapid global demographic change, with people flocking towards its cities and abandoning its huge interior. This makes the country a testbed for social and environmental innovation. If things work out as promised, future Sweden will be made up of high-tech energy-efficient cities that will serve as a gold standard for the rest of the world.  The Swedish manifesto for Paris was eagerly spread around social media without much of a critical response. The strategy has three pillars. It wants a treaty that is dynamic so that countries can increase their binding targets as they make progress. It wants to encourage willing countries to achieve the most ambitious outcomes possible, while engaging with countries suffering the most from climate change. And it wants to be a facilitator in negotiations and a model of best-practice. The Swedes promise to help developing countries to jump from semi-industrialised to post-carbon economies, presenting a rosy picture of what is possible.   Yet Sweden’s negotiating potential is somewhat undermined by the fact that its own environmental numbers don’t yet add up. Wealthy Swedes have a taste for meat, luxury goods and foreign holidays they are loathe to part with. This has resulted in sizeable carbon exports to poorer countries where manufacturing takes place. Swedish companies and the government also have a worldwide web of invesments, not all of them ethical. State utility Vattenfall owns overseas coal plants and former foreign minister Carl Bildt was even a board member of Lundin Oil, a prospecting company that has been heavily criticised by human rights campaigners.   The Swedes are well aware that they still have much to do. The head of the respected Stockholm Environment Institute, Johan Rockström, who has become an important voice in climate debates, has said: We need a new narrative for Sweden too. This is of global importance, because we are such an important example for the rest of the world. This doesn’t mean the Swedish way cannot work. The future needs to be a place not of catastrophe and collapse but of progress towards something better. Sweden’s environmental approach offers one of the best opportunities of realising that. Sweden understands the importance of telling a convincing story, and with such a powerful vision it could well inspire progress in Paris.  If it really can achieve its own aims for sustainability, it will be a story worth listening to."

Pepsico and a “lethal force in society”
Forbes reports Pepsico CEO Indra Nooyi is not amused over Trump’s election, warning of a potential “lethal force in society“.
As a result some people have reacted critically to Nooyi’s comments, and are even calling for a boycott of Pepsico products.
Yet looking at the company’s product range, there are far more compelling reasons to boycott them: your HEALTH!
If anything is lethal, it is the many of Pepsico’s beverage and snack products.
Comically, Nooyi insists that the company’s products contain mostly natural ingredients, and so can be enjoyed healthily in moderation. “We never want you to make a choice between health and taste, health and availability, and health and price,” she said.

Killer dream team of junk food
With the exception of Quaker Oats, its mineral water and maybe Tropicana brand juice, much of the rest of the product line shown above is what I’d call a killer dream team of unhealthy junk food.
Such junk foods throughout the industry have in large part contributed to the massive epidemic of heart disease and metabolic syndrome now sweeping across large parts of the globe.

Never mind the sugary soft drinks or aspartame-laced diet beverages, Pepsico’s range of snack foods are real health dangers when eaten in excess. No credible healthfood expert would recommend their consumption on any frequency scale other than rarely or never.
For example look at the ingredients for Doritos (analysis here):
Whole corn, vegetable oil (corn, soybean, and/or sunflower oil), salt, cheddar cheese (milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes), maltodextrin, wheat flour, whey, monosodium glutamate, buttermilk solids, romano cheese (part skim cow’s milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes), whey protein concentrate, onion powder, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, corn flour, disodium phosphate, lactose, natural and artificial flavor, dextrose, tomato powder, spices, lactic acid, artificial color (including Yellow 6, Yellow 5, Red 40), citric acid, sugar, garlic powder, red and green bell pepper powder, sodium caseinate, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, nonfat milk solids, whey protein isolate, corn syrup solids.
Though many may stem from “natural” sources, as Nooyo likes to trumpet, most ingredients are so highly processed that they are de facto rendered totally foreign of natural foods.
Note all the added starches, processed flours and various forms of sugar that will do a real number on putting your blood sugar on a roller coaster. The product also contains partially hydrogenated oils – bad stuff.
Moreover the ingredients are not only selected and portioned to make the product taste great, but also to mess up with your appetite-regulation system (intense cravings). You’ll just want to eat more.
Checck out what one finds in Cheetos here!
The high number of calories in each package hardly delivers any body-regenerating nutients in the form of essential vitamins and minerals. Nutrient-density is practically zilch.
The oils these snacks contain are often subjected to high heat Levels and extensive processing, making them real free radical suppliers. In my opinion any parent making such products (no matter the manufacturer) a part of a child’s daily nutrition ought to be punished for child abuse. Little wonder child obesity rates are as high as they are today. Unbelievable corporations get away with this.
Of course consuming a serving of these snack products from time to time (a couple times a month) will likely pose little added health risk because the human body is equipped with rather a formidable waste treatment/disposal system that is designed to deal with the rubbish that the digestion of junk snack foods leads to – but only to a certain point.
Forget the political boycott. Just do it for your health.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFinally there’s agreement: Ocean cycles are responsible for the missing warming since 2000
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated, edited by P Gosselin)
It was stated in our 2012 climate science skeptical book “Die kalte Sonne” and was massively criticized. Today it is accepted: the systematic impact of ocean cycles on climate events.
The latest example: Meehl et al. from August 2016 in Nature Climate Change:
Contribution of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation to twentieth-century global surface temperature trends
Longer-term externally forced trends in global mean surface temperatures (GMSTs) are embedded in the background noise of internally generated multidecadal variability1. A key mode of internal variability is the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), which contributed to a reduced GMST trend during the early 2000s1, 2, 3. We use a novel, physical phenomenon-based approach to quantify the contribution from a source of internally generated multidecadal variability—the IPO—to multidecadal GMST trends. Here we show that the largest IPO contributions occurred in its positive phase during the rapid warming periods from 1910–1941 and 1971–1995, with the IPO contributing 71% and 75%, respectively, to the difference between the median values of the externally forced trends and observed trends. The IPO transition from positive to negative in the late-1990s contributed 27% of the discrepancy between model median estimates of the forced part of the GMST trend and the observed trend from 1995 to 2013, with additional contributions that are probably due to internal variability outside of the Pacific4 and an externally forced response from small volcanic eruptions5. Understanding and quantifying the contribution of a specific source of internally generated variability—the IPO—to GMST trends is necessary to improve decadal climate prediction skill.”
The cycles always pop up with new names, but in the end they are all relatives of the PDO and AMO, which are also coupled with one another with a time lag.
Now that this factual basis has become accepted, suddenly there have been a shower of publications. For example Chikamoto et al. from the Geophysical Research Letters in July 2016:
Potential tropical Atlantic impacts on Pacific decadal climate trends
The tropical Pacific cooling from the early 1990s to 2013 has contributed to the slowdown of globally averaged sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The origin of this regional cooling trend still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that the remote impact of Atlantic SST anomalies, as well as local atmosphere-ocean interactions, contributed to the eastern Pacific cooling during this period. By assimilating observed three-dimensional Atlantic temperature and salinity anomalies into a coupled general circulation model, we are able to qualitatively reproduce the observed Pacific decadal trends of SST and sea level pressure (SLP), albeit with reduced amplitude. Although a major part of the Pacific SLP trend can be explained by equatorial Pacific SST forcing only, the origin of this low-frequency variability can be traced back further to the remote impacts of equatorial Atlantic and South Atlantic SST trends. Atlantic SST impacts on the atmospheric circulation can also be detected for the Northeastern Pacific, thus providing a linkage between Atlantic climate and Western North American drought conditions.”
Incorporating ocean cycles in the climate models has now taken on top priority as the earlier models have failed miserably, just as has been shown by Peings et al. in March 2016 in the Journal of Geophysical Research.
Let’s ignore the past for now and direct our focus instead on the new, improved models.

Also a team led by Monika Barcikowska succeeded in integrating the ocean cycles in model simulations as explained on 20 October 2016 in the Journal of Climate. And suddenly, lo and behold, the warming hiatus made sense and cooling looks likely for the future:
Observed and simulated fingerprints of multidecadal climate variability, and their contributions to periods of global SST stagnation

This study investigates spatio-temporal features of multidecadal climate variability, using observations and climate model simulation. Aside from a long-term warming trend, observational SST and atmospheric circulation records are dominated by a ~65yr variability component. Though its center of action is over the North Atlantic, but it manifests also over the Pacific and Indian Oceans, suggesting a tropical inter-basin teleconnection maintained through an atmospheric bridge.
Our analysis shows that simulated internal climate variability in a coupled climate model (CSIRO-Mk3.6.0) reproduces the main spatio-temporal features of the observed component. Model-based multidecadal variability comprises a coupled ocean-atmosphere teleconnection, established through a zonally oriented atmospheric overturning circulation between the tropical North Atlantic and eastern tropical Pacific. During the warm SST phase in the North Atlantic, increasing SSTs over the tropical North Atlantic strengthen locally ascending air motion and intensify subsidence and low-level divergence in the eastern tropical Pacific. This corresponds with a strengthening of trade winds and cooling in the tropical central Pacific.
The model’s derived component substantially shapes its global climate variability and is tightly linked to multidecadal variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This suggests potential predictive utility and underscores the importance of correctly representing North Atlantic variability in simulations of global and regional climate.
If the observations-based component of variability originates from internal climate processes, as found in the model, the recently observed (1970s-2000s) North Atlantic warming and eastern tropical Pacific cooling might presage an ongoing transition to a cold North Atlantic phase with possible implications for near-term global temperature evolution.”


And because it is so nice, here’s another paper on the subject by Dai et al. 2015 from Nature Climate Change:
Decadal modulation of global surface temperature by internal climate variability
Despite a steady increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), global-mean surface temperature (T) has shown no discernible warming since about 2000, in sharp contrast to model simulations, which on average project strong warming1, 2, 3. The recent slowdown in observed surface warming has been attributed to decadal cooling in the tropical Pacific1, 4, 5, intensifying trade winds5, changes in El Niño activity6, 7, increasing volcanic activity8, 9, 10 and decreasing solar irradiance7. Earlier periods of arrested warming have been observed but received much less attention than the recent period, and their causes are poorly understood. Here we analyse observed and model-simulated global T fields to quantify the contributions of internal climate variability (ICV) to decadal changes in global-mean T since 1920. We show that the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) has been associated with large T anomalies over both ocean and land. Combined with another leading mode of ICV, the IPO explains most of the difference between observed and model-simulated rates of decadal change in global-mean T since 1920, and particularly over the so-called ‘hiatus’ period since about 2000. We conclude that ICV, mainly through the IPO, was largely responsible for the recent slowdown, as well as for earlier slowdowns and accelerations in global-mean T since 1920, with preferred spatial patterns different from those associated with GHG-induced warming or aerosol-induced cooling. Recent history suggests that the IPO could reverse course and lead to accelerated global warming in the coming decades.”
The summary sentence with suspected warming linked to ocean cycles over the coming years is mysterious, though. Perhaps the authors here are thinking about the time after 2035…
If any journalist, who got all excited about our “crude” ocean cycle theory when we published our book in 2012, wishes to contact us — they’re welcome to do so. We are not resentful when the apology comes from the heart.

"Livestock production needs to reach its peak within the next decade in order to tackle the climate emergency, scientists have warned. They are calling for governments in all but the poorest countries to set a date for “peak meat” because animal agriculture is a significant and fast-growing source of global greenhouse gas emissions.  Cattle and sheep emit large amounts of methane while forests are destroyed to create pasture and grow the grains that are fed to intensively reared animals. The world’s scientists agree that huge amounts of carbon dioxide will have to be removed from the atmosphere to limit global heating to 1.5C. More than 80% of farmland is used for livestock but it produces just 18% of food calories. Reducing meat and dairy, and eating plant-based diets instead, would free up land to be returned to natural forest. Researchers say that is the best option currently available for storing large amounts of carbon. The researchers emphasise that such changes to global agriculture are only one part of the urgent action needed to address the climate crisis. Slashing fossil fuel use is vital, as is action in other sectors, such as transport. In a letter to the Lancet Planetary Health journal, the researchers call on countries to “declare a timeframe for peak livestock”, after which production would not increase. Negotiators are at a UN climate summit in Madrid, hoping to make progress towards ambitious new climate pledges in 2020. “Countries should be looking for peak livestock within the next 10 years,” said Helen Harwatt, a fellow at Harvard Law School in the US and lead author of the letter. “This is because we need steep and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, as we are reaching dangerous temperature tipping points.” The production of meat, milk and eggs has increased from 758m tonnes in 1990 to 1,247m tonnes in 2017, research shows. “Food demand is expected to increase massively as our population expands toward 10 billion,” said Prof Matthew Betts at Oregon State University, US, and another author of the letter. “Reducing human demand for resource-intensive animal protein would considerably slow the rate of global forest loss, with huge benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services, in addition to carbon storage.” The letter is supported by more than 50 leading experts, including Prof Pete Smith, at the University of Aberdeen, UK, a senior author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on land use and climate change, published in August. “Ruminant meat is 10 to 100 times more damaging to the climate than plant-based food,” he said. “As a planet, we need to transition away from a dependence on livestock, just as we need to to transition away from fossil fuels, if we are to have any chance of hitting the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Livestock numbers need to peak very soon and thereafter decline substantially.” Smith said it was up to individual governments to set their own targets for peak livestock. “However, given the urgency of the climate emergency, this will need to be over the coming decade for sure,” he added. “But the transition will need to be managed fairly to allow citizens to change diets and for farmers, producers and agri-food chains to diversify. In poor countries, where over 800 million people are still undernourished, priorities obviously differ.” Other supporters of the letter include Prof Sir Ian Boyd, until recently the chief scientific adviser to the UK government on environment, food and farming, and Walter Willett at Harvard University, who led the work on the first science-based planetary health diet, published this year. Of the world’s mammals, 60% ,by weight, are livestock, 36% are humans and only 4% are wild mammals, according to 2018 research by Prof Ron Milo, at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, who also backed the letter. Harwatt said the changes needed to achieve peak meat were feasible, as farming could change faster than other sectors where infrastructure, such as power stations, had lifespans of decades. She recognised that much lower levels of meat consumption required significant changes in behaviour but said: “I see many more vegan options today [in the UK] that were not there even a year ago. “We’re fully aware that our call requires large-scale change across society and isn’t something that can be achieved overnight or without challenges.” Harwatt said climate change would have huge impacts on society, and passing peak meat would help limit the damage, as well as reduce ill-health and help wildlife. “This isn’t hardship,” she said."
"It sounds like the plot of a Hollywood science-fiction movie. An alien species is dying. Their only hope is for a brood of artificially fertilised eggs created from the preserved DNA of some of the last survivors to be brought back to life in a future world where (hopefully) conditions are better suited to them. Crazy? Not really: this is the only hope remaining for the northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni). The death of Nola, a 41-year-old female who had to be euthanised at San Diego Zoo following a routine operation to treat an abscess, leaves just three individuals remaining in the world. Two are infertile females, the solitary male has low fertility; all are elderly.  After being decimated by poaching, the subspecies appears to have no chance of natural recovery. The three remaining rhino, Najin, Fatu, and Sudan, are living under 24-hour guard at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, and are effectively “walking dead”.  The only possible (and highly optimistic) route to non-extinction is for frozen eggs and sperm from these last rhino to be combined with DNA from the last few to die, and the resulting embryos implanted into surrogate mothers for gestation. These surrogates would be southern white rhinos (Ceratotherium simum simum), a closely-related and much more populous subspecies. The northern white rhino’s precipitous decline is due to poaching. It was last sighted in the wild back in 2006 and drastic action, when it was taken, was too little, too late. In 2009, four of the dwindling captive population were moved to Kenya to encourage breeding. But the animals were too old, and all attempts at reproduction, including controversial inter-breeding with southern relatives, failed. Can we bring an (effectively) dead species back to life? Enter the Jurassic Park scenario. For those unfamiliar with the story, scientists facilitate the rebirth of extinct dinosaurs using DNA from long-dead animals in a process known as de-extinction.  We know that it is possible: back in 1996 Dolly the sheep was produced using similar technology (gene insertion into an egg, and development in a surrogate mother). And, whenever a well-preserved woolly mammoth is found frozen in ice, we hear whispers of the potential to produce a living mammoth using its DNA. The technique works in cattle, sheep, and mice. However, we have not yet brought an extinct species back to life or even saved a nearly extinct species using such technology. Fortunately, San Diego Zoo had the foresight to collect samples in recent years via skin biopsy and post-mortem from 13 individual northern white rhino. In theory, their stem cells could be inserted into eggs and sperm from the remaining northern whites to maximise the genetic diversity of the “re-born” population. Frozen sperm from recently deceased male Angalifu is in storage at San Diego’s Frozen Zoo, but sadly the project remains egg-less as Nola’s eggs, harvested immediately upon her death, proved infertile. The situation is desperate as all three remaining northern white rhino have reproductive concerns.  We’re entering uncharted territory here. It may be possible to proceed with stem cell development via in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and the implantation of eggs (embryo transfer) to surrogate southern white rhino, but it’s never been done before and there’s lots we still don’t know about rhino reproduction. The uterus is deep within the body, for instance, and the zoo will need to develop special instruments to reach it. Researchers are currently looking to raise £500,000 (US$750,000) via GoFundMe campaign Make a Rhino, Save a Species, and scientists and conservationists associated with the project estimate that they may produce a calf in eight years time. By that time, the remaining three northern white rhino will likely be dead, and the subspecies formally extinct.  But a question remains. Even if it is possible to bring back the northern white rhino, from a founder population of 13 or so individuals, will the resurrected population be genetically viable? And how will we save them post-resurrection when we failed with our best chance pre-extinction? Some would argue that, as a subspecies, the northern white rhino is of limited importance. After all, the southern whites are still going, with fears over their long-term future countered by hope in more likely technology, and they could be moved northwards to fill the same ecological role. However, any adaptive (genetic) differences unique to the northern white rhino are currently lost to the species as a whole.  If we accept that conservation resources are limited, should we not be prioritising species that we are more likely to save, such as Africa’s remaining southern white and black rhino, or the various endangered Asian species, rather than trying to resurrect a subspecies that is already functionally extinct?"
"It may sound like a no-brainer to say that trees improve air quality. After all, we know that trees absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO₂), and that their leaves can trap the toxic pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ozone, and harmful microscopic particles produced by diesel vehicles, cooking and wood burning.  Yet some recent studies have suggested that trees may in fact worsen urban air quality by trapping pollutants at street level. A closer look at the evidence – and how it was collected – reveals the root of this dispute, and can help us come to a more nuanced understanding of the impacts of trees on our urban environment.  First things first; it is not trees that pollute the air of cities in the developed world. As car manufacturers are all too guiltily aware, it is mainly road vehicles that cause pollution. And their impacts are compounded by the choices we make about how and what we drive. Many features of the urban landscape influence how air moves around a city. Impervious objects like buildings, and permeable ones like trees, deflect air from the path imposed by weather patterns, such as high and low pressure systems. The urban landscape turns freshening breezes into whorls of air, which can either contain pollution near its source – where it affects vulnerable hearts and lungs – or lift it away from ground level.  Whether the landscape traps or lifts air will depend very sensitively on the exact positioning of roads, buildings, gardens, street trees, intersections, even billboards and other street furniture.  Trees affect the urban environment in several subtle ways. From altering air flows, to collecting pollution deposits, to affecting the chemical make up of the atmosphere, their impacts are both pervasive and difficult to pinpoint.  As air swirls and twists past the urban fabric, microscopic pollutants can deposit on surfaces. Any surface will do, but trees are especially effective at trapping these particles, because of their large, porous surfaces. One way we can tell whether trees are helping to reduce air pollution is by estimating the mass of pollutant deposited. Experiments to measure depositing pollutants are usually carried out in the middle of flat fields, where it is easier to interpret the measurements. But, of course, a city is a very different environment, and it’s not clear whether these results hold true in highly variable urban settings.  Experimental studies can certainly show that pollution ends up on leaves. But it is no easy task to convert such measurements into an estimate of how the concentrations – that is, the amount of pollutant per cubic metre of air – change. And it is this concentration change that really counts, since we breathe air and – generally speaking – don’t lick leaves.   Some pollutants, like NO₂, are both emitted by human fuel use and produced when chemical reactions take place in the atmosphere. Other pollutants, notably ozone, are only produced through reactions of nitrogen oxides with fumes from oil-based solvents, petrol and similar chemicals in the air. The production of toxic ozone can happen purely as a result of our consumption of fossil fuels: particularly when hot, settled summertime conditions provide the light needed to kick-start the chemical reactions, while the stillness prevents dilution of the pollution into the global atmosphere.  That said, trees also release chemicals that react with nitrogen oxides to produce ozone, sometimes in sufficient quantity to make a difference, even in urban areas.  Trees also take up space. Parks and gardens are not usually sites with intense pollutant emissions, so they provide an important volume into which pollution can be diluted. This is evidenced by statistical studies, which show how concentrations of air pollutants vary according to the type of urban neighbourhood: the decrease of pollutant concentrations away from busy roads is modified by how tall the buildings are in the neighbourhood. When assessing research on the effects of trees on urban air pollution, remember that no single study has yet put all the pieces of the puzzle together. With so many processes to consider, it’s little wonder that experiments based in a range of locations, using varying methods, yield vastly different results.  To produce a definitive study, it would take either many months of measurements before and after the planting of vegetation, or a shorter series of simultaneous measurements in two urban locations identical in all respects, except for the presence of trees or some other form of “green infrastructure” in one location. Both approaches are expensive and difficult to undertake in busy cities, which are constantly subject to all kinds of other changes. So, we are left with piecing together the evidence as it is presented to us in reports. When doing so, look first at whether the study is, in fact, concerned with how air is dispersed in urban areas, and remember that such dispersion really depends on every part of the cityscape, not just on trees. Look to see if, and how, removal of pollutants by deposition is considered, and then check whether the study considers the effects of dilution or atmospheric chemistry. Finally, consider the results of any single study in the light of the best available systematic approach to trees in the townscape before drawing conclusions. Asking whether cities should have trees in it is a bit like asking whether a suit should have a person in it. There is every chance that urban trees could provide a “nature-based solution” to several pressing problems with the urban environment, but perhaps not in the way scientists and policy-makers seem currently to be thinking. Rather than providing a technical fix that disguises our obsession with the diminishing returns of the internal combustion engine, increasing urban tree numbers could change our entire perspective on cities, facilitating the creation of liveable cities that value nature as an integral part of social, economic and environmental capital."

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Fritz Vahrenholt wrote an expert assessment for the Liechtenstein-based Geopolitical Intelligence Services on the situation concerning Germany’s power grid stability and its current renewable energy policy. He says Germany needs an immediate and fundamental course correction if it wishes to avert a disaster.

Costly for the consumer
Vahrenholt writes that already today Germany has the second highest electricity price (after Denmark) in Europe and that the so-called renewable energy feed-in tariff will rise from 6.35 €ct/kwh today “to an astounding 7.3 €ct/kwh in 2017“. Germany’s green energy feed-in act generates an additional cost to consumers of some 25 billion euros annually, paid by citizens via their power bill. This represents “a social transfer from bottom to top of immense dimensions“.
He stresses four main points in the GIS piece: 1) German consumers and industry pay a hefty price for Energiewende, 2) Technical problems within the German power grid are piling up as the government continues its breakneck drive to change the country’s energy mix, 3) Parts of Germany are already oversaturated with wind turbines and 4) not surprisingly other states are not following the German example as they grapple for their responses to the energy and climate issue.

He notes that unless a drastic course change is enacted, the future looks bleak.
Irrational fear
The driving force behind the socially unstable, frenzied energy policy is an irrational fear that we will irreparably damage our climate with CO2 – despite new scientific findings showing that CO2’s impact on the global climate has been vastly overstated by the IPCC.
The German professor blasts German Green Party in states where it is driving government plans to open forests to allow the construction of wind parks. “This is a catastrophe for most species of predatory birds and bats and the surrounding ecosystem.”
In his piece, Vahrenholt also pleads it is high time for the German federal government to acknowledge that it makes no sense to build additional wind turbines in many areas, as there’s no place for surplus energy to go on windy days.
The German energy expert describes a rising citizens’ resistance to expanding wind energy, but that it may not be enough to deter the government from continuing on its ruinous path. He envisions two possible (gloomy) scenarios for Germany by the year 2020. To find out, readers will have to obtain them from GIS.

"Even if the world celebrates a Paris climate deal on December 11, the process will still have to be regarded as failure. Let me explain why. The basic reason is that the unequal distribution of carbon emissions is not even on its agenda. The historical responsibility of the West is not on the table, nor is a method of national carbon accounting that looks at how the emissions a country consumes rather than produces. Instead, what is on the table are expanded and new mechanisms that will allow the rich, Western countries to outsource their emission cuts so they can paint themselves green. When the figures are in, 2015 is likely to be the warmest year on record and we’ve just reached 1℃ temperature rise since the industrial revolution, halfway to the 2℃ widely agreed to be the upper safe limit of global warming. It’s the fastest surface temperature increase in the world’s known geological history. We are now entering “uncharted territory”. The dangers of global warming have been known – even to oil company executives – since at least the early 1980s. Yet, despite 25 years of UN-led climate talks, the world is burning more fossil fuels than ever. This is not simply the fault of big emerging economies such as China, India or Brazil. Instead, what we are dealing with is the fundamental failure of neoliberal capitalism, the world’s dominant economic system, to confront its hunger for exponential growth that is only made possible by the unique energy density of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. A glance at global history reveals how closely energy is linked to economic growth. The Netherlands was the first country to get a taste for exponential industrial growth back in the 16th and 17th centuries – and the Dutch empire was built on the availability of cheap domestic peat as well as timber from Norwegian and Baltic forests.  One reason the British took over the Netherlands’ imperial leadership was its vast reserves of cheap coal, which started to be burned at the end of the 18th century, exponentially growing in the 19th century. Then came oil and gas, which helped make America the imperial master from the early 20th century onwards.  So there are more than 300 years of massive fossil fuel burning by the so-called West to account for. And while this historical responsibility still played a significant role at Kyoto in 1997 – resulting in emissions cuts that were only legally binding for industrialised countries – it has gradually been pushed into the background.  Now in Paris it seems almost forgotten. But the fact that about 80% of historical carbon emissions have to be attributed to the developed countries cannot simply be wished away. The rapid rise of emissions, particularly in China and India, is often cited as reason for why these rapidly industrialising countries now also have to curb their emissions. I’m not saying that they shouldn’t. Both countries clearly have their own imperial ambitions, which they hope to achieve by stimulating massive industrial expansion.  But let’s bear in mind that India’s carbon emissions per capita are still 10 times lower than those of the US. And China’s rapidly rising emissions are to a great extent driven by export-driven industries, producing consumer goods for the West. In fact if a consumption-based approach to carbon accounting is taken, the UK’s national carbon emissions would be twice as high as officially reported. This is also true for most Western European countries and the United States, which have experienced increasing rates of deindustrialisation over the past two decades with not only jobs but also carbon emissions being offshored to developing countries. In return the West is receiving cheap consumer goods without recognising the responsibility for the embedded carbon emissions that come with them. A clear form of carbon colonialism. Of course, some of the exponential growth in carbon emissions by India and China is also due to increases in home-grown consumption. China apparently now has the largest middle class in the world. However, if we take a consumption-based view, then even China’s emissions per capita will not reach the US’s current rate for a long time – and India’s lag further behind. Yet rich countries continue to be eager to outsource their responsibilities. Carbon offsetting will see an unprecedented growth in the coming years. Countries such as Norway and Switzerland will continue to strike bilateral deals with poor nations desperate for cash. Emissions trading systems (ETS) will allow maximum flexibility for companies to offset their emissions.  These are all mechanisms designed to cement the status quo. The EU ETS has not made a significant impact on the trading bloc’s carbon emissions since its inception in 2005, allowing Shell’s chief executive, Ben Van Beurden, to insist even in 2015 that: “The reality of demand growth is such that fossil fuels will be needed for decades to come.” Nothing significant has changed since Rio 1992 or Kyoto 1997. Paris 2015 will be no different. The talking will continue until we realise climate change is a failure of a system, which – on the back of fossil fuel – is geared towards exponential economic growth. Nobody who sits at the negotiation table in Paris has the mandate nor inclination to ask fundamental, systemic questions of the logic of the dominant economic system and the way we consume the resources of this planet."
"Russia has a reputation as one of the more difficult states involved in international climate negotiations – and don’t expect things to change at the latest UN conference in Paris. After all, this is a country with vast oil and gas reserves, brutal winters and a strong sense of its own economic self-interest. Three main factors will influence Russia’s strategy at the talks. It will want strong recognition of the role forests play in the climate, which would put the country and its 640 billion trees in a good position from which to negotiate emissions reductions.  It will also want commitments from other countries before signing up to a deal – Russia is one of the strongest supporters of the “common but differentiated responsibility” principle in climate politics.  Finally, the country is very unlikely to commit to a deal that will put any pressure on its economic development. As one of the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters in the world, Russia has previously been among the countries standing in the way of global climate agreements. It took more than six years for Moscow to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, for instance, which eventually brought the treaty into effect. This behaviour was explained by political and economic issues which often had little connection with the climate itself – the Kyoto ratification was also held up by negotiations on WTO accession, for instance. Yet this time round the headline pledge is, on the surface, very strong. Russia’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) submitted in March 2015 commits the country to cutting its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 25-30% of the 1990 level by the year 2030.  Such cuts will be possible, Russia says, as it has already broken free from the direct correlation between economic development and GHG emissions. The INDC points out that between 2000 and 2012, for instance, GDP increased 72.9% while GHG emissions increased by just 11.8%. Despite this, Russia’s economy is still considered carbon-intensive due to continuing high levels of emissions per unit of GDP. This is mostly explained by its natural resources, severe winters and outdated and energy-inefficient buildings and infrastructure.  Climate change has slowly entered Russia’s official and public discourse. Even the president, Vladimir Putin, is talking about it these days – he mentioned climate change during the latest UN General Assembly meeting. The latest pledge is certainly a step up from previous promises such as in Copenhagen where Russia only committed to a 15-20% GHG reduction, and the country’s government has set out its plans to address climate change in presidential decrees, national laws, an official climate doctrine and even the state’s energy strategy. However the economic collapse which followed the dissolution of the USSR makes it far easier to reach any target pegged to 1990 levels. Most of the country’s heavy polluting industries failed, causing emissions to drop hugely throughout the 1990s – and they haven’t yet recovered. In fact, to achieve its latest targets, Russia doesn’t even need to cut its emissions. Furthermore, some of the energy efficiency steps which can be counted towards the climate mitigation strategy, such as the modernisation of the energy sector or improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings are in Russia’s best economic interests. It is likely they would have been considered anyway, even without any international obligations.  Traditionally Russia places particular emphasis on the huge taiga which covers much of Siberia and contains more than 70% of the world’s boreal forest. The INDC specifically mentions that the pledge is “subject to the maximum possible account of absorbing capacity of forests”, which in turn is supposed to give some leeway for other industries to continue emitting. However, Russian environmentalists and specialists doubt the forests will have as much impact on the state’s emissions as the government claims. The Russian economy is shaped by the country’s gas reserves – the world’s largest. The largest gas, oil and electricity companies are either directly owned by the state or share very close ties with it. Concepts of energy and state security go hand-in-hand in Russia and fossil fuels are often seen as an important political tool, as demonstrated in numerous gas disputes with neighbouring Ukraine, Belarus and others. All this means Russia is unlikely to spring any surprises in Paris. It will most likely continue to communicate the same message of pursuing a 25-30% GHG emissions cut, while underlining the importance of its forests and that the “common but differentiated responsibility” principle must be observed. Russia will keep prioritising its economic and political stability, thus, any commitments will be the result of careful calculations of whether they will upset that balance."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe greatest obstacle to wind energy is its unreliable, weather-dependent supply. If the wind stops blowing, then it’s lights out!

Image cropped from: www.youtube.com/kGXoE3RFZ8
Yet, proponent’s often claim the solution is offshore, for example out in the tempestuous North Sea. There the wind is always blowing, they like to tell us.
Unfortunately this too is turning out to be more myth the truth, as a recent hard-copy Spiegel report writes:
The hope that the North Sea wind parks would reliably generate power have not been fulfilled up to now. Last month provided an example. On nine days almost windless conditions were seen. On August 17 at times no megawatt of power output was measured.”
Spiegel then reports that when the wind does get especially brisk, the power transmission facilities designed to deliver the power onshore are unable to handle it, writing that “the world’s largest transmission facility of its type, DolWin2, has repeatedly gotten shut down since it began trial operation back in February.”
According to the German news weekly, the facility has again been out of operation since August 26. The blame is a 900-metter long section of a 90-kilometer high voltage line onshore. The bad news, Spiegel reports, is that grid operating company Tennet thinks solving the problems could even take months!

Also giant offshore part Riffgatt was taken offline for a period of half a year, Spiegel writes.
“Spectacular failures”
Wind parks in Germany have not only been riddled with problems technically, but also economically, In early July the BSZ investor watchdog site presented an article titled: “Capital investments in wind energy: lousy returns, spectacular failures, mass corruption, Energiewende finished?”
The BSZ article describes how promises of up to double digit returns in “lucrative and safe” green power investments often never materialize, and investors end up seeing their money evaporate.
Spectacular examples include the insolvency filing by Prokon in May 2014, where 74,000 investors had ponied up approximately 1.4 billion euros. Other failed investment companies include EECH in Hamburg and Windreich in south Germany.
The legal environment for wind parks is also getting more hostile, BSH writes. Courts are now leaning more in favor of parties protesting the encroachment by turbines.
Even Germany’s Umweltbundesamt (ministry of environment) is warning the wind party may be nearing its end:
The Umweltbundesamt is alarmed. Germany-wide, according to the Ministry, which actually is supposed to protect the environment, 97 percent of Germany’s area may not be covered with the tall wind turbines. The Ministry has also ‘warned’ other states that the ‘Energiewende’ is thus finished.”

"European Union leaders have vowed to press on with a major economic plan to confront the climate emergency, despite Poland’s opt-out from a net-zero emissions target by 2050. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, told journalists he had secured an exemption for Poland on the 2050 target, which is meant to become the legally binding centrepiece of the “European Green Deal” , a plan to transform Europe’s economy announced two days ago.  Poland, which relies on coal for 80% of its electricity, is angling for more precise and generous commitments of EU funds to move away from fossil fuels before it agrees to implement the target. “Poland will be reaching climate neutrality at its own pace,” Morawiecki said. The European Green Deal is the EU’s answer to what the European commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the “existential issue” of the climate emergency. Most EU countries have signed up to goal of a climate neutral EU by 2050, a goal demanding dramatic change in energy use, farming, housing, transport, trade and diplomacy. The European Green Deal is only the start of the journey: laws will have to be drafted and agreed by EU ministers and MEPs; money will have to be raised; plans will have to be implemented. It is a route map, rather than a destination, and time is running out. Morawiecki had even floated the idea that Poland should be able to meet the target in 2070, an idea shot down in the leaders’ talks that ran hours over schedule. The European council president, Charles Michel, who wanted a success at his first summit in the chair, declared victory on the 2050 target, despite the ambiguity about Poland. “Climate neutrality by 2050 is our common goal,” he told journalists after 10 hours of talks. “But at the same time it is correct that for one member state, at this stage, it is not possible to commit to implement this objective.” He added: “It is very important for the European Union, the strong message today is we want to become the first climate neutral continent by 2050.” Leaders expect Poland to sign up to implementing the target in June. The French president Emmanuel Macron tweeted: “Yes Europe will be the first carbon neutral continent! We did it together last night. Let’s move on now to implement the green new deal.” Asked whether the EU had a common goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, one diplomat said “nearly”, adding: “It’s not the strongest political signal you could give. You have 27 saying they support it and Poland saying we don’t object if the others support it.” A greater diplomatic embarrassment was narrowly averted – following a previous failure to agree the target in June – via some linguistic gymnastics in the EU summit text. “The European council [of EU leaders] endorses the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. One member state, at this stage, cannot commit to implement this objective as far as it is concerned, and the European council will come back to this in June 2020,” states the text, which was agreed after hours of wrangling over timetables and money. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Poland’s position would not deter the commission from moving ahead with the next steps of the green deal. She has promised to publish details of a €100bn (£83bn) “just transition fund” in January to help European economies make the green transition, in addition to €1tn the European Investment Bank has said it plans to generate from public and (mostly) private sources. Von der Leyen said she accepted it was necessary for Poland “to have a closer look” at the details of the just transition fund. EU leaders were more successful in bringing into the fold two other countries that had previously opposed the target: the Czech Republic and Hungary. Both want generous guarantees of EU funds for their green transition. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, who had gone into the summit discussion “all guns blazing”, according to one diplomatic source, came onboard after an agreement that nuclear energy could be referenced in the summit text. He claimed: “Nuclear energy is clean energy, without any emissions. And I don’t know why a lot of countries have a problem with this.” EU member states are free to choose whether to use nuclear power, but the debate over the controversial energy source bogged down the discussions for hours, with Luxembourg’s anti-nuclear government opposed to any reference in a climate text. The tense discussion on the 2050 target heralds even more difficult talks on agreeing tougher greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030. The commission wants to cut the EU’s emissions by at least 50% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels), but that requires member states taking decisive steps to decarbonise their economies in the short term. Campaigners said the EU’s decision fell short of the action needed. “A target 30 years in the future in 2050 does not represent emergency action, and it absolutely must be matched with immediate action to dramatically reduce climate emissions everywhere,” Susann Scherbarth, climate justice spokesperson for Friends of the Earth Europe, said in a statement. “The huge demonstrations of people calling for climate justice know that all of Europe must phase out all fossil fuels, including gas, in the next decade – today’s announcement won’t reassure them of a safer future. “Like the green deal unveiled by the European commission yesterday, this promise risks being too late and too vague on details how it will be achieved.” "

Share this...FacebookTwitterBack in the 1970s, many media outlets warned of global cooling and even a possible coming ice age. For example here I wrote about how Spiegel in 1974 grimly reported of threatening global cooling and that the odds of global warming were “at best” only 1 in 10,000!
Current warm period “coming to an end”
It turns out that the flagship German weekly news magazine here also warned of global cooling on January 10, 1977, citing leading global climate scientists:
The current warm period, they forecast, is coming to an end.”
In the article Spiegel describes summertime conditions in Europe at the peak of the last ice age, some 18,000 years ago, which “American and European scientists have precisely reconstructed” and ascertained how it had been “very much warmer 120,000 years ago then it is today.”
Spiegel described the works of “Climap”, which had involved scientists from 17 universities charged with the goal of researching the “long term fluctuations of the earth’s climate and developing models for the long-term forecasts“. Also “Climap studied the interrelationships on a decadal scale between the world’s oceans, the atmosphere and the continents as well as the cosmic effects“.
Spiegel wrote how it had been discovered that ice ages had been the normal over the past million years and that the current Holocene had been just a break in the cold.
All of this had been driven by solar-earth orbital variations, among other theories that had been proposed: solar irradiance, cosmic dust, changing earth’s magnetic fields, volcanic aerosols, CO2 distribution over the oceans, polar ice cap extent, ocean currents, etc., the article wrote.
“Widespread glaciation”
Spiegel described that Climap expert James D. Hays, John Imbrie and Nicholas J. Shackleton had examined the Milankovitch cycles and this had led them to conclude that changes in the earth’s orbit had been the “fundamental cause” of the cycles between ice age and warm periods.

Spiegel quoted the scientists:
The trend for the next 20,000 years is headed for a widespread glaciation of the northern hemisphere. and a colder climate.”
Spiegel added:
The earth’s orbit, namely after having been extremely elliptical, is again approaching a circular form, which is characteristic for the ice ages.”
Temperature drop of 0.3°C since 1940s
Spiegel warned of dire consequences:
Since the mid 1940s, for example, the mean annual temperature has fallen 0.3° Celsius: and indeed snow and ice area during this time has expanded by more than a tenth. Also the droughts in the African Sahel zone and the past summers in Europe are being ascribed to the minimally seeming heat loss.”
CIA warning!
Spiegel also wrote that even the CIA had taken the findings very seriously:
America’s intelligence service in any case already summarized the Climap findings in a warning to the US government. The CIA prophesized that the climate would soon simulate soon once again the 1600 to 1850 so-called Little Ice Age — ‘a time of drought, hunger and political unrest’.”

"Suppose your relationship is falling apart and you want to save it. To find the best counsellor, you might search online or ask your friends. It’s no different in agriculture. The rational response to any food or farming dilemma is to test and compare different options to see which is most effective as a solution.  Except when it comes to genetic modification (GM). I have yet to hear of a research trial where a newly developed GM crop has been compared with other approaches to address the problem it claims to solve. If the goal was to identify the most effective solution, this would be very odd – but if the real goal is to find a use for the technology, it makes perfect sense.   Here’s an example from my work in the subtropics (I better not name the country). In the 2000s, one region experienced several consecutive years of severe drought. The worst affected area saw over 3,000 wells dry up, and over 2,000 of its cattle lost. Many farmers were unable to sow their staple maize crop. The easy culprit was climate change, since temperatures had risen half a degree in recent years. What was less frequently pointed out was the poor condition of the soils: 60% suffered from erosion, 40% had low water retention, and 45% had low fertility – all the result of several decades of industrial agriculture.  The mainstream agricultural sector proposed constructing a large water pipeline from the wetter part of the country to the drier parts. Yet the government didn’t have the funds. A GM drought-tolerant maize was also suggested, but thankfully wasn’t yet available. I started working with a local research team to develop a low-cost pilot in two communities with a very different approach. It sought to help farmers understand the water cycle and manage water sustainably; and also to experiment with simple techniques to improve soil fertility. These included planting cover crops, which are crops put there primarily to protect the bare soil from high temperatures and from water escaping through plants and Earth (evapotranspiration); as well as adding organic fertilisers; rainwater harvesting and testing numerous crop varieties to see which worked best. Farmers and households were particularly supported to share their own local knowledge and experiences. After just one year, we saw various intended and unintended results. There was much more crop diversity, and yields and production had increased across the board. Manure had become a valuable resource, which farmers were collecting systematically from livestock. There was more water available for these animals, and the soil’s capacity for water retention had improved too. The farmers were widely using biological fertilisers, and had generally become better at working together and experimenting.   Above all, the first vegetable market had opened – previously there had never been any surplus to sell – along with an informal seed market. Family incomes had gone up and there were more nutritious foods for everyone. For an investment of just £15,000, the project seemed to tick all the development boxes.  Most telling were the responses from community members who were asked what had changed:  A year ago drought was a worry to us, but now we don’t rate this as important as other concerns. The main change? Now we can afford for all the children in our village to wear shoes.  Suppose instead that a GM drought-tolerant maize had been available at the time. Farmers would have had to buy patented seed every year. At best, the crop would have needed slightly less water and the yield might have been maintained or even increased a little. No other crops could have been grown since the soil would have remained degraded, and irrigation would have still been required. (This kind of GM maize has since been developed, at a cost of millions of pounds.) I’m not the only one with these sorts of findings. Previous studies have shown that this kind of agroecological approach produces better results than GM in terms of environmental impact, human health and societal benefits; while it has been convincingly argued that using GM varieties does nothing for biodiversity in agriculture.  The conventional corporate model legally obliges chief executives – on behalf of shareholders – to prioritise profits over ethics and sustainability, whatever their personal inclination. It is a manifestation of an underlying mindset. This can be seen in Cuba, where until recently there was no private corporate sector, and where the government made several varieties of GM maize available to some parts of the country in 2006. Cuba inherited its agricultural approach from the former Soviet Union, which unwittingly shared a mindset with Western countries that has been dominant for over 300 years.  Borrowing from the French philosopher Descartes, this world view breaks down complex processes into smaller parts to be analysed in isolation, and sees nature as a resource to be exploited and conquered. It wasn’t and isn’t always so – as indigenous communities continue to demonstrate with their reverence for nature and their sense of inter-connectedness. The organic and regenerative farming movements attempt to take a similar approach, as did the “drought-proofing” project that I outlined above.  GM is simply a manifestation of the same misguided industrial mindset, a mindset that tries to control nature rather than work with it. From a psychological perspective, the need to control is driven by fear, as I found from years of interviewing farmers about why they felt they needed to continue with industrial agriculture rather than switch to organic. Allowing private companies to peddle their wares in the name of development or to “feed the world” is arguably immoral when there are alternatives that can bring much wider benefits. If GM were banned, though, similar problematic technologies would continue to present themselves. It is the mindset from which they emerge that needs reprogrammed. Its not as if there aren’t better ways of achieving the same result."
"The South-East Asian haze crisis has made Indonesia very unpopular with its neighbours. Yet its government can’t do much about it. Local elites, who call the shots in the forested regions, don’t want to tackle the crisis – and they’re able to stand up to national leaders in Jakarta. The haze is caused by man-made forest fires, mostly on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan, often started to clear land for palm oil plantations. It’s an annual event, though this year El Niño has meant drier conditions and thus particularly bad haze – the worst since 1997. During a major haze year, smoky air can harm the health of an estimated 75m people. It has been estimated that the fires will cost the Indonesian government $47 billion – and Singaporean and Malaysia’s will also be affected, thanks to airport and business closures and increased healthcare costs. The fires have tripled Indonesia’s carbon emissions this year – in just a few months the fires alone have emitted more carbon than the annual emissions of Germany or Japan. Malaysia and Singapore have both criticised Indonesia’s handling of the crisis and called for action. The regional organisation ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) has unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the crisis through an agreement on trans-boundary haze which calls for strong national and international efforts.  Indonesia has ratified the treaty and the central government at least seems committed to tackling the crisis. Indonesian president, Joko Widodo (or “Jokowi” as he is known) has extended a moratorium on logging in affected areas and made a point of promptly visiting areas ravaged by fires. When fires occur, aircraft and military are deployed to combat them. In attempting to deal with the haze, Indonesia’s central government is hamstrung by the country’s decentralised set-up and opposition from local governmental elites and “regents”, known as “bupatis”, which are interested in preventing enforcement of anti-haze laws. Often they have lucrative relationships with the large palm oil companies that are responsible for the fires – which has led to corruption, collusion and networks of patronage in these provinces.   This wouldn’t matter if the local elites were ineffective or couldn’t stand up to central government. However decentralising policies over the past 16 years have handed more power to local governments, meaning bupatis and other elites are now perfectly capable of preventing significant law enforcement and letting the loggers do what they like. These elites subvert central power and policy without significant risk of prosecution – they simply don’t answer to Jakarta. There have been only limited prosecutions of the firms responsible for the haze, and local individuals often become scapegoats for large companies. Given that Jakarta is largely unable to affect things in the distant forests, there’s little chance of a regional solution either. If local officials in rural Indonesia won’t take orders from central government, they certainly won’t listen to Malaysia or Singapore. The only way to prevent the haze will be to remove the capability or the motivation of local elites, especially bupatis, and palm oil companies to subvert national law. Of the two options removing the motivation is the easiest. By increasing law enforcement and enacting harsher prosecution, Jakarta could signal to the bupatis and companies that corruption and collusion is no longer acceptable, and maintaining these networks would have costly consequences. However law enforcement is once again often devolved at local level and sometimes too closely involved in the issues.  Indonesia faces significant structural problems in trying to combat corruption and patronage networks. The Corruption Eradication Committee (KPK), an anti-corruption organisation separate from the police, needs strengthening. Jakarta could use money to get local elites to switch sides. Caps on political donations and a lack of campaign subsidies mean only limited finance makes its way to local candidates, who still face high costs. Amending these caps or allowing limited subsidies would reduce incentives for local politicians to side with the loggers. Subsidising more efficient land clearance for palm oil companies may also prevent companies from resorting to the cheapest possible method – burning. However, this would require strong political will as no one wants to see government costs rise. Beyond this, the only option available to Jakarta is to undertake massive structural reform to ensure the power of the central government is increasingly felt in the provinces. This would mean bupatis, palm oil companies and local law enforcement weren’t able to do anything illegal without significant risk. It’s a daunting task, however – and not the favoured option of central government. To prevent the recurrence of the haze crisis, Indonesia’s government must either get local elites on board, or ensure they aren’t able to resist anti-haze policies dictated from Jakarta. Unfortunately both require central strength and willingness, which seems in short supply in recent years. Be prepared for similar hazy headlines next year – and the year after that."

By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
Also last month the sun was relatively inactive. The observed sunspot number (SSN) was 44.7, which was just 64% of what is the average for the previously observed 23 cycles.
The average cycle has a duration of 11 years. The current cycle number 24 is depicted by the red curve in the following chart:
Figure 1: The current solar cycle 24 is shown in red. The mean of the previous 23 cycles is shown by the blue curve. The black curve depicts solar cycle 5, which had a similar behavior as the current cycle 25.
What stands out is that the last 18 months of activity of the current cycle has been consistently weaker than during the same period of solar cycle 5, which ushered in the Dalton-Minimum in 1795.
So what can we say about the upcoming solar cycle 25, which is expected to begin around 2020? Next month we will take another look at the solar polar field because its strength is a leading indicator for what the sun has in store for us. Up to now everything looks like the situation we saw in the early 19th century.The comparison of the individual cycles with respect to their sunspot deviation from the mean after 94 months into the cycle follows:

Figure 2: The accumulated monthly sunspot totals for each cycle and their respective deviation from the mean (blue curve in Figure 1), 94 months into the cycle. Only 2 cycles were less active than the current cycle: cycles no. 5 and 6 – some 200 years ago!   The second half of the 20th century was the most active phase with respect to amplitude and duration.
Beginning with solar cycle 18 in the year 1944 until the mid 1990s (SC22) there were 4 strong cycles. The peak was SC 19, which ended in 1964. SC 21 was the third strongest cycle and 1986. The strong cycles ceased in 2005, and one is not expected with strong certainty until 2033.
===================================
Note from NTZ: Yesterday Kenneth Richard posted on 18 very recent papers showing a strong correlation between solar activity and global temperature over the past centuries. Many accept that periods of low solar activity lead to periods of global cool-offs. But some experts caution that the effects from the series of the powerful solar cycles of the late 20th century will not be offset by the single weak cycle we are currently experiencing.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday just a few comments on Trump’s spectacular victory.
Don’t let the title above mislead you. The overwhelming majority of the German media were shocked and infuriated by Trump’s against-all-odds victory. Indeed if Germans had cast their votes in the US election, Hillary would have won by a margin of something like 94 – 6.  That’s how disgustingly one-sided the press here is.
Yet, there are a few journalists/commentators who had the courage to express the harsh, politically incorrect truth of the US election result.
What follow are some examples of non-conforming reaction to Trump’s spectacular victory.
“hate-filled arrogance”
Roger Köppel of the Swiss Weltwoche here writes:
I can understand that some reject Trump and criticize his positions. But what really annoyed me was the hate-filled arrogance coming from fat-cat elites who with great certainty believe that it is a sort of blasphemy whenever someone stands up and challenges their claim to power.”
He summarizes:
The arrogant political cartel, which Trump was fighting, experienced a staggering defeat.”
“High altitude flight of arrogance and disdain!
Henryk M. Broder (right) commented at national daily Die Welt here, where he described how he started the election evening by attending a ritzy election party in Berlin, wholly occupied by Hillary supporters, pundits and elitists of every type. Outside he couldn’t help notice a huge, white stretch-limousine parked outside waiting to ferry guests to the next stop for celebrating a Clinton victory. Broder titled his commentary:
A high altitude flight by arrogance and disdain.”
He writes that he too was convinced Clinton would win. After all: “So many intelligent people in one single spot just couldn’t possibly be wrong.” When the result became clear, Broder says he couldn’t help feeling “a bit of Schadenfreude“. He summarizes:

What do we learn from this? The political elites, starting with the think tanks and ending with the top of the EU, have no clue about the USA. They know where to find the best margaritas in New York, the best spare ribs in Washington and the best tacos in Los Angeles, yet they do not understand America.”
“Collapsed expectations”
At Germany’s flagship political daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung here, journalist Frank Lübberding writes how expectations by Germany’s elitist media collapsed before their very eyes. To explain Trump’s voter base, charts and figures from ARD moderator Jörg Schönenborn were used to clearly show that Trump’s message resonated “only with white men who had little education“. Schönenborn insisted at the beginning of the evening: “Hillary Clinton’s chances are much greater.”
Lübberding then writes that in the ARD studio in Cologne there was only a pro-Clinton audience – and one single “Never-Trump” republican. That was the overall atmosphere. Only the Clinton perspective was presented.
Lübberding then describes the atmosphere of shock and stun that spread across the pro-Clinton ARD studio as the results came to show that Trump would roll to victory. What happened? To explain, Lübbermann cites data presented in the studio from Virgina:
In Virginia white women with college degrees voted as often for Trump as they did for his opponent. That Trump appealed to white uneducated men, a claim that pollsters often heard during the campaign was impressively refuted on that evening.
The picture in reality was nothing what the German media elitists and think tanks believed it had been.
“Shock therapy” for the elitist class
Finally, chief editor Markus Somm at the Swiss Basler Zeitung writes how the elitists have in fact become “trapped by the ideology of privilege” and that anyone who views things differently, or suffers under the elitits, is “berated or ignored“. In talk shows guests who maintain other views are almost excluded. And when they are invited, they are hugely outnumbered so that a pile-on results.
Somm calls the result of the election “shock therapy” for the elitists, and he issues a dire warning for Europe:
What happened in the USA, where a totally non-tested outsider succeeded in capturing the highest office, this is only the beginning. Many countries in the West will soon experience something similar. A revolutionary mood has taken over. […] It is hardly a coincidence. Switzerland, Great Britain, Netherlands, the USA: these are countries that are among the oldest democracies of the West. The more mature and established the democratic traditions are, the more the people’s resistance comes to surface, and thus the more the elitists tremble.”

The year without a summer: how Europe descended into climate chaos


The year 1816 is barely four months old and the people of Upper Swabia are already facing a catastrophe of Biblical proportions. […] in the months that follow, the rain falls and the wind howls without mercy – and snow even falls on the Swabian Jura mountains in July. … The consequences are fatal, not just for this region on the fringes of the Alps, but for all of central and western Europe.
Famine and exodus

The failed harvest is followed by hunger and chaos. Grain prices go through the roof, cattle perish or have to be slaughtered as a last resort, and people start looting. Soon, the entire supply system collapses. … This is followed by mass emigration: hordes of people leave … Baden and Württemberg are faced with exodus.
The rural population, in particular, turns to supernatural explanations, seeing the extreme weather as a punishment from God. ….a huge eruption of the Mount Tambora volcano on the island of Sumbawa (now part of Indonesia) in April 1815 is to blame for the plight currently experienced in Europe.
Extreme volcanic eruption
Thomas Stamford Raffles, the British Lieutenant-Governor of Java […] thought a cannon was being fired in the immediate vicinity. […] however, was some 800 kilometres away from Tambora. … It is now clear that this was one of the largest eruptions in modern human history.
Sulphuric gases make their way to Europe
…huge quantities of sulphuric gas were released. …aerosol clouds formed…arrived in the northern hemisphere, …and absorbed large amounts of sunlight. As a result, the weather in Europe went haywire. …
Prices spiralled further out of control, many people were left destitute… Anti-Semitism also flared up: Jews were vilified … there were even violent attacks on the Jewish population in many places.”
Like they falsely blamed God for punishing the people back then, today we find ourselves not a bit wiser barking again up the wrong tree.

"When COP 21 begins in Paris, the world’s leaders will review the climate framework agreed in Rio in 1992. For well over 20 years, the world has not just been thinking and talking about climate change, it has also been writing and reading about it, in blogs, newspapers, magazines – and in novels.  Climate change fiction is now a recognisable literary phenomenon replete with its own nickname: “Cli-fi”. The term was coined in 2007 by Taiwan-based blogger Dan Bloom. Since then, its use has spread: it was even tweeted by Margaret Atwood in 2012.  It is not a genre in the accepted scholarly sense, since it lacks the plot formulas or stylistic conventions that tend to define genres (such as science fiction or the western). However, it does name a remarkable recent literary and publishing trend. Putting a number to this phenomenon depends, partly, on how one defines cli-fi. How much of a novel has to be devoted to climate change before it is considered cli-fi? Should we restrict the term to novels about man-made global warming? (If we don’t, we should remember that narratives about global climatic change are as old as The Epic of Gilgamesh and the Biblical story of the flood.) If we define cli-fi as fictional treatments of climate change caused by human activity in terms of setting, theme or plot – and accept there will be grey areas in the extent of this treatment – a conservative estimate would put the all-time number of cli-fi novels at 150 and growing. This is the figure put forward by Adam Trexler, who has worked with me to survey the development of cli-fi. This definition also gives us a start date for cli-fi’s history. While planetary climatic change occurs in much 20th-century science fiction, it is only after growing scientific awareness of specifically man-made, carbon-induced climate change in the 1960s and 1970s that novels on this subject emerged. The first is Arthur Herzog’s Heat in 1976, followed by George Turner’s The Sea and the Summer (published in the US as Drowning Towers) in 1987.  At the turn of this century, Maggie Gee and TC Boyle were among the first mainstream authors to publish climate change novels. In this century, we can count Atwood, Michael Crichton, Barbara Kingsolver, Ian McEwan, Kim Stanley Robinson, Ilija Trojanow and Jeanette Winterson as major authors who have written about climate change. The past five years have given us notable examples of cli-fi by emerging authors, such as Steven Amsterdam, Edan Lepucki, Jane Rawson, Nathaniel Rich and Antti Tuomainen.  Cli-fi is all the more noteworthy considering the creative challenge posed by climate change. First, there is the problem of scale – spatial and temporal. Climate change affects the entire planet and all its species – and concerns the end of this planet as we know it. Novels, by contrast, conventionally concern the actions of individual protagonists and/or, sometimes, small communities.  Added to this is the networked nature of climate change: in physical terms, the climate is a large, complex system whose effects are difficult to model. In socio-cultural terms, solutions require intergovernmental agreement – just what COP21 intends – and various top-down and bottom-up transformations. Finally, there exists the difficulty of translating scientific information, with all its predictive uncertainty, into something both accurate and interesting to the average reader.  Still, cli-fi writers have adopted a range of strategies to engage their readers. Many cli-fi novels could be classified as dystopian, post-apocalyptic or, indeed, both – depicting nightmarish societies triggered by sometimes catastrophic climate events. A future world is one effective way of narrating the planetary condition of climate change.  Some novelists are also careful to underpin their scenarios with rigorous climatic predictions and, in this way, translate science fact into a fictional setting. Kingsolver, who trained as an ecologist, is the best example of this – and Atwood and Robinson are also known for their attempts at making their speculations scientifically plausible. Also, cli-fi novels, particularly those set in the present day or very near future rather than in a dystopian future, tend to show the political or psychological dimensions of living with climate change. Readers can identify with protagonists. To some extent, the global community is represented in fictional everymen or everywomen. Or, often, it is through such characters that science is humanised and its role in combating climate change better understood.  Could cli-fi affect how we think and act on climate change? The paradox is that the harder cli-fi tries, the less effective it is. Many writers want to inspire change, not insist on it: the line between literature and propaganda is one that most novelists respect. Literature invites us to inhabit other worlds and live other lives. Cli-fi at its best lets us travel to climate-changed worlds, to strive there alongside others and then to return armed with that experience.  In Paris, the UN will seek a global agreement on climate action for the first time in more than 20 years. There is plenty of climate change fiction out there to help provide the mental and psychological space to consider that action."

The Dutch-British publishing company Elsevier B.V. has put online a paper entitled “Earth Climate Identification vs. Detection and Attribution”. This publication, referenced on the ScienceDirect website, was revised in the due rules by a peer committee in Annual Reviews in Control (ARC), one of the seven scientific journals of IFAC, federating thousands of international experts in automatic control and modelisation of complex systems.
The paper’s author, Professor Philippe de Larminat, applied the proven techniques of dynamical systems identification to the Earth climate, using paleoclimatic databases available from the major institutes and international organizations. It follows that “with a 90% probability level, one cannot reject the hypothesis of a zero anthropogenic contribution”. While “the hypothesis of a low sensitivity to solar activity must be rejected with a probability level greater than 90%.”
Conversely, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) considers that “it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the middle of the 20th century”, this on the basis of the “Detection and Attribution”, a theory explicitly dedicated to anthropogenic attribution of recent climate change.
The paper presents and clarifies the causes of this contradiction:
• The main one is due to the durations used for climate observations: a thousand years for identification, at most one hundred and fifty years for the Detection-Attribution, thereby eliminating the millennia events of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, notoriously correlated to solar activity. “It has the effect of minimizing the contribution of solar activity,” says the author.
• The second contradiction is due to a confusion between cause and effect, about the El Niño events. The author examines the reasons for this “heavy methodological error, which is obvious to any expert in systems science”.
Could the Philippe de Larminat publication challenge the prevailing consensus on anthropogenic climate change, consensus which is turning the world economic issues (COP 21, 22) as far as the moral issues (Laudato si)? Questioned on the eventuality that a new consensus can emerge, that of a preponderant influence of solar activity on the climate, the author only recalls:

Neither the consensus nor the votes have any place in science; only the evidence matter. To the argument of authority, French philosopher Descartes opposed the authority of the argument. But the consensus is only a submission to the argument of authority, the lowest ever.”
This publication, whose part is accessible even to the non-experts, confirms the conclusions already advanced by the author in his previous work “Climate change – identification and projections” (ISTE/Wiley, 2014).

"Everyone has experienced it. Striding along in a purposeful hurry, your progress is thwarted by a slow-moving pedestrian, dawdling along the pavement. Perhaps they’re talking into their mobile phone, looking lost or just plain taking their time. It can drive you mad. The question is: should it? According to unsubstantiated research commissioned by UK retailer Argos, 47% of British people find slow walking the most annoying aspect of high-street shopping, while 30% say that they would like a system of fast lanes to cater for the high street’s speedier pedestrians.  And so the retailer has obliged, initiating a one-week trial of “fast track” phone-free pedestrian lanes, marked on the footway through a shopping complex in Liverpool.  Similar schemes already have made appearances in Washington DC and Chongqing, China, so could this be the start of a global trend? In the past, the retail sector has been notoriously slow in supporting schemes such as pedestrianisation in town centres, on the basis that the reduction in car traffic would reduce their trade. In fact, the opposite has usually turned out to be the case. Even so, it will be interesting to see if the scheme provides a better retail experience and boost sales. I have to say, I am doubtful.  For one thing, it’s probable that many people will ignore the lanes: especially if they’re too absorbed in their phones to notice the markings on the pavement.  But then perhaps this is because a mobile phone provides a greater source of interest to people than the environment around them. As far as one can tell, the pedestrian environment in many cities is rather featureless, even grim. It’s not clear that pedestrian lanes could achieve better results for retailers than, say, making their products, services and appearance sufficiently appealing to attract people’s attention. But my real concern runs deeper. What makes a city is its people. Buildings and infrastructure should be designed and constructed to serve them, and to help improve their quality of life. To this end, a city’s design should encourage courtesy.  People – and especially elderly people – should not have to struggle to cross the road in a short time, to avoid annoying drivers, or constantly worry about other, hurrying pedestrians. Our public spaces should not be so frightening as to exclude vision- or hearing-impaired people.  The problem is that we have spent so much of the last few decades designing traffic systems that we think that people behave like cars. But they don’t. Cars need lots of room, and formal structures such as lanes and traffic lights to allocate time and space on the roads, because they cannot share.  People, on the other hand, are essentially social beings, who respond sensorially to the individuals and places around them. We have higher ideals than just occupying space for the shortest possible time. Providing space and time to pause, breathe, linger and live is one of the great urban design objectives. By creating spaces that make it easy for people to give way to each other, to stop and chat, we can enhance the social use and enjoyment of our public spaces. And stress-reduction through urban design is not only desirable – it’s also achievable. We can see the success of schemes designed to encourage lingering in spaces such as Campo di Siena, Broadway in New York, the Lungomare in Naples. In places such as these, people are encouraged to stop, look around, enjoy a coffee, chat, absorb the atmosphere.  As a result, people feel happier and more relaxed – they enjoy themselves. The city feels better, the shops have more trade, and people engage with their surroundings, rather than switching off (or switching their phones on).  As part of my research on future cities, I have been part of discussions with people from a variety of professional sectors, including health, planning, heritage, architecture, education and retail. We talked about which features help improve quality of life in our cities, and make them more sustainable.  Overwhelmingly, the strongest comment from each group has been that the future city should be slower, more relaxed, with more of our daily essentials accessible to everyone within walking distance.  Just because slow walkers are said to cause stress, doesn’t mean we should design the city to accommodate fast walkers. Nor should we be designing urban environments which forcibly slow people down. The answer, it seems to me, is to create spaces that cause people to want to slow down: where the real is more pleasurable than the virtual, and people want to linger and enjoy their environment. At that point, fast lanes for pedestrians become irrelevant."
"In the last week of October, Scott Morrison got more involved with the Prime Minister’s XI match than most who have held the office. While the home team took on a touring Sri Lankan side, Morrison spent a Canberra evening running out drink bottles to the players for some good wholesome everyman sporting photo opportunities. Before the season’s first Test in November he was back at the cricket again, shaking hands with Test players at training in Brisbane and posting some new snaps with a musing: “For our firefighters and fire-impacted communities, I’m sure our boys will give them something to cheer for.” However debatable the national morale value of David Warner towelling up teenage bowlers on debut, by early December, “our boys” were feeling the impact of fire themselves. Players for New South Wales and Queensland went about a state match cloaked in thick bushfire smoke. The images from the Sydney Cricket Ground were bizarre: the familiar scene of a cricket match blurred out through a monochromatic haze, somewhere between static and a fade to black. Recognisable figures like Trent Copeland and Steve O’Keefe reduced to silhouettes, dim shapes celebrating wickets through the fug. They were running in to bowl while air pollution in the city topped out at a dozen times the official threshold for hazardous. While people questioned whether the Melbourne Test might be unplayable because of the quality of the pitch, more salient was whether the Sydney Test might be unplayable because of the quality of the air. The smoke-out had been going on for weeks as NSW burned. In a cricket context it brought to mind matches in Delhi, where industrial fumes and agricultural burning create a thick haze at certain times of year, especially when adding the after-effects of Diwali fireworks. This hasn’t stopped Indian authorities scheduling matches in the city – the Sri Lanka team played in face masks and had players vomiting in the change rooms during a Test in 2017. Admitting the reality of the climate crisis has been tagged as a political position rather than basic sanity In other cricket countries we have shrugged this off as an India problem, chalking it up to corruption and poor governance. But it is global practice for leaders to ignore pollution that is created by the financial interests of the rich and a lack of alternatives for everyone else. Call Delhi an India problem, but here was Sydney looking the same, with federal and state governments just as keen to avoid talking about causes or solutions. Morrison’s posing with cricketers came to look even more flimsy. Cricket was supposed to be the vehicle for escapism from bushfire season, but became subject to the same problem. Even as the country burns, Australia has a government and an opposition that stay cosy with the coal and oil industries to avoid a powerful electoral enemy, and to keep the campaign donations coming in. ABC political correspondent Barrie Cassidy wrote: “I don’t think we’ve ever had a government so out of touch with a national concern and an opposition so incapable of putting the pressure on them.” Admitting the scientific reality of our collective problem has been tagged as a political position rather than basic sanity. The supposed measures being taken and emissions reduced are largely illusions or creative accounting from a regime for whom meaningful change would be viewed as some abstract defeat. So this week we had a prime minister in a city choked by smoke addressing the media about a religious discrimination bill, another pointless artefact of a culture war that interests approximately 12 columnists and one former rugby winger. We have members of cabinet saying it’s insensitive to discuss the cause of fires while they are still burning. A fire season spanning half the year will be quite the brake on conversation. That same prime minister wouldn’t meet with emergency chiefs months ago who were urging him to lease extra water bombers for the season ahead. He rejected calls this week to assist volunteer firefighters who are crowdfunding for supplies. He responded to Australia’s ranking as the worst-performing developed country on the climate crisis by saying “We don’t accept that report.” You can do that now, apparently, with anything you don’t like. Perhaps the most striking line from his government came from minister Paul Fletcher when asked about the clear link between climate and fires. “I don’t pretend to be an expert in this area,” he replied. With respect Paul – become one. You could start by taking briefings from experts. It’s your job, and it’s kind of important. No sport is more vulnerable to climate breakdown than cricket. Its whole spiritual core – the grass pitch that changes organically over the days of a match – depends on the right amounts of watering and sunshine, of soil acidity and not too much heat. Its great enemy is drought, turning lushness to dust. Sports fields are among the first expendable items when the water dries up. That’s before we come to players, strapping on heavy kit for full days of exertion in the sun. Each degree makes a difference; a rising average means irreversible change. Cricket does not have a plan for this. No ICC agreement, little action from most member boards. Cricket Australia is just now starting to move with urgency, putting together a thorough policy to be voted on in 2020. Environmental changes have been minor and piecemeal: plastic bottles banned at one ground, renewable energy installed at another. Worthwhile, but not co-ordinated. Hundreds of parts per million short of enough. The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. In the meantime, the sport keeps churning through resources. Not just the water for grounds or willow for bats or power for floodlights. The mountains of garbage left at stadiums. The thousands of cars ferrying people to watch. The hundreds of thousands of domestic and international flights carrying teams and families and support staff between series, players between the multitude of leagues, press boxes full of media and bays full of supporters along on tours. Cricket officialdom is rich with people from Morrison’s Liberal and National political type. This is the sport that tried to nominate former prime minister John Howard to lead the ICC, and decided that former NSW premier Mike Baird did such a fine job with Sydney’s cultural life that he should join the state’s cricket board. Yet these contacts aren’t delivering. A game that needs leadership is getting none federally, and a game that can provide its own has barely moved on its most pressing issue. Now we’re halfway through a Test in Perth, but that doesn’t mean the show has gone on. The forecast for the entire match is over 40, as it was for the 2013 Ashes. The smokebombed match at the SCG is over, but moving on to the next thing doesn’t mean we’re done. The last decade has been a consistent parade of hottest months on record, hottest years, hottest daily highs, adding new colours to heat charts, longer fire seasons overlapping California to Australia while droughts ravage both. The numbers are clear and irrefutable. When anyone in this area raises their eyes from the playing arena, there are those who will tell them to stick to sport. But sport is not an island, and even if it were the tide is rising. Sport exists in the world around it. Cricket is affected by, and is affecting the climate crisis, a basic truth. The past few weeks have only served to demonstrate it more graphically than before. Cricket exists alongside the smoke that chokes cities and the fires threatening towns, the same world as the firefighters arrayed against them. The same world as a prime minister who likes to run out the drink bottles and smile for the photos, and gesture vaguely at the problem without acknowledging its existence. But it does exist. It’s not going away. And cricket is just one small part of our lives that deserves better."
"One of the toughest things for those of us who actually accept the science on climate change is to maintain optimism that anything will be done. After weeks like the one we’ve just had, I sometimes wonder how long it will be before our major political parties shift from talking about reducing emissions and instead arguing over how to best deal with the impact of climate change. You know the sort of thing – “Should we means-test free access to P2 masks?” or “Should there be a mutual obligation regime for climate-change relief?” – and before you know it the Australian and the other climate change-denying News Corp media outlets will be running editorials about how “we need to get more people off climate change welfare”. It is a shift we need to fight against – the war to prevent disastrous climate change is not lost, but it will be if we allow political parties to raise the white flag. Of course climate change has already affected our lives in a way that requires governments to adjust. This is most obvious regarding the need to alter projections of how much money we need to allocate for fighting fire. In the space of two days this week we saw the prime minister completely contradict himself on the issue of extra funding for firefighting services. On Tuesday he said more support was not needed because “the commonwealth puts $15m a year into that and we put an additional $11m this year in, in response to what we knew was going to be a very difficult fire season”. On Thursday he said more support was needed, telling reporters: “Today we have announced a further $11m that we’re putting into the aerial firefighting fleet. That is on top of the $15m that we already put in on annual basis.” Apparently this is a new $11m, not the old $11m promised this time last year, although it is passing strange that Scott Morrison in announcing the new funding did not reference that this was on top of an already extra $11m. But then there’s not a lot of sense in any of these things. We live in a time where climate change denialism is a safer route for a conservative than is acknowledging reality. This is mostly because the main media company in this country, from its editors through to its leading columnists, has an approach to climate change denial that is impervious to logic, reason and basic maths. This week the New South Wales environment minister, Matt Kean, stated the obvious when he noted the link between increased severity of bushfires and climate change. On Friday the Daily Telegraph responded by smearing him on its front page. A conservative stating reality on climate change is now considered a betrayal, and a progressive stating reality is portrayed as an extremist. And you can thus see why the Labor party has chosen to largely dissociate itself from the climate change movement, a movement which saw 20,000 people take to the streets this week in Sydney despite next to no notice. Labor has instead decided it is more sensible for Anthony Albanese to pick this week when his own electorate has been covered in smoke from bushfires and the UN is holding a climate conference at which Australia has been declared the pariah of the world, to tour rural Queensland to visit coalmines and aluminium smelters and talk up “practical” solutions. It’s pretty horrific when you think about it that the main strategy to doing something on climate change is to pretend that any change will have a minimal impact on people’s lives. It is also pretty horrific when you think that a progressive party has decided it does not need to use the mass support of people desperate for action. Surely some form of progressive populism should actually involve trying to be popular? Because the problem is at some point we are going to need to do more than just the “practical” solutions, and doing that will require a lot of support. The latest projections show that in 2030 Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions will be 99 megatonne (Mt) lower than in 2005 (the base year for Paris agreement targets). And all of it is accounted for by a drop in land use: ie less land-clearing and a few more trees being planted. Of actual emissions there is no change. And yet by 2030 we are projected to get 50% of our electricity from renewables. The problem is while electricity is the biggest producer of emissions, it only accounts for 30% of the total. By 2030 other areas such as direct combustion from industries, transport and fugitive emissions (which occur during the production, processing, transport, storage, transmission and distribution of fossil fuels) all will have risen by enough to offset the fall in electricity emissions. This is the crux of climate change: if it was as easy to solve as politicians would have us believe then it would not actually be a problem. Yes, people love renewables, but we are going to need to do more – and any political party that wishes to actually do real action will at some point need to be honest with the public that the change is not going to be pleasant for many and it will be costly. We are for a start going to need to keep coal in the ground – even our glorious cleaner-than-others coal. The government’s fraudulent Paris target of 28% below 2005 levels, which includes land use, would require actual emissions to fall from the current level of 551Mt to 440Mt. But that target is a complete joke. The science requires cuts of at least 45% in actual emissions by 2030, not a reduction through offsets, or by counting things we are are no longer doing. To achieve a 45% cut in actual emissions we would need to reduce our annual emissions to 287Mt by 2030. Or to put it another way, in 2030 we would need to remove the equivalent of all emissions produced this year from direct combustion, transport, fugitive emissions and waste (ie landfill). That is a scale well beyond anything that current policies will achieve. It is an amount that will require changes in how and what we consume and produce. In effect, a change in how we live. And it will require a political party able to persuade voters it needs to happen, because the low-hanging fruits of climate change reduction have all been picked. • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"
"A large solar thermal electricity plant will soon begin operating near Ouarzazate, Morocco, which will reportedly bring energy to a million people when fully complete. But what is solar thermal electricity and how does it differ from the method used to generate power from the solar panels you might be more familiar with? The Moroccan plant uses large mirrors in the form of parabolic troughs (as in the picture above) to concentrate sunlight onto a fluid flowing through a pipe at the focal point of the trough – where all the light is reflected; a parabola is used because this shape focuses the incoming beam to a single line.  The heat collected from this process generates steam, which can be used in a conventional steam turbine system to make electricity. In contrast to the low-temperature solar thermal systems that are used for air or water heating in domestic or commercial buildings, these solar thermal electricity plants operate at high temperatures, requiring both concentrated sunlight and a large collection area, making the Moroccan desert an ideal location. This is an alternative approach to the more widely used “photovoltaic” technology for producing electricity from sunlight. In a photovoltaic system, the sunlight is absorbed in the photovoltaic device (commonly called a solar cell) and energy is passed to electrons in the material, converting the solar energy directly into electricity. Sometimes, solar thermal electricity and photovoltaics are portrayed as competing technologies and, while this may be true when deciding on the way forward for a specific site, in general they are complementary, using solar energy as extensively as possible.  Currently, the main advantage of a solar thermal electricity system is the ability to store heat which can be used later to generate electricity. This allows the system, at least in part, to disconnect electricity generation from solar energy collection for periods in time. This addresses one of the most challenging aspects of the widespread use of solar energy: variability due to changing weather conditions and, of course, the period of darkness in each 24-hour period when no solar energy is available.  For efficient storage, the system generally uses a molten salt with a high melting temperature, typically around 500-600°C, which is heated by the solar energy. Most recent plant designs have integrated storage, including the plant in Morocco, which reportedly can store enough heat for three hours of generation at the rated power level each evening. As the plant increases in size from this first phase, more storage will be possible. In comparison, for a photovoltaic system to generate outside sunlight hours, electricity would need to be stored in a battery or alternate system, and this is generally less efficient. There are disadvantages to the solar thermal electricity system. First, it requires direct sunlight, since it is not possible to concentrate the diffuse light that is scattered by the atmosphere. This means these systems are restricted to locations where there is a high proportion of clear days, such as Morocco.  In contrast, most photovoltaic systems can utilise all sunlight, so are much better suited to a wider range of climates – although concentrating photovoltaic systems, which use lenses or mirrors to focus sunlight onto high efficiency solar cells, also require direct sunlight.  Second, solar thermal systems need to operate at high temperatures, both for steam generation and to ensure high thermal efficiency. This means that the system needs to be physically large to collect all the solar energy required. The photovoltaic system, meanwhile, can be operated efficiently in a range of sizes, from very small (to fit on a domestic roof) to vast (plants rated in the hundreds of megawatts).  Third, solar thermal electricity systems are currently more expensive than photovoltaic systems of a similar size. This is partly due to there being a larger market for photovoltaic systems – around 180GW of photovoltaics are installed worldwide compared to 5GW of solar thermal electricity (a typical fossil-fuelled power station is around 1GW in size). However, costs can be expected to fall as experience and the size of the market grow. There are potential challenges, too: ensuring the mirrors accurately track the sun, keeping them clean, and the need for water (for cleaning and in the generation system). But all these aspects are being addressed in the evolution of system designs. Solar thermal electricity systems are an exciting technology for harnessing solar energy, to sit alongside the low temperature solar thermal systems for heating and the photovoltaic systems for electricity generation in a wide range of applications. Which one of these is the best choice depends on what you want to do with the energy and where the system is going to be located – ultimately, we will need all of them to substantially contribute to the world’s energy supply."
"Poor countries have accused a handful of richer nations of holding up progress on tackling the climate crisis at UN talks in Madrid, as demonstrators and activists vented their frustration in the final hours of two weeks of negotiations. The talks, which had been due to end on Friday, dragged on with negotiators still battling on Saturday to salvage a result, as governments wrangled over the details of a seemingly arcane issue: carbon markets, governed by a provision of the 2015 Paris agreement known as article 6.  Brazil, India and China were singled out as acting to block agreement on article 6, as ministers from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) warned that their countries would suffer most if there was no decision. Simon Stiell, Grenada’s environment minister, speaking for AOSIS, urged all parties to reach a compromise. “Our countries will be rendered uninsurable if we breach 1.5C warming,” he said. There was a widespread view among delegates that Brazil was refusing to compromise on article 6 as a means of holding up implementation of the Paris accord. Brazil’s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, is hostile to the Paris agreement, and is accused of paving the way for devastating fires set by ranchers in the Amazon, but the government is still officially a party to the UN talks. Article 6 focuses on the role of carbon markets and carbon trading in helping countries to fulfil their pledges under the Paris agreement. Carbon markets allow for countries to claim carbon credits for carbon sinks, such as standing forests, and for emissions-cutting efforts, such as wind farms or renewable energy projects. These credits can be sold to rich countries, which can count them towards their own emissions targets. Carbon markets were introduced in the 1997 Kyoto protocol as a mechanism for directing financial investment towards poor countries which would otherwise struggle to implement clean technology, or face economic pressure to cut down their forests. Brazil’s contention is that its forests should be counted as carbon sinks towards its national emissions targets, meaning it could make less effort to cut emissions in other areas, but that it should also be allowed to sell credits based on keeping the forests intact. Critics regard this as double counting and some countries are determined to prevent it. Other countries are also trying to ensure that carbon credits awarded in the decades since the Kyoto protocol are carried over beyond 2020, which critics say would allow those countries to ease off on their Paris commitments. Carbon markets are seen by some businesses, economists and campaigners as a way to generate financial flows to poor areas, and to cut carbon at the lowest possible cost. “Carbon markets are one way to not only manage mitigation [emissions cuts], but help to find the lowest cost and therefore the best possible means for implementing international efforts,” said Fenella Aouane, an investment specialist at the Global Green Growth Institute. For campaigners, the issue is more nuanced. Nat Keohane, the senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, said: “We know we are not going to solve the climate crisis without international cooperation... [Carbon markets] can be a way of cooperating and raising ambition.” But he said the markets would only work with strong rules and a ban on double counting. Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said setting a price on carbon was a good way of assisting governments to make cuts, but warned that allowing countries simply to offset their emissions through carbon credits, rather than making substantial new efforts, would not work. “The real question is over urgency – we need absolute cuts in global carbon,” she said. “We see this as a dangerous distraction. Why are we here in 2019 still talking about a failed policy from 1997?” Another vexed issue at the talks is loss and damage – the acknowledgment by rich countries that poor countries face serious hardship as the result of climate breakdown, even though most of the emissions to date have come from the rich world. Rich countries were willing as part of the Paris agreement to make this acknowledgment, which would open the way for the poor to receive financial assistance, but they balk at admitting liability, which could require legal redress and compensation payments. The talks were intended to forge agreement on these outstanding issues in order to clear the way for a discussion to take placenext year around strengthening countries’ commitments under the Paris agreement. The commitments put forward in Paris in 2015, for countries to cut or at least curb the growth of their emissions by 2030, were always acknowledged to be inadequate to the scale of the climate crisis. If allowed to stand, they would lead to an estimated 3C of warming, far beyond the 1.5C threshold beyond which sea level rises, droughts, storms and floods would devastate swathes of the globe. At next year’s talks, to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow in November, countries are supposed to agree much more ambitious national commitments for 2030, in line with the Paris goal of holding heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to stay within a 1.5C limit. On Friday, a group of developing countries and the EU called the High Ambition Coalition said it was essential the Madrid outcome should involve a clear call for countries to come forward with more ambitious plans. Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, which on Thursday finally agreed a target of net zero carbon by 2050, said: “We can only get there [to 2050] if we start now. We need concrete plans and concrete steps – we need to come to Glasgow with plans.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterCiting the London-based consulting company Bloomberg New Energy Finance the German Business News here reports that “investments in renewable energies collapsed worldwide in the third quarter” of this year, led by Europe, China and Japan.
Compared to the 3rd quarter of 2015, investment, mainly in solar and wind power, fell a whopping 43 percent.
Among the reasons: a number of governments rolled back subsidies for renewable energies, and so total investments for the year will be far below the level of the previous year 2015), Bloomberg reports.
According to the report (translated from the German Business News): “The third quarter results are worrisomely low, especially with regards to the weakening trend of the year overall“. Japan and China saw significant reductions in investments.
In total in 2015 almost one third of a trillion dollars were invested – a record. However, global CO2 emissions continued to climb unhindered. 2016 will see less investment in wind and solar.
The Bloomberg report also mentions that the German government also will “throttle” the expansion of wind energy in northern Germany, a region that had seen huge growth in the sector since the year 2000. The reason for the scale-back is the slow pace at which the needed power grid expansion is taking place – due in large part to mounting citizens’s protests.
This is hardly the investment trend that the upcoming Paris Treaty has in mind.

"The government is giving no sign that it intends to replace fossil fuels with renewables, so the only way to avoid the carbon emissions from burning natural gas and oil is the widespread use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to extract CO₂ from the exhaust gases. But there’s still no commercial CCS in operation, grants for developing it are being axed, and the process of separating hot gases is inefficient and energy intensive, which adds to the cost. However, while natural gas produces CO₂ when the methane it contains is burned, it also contains the cleanest fuel: hydrogen. When separated from carbon, hydrogen is a perfect zero-emission fuel, for example for vehicles with high energy requirements. Hydrogen-powered vehicles can use reverse electrolysis in hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity, or burn hydrogen in an engine, driving pistons through combustion. The only emission from this is pure water.  The trick, then, is to separate the hydrogen from the carbon. The technology used to do this for decades has converted methane to hydrogen but only with CO₂ as a by-product. Now the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany have demonstrated a process through which it’s possible to strip hydrogen from methane – without producing any greenhouse gases. In a device only 1.2 metres high built from stainless steel and quartz, the technique passes methane bubbles through a column of molten tin where 78% of the methane is cracked into pure hydrogen without producing any CO₂. Instead, pure carbon forms a solid on the surface of the molten tin. This can be used in car tyres as a filler, as a pigment or, if activated like charcoal, in filters. As a solid, carbon does not contribute to greenhouse warming.  The process requires heating to 1,200°C, but this can be powered by using some of the hydrogen generated. Cracking methane this way is a more efficient way of removing carbon than using CCS on exhaust gases, and it can be done before the hydrogen fuel is burnt. New or older gas power stations refitted to burn pure hydrogen would emit mostly water as steam.  A heavier reliance on gas will result in higher prices and increased pressure to retrieve gas from unconventional sources such as through fracking. This may remain objectionable for those who fear ground water contamination, but using this methane cracking technique it should not be objectionable on climate change grounds. What will gas refineries of the future look like, and how will hydrogen fuel be distributed? One problem is that transporting hydrogen is hazardous. A possible workaround is ammonia, a combination of hydrogen and nitrogen that is usually found in fertilisers and bleach but is also a fuel. Once hydrogen is bound to nitrogen as ammonia it can be transported at lower pressure, meaning cheaper and lighter fuel tanks. In World War II, Belgian buses were fitted to run on ammonia.   However, weight for weight, ammonia has less energy than petrol and unless burnt carefully it produces poisonous nitrogen oxides, which would mean strictly enforcing emissions standards like those for diesel engines (with all their problems). Even with leaps in battery technology, the charging infrastructure for low-emission vehicles is still lacking but zero emission vehicles could carry ammonia for their fuel cells.  The advantage of deriving low emission fuels from natural gas is that there is already enormous infrastructure in place and giant energy firms that are skilled at using it, with known reserves for many years. Now the industry has the techniques to make it carbon free."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the course of years to decades, the heat contained in the ocean naturally undulates, with more or less upwelling cooler waters rising to the surface.  Naturally-occuring El Niño (wind current) events greatly influence the prevention of cooler waters from upwelling to the surface; this phenomenon, in turn, ultimately elicits an overall surface warming event (less cooling = net warming).
Below is a very simplified version of “How El Niño Works” from NASA:
NASA :
“During a normal year, strong, easterly surface winds (winds blowing from the east to the west) along the equator, cause upwelling of cold, nutrient rich water along the coast of South America. This keeps the waters of the central Pacific relatively cool. … When, for an as yet, unknown reason the easterly surface winds weaken, or reverse, the warm pool moves from the western Pacific to the central and eastern Pacific ocean basin. This situation is known as an El Niño, and when this happens, heavy rainfall occurs along the western coasts of Peru, Mexico and California instead. The warm water also acts as a cap that prevents cold water from upwelling along the eastern edge of the Pacific.”
Over time, net step-changes induced by each successive El Niño warming event may lead to an overall surface warming trend. The more frequent and/or powerful the El Niño event(s), the greater the net step change.  These internal ocean heat circulation processes that lead to more or less heat welling up to the ocean surface can significantly account for the warming trend since the early 1980s, meaning that the increase in temperature could be mostly explained by natural variability, not anthropogenic intervention.
This conclusion has been reached by scientists Large and Yeager (2012), who maintain that, over the 1984-2006 period,  the observed “diminished ocean cooling [i.e., warming] due to vertical ocean processes” imply that “natural variability” can explain the rise in sea surface temperatures since 1984 rather than anthropogenic climate change.
Large and Yeager, 2012
“Global satellite observations show the sea surface temperature (SST) increasing since the 1970s in all ocean basins, while the net air–sea heat flux Q decreases. Over the period 1984–2006 the global changes are 0.28°C in SST and −9.1 W m−2 in Q, giving an effective air–sea coupling coefficient of −32 W m−2 °C−1  …[D]iminished ocean cooling due to vertical ocean processes played an important role in sustaining the observed positive trend in global SST from 1984 through 2006, despite the decrease in global surface heat flux. A similar situation is found in the individual basins, though magnitudes differ. A conclusion is that natural variability, rather than long-term climate change, dominates the SST and heat flux changes over this 23-yr period.“
Below is an extremely simplistic illustration of the step-change influence of El Niño events on surface temperature.  Notice that between each El Niño-induced warming event, the temperature declines or flattens until the advent of the next El Niño event.

El Niño-Induced Warming Events Are Natural, And Not Influenced By Human Activity
While discussing the powerful 2015-’16 El Niño a few months ago, Dr. Fredolin Tangang — a Malaysian climate scientist, oceanographer, and the vice-chairperson of the IPCC —  maintains that the warming of the ocean surface which occurs with the onset of an El Niño event has not been linked to anthropogenic climate change, but is instead a naturally-occurring phenomenon.
The current El Nino phenomenon that has brought prolonged drought and sweltering heat to Malaysia is the strongest of the 20 over the last 60 years, but there is no concrete evidence to link its heat intensity to global warming, says an expert.  Climatologist and oceanographer Prof Dr Fredolin Tangang of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia said this year’s El Nino was even more extreme than the severe phenomena experienced in 1982/82 and 1997/98.
“There is no conclusive evidence that the occurrence of El Nino (frequency and intensity) is influenced by climate change,” said Tangang, who had served from 2008 to 2015 as vice-chairperson of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations agency.
“El Nino is a naturally occurring phenomenon, which is part of the inter-annual variability associated with oscillation of the atmosphere-ocean interaction in the Pacific Ocean that occurs in a two- to seven-year cycle.”
A few months before Tangang’s announcement, Mike Halpert, NOAA’s deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center, had also declared that anthropogenic climate change was playing an “insignificant role, if any role at all” on the warmth experienced during 2015-’16.
NPR interview with NOAA’s Mike Halpert:
SHAPIRO: OK. So El Nino plays a role [in the 2015-’16 warming]. The Arctic oscillation plays a role. What about climate change? Is that playing a role?
HALPERT: If it is, it’s probably fairly insignificant at this point. If it were to play a role, it would be more likely if, somehow, climate change is impacting either the Arctic oscillation or El Nino, and we’re not really aware that it is at this point. If you think about, maybe – the high temperature over the weekend was 70, so maybe without climate change, it would’ve been 69. I think it’s a fairly insignificant role, if any role at all.
Since 1982, Temp Records Show No Warming Other Than Due To The All-Natural El Niño Warming Events, With Cooling In Between Each Event
In the satellite record (UAH), the significant warming effects of moderate to strong El Niño events on temperature can be reasonably identified.  As mentioned above, notice the cooling or flattened temperatures that occur between each warmth-inducing El Niño event.

If we combine these graphs to illustrate the effects of El Niño events on temperature over the entire 1983 to 2015 period, a somewhat disorderly version of a step-change warming trend emerges that looks similar in scope to the neat and simplified El Niño-induced step-change graph shown above.

El Niño Events “Triggered” by Solar Activity
So if El Niño events can significantly explain the step-change warming trend in the temperature record since the early 1980s, what physical mechanism(s) may explain why El Niño events occur?  According to scientists, the Sun is the main catalyst.
Huo and Xiao, 2016
The impact of solar activity on the 2015/16 El Niño event
“Recent SST and atmospheric circulation anomaly data suggest that the 2015/16 El Niño event is quickly decaying. Some researchers have predicted a forthcoming La Niña event in late summer or early fall 2016. From the perspective of the modulation of tropical SST by solar activity, the authors studied the evolution of the 2015/16 El Niño event, which occurred right after the 2014 solar peak year. Based on statistical and composite analysis, a significant positive correlation was found between sunspot number index and El Niño Modoki index, with a lag of two years. A clear evolution of El Niño Modoki events was found within 1–3 years following each solar peak year during the past 126 years, suggesting that anomalously strong solar activity during solar peak periods favors the triggering of an El Niño Modoki event. The patterns of seasonal mean SST and wind anomalies since 2014 are more like a mixture of two types of El Niño (i.e., eastern Pacific El Niño and El Niño Modoki), which is similar to the pattern modulated by solar activity during the years following a solar peak. Therefore, the El Niño Modoki component in the 2015/16 El Niño event may be a consequence of solar activity, which probably will not decay as quickly as the eastern Pacific El Niño component. The positive SST anomaly will probably sustain in the central equatorial Pacific (around the dateline) and the northeastern Pacific along the coast of North America, with a low-intensity level, during the second half of 2016.”
Summarizing, scientists Lakshmi and Tiwari (2015) point out that climate changes are primarily driven by solar activity and El Niño events.  This leaves little to no room for anthropogenic activities to have a significant influence on the Earth’s climate.
Lakshmi and Tiwari, 2015
“Introduction: Several recent studies of solar–geomagnetic effects on climate have been examined on both global as well as on regional scales.  The Sun’s long-term magnetic variability is the primary driver of climatic changes. The magnetic variability (mostly short-term components) is due to the disturbances in Earth’s magnetic fields caused by the solar activity, which is usually indicated by indices of geomagnetic activity. The Sun’s magnetic variability modulates the magnetic and particulate fluxes in the heliosphere. This determines the interplanetary conditions and imposes significant electromagnetic forces and effects upon planetary atmospheres. All these effects are due to the changing solar-magnetic fields which are relevant for planetary climates, including the climate of the Earth. The Sun–Earth relationship varies on different time scales of days to years bringing a drastic influence on the climatic patterns. The ultimate cause of solar variability, at time scales from decadal to cen tennial to millennial or even longer scales, has its origin in the solar dynamo mechanism. During the solar maxima, huge amounts of solar energy particles are released, thereby causing the geomagnetic disturbances. … The 11 years solar cycle acts an important driving force for variations in the space weather, ultimately giving rise to climatic changes. Therefore, it is very important to understand the origin of space climate by analyzing the different proxies of solar magnetic variability.”
“The another most important climate variation is El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which impact the global oceanic and atmospheric circulations which thereby produce droughts, floods and intense rainfall in certain regions. The strong coupling and interactions between the Tropical Ocean and atmosphere play a major role in the development of global climatic system. The El Niño events generally recur approximately every 3–5 years with large events spaced around 3–7 years apart. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena has shown huge impact on the Asian monsoon (Cole et al., 1993), Indian monsoon (Chowdary et al., 2006, 2014) as well as globally (Horel and Wallance, 1981; Barnett, 1989; Yasunari, 1985; Nicholson, 1997). In particular, the El Niño, solar, geomagnetic activities are the major affecting forces on the decadal and interdecadal temperature variability on global and regional scales in a direct/indirect way.”

"Brexit doesn’t matter. Jeremy Corbyn’s likability doesn’t matter. What matters above all is that the planet that is our only home remains habitable. Australia, California and Amazonia are on fire, the Victoria Falls are a mere trickle, the oceans are deoxygenating, the thawing Arctic tundra is belching methane. In Europe, once-thriving Alpine ski resorts are left to rot for lack of snow, and here in the UK flooding is starting to become endemic. Catastrophic feedback loops, points of no return, are inevitable unless we change our way of living quickly. Labour is the only major party with viable plans to tackle this. Their Green New Deal would be good for the planet’s health and ours too. Investment in green technologies like wave and tidal power will provide us with unlimited clean energy. The expertise and equipment of this technology could be exported around the world, creating jobs and wealth for us. Another five years of Tory government will be disastrous. Many Tories own or are heavily invested in the fossil fuel industries. That is why nothing of proper effect has been done for the last 30 years – why innovative green technologies have been repressed and why the ideas of greens have for years been dismissed as “crazy”. Even now, with all the evidence we have, when it’s virtually too late, the right has no interest in climate change or survival plans that are fit for purpose.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few of days ago I reported on a spate of wind turbine collapses occuring in Germany and Europe. Well the folly appears to be continuing as the online German Tageblatt here reports how yet another has come crashing down, with a passerby witnessing it live.
The fourth collapse in four weeks!
German news site NTV here writes:
South of Hamburg an approximately 100-meter tall wind turbine collapsed. The turbine in Neu Wulmstorf fell during the morning, a police spokesman said. A passerby observed the incident and called the fire department.”
The NTV reports it’s still unknown why the bolted connection 20 meters high came apart at around 11 a.m, but was probably due to brisk winds at the time.
The latest incident led the Swiss online daily Baseler Zeitung (BaZ) here to report on the unusual series of wind turbine failures in neighboring Germany, writing that such a string of failures “is not supposed to happen“.
The BAZ adds that normally Germany sees about 6 or 7 such failures over an entire year.

There have been four serious incidents in northern Germany over the past four weeks. ‘Too many in such a short time,’ writes Philipp Stukenbrock of Ingenieurbüro 8.2 Consulting, which specializes in wind parks.”
The four recent collapses in summary:

Early December, the tower of a 70-meter tall turbine snapped in half and the turbine and blades crashed to the ground in the state of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
In the northeast German state of Saxony, the tower of a 100-meter tall turbine snapped some 15 meters above the ground.
Early this week a 40-meter blade came apart and fell to the ground in Brandenburg.
As described above, the tower of a 100-meter tall turbine south of Hamburg broke catastrophically 20 meters above the ground.

Ice projectiles
Collapsing turbines are not the only hazard posed by wind parks. There’s also the danger of falling ice, as the WN.de here reports.
On the morning of New Year’s Eve, Werner van Veenendaal was out for a walk near Bochum in the Ruhr region, when a roughly 2-foot long ice projectile flew off from the tip of a blade of a nearby 98-meter tall wind turbine and crashed close by, shocking the bejesus out of him. From the photo of the ice chunk, a direct hit certainly could have been lethal.
van Veenendaal told the Westfälische Nachrichten daily that he also found several other chunks of ice of similar size in the area: “The street was also littered with smaller pieces.” And because it was foggy he was not able to see the tops of the turbines and thus “could not see that there was ice on them“.
Luckily he wasn’t hit, or worse!

"One of the most striking findings in the Australian National University’s Australian Election Study – the survey of voters the university has undertaken after every federal election since 1987 – are the results on satisfaction with democracy. The survey tells us that back in 2007, Australians were sanguine. Kevin Rudd had won the federal election, and politics was hovering on the brink of a decade of profound disruption. At the tail end of the revolving door of prime ministers, and the failure of our parliament to achieve a durable consensus on important issues like climate change, only 59% of us are satisfied with democracy, and trust has reached its lowest level on record, with just 25% believing people in government can be trusted.  Loss of faith, given the experience post-2007, is to be expected. But the striking bit for me in the latest AES was the rate of decline in satisfaction with democracy. The faceplant in Australia has been steeper than the experience in the United Kingdom after the 2016 Brexit referendum and in the United States following Donald Trump’s 2016 election win. Just roll that small insight around in your head for a minute. Politics in the US and the UK has completely jumped the shark – yet our citizens are hitting the screw-this button faster than the citizens of America and Britain. Assuming this insight is correct, that’s really quite something. It tallies with the despair I encounter among the community of politically engaged people on social media, day in and day out, heaving and crashing. My inbox is studded with it. Progressives, engaged folks, are clearly angry, frustrated, thwarted. Some of this roiling is currently trained in Labor’s direction. Anthony Albanese has copped a hiding on social media and elsewhere this week for visiting coal communities during the bushfires – the visit seen as a portent of capitulation by Labor on climate policy. I want to work through the points I’m going to make about this reaction, step by step, just so we are clear. This first thing to say is I’m minutely interested in where Labor ultimately ends up on climate policy. If Labor does ultimately capitulate on climate action, producing an execrable policy for the next federal election, then I will be the first one lining up with the rhetorical baseball bat. I will be taking no prisoners. But rather than fly off in a rage because Albanese went to Emerald, or looked sideways at a coalminer while Sydney choked in smoke, right now I’m content to wait and watch. I’m content to wait and watch not because I’m a naturally patient person, or a trusting person, or a generous person, but because I’m a student of history. It’s worth laying out the recent history just so it’s clear, because right now the debate feels a bit untethered, and things that can be known and proved (as opposed to being speculated about) are a bit obscured in the thicket of fail hashtags. History tells us that Labor has made mistakes on climate policy, significant errors of hubris, fear and poor judgment that have set back the cause of progress. But history also tells us this political party shows up on climate action. It is the only party of government in Australia that does, election cycle after election cycle. That basic fact seems a bit lost in the wash in some of the current emoting and hectoring. The other lesson of history that may not be obvious is this. Labor has lost two elections on climate change – 2013 and 2019. Climate change wasn’t the only negative factor in these contests. Labor lost predominantly in 2013 because it was more interested in conducting a civil war at taxpayer expense than serving Australian voters, but Labor also lost because Tony Abbott was successful in weaponising climate change. It was diabolical, what Abbott did, but it was a precision, partisan, demolition. A backlash against climate action in regional Queensland was also part of the story of Labor’s election loss in May. I don’t think a lot of progressive people have really grasped this basic fact, because they prefer to think climate change switched votes Labor’s way in 2019, because that’s a more comforting story. Now it’s true, climate change did help shore up Labor’s left flank against the Greens, and pushed a number of swing votes Labor’s way in 2019. But it’s important to look where those positive swings happened, and they were largely in seats Labor had no prospect of winning. Any political party will happily bank any positive swing. It’s gratifying. It suggests the dial is moving. But obviously it is better if the swings deliver you government rather than just a warm inner glow, and abstract validation. So what I’m trying to convey this weekend is Labor has paid a price electorally for pursuing climate action. I don’t high five this fact. I don’t find it comforting. I can’t fathom, given what the science says, given the clear evidence that warming is under way, why there is even a debate in this country about what needs to happen, why climate change goes on being Australia’s Brexit. But there is a “debate”, pushed by corporates with vested interests, and culture warriors intent on routing progressivism, whatever the cost; and materialist anxiety is stoked assiduously by poisonous agitprop rags like the Daily Telegraph, and other alleged news outlets in the Murdoch stable that act like sheep dogs rounding up thought criminals, fully resolved to let no good deed go unpunished. I thought after the defeat in May we would see ignominious surrender from the ALP. I fully expected that to happen, not because it’s right, but because retreat is not irrational in terms of the electoral calculation. But the only person I’ve heard in Labor saying we need to lower the level of ambition is Joel Fitzgibbon, who got the fright of his life after suffering a huge negative swing in his coal community in the Hunter Valley, and has now embarked on a coal worshipping tour of the country as an act of contrition. Mark Butler isn’t saying lower ambition. Albanese isn’t saying it. Penny Wong isn’t saying it. Senior New South Wales rightwingers, such as Tony Burke and Chris Bowen, are saying we need to maintain ambition consistent with the science and find a way to do that while reassuring our blue-collar base. Burke and Bowen have floated the New Green Deal, or something like it, as a mechanism that might square the circle. Maybe Labor will, ultimately, surrender. It’s certainly possible. But what’s happening now isn’t surrender – it’s an attempt to stitch climate action and blue-collar jobs together. It’s an attempt to craft a nuance. Now some progressive people will argue that’s impossible, so don’t even bother; Labor should just draw a line now and say we are for climate action, no compromises, no redux on the messaging. If you don’t like it, vote for someone else. That’s fine, as long as the people making these arguments understand a couple of basic things. Labor can’t win an election by saying that. Not on current indications. Perhaps that could change in time, because public sentiment will shift as the evidence and experience of warming grows. The community is clearly mobilising. But right now, Australians are telling pollsters they are increasingly worried about climate change, but a majority is not voting in favour of climate action when push comes to shove. The country remains divided, and rancorously so. That’s the legacy of our busted arse politics, and our busted arse media “conversation”. While ever that remains the case, Labor will have to hold its progressive post-material constituency and hold its traditional base, or enough of it to win enough seats to form a government. If it’s either/or, Labor loses. So let’s be precise about what that means. It means the only party of government in Australia that is halfway serious about climate action, the only party with the capacity to deliver tangible action, remains out of power, unable to move the dial. This is less of a problem obviously if the Liberal party can enjoy a Damascene conversion. I remain hopeful that it might happen. But there’s not much evidence of that happening currently. These are just facts. These might be irritating facts, facts disruptive to the flow of feelings, but they are facts. Let’s loop back to despair, which is where we started this weekend. I get despair. I understand why people who care about the fate of the planet are so worried about the failure of our political system, particularly on this issue. I worry about it constantly. I report on it incessantly in the hope that something will change. I understand the feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. I battle these feelings myself. But also know this. Lashing out is a waste of time and energy. Rage in advance of the facts is just more noise. Some of it’s eloquent noise, but it is just noise. David Remnick of the New Yorker wrote one of the finest pieces of the year about the challenges of reporting during the age of Donald Trump. He told his readers despair is not an option. “Despair is a form of self-indulgence, a dodge.” Remnick is absolutely right. Despair is not an option, particularly in advance of the facts. The times are just too serious. Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editor"
"I harvested potatoes the other day. Each plant had two to three kilos of potatoes beautifully arranged just under the foliage. But if you believe this is natural, you are mistaken. Like all modern crops, they are genetic variants selected by our ancestors and improved by modern breeders. Breeding always involves changing genes. That this is genetic modification (GM) is generally overlooked. The combination of whole gene families by grafting gets even less attention. What people usually mean when they talk about GM is specific genetic engineering (GE) of crops. Scientists prefer the term GE because it advertises the real innovation, that they know which genes they introduce and why.  Introduced in the 1990s, GE crops have become much more commercially available. There are currently ten different crops available in the US alone, including corn, soybeans, sugar beet and cotton. Yet ask ten people in the street what they think about GE crops you will find a lot of caution, some rejection, and no support. None of them are likely to have anything against traditional breeding or grafting. Neither will they object to injecting insulin, say, even though it has been purified from a GE micro-organism.  Efforts to genetically engineer crops, have tended to focus on things like herbicide tolerance and disease and insect resistance. Insect resistance was tackled as far back as the early 1990s by the creation of transgenic crops that produce small amounts of the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin. This removed the need to combat insect pests by spraying fields with tonnes of this chemical, which ends up in the soil because it falls next to the plant or is washed off with the next rain. It sounded like a win-win – both better for the environment and more effective. Herbicide-resistant crops also began appearing in the 1990s. Farmers traditionally controlled weeds using herbicides like paraquat that can only be sprayed before the crop has started growing. These are highly toxic, harming biodiversity and also animals and humans. Scientists engineered crops with built-in resistance to less toxic and more biodegradable herbicides. This has enabled farmers to switch to the likes of Roundup, which kills all weeds and can be sprayed on even once the crop is already growing. Another win-win?  Not quite. Both types of crops are grown in many parts of the world, but they are not embraced by consumers. Hardly anyone seems to know about the drawbacks of spraying Bt toxin or paraquat. Yet the typical criticism that herbicide-resistant crops are just a marketing strategy to promote the use of different herbicides seems to have stuck.  These examples highlight two key failures in the industry. The first is about marketing: from the start, these products have lacked appropriate advertising and consumer information.  The second failure relates to the disproportionate focus on crop protection: trying to improve resistance to things like pests, frost and droughts is both very difficult and will only benefit farmers’ production costs. Only a small proportion of this is passed on to consumers.  Some true GM jewels have meanwhile failed to make an impact. Take golden rice, a GE rice that contains high levels of vitamin A. It could really make a difference to vitamin A deficiency, which leads to blindness and death in many parts of the developing world. This rice is one of the best examples of genetic engineering, achieving a trait that could take millennia to stumble upon through conventional breeding.  Yet people are not benefiting. Opposition has meant that it has not been licensed anywhere. Golden rice received far better public support compared to insect or herbicide-resistant crops, but by the time it emerged in the late 1990s, GE negativity had taken hold. More recently scientists have succeeded in dramatically increasing protein content in potatoes and cassava. This is much simpler and cheaper than engineering resistance to insects and the like, and also promises to improve nutrition in many parts of the world. If the first GM crop had been golden rice or a high-protein potato, public perception of the new technology might have been very different.  When I think about the opportunity we have missed with GE foods, I think of Flavr Savr tomatoes. I would have loved to try one: sweet, juicy, beautifully red and yet crunchy, great for a salad with mozzarella, basil and olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt. If only I could buy them in the supermarket. But as one of the first GE products to be licensed, it was withdrawn in 1997. Why did it fail? Instead of putting any emphasis on the benefits to the consumer, much of it was turned into tomato puree, marketed as 10% cheaper to manufacture. Would you have been drawn by an advert offering such dazzling features? I guess not."

 (Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
====================================
Arctic: Sea ice melt 2016 done at 4.1 million km²? Northwest Passage freezes over!
At approx. 4.1 million square kilometres extent, it appears that the summertime Arctic sea ice melt has ended early, on 7 September 2016. 
Here the sea ice area is 743,000 km² greater than the low set on 16 September 2012.

On average sea ice begins to grow again in mid September.
The NSIDC table shows the preliminary low point on 7 September 2016, at 4.083 million km²,. On September 8 the ice area grew by 21,000 sq. km. to 4.104 million km²:

Also NORSEX shows Arctic sea ice (min. 15% concentration) possibly having turned the corner from the September 7 low point:

Whether there will be more melting, depends on the wind conditions over the next few days.
But one thing is clear: The northern part of the Northwest Passage was blocked by multi-year ice – foremost the western exit – for the entire summer of 2016, and was even not passable by ice breakers.
The southern part – Amundsen’s Route – was neither ice free in August 2016…

When comparing both NSIDC charts, we see a growth in sea ice in early September 2016 along the southern Amundsen Route compared to August 2016.
250 billion tonnes more ice
The Arctic polar winter 2016 has started early this year, as it did a year ago. Greenland ice from to 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2016 grew by 30 billion cubic meters (30 km³). Since the 2011/2012 season it has grown by 250 billion tonnes (250 km³) in mass. [That’s the same as 250,000 sq. km of 1 meter thick sea ice.]

Bottom: The accumulated surface mass balance from September 1st to now (blue line, Gt) and the season 2011-12 (red) which had very high summer melt in Greenland. For comparison, the mean curve from the period 1990-2013 is shown (dark grey). The same calendar day in each of the 24 years (in the period 1990-2013) will have its own value. These differences from year to year are illustrated by the light grey band. For each calendar day, however, the lowest and highest values of the 24 years have been left out.” Source: dmi.dk/en/groenland/maalinger/greenland“.
Astonishingly there are some people who wish to navigate the Arctic in sailing vessels because some climate prophets, like Al Gore and Peter Wadhams, claimed that Arctic sea ice would be practically gone in the polar summer of 2016. Read more here on climate scientists who called such claims pure nonsense.
Many people of course can appreciate the sailing skills of the Northabout crew, but no one should risk their lives to prop up the climate fairy tale of man-made global warming with an ice-free summertime Arctic: A Race Against Time.
The next coming days will tell us whether or not Arctic sea ice has reached the minimum for the summer earlier than normal, or if it will shrink some more.

"Witnessing any dolphin or whale stranding live is a deeply moving experience; particularly when you end up accompanying an individual to the end of its life. My stomach still churns remembering the time that I encountered one in Scotland. But the reasons behind such events remain mysterious. Dolphins and whales can strand together – most recently, ten long-finned pilot whales became stranded on a beach near Calais, seven of which died – but we can’t pinpoint a single reason why this happens. Instead, many different factors appear to be involved. Some mass strandings are easy to solve, because the individuals involved are similarly sick or injured. In these cases, they strand because they are pushed inshore by currents as they ail and die. Alternatively, they head for shore because they are simply too sick to swim. Harmful algal blooms, for example, have been linked to mass strandings of whales as far back as the Miocene.
Epizootics – disease events among an animal population – are also a common culprit. A morbillivirus (related to our measles virus) outbreak among dolphins in the North Atlantic caused several mass strandings along the US eastern seaboard in 1987 and 1988.  Accidents happen, too. Naval exercises, which may involve the use of high-powered sonar, have been linked to mass strandings as individuals become confused, or get injured or injure themselves trying to flee. Like human divers who surface too quickly, some even get the bends (decompression sickness).  There are also long-term trends, which are linked to tougher environmental conditions. Perhaps food stocks are low, temperatures are unusually high or low, or pollutants enter the water. Any of these factors could cause the mammals to behave differently. Some studies also point to features on the coastline and at sea that might disorient whales and dolphins. Finally, even whales and dolphins make mistakes, as in the below video of a killer whale, filmed earlier this year. It is also worth remembering that many of these species live in social groups. As in human communities, if an individual is affected by any of the factors above, then others travelling with it will also be exposed to the same problems.  But illness, injury and error aren’t always behind these events. Far more intriguing, it is not uncommon for some strandings to involve healthy animals, seemingly unaffected by any of these problems.  This is particularly true of pilot whale mass strandings, such as the recent Calais event. This has puzzled biologists for centuries: why would a healthy animal put itself in such danger if there is no reason to? Is it possible that they are deliberately harming themselves? Even attempting suicide? Pilot whales live in matrilineal societies. They spend their lives in schools that are composed of extended families centred around the females – mothers and their daughters are the family focal points.  Based on this social structure, the common assumption has long been that healthy animals strand themselves as an altruistic gesture, that they do so to continue caring for distressed family members. Recent work, however, casts doubt on this analysis, with genetic tests showing that animals stranded close to each other during mass events may not be related after all. Perhaps this isn’t always a family tragedy. The evolution of whales and dolphins is one of the best documented in the animal kingdom. These species evolved from land-based ancestors and share an ancestry with modern ungulates, think “cows-with-attitude”.  Their invasion of the sea was progressive, and therefore we are left to ponder whether in difficult times, individuals might still instinctively react as if land confers an element of safety.  Regardless of this, however, if injured or sick, these marine mammals will still be able to rest more easily if they can find a shallow area where they can stop moving. And that places them in hazardous situations.  While there are advantages to fleeing to or resting in shallow water, stranding is a messy business. It leads to further injuries, such as cuts and abrasions, as well as internal injuries caused by the unsupported weight of the body on internal organs – their bodies are designed to swim and float, not bear their mass on land. Often, it will lead to death. We simply don’t know why some apparently healthy whales and dolphins strand themselves. Which begs the question: are they doing it deliberately? The social caring hypothesis still remains the favoured explanation at this stage: these individuals strand to stay in contact with their sick or injured companions, whether relatives or otherwise. What we don’t fully understand are the mechanisms behind this. These can range from simple ‘hardwired’ instincts to complex behaviours, which may allow them to reflect on the needs of other members of their group, even act altruistically. The truth probably lies somewhere in between. Thankfully, we have developed good techniques over the past 25 years to assess best strategies to save as many individuals as possible during a mass stranding. This involves a rapid triage process to know which individuals should be refloated first and the identification of the ‘problem’ individuals – those likely to be at the origin of the stranding.  The truth is that individuals will often re-strand and die hours or days after being refloated – doubtless because they were sick or injured in the first place – but some do get away.  We have learned a lot since Aristotle first wondered why these creatures strand together sometimes – and will never stop trying to help them. Establishing exactly why some of them do it, however, still eludes us."
"“There are better ways we can be doing things,” says Erin Brockovich, the environmental activist portrayed in the Oscar-winning 2000 film, who has become one of the latest people to draw attention to the frequent man-made earthquakes plaguing the US state of Oklahoma. In 2008, the state recorded only one earthquake of magnitude 3 or greater (big enough to be felt by people locally). In 2015, the number of earthquakes of equivalent magnitude peaked at a staggering 903. Oklahoma has been transformed from a seismic dead zone to a hotspot in less than a decade.  Scientists attribute this unprecedented increase in seismicity to the oil and gas industry injecting its wastewater (known as “saltwater”) deep underground. In a study published in the journal Science, my colleagues and I have now shown that the size of these man-made earthquakes is strongly linked to the depth at which the saltwater is injected. As a result, reducing the depth of injections could significantly reduce the likelihood of larger, damaging earthquakes. There are now more than 10,000 injection wells dotted across Oklahoma. This includes both oil recovery wells and wells used to dispose of the saltwater that is an unwanted byproduct of the oil and gas extraction process. The water is injected deep underground, typically at depths of 1km to 2km. This deliberately is well below the level of fresh ground water supplies in order to avoid contamination. Since 2011, well operators have injected on average 2.3 billion barrels of fluid a year into layers of sedimentary rock deep underground. The link between Oklahoma’s earthquakes and wastewater disposal was firmly established by a 2013 study that showed a strong association between the injection zone and earthquakes, including the 2011 magnitude 5.7 Prague event.  Since 2015, some new regulations have led to an overall decline in the number of earthquakes. But the total seismic energy (the “moment”) has not dropped as significantly as expected. In fact, a number of powerful earthquakes including Pawnee (magnitude 5.8) – the largest in state history – struck in 2016, after the new regulations came into effect. There is also some concern that there have only been fewer earthquakes because a lower oil price has led to less oil production and saltwater disposal, and that seismicity would increase if the oil price rises again.  Our new study sheds light on the complexity of Oklahoma’s induced seismicity. We created a computer model of the relationship between seismic activity, geology and injection operations using six years’ worth of fluid disposal data from across the state. It shows that the more saltwater is injected and the greater the depth it goes to, the larger the resulting earthquake. The injection is even more likely to cause earthquakes at depths where layered sedimentary rocks meet the crystalline “basement” rocks below them, at depths of between 1km and 6km. This shouldn’t be surprising because we know that when fluid gets into the spaces within rocks it can considerably weaken them. Pressurised fluids can effectively lubricate ancient fault zones that may have locked-in stresses built up over time, making them more prone to failure. Raising injection well depths further above the basement rocks in key areas could significantly reduce the annual energy released by earthquakes, in turn making larger earthquakes less likely. Current regulations can require operators to either reduce injection or raise the depth at which wells inject relative to the crystalline basement, but often the amount is not given or not based on scientific evidence. We hope our approach could help regulators test the effects of new regulations and the potential impact of new injection wells. Another major benefit is that our model can easily be updated as more data becomes available. This is important as different areas have become seismically active over time. This type of model could be used to identify when certain locations become more vulnerable to earthquakes, and help manage seismicity in Oklahoma and other areas where saltwater injection takes place. Most people involved, including Erin Brockovich, admit “effective, immediate and realistic steps” are required to tackle Oklahoma’s earthquake problem. The science of saltwater disposal can provide some practicable solutions, and our study is just the first step. We need the support of researchers, operators and regulators, to ensure this approach has a lasting impact on reducing man-made earthquakes."
"Australia’s plan to use an accounting loophole to meet its commitment under the Paris climate agreement has no legal basis and suggests it has reneged on a pledge to make deeper emissions cuts once a global deal was reached, a new report says. An analysis by Climate Analytics, a Berlin-based science and policy institute, found there were no grounds for Australia to claim credit towards its Paris emissions target for having beaten targets under its predecessor, the Kyoto protocol. It found the two agreements were separate treaties and should not be treated as a continuation of one agreement. The report, commissioned by the Australia Institute, has been released as Australia faces a challenge from at least 100 mostly developing countries at a UN climate conference in Madrid over its plan to use carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet its Paris target for 2030. The analysis was backed at the conference by Anote Tong, a former president of low-lying Kiribati. Launching the report, he said if Australia had beaten its earlier targets it had the capacity to do more, not less. “Australia is on fire due in large part to climate change, ands it is beyond me why the Australian government is looking for ways to weaken the Paris agreement so it and others can do less to solve the climate crisis,” Tong said. “This is about the real impact of what we are all trying to achieve here. Are we trying to work together or are we just shifting numbers?” Carryover credits were allowed under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol in a bid to encourage countries to be as ambitious in cutting pollution as possible. They were not mentioned in the original Paris agreement but have been added to the text being negotiated in Madrid, with some countries proposing they be banned. Officials told Senate estimates earlier this year that Australia was the only country planning to use them. Several developed countries have explicitly ruled out using them. Australia strongly opposes a ban and has factored in the credits as necessary for it to meet its Paris commitment. Climate Analytics found there was nothing in the legal framework of the Kyoto protocol that permitted the carryover over of emissions cuts into a new agreement after it ends in 2020. It says most of the credits, which the Morrison government now describes as its “overachievement”, were a direct result of Australia having massive emissions from deforestation in 1990, the year against which targets under the Kyoto deal are measured. According to the latest greenhouse accounts, deforestation made up about 30% of national emissions in 1990. It declined significantly in the years that followed, allowing Australia to increase fossil fuel emissions and still beat its first Kyoto target. This became known as the “Australia clause” of the Kyoto protocol, which was agreed by the Howard government in 1997. The report says it would be perverse for Australia to be rewarded in 2030 for the existence of large-scale deforestation four decades earlier. It says the claimed overachievement also came directly from Australia’s decision to give itself targets that were far less ambitious than other countries: an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2010, and what was equivalent to just a 0.5% cut below 1990 and 2020 (expressed as a 5% cut below 2000 levels). It says Australia’s attempt to minimise how much it had to cut emissions over the next decade was at odds with the goals and principles of the Paris agreement, committed countries to escalating action that reflected their “highest possible ambition”. Including carryover credits effectively cuts Australia’s 2030 target in half, from a minimum 26% cut to less than a 14% cut. Pollution from transport and industry and fugitive emissions from fossil fuel excavation continue to rise. Government advisers recommended a minimum 45% cut. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy director, said: “This research makes clear that there is no scientific, moral or legal foundation for the Australian government’s determination to gain credit for its historic recalcitrance.” The report says Australia appeared to have reneged on a commitment to increase its 2020 target from a 5% cut below 2000 levels to a 15% cut if the world reached a comprehensive treaty that was capable of limiting emissions to below 450 parts per million of atmospheric carbon dioxide. It said the Paris agreement could limit emissions to that level. The climate conference, and debate over the text, including the ban on carryover credits, is due to end on Friday. It was not clear on Wednesday night Australia if agreement would be reached. In a speech to the conference on Tuesday, Angus Taylor, the emissions reduction minister, said investments in technology were central to fighting climate change, but did not specifically mention the plan to use carryover credits. Taylor said the Paris agreement “sent a powerful signal to the world that countries are serious about climate action”. Angus Taylor tells #COP25Madrid Australia is on track to ‘meet and beat’ its Paris and Kyoto targets but sidesteps Australia’s controversial plans to use a carbon accounting loophole to slash its climate targets.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago, “Hurricane” Matthew weakened into a Category 1 storm by the time it made landfall in the U.S., which means its official title has been changed to “post-tropical storm Matthew“.  Because it lost so much intensity and could no longer be considered a real hurricane as it made landfall, this development has further lengthened the more than 10-year drought of major, intense (Category 3 and up) hurricanes that have failed to strike the U.S. coasts.
John Sutter, a CNN columnist who focuses on social justice and climate change in his op-ed essays, claimed a few days earlier that humans, by causing the ocean temperatures to increase, are simultaneously causing hurricanes (or, in this case, tropical storms) to get even more intense than they otherwise would. He called this claim a “truth”, and implored American readers to “rid the economy of fossil fuels” so as to reduce storm intensities.
CNN (John Sutter):
“[T]here’s an uncomfortable truth the rest of us should wrestle with: Hurricane Matthew looks a lot like future climate change. And if we want to stop storms like this from getting even more intense, we need to do everything we can to rid the economy of fossil fuels.”
To garner support for his opinions, Sutter quoted Dr. Michael Mann — the Penn State meteorologist made famous in the early 2000s by creating the hockey stick graph of the entire Northern Hemisphere with tree ring data from a few trees in North America —  in the same opinion piece.  Mann claims that (a) oceans are the warmest they’ve ever been, that (b) this apparently unprecedented warmth “intensifies” storms, and that, (c) within the last year (since 2015), we have “seen the strongest hurricane in both hemispheres.”
Michael Mann:
“Last year was the warmest our oceans have ever been on record. And that’s critical context.  It’s that warmth that provides the energy that intensifies these storms. And it isn’t a coincidence that we’ve seen the strongest hurricane in both hemispheres within the last year.”
It’s understandable that Sutter, a columnist, would be unfamiliar with what the scientific literature has to say about a link between warming ocean waters (by hundredths to tenths of a degree C) and the intensification of hurricanes.  He’s only taking the “experts” at their word when he calls it the “truth” that humans cause storms to become stormier.  But Michael Mann, on the other hand …he should simply know better.
First of all, the Pacific Ocean (where most hurricanes form) is currently not the warmest its ever been.  In fact, contrary to Mann’s hockey stick creations, the Pacific Ocean heat content is still cooler than it was just a few hundred years ago.   For example, Rosenthal et al. (2013), publishing in the journal Science (the same journal that published Mann’s tree-ring hockey stick creation), points out that the Pacific Ocean is still much cooler (0.65°C) than it was during the Medieval Warm Period, and the paleoclimate graph of the Pacific reveals that today’s temperatures are still some of the coldest of the last 10,000 years.
Rosenthal et al., 2013 (Pacific Ocean Heat Content)
“We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer by 2.1°C and 1.5°C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both water masses were ~0.9°C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65° warmer than in recent decades.”

But even more curious is Mann’s claim that this past year’s hurricanes are the strongest we have seen in both hemispheres.   It is clear the scientific literature does not support Mann’s claims that hurricanes have been observed to become more intense with warming (however modest that warming may be relative to the rest of the Holocene).  Even the IPCC (Chapter 2, WG1, AR5 2013) does not support Mann’s claims, citing low confidence in detecting a trend in increased hurricane intensities since 1900.
Simply put, the opposite of what Mann (and Sutter) claim to be “truth” about warming ocean temperatures and hurricane intensification is detailed in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Namely, observations indicate that there has been no trend in increased hurricane intensity in recent decades (i.e., Category 3 and up), and many observations even show there has been a slight decline in overall hurricane intensities since the middle of the 20th century.   Secondly, the frequency with which hurricanes make landfall have also been declining in recent decades.   And finally, it has been determined from paleoclimate analyses that cooler ocean temperatures are associated with more tropical storms and major hurricanes than warmer ocean temperatures.
Below there are 30 peer-reviewed scientific papers that summarize the literature on the lack of connection between ocean temperatures and hurricane variability.  Perhaps Sutter and Mann could find these educational.
No Trend Or Reduced Intensity Of Landfalling Hurricanes With Warming
Perrie et al., 2010
“The impact of climate change is seen in slightly decreased intensities in landfalling cyclones.”
Klotzbach and Landsea, 2015
“[T]be global frequency of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has shown a small, insignificant downward trend [1990-2014].”
Zhang et al., 2012
“The various SST measures only have a weak influence on TMLGP [tropical cyclones making landfall, South China] intensities. Despite the long-term warming trend in SST in the WNP, no long-term trend is observed in either the frequency or intensities of TMLGP [tropical cyclones making landfall, South China].”
Landsea et al., 1996
“A long-term (five decade) downward trend continues to be evident primarily in the frequency of intense hurricanes. In addition, the mean maximum intensity (i.e., averaged over all cyclones in a season) has decreased, while the maximum intensity attained by the strongest hurricane each year has not shown a significant change.”
Hsu et al., 2014
“All of the counts, lifespans, and accumulated cyclone energy of the late-season typhoons during the 1995–2011 epoch decreased significantly, compared with typhoons that occurred during the 1979–94 epoch.”
Hoarau et al., 2012
“There has been no trend towards an increase in the number of categories 3–5 cyclones over the last 30 years.”
Chang et al., 2016
“Extratropical cyclones cause much of the high impact weather over the mid-latitudes. With increasing greenhouse gases, enhanced high-latitude warming will lead to weaker cyclone activity. Here we show that between 1979 and 2014, the number of strong cyclones in Northern Hemisphere in summer has decreased at a rate of 4% per decade, with even larger decrease found near northeastern North America.”
Wu et al., 2006
“[D]ata show a decrease in the proportion of category 4-5 typhoons from 18% to 8% between the two periods of 1977-1989 and 1990-2004 (Table 1; intensity estimates in terms of sustained maximum winds first became available in RSMC-Tokyo best track data in 1977).”
Chan and Liu, 2004
“No significant correlation was found between the typhoon activity parameters and local SST [during 1960-2003]. In other words, an increase in local SST [sea surface temperatures] does not lead to a significant change of the number of intense TCs [tropical cyclones] in the NWP, which is contrary to the results produced by many of the numerical climate models.”
Zarzycki, 2016
“Multi-member ensembles show that the overall number of TCs [tropical cyclones] generated by the model is reduced by 5-9% when allowing for two-way air-sea interactions. TC [tropical cyclones] intensity is greatly impacted; the strongest 1% of all TCs are 20-30 hPa (4-8 m s−1) weaker and the number of simulated Category 4 and 5 TCs [tropical cyclones] are reduced by 65% in slab ocean configurations. Reductions in [tropical cyclone] intensity are in line with published thermodynamic theory.”
Blake and Landsea, 2011
“[D]uring the 40-year period 1961-2000 both the number and intensity of landfalling U.S. hurricanes decreased sharply.  Based on 1901-1960 statistics, the expected number of hurricanes and major hurricanes during  the period 1961-2000 would have been 77 and 30, respectively. However, only 55 (or 71%) of the expected number of hurricanes struck the U.S. with only 19 major hurricanes (or 63% of that expected number).”
Sanchez and Cavazos, 2014
“[D]uring 1970−2010 … SST in the MDR [along Mexican coasts] showed a statistically significant increase of 0.57°C over the whole period, but the frequency of HUR4−5 [intense hurricanes, Category 4 and 5] did not show a significant trend, while the frequency of HUR1−5 [weak and intense hurricanes] significantly decreased (−0.95% yr−1).”

Free et al., 2004
“Long-term changes in the intensity of tropical cyclones are of considerable interest because of concern that greenhouse warming may increase storm damage. The PI [potential intensity of tropical cyclones] calculated using radiosonde data at 14 tropical island locations shows only small, statistically insignificant trends from 1980 to 1995 and from 1975 to 1995.  … Between 1975 and 1980, however, while SSTs rose, PI [potential intensity] decreased, illustrating the hazards of predicting changes in hurricane intensity from projected SST changes alone.”
Nott and Hayne, 2001
“Our estimate of the frequency of such ‘super-cyclones’ [wind speeds in excess of 182 kilometers per hour] is an order of magnitude higher than that previously estimated.  … [The Great Barrier Reef] experienced at least five such storms over the past 200 years, with the area now occupied by Cairns experiencing two super-cyclones between 1800 and 1870.  The 20th century, however, was totally devoid of such [super-cyclone] storms, with only one such event (1899) since European settlement in the mid-nineteenth century.”
IPCC AR5 (2013) Working Group I, Chapter 2
“In summary, confidence in large scale changes in the intensity of extreme extratropical cyclones since 1900 is low”
Reduced Frequency Of Landfalling Hurricanes With Warming
Knutson et al., 2008
“Here we assess, in our model system, the changes in large-scale climate that are projected to occur by the end of the twenty-first century by an ensemble of global climate models, and find that Atlantic hurricane and tropical storm frequencies are reduced. At the same time, near-storm rainfall rates increase substantially. Our results do not support the notion of large increasing trends in either tropical storm or hurricane frequency driven by increases in atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations.”
Chenoweth and Divine, 2008
“Our record of tropical cyclone activity reveals no significant trends in the total number of tropical cyclones (tropical storms and hurricanes) in the best sampled regions for the past 318 years. However, the total number of hurricanes in the 20th century is ∼20% lower than in previous centuries. … Long-term variations in the number of tropical cyclones do not show any evidence of increasing storm frequency and have declined a nonstatistically significant amount.”
Haig et al., 2014
Australian tropical cyclone activity lower than at any time over the past 550–1,500 years
“The assessment of changes in tropical cyclone activity within the context of anthropogenically influenced climate change has been limited by the short temporal resolution of the instrumental tropical cyclone record (less than 50 years). Furthermore, controversy exists regarding the robustness of the observational record, especially before 1990. Here we show, on the basis of a new tropical cyclone activity index (CAI), that the present low levels of storm activity on the mid west and northeast coasts of Australia are unprecedented over the past 550 to 1,500 years.”

“We conducted 228-year long, three-member ensemble simulations using a high resolution (60 km grid size) global atmosphere model, MRI-AGCM3.2, with prescribed sea surface temperature and greenhouse gases and aerosols from 1872 to 2099. We found a clear decreasing trend of global tropical cyclone (TC) frequency throughout the 228 years of the simulation.”

“As of the end of the 2014 hurricane season, the US has experienced no major hurricane landfall since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, a drought that currently stands at nine years. Here, we use a stochastic tropical-cyclone model to calculate the mean waiting time for multi-year landfall droughts. We estimate that the mean time to wait for a nine-year drought is 177 years. We also find that the average probability of ending the drought with a major landfall in the next year is 0.39, and is independent of the drought duration, as one would expect for a Bernoulli process.”
Wang and Lee, 2008
“Here we use observational data to show that global warming of the sea surface is associated with a secular increase of tropospheric vertical wind shear in the main development region (MDR) for Atlantic hurricanes. The increased wind shear coincides with a weak but robust downward trend in U.S. landfalling hurricanes.”
Ha and Zhong, 2015
“Results show that the SCS TC [South China Sea tropical cyclone] activity experienced an abrupt decadal decrease at around 2002/2003. Compared to the TC [tropical cyclone] activities from the early 1990s to 2002, the number of TCs [tropical cyclones] formed in the SCS markedly decreased from 2003 through the early 2010s.”
Callaghan and Power, 2011
“The linear trend in the number of severe TCs [tropical cyclones] making land-fall over eastern Australia declined from about 0.45 TCs/year in the early 1870s to about 0.17 TCs/year in recent times—a 62% decline.”
Liu and Chan, 2013
“Tropical cyclone (TC) activity over the western North Pacific (WNP) exhibits a significant interdecadal variation during 1960-2011, with two distinct active and inactive periods each. This study examines changes in TC [tropical cyclone] activity and atmospheric conditions in the recent inactive period (1998-2011). The overall TC [tropical cyclone] activity shows a significant decrease [1960-2011], which is partly related to the decadal variation of TC genesis frequency in the southeastern part of the WNP and the downward trend of TC genesis frequency in the main development region.”
Williams et al., 2016
“Bayesian age–depth models, derived from eight AMS radiocarbon dates, suggest that the frequency of typhoon strikes was 2–5 times greater from 3900 to 7800 cal. yr. BP compared to 0–3900 cal. yr. BP [calendar years before present]. Possible explanations for this variability in the typhoon record are that typhoons were more frequent and/or more intense in Southeast Asia in the mid-Holocene because of climatic changes associated with the Mid-Holocene Warm Period or that the record reflects site sensitivity changes resulting from a mid-Holocene sea-level highstand.”
Dezileau et al., 2016
“Storms and tsunamis, which may seriously endanger human society, are amongst the most devastating marine catastrophes that can occur in coastal areas. Many such events are known and have been reported for the Mediterranean, a region where high-frequency occurrences of these extreme events coincides with some of the most densely populated coastal areas in the world. In a sediment core from the Mar Menor (SE Spain), we discovered eight coarse-grained layers which document marine incursions during periods of intense storm activity or tsunami events. Based on radiocarbon dating, these extreme events occurred around 5250, 4000, 3600, 3010, 2300, 1350, 650, and 80 years cal BP. No comparable events have been observed during the 20th and 21st centuries.”
IPCC AR5 (2013) Working Group I, Chapter 2
“Current datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century … No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin.”
Cooler (Not Warmer) Sea Surface Temps Produce More Frequent, Intense Hurricanes
Sugi et al., 2015
More tropical cyclones in a cooler climate?
“Recent review papers reported that many high-resolution global climate models consistently projected a reduction of global tropical cyclone (TC) frequency in a future warmer climate, although the mechanism of the reduction is not yet fully understood. Here we present a result of 4K-cooler climate experiment. The global TC [tropical cyclone] frequency significantly increases in the 4K-cooler climate compared to the present climate. This is consistent with a significant decrease in TC frequency in the 4K-warmer climate.“
Nott et al., 2007
“Our record demonstrates that the frequency variability of intense landfalling cyclones is greatest at centennial scale compared to seasonal and decadal oscillations.  [T]he period between AD 1600 to 1800 [Little Ice Age] had many more intense or hazardous cyclones impacting the site than the post AD 1800 period.”
Degear et al., 2015
“A comparison with North Atlantic and Western Mediterranean paleoclimate proxies shows that the phases of high storm activity occurred during cold periods, suggesting a climatically-controlled mechanism for the occurrence of these storm periods. … Periods of low storm activity occurred from 560 cal yr BC to 140 cal yr AD (SP9 and SP8, Roman Warm Period) and from 820 to 1230 cal yr AD (SP4, Medieval Warm Period).”
Laliberte et al., 2015
“Our work illustrates a major constraint on the large-scale global atmospheric engine: As the climate warms, the system may be unable to increase its total entropy production enough to offset the moistening inefficiencies associated with phase transitions. … On a warming Earth, the increase in perceptible water has been identified as a reason for the tropical overturning to slow down, and studies over a wide range of climates suggest that global atmospheric motions are reduced in extremely warm climates.“

"There have been five mass extinction events, the most famous of which was the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, there is evidence that we are currently experiencing a sixth. This time, however, the extinctions are happening at a much faster rate – and they are mainly due to us.  Unfortunately, many species just cannot adapt fast enough to our changing environment, be it global warming, habitat destruction or the impact of introduced species. Sadly, some of them suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs and vanish forever. It is extremely difficult to determine whether a species is extinct, or just absent from an area – but you do only need one specimen to prove that a species is still with us. Fortuitously, there have been several instances of species that were thought to be extinct (sometimes for millions of years) being rediscovered. These are termed “Lazarus” species, after the biblical story in which Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. Over 100 species have been rediscovered in this way, but here are six of the most interesting: This species, Balaenoptera omurai, which resembles a small fin whale, was only named in 2003, and purely from dead specimens. There were also no confirmed sightings of the species, which measures around 10m in length, afterwards, suggesting it had already gone extinct. However, a population of small whales, which are pale on the right-hand side and darker on the left, was discovered off the coast of Madagascar in 2013, which was later confirmed via DNA evidence to be the Omura’s whale. This exciting discovery of the first living specimens was reported earlier this month.   Possibly the most famous Lazarus species, the coelacanth (pronounced seel-a-canth), was thought to have gone extinct at the same time as the dinosaurs, but in 1938 one was discovered off the coast of South Africa. Coelacanths are closely-related to lungfish and are thought to be an evolutionary transitional species between fish and tetrapods (four-legged creatures). The fish tend to shelter in deep water caves, largely out of sight, but it is estimated that there could be only 500 or so left alive. You may forgive scientists for not being able to keep track of species that can move around, but surely sedentary species such as plants are easier to study? Mount Diablo Buckwheat, Eriogonum truncatumis, found only on Mount Diablo, California, was discovered in 1862. However, despite the area being studied in depth, only seven specimens were recorded, the last of which was found in 1936. Consequently, this species, which has a small pink flower, was declared extinct, presumed outcompeted by introduced species, until it was found accidentally in 2005 by a researcher working on the edge of its recorded range. Hundreds of thousands of seeds have now been propagated, ensuring that the species won’t become extinct again – at least not in our lifetimes. This enormous invertebrate, Dryococelus australis, is the size of your hand and was native to Lord Howe Island in the Pacific Ocean. Although once common, the insects were believed to have gone extinct in 1920 after being wiped out by rats that had been on a ship that ran aground on the island. Nevertheless, recently-dead specimens were found in the 1960s, and a living population of 24 insects was discovered in 2001 on Ball’s Pyramid, an isolated sea stack around 20km from Lord Howe Island. Over 9,000 adult stick insects have since been bred in captivity and will be returned to the wild once the rats have been completely eradicated. This seabird spends most of its life at sea, and when it does return to land it is largely nocturnal, to avoid predators. Consequently, the bird was thought to be extinct for more than 150 years having not been seen since 1850. Photographic evidence of the bird was finally gained off the coast of New Zealand, in 2003, however. In 2005, three birds were captured and fitted with radiotransmitters, and were tracked mainly at sea until their now protected breeding location was discovered in 2013. This large bat was once so abundant that its huge piles of guano (faeces) were mined and used as fertilizer. However, the species was declared extinct in 1996 as none had been seen since 1964, despite intensive surveys. It is thought that the species declined partly through hunting it for its meat but mainly because sugar cane plantations replaced the forests where the bats had foraged for fruit. The bat was rediscovered in 2001 but some of their habitat, on Cebu and Negros islands, remains unprotected so they are still threatened. So, are these Lazarus species cause for hope? To a degree, yes. As the fictional Dr Alan Grant of Jurassic Park said: “Life finds a way.” But, in reality, Lazarus species are extremely rare, and sadly we are certain that many more species have indeed gone extinct in the last 100 years. Conservation efforts work, though, so we should be able to ensure that many species continue to survive, rather than relying on them being brought back from the dead."
"Thousands of people have rallied in Sydney to protest against inaction on the climate crisis, after months of bushfires and hazardous smoke in New South Wales and Queensland. On Tuesday, the level of dangerous PM2.5 particles in Sydney’s air was as high as 10 times normal, and fires have burnt through nearly 3 million hectares of land across NSW and Queensland this season.  Thousands gathered in Sydney last night to demand climate change action in the midst of a devastating bushfire season which has destroyed more than 700 homes and seen smoke blanket much of the NSW. pic.twitter.com/FffhiirW62 Outside Sydney’s Town Hall, protesters gathered wearing face masks, asking the government to act on the role global heating had in making bushfire seasons longer and more devastating. Speakers called on the state and federal governments to increase funding to the Rural Fire Service, and provide P2 masks and Hepa air filters to firefighters, hospitals, aged care facilities and schools. Leighton Drury, the NSW secretary of the Fire Brigades Employees Union, said that firefighters were “spread thin”. “I am well-qualified to say that these are the worst fires we’ve had in decades, and they’re not going to get better unless we take action,” he said. “A decade of denial about own environment changing has led to this … the solution is simple. Firefighters put out fires. Politicians put out policies and budgets. We’ve got our job, they need to do theirs better”. Dr Janet Rowden from the Nurses and Midwives’ Association said the weeks of smoke were now posing a public health risk. “Already four of our members have lost their homes in the fires,” she said.  “We are suffering a public health climate emergency. We need to go on for another three months we are told.” Our bush is burning. Our city is shrouded in smoke. We demand action. #SydneyIsChoking #climateactionnow pic.twitter.com/94e74zlEgQ Big #climate protest gathering in #Sydney ... follows month of record bad air pollution and probably the biggest fires to sear NSW. pic.twitter.com/YqAckJcWlR I think this is my favourite pun-related placard at the climate change march at Sydney Town Hall #SydneyIsChoking pic.twitter.com/z2elIY9DWu The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, said earlier on Tuesday the fires were “not normal” and that we “need to reduce our carbon emissions immediately”. On Tuesday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was asked about concerns over how long the tens of thousands of volunteer firefighters – many who have been away from work for weeks now – were expected to continue without pay.  Morrison said volunteer firefighters “want to be out there defending their communities” and told media he was “pleased with the way those arrangements [between state and federal governments] are being worked out”. Rapturous cheers at Sydney Town Hall to thank all the firefighters for their bravery#AustraliaFires #ClimateEmergency pic.twitter.com/fV8uWL8KWv On Wednesday, former fire chiefs called for a national emergency summit on bushfires, and on Monday former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said it was a “national security issue”. The NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge told the crowd of protesters in Sydney that the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, was “missing in action” and Morrison had not done enough. “His big policy announcement has been a draft religious discrimination bill,” Shoebridge said to loud boos. Natalie Wasley from the Maritime Union of Australia said this week’s smoke haze was among the worst she had ever seen. “As a wharfie, I work in extreme conditions,” she said. “We work in heat, we work in rain, we are exposed to diesel particulates, we are exposed to dust. But like you, we have never, never experienced what has been happening in the past couple of weeks in our worksite”. High school student Amy Lamont told the crowd that a fire had threatened her home that very day. “There was a fire two kilometres from our house, and one kilometre from old primary school,” she said. “And if you’re not directly experiencing these fires, you’re breathing in about 30 cigarettes a day. “Students shouldn’t have to worry, when going to school, that they might come back to to a burned home.”"
"It could herald a great leap forward in the way we live our lives. The internet of things, the idea that objects can be interconnected via a global network, will run your home, keep you healthy and even check how much food is in your fridge. It will mean a trillion new “smart sensors” being installed around the world by 2020. But what’s going to power these devices? In some cases, the energy source is obvious: sensors in fridges or traffic lights can simply tap into mains electricity. But it’s much trickier to power something that detects water quality in remote reservoirs, cracks in railway lines, or whether a farmer’s cows are happy and healthy. Organic solar panels might be the answer. They’re cheap, and are flexible enough to power minuscule sensors whatever their shape. The cells can be just two micrometres thick – around a 50th the width of a human hair – but they are able to absorb a huge amount of light for such a thin surface. These organic photovoltaics (OPVs) differ from silicon solar cells as they can be made entirely from specially-synthesised organic materials, which are deposited onto cheap substrates such as PET, a form of polyester also used in soft drink bottles and crisp packets. This material is lighter, more flexible and can even be tuned to provide different colours – who said solar cells have to be plain black? Critically, it takes just one day for OPVs to earn back the energy invested in their manufacture, known as the “energy payback time”, which compares to around one to two years for regular silicon solar cells. Organic photovoltaics can also be moulded onto 3-D surfaces such as roof tiling or even clothing. In our latest research, colleagues and I demonstrated that this makes them more effective at capturing diffuse or slanting light. This wouldn’t make much difference for a regular solar farm in a sunny country, but cloudier places at higher latitudes would see benefits.  For the internet of things, however, these improvements are a game-changer. Few of those trillion sensors will be placed conveniently in the sunshine, facing upwards; far more will be in unusual locations where light only falls indirectly. Tiny organic solar cells will enable energy to be captured throughout the day, even indoors or when attached to clothes. There’s no denying the huge need for such a technology. The “trillion sensors” figure at first seems outlandish, but consider the fact that a typical smartphone, for example, possesses around ten smart sensors that measure light, temperature, sound, touch, movement, position, humidity and more.  More than a billion smartphones will be sold this year, so that’s 10 billion new sensors just in phones. And not all smart sensors are confined to smartphones, of course; they are already routinely used in personal care, environmental monitoring, security and transport. Whatever the exact numbers, we can assume that many, many more sensors will be deployed in future and their complexity and usefulness is growing exponentially. My colleagues and I at Bangor are interested in how we could power them all, which is what led us to organic solar. Though engineers will always try to reduce energy consumption through better design and putting sensors to “sleep” when they are not required, even ultra-low power sensors still consume around 3.5mW (milliWatts) per measurement. Poorer quality sensors might use considerably more. Now assuming the “average” sensor actually consumes 5mW per measurement, and assuming one measurement is made every minute and takes 30 seconds to complete, this average smart sensor will need 22 Wh (watt-hours) in a calendar year. On it’s own, this is not a substantial value and equivalent to running your TV for about five minutes. But it all adds up. Based on this simple analysis, 1 trillion sensors will use 21,900 Gigawatt hours (GWh) per year. That’s an incredible demand on electricity grids, equivalent to the combined output from a few typical nuclear power plants. This is all before considering the extra demand needed by data centres to handle and store such large sums of information. Yes, low-power electronics will be developed that should reduce the amount of energy that the sensors need. But, for long term operation, many sensors can’t rely upon an internal battery, as a battery has a finite energy store. This is particularly pertinent as many smart sensors may be placed in remote locations, often far from the electricity grid or without a power connection.  Therefore we must create smart sensors that can harvest their own energy from the local environment – and it’s here that organic solar technology will find its niche."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Sun in November 2016.  And models coming back to reality
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)The star at the center of our solar system last month again approached bottom with its solar activity. The monthly mean for sunspot number (SSN) was 21.4. Just how low this is, is clearly illustrated by comparing it to other solar cycles. SSN in November was only 36% of the mean of the previous 23 cycles 96 months into the cycle. The data are plotted in the following chart:
Figure 1: The monthly SSN of solar cycle (SC) 24 (red) since December 2008 compared to the mean of the previous 23 observed solar cycles (blue) and the similar SC 5 (black).
Over the past 8 years of the current cycle, activity has been only 56% of the mean. The following chart shows all 24 solar cycles — 8 years into the respective cycle:

Figure 2: The activity of the previous 24 systematically observed cycles since 1755 is compared. The numbers result from the summed accumulated monthly anomalies from the mean value (blue curve in Figure 1) — 96 months into the cycle.
SC24 activity up to the current month is dropping rapidly. There are many indications of a protracted end of the cycle with few sunspots.
In January 2017 we will assess the sun’s polar fields. The suspense is building because what we suspect with respect to the next cycle is becoming more and more solid as we get closer and closer to the sunspot minimum. A quick look at the new data all points to another weak cycle ahead.
=====================================
And it is widely accepted that weak cycles are associated with cooling climate conditions. Little wonder an increasing number of scientists are retreating from runaway warming predictions.
Sexed up climate models
And as the evidence of much slower warming grows, climate modelers have been scrambling to get their models back in line with observations, Bosse and Vahrenholt write. A recent new paper appearing on November 30, 2016 has created some controversy. Thomas Knutson and his colleagues of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the NOAA at Princeton examined the warming slowdown we have seen since 1997.
They conclude that it is due to large internal variability, one that is larger than assumed by climate models. They find:
Nonetheless, if CMIP5 models overestimate the TCR (forced warming rate), internal climate variability may have also played a significant role in the late 20th century global warming.”
“Internal variability” is in fact just another name for natural factors, and the authors suspect that there is a significant probability of a reduced warming trend for the future – like we have been seeing since 1997.

Their findings confirm what a number of scientists have suspected already: CO2 has been greatly exaggerated as a climate-driving factor. Ocean cycles are turning out to be playing a major role and rising CO2 concentrations are not leading to a climate catastrophe after all. The climate catastrophe is only showing up in IPCC models.
Grant Foster’s far-fetched claims
Bosse and Vahrenholt write that proponents of high CO2 climate sensitivity are upset by these new, non-alarmist findings. Grant Foster at his site “Tamino” claimed flaws in the findings, commenting:
I consider its many, and very serious, flaws to be telling evidence that the whole “slowdown” idea was misguided from the very start.”
But Bosse and Vahrenholt claim that “Tamino“ first ought to carry out a few simple operations before making such far-fetched claims about peer-reviewed papers, and so present all trends in “Tamino’s“  own datasets since 1951 that are at least 15 years long – and all end at 2015.

Figure 4: Trends of global temperature (GMST) with the start year on x axis until 2015. The steep drop since 1997 is clear to see. The AMO trends (violet) are also plotted.
The slowdown in the warming rates after 1997 compared to the values after ca. 1975 are not what Tamino (Grant Foster) claims they are. Rather they are in fact real.
Figure 4 clearly shows that the AMO (violet) sets the pace, with its trend some 4 years ahead of the GMST.
Getting back to real physics
In summary observations show that there is a TCR that is not more than 1.35°K for a doubling of CO2 atmospheric concentration. Anything over that is just “modeling hype”, write Bosse and Vahrenholt.
What does it all mean? Vahrenholt and Bosse summarize?
When models predict a warming of 2°C, observations tell us it is actually only 1.4°C — which is really not a catastrophe.  So let’s keep the focus on physics, which deals with the evaluation of observations,  and stays away from catastrophe scenarios!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is an interesting chart presented by Joe Bastardi’s Daily Update at Weatherbell Analytics.
There’s been a lot of talk about the current warm weather conditions up in the high Arctic, but little talk about the impressive snow cover over the northern hemisphere and the extreme and vast cold over Russia and Siberia.
What happened is that the cold air mass that’s usually over the pole has split, allowing warm air from the south to make its way to the pole and displacing the frigid air southwards. It’s called weather, which we know can be chaotic at times.
With the cold air moving southwards, it is of little surprise that the phenomenon would lead to greater snow cover over the northern hemisphere.

The chart above shows that the northern hemisphere currently has the second highest northern hemisphere snow cover for this time of the year. Source Weatherbell Analytics. In fact 5 of the last 6 years have been in the top 20!
Joe Bastardi says in today’s Daily Update that “there’s lots of snow in the northern hemisphere” and that it will become “more and more prominent” across the northern United States, accompanied by “explosions of thundersnow coming off the [Great] Lakes“.
Joe projects heavy snows across much of the US up until the new year and warns of a “December to remember”.

Meanwhile wetteronline.de here reports on extreme cold over Siberia, with temperatures “20°C below what is normal for this time of the year“, adding: “That means daytime highs of -35°C and lows  down to -45°C.”
 Chart of current low temperatures in Siberia here. What follows is the Chart for the high temperatures:

Chart: wetteronline.de.
What’s the cause of the extreme Siberian cold?
Wetteronline.de reports that it is due to the “widespread snowfall in October and a subsequent unusual formation of a powerful cold high“.
The German weather site warns that the cold is spreading westwards, and that it is possible a high over Scandinavia forms in the weeks ahead and thus deliver a significant cold blast across Europe.
A possible collapsing polar vortex makes this scenario more probable during Advent.”
So, don’t let yourselves be fooled by the mild weather that will grip western Europe in the days ahead.

"An exciting attempt to help honey bees has come about thanks to an unlikely intellectual marriage. One of us is an ecologist who wants to keep an eye on individual bees over their entire two to three-mile range and monitor their behaviour. The other is an expert in micro-electronics. Together, we want to develop miniature bee “backpacks” that will power tracking devices by harvesting the energy honey bees generate while flying and visiting flowers.  Bumble and honey bees, along with butterflies, moths and hoverflies perform much of the pollination that is essential for us to grow food. Unfortunately, since World War II, these insects have seen dramatic global population declines – numbers of some British bumblebees are down as much as 70%. There are lots of reasons for this drastic decline, including habitat loss – as meadows and wildflowers are destroyed to make way for farmland and buildings – invasive species such as the varroa mite and Asian Hornet, which preys on bees, disease and pesticide use. More intensive agricultural methods also leave little room for flowering plants.  We’d like to know more about this decline, of course, but the main problem confronting researchers is that bees are very small and difficult to follow as they go about their business. This presents a substantial challenge to tracking their movements and quantifying the major causes and effects of population declines.  Current studies tend to count the number of bees that do not return to a hive as lost or dead, for example. And any attempt to determine a cause of death is lost in the wider environment as we don’t know where the missing bees end up. Knowing where, how and when they died or became lost is essential to improving our understanding of the impact of pesticides on non-target organisms and ultimately to how we control the use of such chemicals. These challenges have spurred efforts to better understand both how bees navigate their way around the countryside, and what determines their ultimate fate. Monitoring bee movements for any length of time and over large distances is extremely difficult. The transmitters used to track bees either weigh more than the bee, or have a range of only a few metres. Consequently, the devices either affect their behaviour (if they are too heavy) or provide insufficient data (if underpowered).  Most bee monitoring occurs in carefully-controlled experimental conditions on relatively flat land. Current tracking systems are unable to monitor in landscapes that are anything other than flat as there needs to be a clear line of sight between the receiver and the transmitter attached to the bee. Knowing where and how bees move and die outside the hive in a variety of landscapes will provide critical information in evaluating the impact of modern agricultural techniques such as the use of neonicotinoid pesticides. Three major challenges need to be overcome for tracking devices to become truly useful: their weight, range, and how long their power source lasts. We’re aiming to reduce the transmitter weight by harvesting the energy the bee generates while flying. This will allow us to do away with the battery, which is normally the heaviest component. The final bee backpack will weigh less than 50 milligrams (about two grains of rice) and will be the size of a match head. To further reduce the need for a high-powered signal (which requires more energy to be emitted from the transmitter) we intend to use a mobile receiver to track and follow the bee’s movements over its entire foraging range. This will remove the need for heavy, cumbersome equipment and will allow monitoring in a greater range of “real life” environments. For the little bee, the new device will feel like a rucksack – not the equivalent of a kitchen table and chairs, as at present.  The same technology could also be used against Asian hornets, which prey on honey bees, can destroy an entire colony in just a few hours, and represent a significant global threat to bees. We could attach a bee transmitter to a captured hornet, track it back to its nest and destroy the colony in early summer, before they have the chance to produce new queens. The devices could also help estimate tropical deforestation rates based on the insects’ visits to flowering trees, or quantify the number of flowers in threatened meadows. They could also be used to calculate the value of pollination services to agriculture and horticulture. There’s certainly a future for bee backpacks."
"The idea that global warming has “stopped” is a contrarian talking point that dates back to at least 2006. This framing was first created on blogs, then picked up by segments of the media – and it ultimately found entry into the scientific literature itself. There are now numerous peer-reviewed articles that address a presumed recent “pause” or “hiatus” in global warming, including the latest IPCC report. So did global warming really pause, stop, or enter a hiatus? At least six academic studies have been published in 2015 that argue against the existence of a pause or hiatus, including three that were authored by me and colleagues James Risbey of CSIRO in Hobart, Tasmania, and Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University. Our most recent paper has just been published in Nature’s open-access journal Scientific Reports and provides further evidence against the pause. First, we analysed the research literature on global temperature variation over the recent period. This turns out to be crucial because research on the pause has addressed – and often conflated – several distinct questions: some asked whether there is a pause or hiatus in warming, others asked whether it slowed compared to the long-term trend and yet others have examined whether warming has lagged behind expectations derived from climate models.  These are all distinct questions and involve different data and different statistical hypotheses. Unnecessary confusion has resulted because they were frequently conflated under the blanket labels of pause or hiatus. To reduce the confusion, we were exclusively concerned with the first question: is there, or has there recently been, a pause or hiatus in warming? It is this question – and only this question – that we answer with a clear and unambiguous “no”. We considered 40 recent peer-reviewed articles on the so-called pause and inferred what the authors considered to be its onset year. There was a spread of about a decade (1993-2003) between the various papers. Thus, rather than being consensually defined, the pause appears to be a diffuse phenomenon whose presumed onset is anywhere during a ten-year window.  Given that the average presumed duration of the pause in the same set of articles is only 13.5 years, this is of concern: it is difficult to see how scientists could be talking about the same phenomenon when they talked about short trends that commenced up to a decade apart. This concern was amplified in our third point: the pauses in the literature are by no means consistently extreme or unusual, when compared to all possible trends. If we take the past three decades, during which temperatures increased by 0.6℃, we would have been in a pause between 30% and 40% of the time using the definition in the literature.  In other words, academic research on the pause is typically not talking about an actual pause but, at best, about a fluctuation in warming rate that is towards the lower end of the various temperature trends over recent decades. If there has been no pause, why then did the recent period attract so much research attention? One reason is a matter of semantics. Many academic studies addressed not the absence of warming but a presumed discrepancy between climate models and observations. Those articles were scientifically valuable (we even wrote one ourselves), but we do not believe that those articles should have been framed in the language of a pause: the relationship between models (what was expected to happen) and observations (what actually happened) is a completely different issue from the question about whether or not global warming has paused. A second reason is that the incessant challenge of climate science by highly vocal contrarians and Merchants of Doubt may have amplified scientists’ natural tendency to be reticent over reporting the most dramatic risks they are concerned about.  We explored the possible underlying mechanisms for this in an article earlier this year, which suggested climate denial had seeped into the scientific community. Scientists have unwittingly been influenced by a linguistic frame that originated outside the scientific community and by accepting the word pause they have subtly reframed their own research. Research directed towards the pause has clearly yielded interesting insights into medium-term climate variability. My colleagues and I do not fault that research at all. Except that the research was not about a (non-existent) pause – it was about a routine fluctuation in warming rate. With 2015 being virtually certain to be another hottest year on record, this routine fluctuation has likely already come to an end."
"Climate talks in Madrid have ended with a partial agreement to ask countries to come up with more ambitious targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions in order to meet the terms of the 2015 Paris accord. Few countries came to this year’s talks with updated plans to reach the Paris goals, though the EU finally agreed its long-term target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Experts say more ambitious emissions cuts are needed globally if the Paris pledge to hold global heating to no more than 2C is to be met.  This year’s round of annual UN talks focused on narrow technical issues such as the workings of the global carbon markets, a means by which countries can trade their successes in cutting emissions with other countries that have not cut their own emissions fast enough. By midday on Sunday, more than 40 hours after the talks deadline, agreement on that was still far off and the issue will have to be resolved next year. There were fears that the more substantive issue of future emissions cuts would also be sidelined, but a “high ambition coalition” made up of the EU and many smaller developing countries pressed for a resolution to ask all governments to formulate stronger national plans on cutting carbon. They partially succeeded, and they will now hope to put political pressure – from within the talks, in behind-the-scenes meetings in world capitals, and in the outside world from civil society – on all governments to recommit to the 2015 Paris accord in 2020 through updates to their national climate plans. That will be a difficult task, judging by the scenes at the two-week-long Madrid conference.  No major breakthrough had been seriously expected at this year’s meeting, known as COP25, but observers had at least hoped to see a spirit of cooperation and a willingness to press ahead with the Paris agreement goal of holding temperature rises to no more than 2C. Both were lacking as the talks moved into the early hours of Sunday. Poor countries grew angry at what they saw as intransigence on the part of some richer nations, while the EU and a coalition of developing countries urged others to come forward with more ambitious plans to combat climate breakdown. In the final hours, weary negotiators wrangled over the wording of provisions for “loss and damage”, by which developing countries are hoping to receive financial assistance for the ravages they face from climate breakdown. The US was blamed for refusing to agree to developing countries’ demands under what is known in the UN jargon as the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM). A US state department official said: “The US government is the largest humanitarian donor in the world. The WIM should be a constructive space to catalyse action on the wide range of loss and damage issues. A divisive conversation on blame and liability helps no one.” Brazil held up agreement over a provision allowing governments to trade in carbon credits. It insisted that its carbon sinks – mainly forests, including the Amazon – should count towards its emissions-cutting goals, while also selling carbon credits derived from preserving forests to other countries to count towards their emissions targets. Other countries said this was double counting and would undermine the carbon trading system. Governments discussed these points for two weeks with little official attention paid to the broader and more urgent issue of how countries can accelerate their plans to cut carbon in the next decade. Protesters outside and inside the halls pointed to increasingly stark scientific warnings and the world’s failure so far to cut greenhouse gases. Research published during the talks showed that emissions have risen by 4% since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, and cuts of more than 7% a year will be needed in the next decade to avoid dangerous levels of heating. The world’s poorest countries, and those most vulnerable to climate chaos, came away largely disappointed and calling for more action in the next year. Sonam Wangdi, chair of the Least Developed Countries Group, said: “This COP was not able to meet our expectations in raising ambition to address the concerns of our people at home and youth around the world. Now while countries must make transformational improvements to [their emissions reduction] targets by 2020 that put us on a pathway to limit warming to 1.5C.” Wangdi pointed to the problems already being seen in some of the poorest nations. “Our people are already suffering from the impacts of climate change. Our communities across the world are being devastated. Global emissions must be drastically and urgently reduced to limit further impacts, and financial support scaled up so our countries can better address climate change and its impacts.” Jamie Henn, the strategy director at the pressure group 350.org, said: “The level of disconnect between what this COP should have delivered and what it’s on track to deliver is appalling and is a sign that the very foundations of the Paris agreement are being shaken up. A handful of loud countries has hijacked the process and is keeping the rest of the planet hostage.” Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa, a climate and energy thinktank, said: “This is a disastrous, profoundly distressing outcome – the worst I have ever seen. At a time when scientists are queuing up to warn about terrifying consequences if emissions keep rising, and schoolchildren taking to the streets in their millions, what we have here in Madrid is a betrayal of people across the world. It is disgraceful and governments are simply not doing their job of protecting the planet.” The most high-profile of those young protesters, Greta Thunberg, tweeted a picture of herself on the way home from the conference on Saturday night. Traveling on overcrowded trains through Germany. And I’m finally on my way home! pic.twitter.com/ssfLCPsR8o The lack of progress leaves the UK, as a co-host of next year’s talks, with a diplomatic mountain to climb in the next 10 months. In Glasgow early next November, countries will meet again with the aim of strengthening their commitments on emissions cuts under the Paris accord. Without such reinforcements, current commitments put the world on track for at least 3C of warning, which scientists say would spell disaster."
"The landscape is literally cracking up. Permafrost causes moving rocks, sliding land and wide crevices. This is the remote island of Edgeøya in the High Arctic, where nature clearly rules. Over the summer, I was part of a team of scientists that made a remarkable discovery here. It could teach us a great deal about how the High Arctic is changing and what it means for the rest of the world. Edgeøya is part of the Svalbard archipelago. The islands belong to Norway, but have long been important in Dutch culture. The Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz discovered them in 1596. The Norwegians think Barentsz only found what they already knew was there, but their evidence remains disputed.  I first went to Svalbard in 1993 and have returned almost every year since 1997, studying the plant and animal life during the two or three months when the tundra is free of snow. I’ve mostly worked on the western side of Spitsbergen, the biggest and most accessible island. But this year’s visit to Edgeøya retraced the steps of a Dutch expedition who studied it in the 1960s and 1970s. We were part of a unique trip to the islands on a 200-strong icebreaker, the Ortelius, which brought together Dutch scientists, tourists, journalists and artists.  Our nine-day mission was to see what had changed since the previous Dutch expedition. Our small team focused on a valley in the northwest of Edgeøya called Rozenbergdalen. Situated next to a fjord, it is home to reindeer, arctic foxes and pink-footed geese. Walruses laze on the shore and the odd polar bear prowls over a landscape that has been scraped out by ice. These creatures are a spectacle in themselves, but we were here for the plant life. Our ship was anchored a distance from the shallow shore, so each morning we had to wait until the pack ice had drifted into suitable positions – never mind that it was August. Then team members had to skilfully navigate to the shore in little Zodiac inflatable boats, bumping between lumps of ice, taking care not to disturb walruses, not to mention polar bears. You don’t visit this terrain without a rifle, and if you see a bear you move quickly out of its way.  We were mentally prepared for many surprises, but not concerning the vegetation. We expected only subtle change – the odd new tuft, as it were. We worked from a vegetation map that the former team had painstakingly produced, moving plot by plot, re-recording the presence and abundance of the different plant species.   The results left us more and more confused. The vegetation was radically different. Were we doing something wrong? We knew we couldn’t be all that far out. Twenty metres maybe, but not more. Had the previous crew made serious recording mistakes? Clearly not, since their records had been so thorough. Nothing made sense. We just could not believe our eyes.  After three days, we concluded the inescapable: the vegetation was far more developed than in the past. It was both exciting and bamboozling. In the 1970s this valley had been home to specialists at growing in difficult barren places, which we call pioneer species – treads of purple saxifrage trailing bare soil, occasionally crossing paths with small snow grasses and the likes.  These pioneers had pretty much been replaced by layers of moss several centimetres thick, where taller plants had made themselves comfortable. These ranged from polar willows forming swards 5cm tall to grasses up to 20cm high. From being a place that was only barely vegetated, the balance had been tipped towards a more stable system. Such dramatic changes in a High Arctic system would generally need a very long period of time. More curiously still, we hadn’t seen such rapid conversions elsewhere on Svalbard.   Although still in the dark – just like Edgeøya in winter – we are forming potential explanations. Direct effects of a warming climate seem unlikely as summer temperatures don’t appear to have increased much on the islands as a whole. Winters have become warmer, however, which could have made life easier for plants. Normally Svalbard’s plant-growth season has a rather abrupt start and stop, and can be as little as six weeks – terms like spring and autumn don’t mean much.   If the snow has been melting earlier, the conditions for growth may have carried on longer. Even extending from six to eight weeks is a large change, and fits with the idea of warming in the Arctic as a whole. And the lack of such dramatic changes in the western warmer parts of Svalbard might be because they happened many hundreds of years ago.  Yet climatic changes may not be the whole story. For example seabirds bring in a lot of nutrients from sea to land. We found little auks breeding on cliffs in the valley, and an increase in this charming plankton-eating seabird would almost certainly stimulate plant growth. Likewise pink-footed geese are now much more common there than in the 1970s, and the foraging of this plant eater will also be leaving its traces on the vegetation. Whatever does explain what has happened, we have been very fortunate to find a system so sensitive to subtle changes. It will help us understand why systems on the edge can change so rapidly, and what it means for the High Arctic as a whole. If we can unlock our mystery, we will be a step closer to understanding one of the most remote regions in the world."
"For those watching the UK energy sector, barely a week has gone by of late without some kind of drama. A third of the nation’s coal power stations breaking down, subsidies cut for renewables but available for diesel generators, and a leaked letter suggesting renewable targets would be missed. This has led to much criticism at home and abroad. No wonder the new Secretary for Energy and Climate Change, Amber Rudd, says she’d like energy policy to be more “boring”. Her recent statement was an opportunity for Amber Rudd to re-establish her credibility. So has the “reset” worked? Few will disagree with the announcement of a fixed end to coal-fired power generation in 2025. Coal produces the largest proportion (32%) of our electricity supply in 2014, and the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions. All plants are over 35 years old, and most were slated for retirement by 2025, with policies such as the carbon price and the need to meet the EU Industrial Emissions Directive designed to persuade power generators to switch away from coal. But progress has been slow, and research by Imperial College has even suggested the economics favour keeping at least some coal power running into the 2030s. So it seems that fixing the judgement day for coal power in the UK is not the bold policy move many are claiming – where other policies are failing, it’s simply another means to achieve the same end. The pressing question is how to replace the power these plants generated. Given the UK’s emission reduction targets, you’d imagine renewables would figure strongly. Instead, the government is suggesting gas power will fill the gap. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC), an independent body established to advise the government, recommends that the emissions intensity of power generation should by 2030 be under 100 grammes CO₂ per kWh and much lower still by 2050 in order for a cost-effective pathway for meeting legally binding emissions targets. Gas produces less than half the greenhouse gas emissions of coal, but at 365 grammes CO₂ per kWh this is much higher than the target intensity level. For gas to remain in the power generation mix, at least 73% of power generation would need to be virtually zero carbon by 2030. Yet gas-fired power already meets about 30% of the UK’s electricity needs – so this means the country needs to reduce, not increase, the number of gas-fired power stations (specifically, those without carbon capture installed). The CCC estimates that investing in low-carbon technologies rather than gas-fired power throughout the 2020s would reduce UK CO₂ emissions by 55m tonnes. The secretary of state gives no indication as to whether new gas plants will have to be fitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Using CCS is widely acknowledged to be the most cost effective way of meeting climate targets, estimated to halve the cost of meeting the UK’s 2050 targets. So it’s surprising that CCS barely gets a mention. But in any case, CCS cannot completely remove emissions: capture rates are estimated to be 85-90%, and overall reductions (over the whole lifecycle) would be lower.  Given that there is no CCS in commercial operation in the UK yet, with the only planned plant not expected to be operational before 2020, the government needs to enable rapid acceleration of CCS development – particularly if it is to emphasise gas power. The UK imported 45% of its gas needs in 2014 and even with the most optimistic shale gas production figures this will continue for the forseeable future. Biogas will contribute at most 10% of current demand by 2025. The extra gas would presumably be liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipped from abroad. Transportation and processing means that LNG has higher overall emissions compared with conventional gas in the range of an additional 12-36% greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing use of LNG will increase the overall emissions from using gas energy. It’s estimated that the process of fracking for shale gas would also generate up to 25% higher emissions. But there are greater problems in decarbonising other energy use sectors. Heating constitutes more than 40% of UK energy use, with transport accounting for another 40%. It is much more difficult to tackle emissions in these sectors. Mass deployment of electric vehicles is a long way off, and for heating there is no competition on performance or cost for a gas boiler. There’s also enormous infrastructure already in place to deliver gas to 84% of homes: were the UK to try and electrify its heating this would require many times more power generation capacity just to meet peak winter demand, that would then lie redundant for the warmer months making it a costly investment.  So the government’s announcement may spell the end of coal-fired power, but says nothing about how to tackle the 80% of the UK’s energy use expected to be more costly and difficult to decarbonise than electricity generation. From Rudd’s statement it seems as if the pressure is off in decarbonising electricity generation. Where does that leave the UK in meeting its legally-binding emissions targets? Perhaps the government should start saving to meet the EU fines and legal costs it will inevitably face when it misses them."

All too often, scientific analysis of modern glacier and ice sheet melt rates is conveniently confined to the last 30 to 60 years.  Indeed, the common reference period for determining current surface mass balance estimates marks the three decades between 1961-1990, which “coincidentally” happens to contain some of the coldest temperatures of the last few hundred years — when glaciers were observed to be advancing relative to the period centered around the 1930s.   Contemporary scientists routinely reported on these observations (a rapidly cooling climate, advancing glaciers) in scientific journals.  For example:
Gordon, 1981   “Since about 1968/69 the glacier fronts have advanced by up to 158 m following a marked climatic recession [cooling] during the 1960s and early 1970s. In general, fluctuations of the glaciers have been in sympathy with prevailing climatic trends and show a relatively rapid response following temperature changes.”
Andrews et al., 1972    “Mean summer temperatures have declined throughout the 1960s to a level cooler than for approximately 40 yr.  … The net effect has been for heavier falls of snow in winter and with lower summer temperatures and therefore less melting (Jacobs et al, 1972), resulting in notably increased glacierization. … at least two corries snowfree in 1960 are presently occupied by incipient glaciers. …  The present  Neoglacial ice is nearly as extensive as the late glacial stade.”
Schneider, 1974    “In the last century it is possible to document an increase of about 0.6°C in the mean global temperature between 1880 and 1940 and a subsequent fall of temperature by about 0.3°C since 1940.  In the polar regions north of 70° latitude the decrease in temperature in the past decade alone has been about 1°C, several times larger than the global average decrease.”
Chi-chun and Pen-hsing, 1978     “Research on glacier fluctuations shows that the Little Ice Age was also experienced here with maxima occurring during the 19th century.  This was followed by a strong retreat from the 1930s with recent signs of the initiation of a new period of glacier advance.  … Our on-the-spot investigations, documental records and information local residents all tell us that, beginning in the thirties, the glaciers in Tibet underwent a period of strong retreating. The air temperature began to fall after the fifties. From meteorological records, we know that the temperature in the sixties was universally 0.7°C or so lower than in the fifties“
Hollin, 1965     “‘Surges’ and ‘catastrophic advances’ in glaciers have received increasing attention recently.  More than forty such events have been reported from Alaska and northwest Canada alone.”
Recently published temperature reconstructions of the high Northern latitudes also indicate a significant drop in temperature (relative to the 1920s to 1940s) during this reference or baseline period (1961-1990).  For example:
Hasholt et al., 2016   “We determined that temperatures for the ablation measurement periods in late July to early September were similar in both 1933 and the recent period [1990s – present], indicating that the temperature forcing of ablation within the early warm period and the present are similar.”

Box et al., 2009   “The annual whole ice sheet 1919–32 warming trend is 33% greater in magnitude than the 1994–2007 warming. … The 1955–82 cooling phase was most significant during autumn in east and southern Greenland.”

So by directly comparing the modern warm phase (1990s-present) in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere to a cool phase (1961-1990), and by failing to include the 1920s to 1940s warm period in their baseline determinations, scientists can conveniently report “accelerated” ice melt rates for recent decades — and thus provide headline material for media outlets (and policy makers) actively promoting the “dangerous” global warming agenda.
‘Present-Day Changes Are Not Exceptional’
On the occasion when scientists extend their glacier or ice sheet studies back to periods earlier than the 1950s, a significantly non-alarming conclusion emerges that does not support the modern zeitgeist that says “catastrophic” and “unprecedented” ice melt is occurring today.  For example, in “Surface mass-balance changes of the Greenland ice sheet since 1866,” Wake et al., 2009  write:
“All SMB [surface mass balance] estimates are made relative to the 1961–90 average SMB and we compare annual SMB estimates from the period 1995–2005 to a similar period in the past (1923–33) where SMB was comparable, and conclude that the present-day changes are not exceptional within the last 140 years.”
Investigation Of Long-Term Glacier Melt Rates For Iceland Reveal No Net Change In 80 Years
Two new (2016) papers lend further support to the conclusion that there currently is nothing unusual happening in the cryosphere.  In their paper “Recent retreat at a temperate Icelandic glacier in the context of the last ~80 years of climate change in the North Atlantic region”, Chandler et al. (2016) compare 3 periods with high glacier-melt rates: 1936-’41, 1951-’56, and 2006-2011.  They find that not only were the temperature changes comparable for all three periods, but so was the rate and magnitude of ice recession.  In fact, the retreat rates were determined to be higher during the earlier periods (1930s, 1950s) than during the 21st century.
Chandler et al., 2016 (Iceland Glaciers)
“[W]e calculated ice-frontal retreat rates [Skálafellsjökull glacier, SE Iceland]  since the 1930s. From the calculated record of ice-front retreat, we recognised two pronounced periods of glacier recession [1936-’41 and 1951-’56] for comparison with the most recent phase of retreat (2006–2011). We undertook quantitative analysis to examine variability between these three periods of retreat, and showed that they are comparable both in style and magnitude. Analysis of climate data for SE Iceland also indicates that the three periods of ice-frontal retreat [1936-’41, 1951-’56, and 2006-’11] identified are associated with similar summer air temperature values, which has previously been shown to be a key control in terminus variations in Iceland. We, therefore, demonstrated that the coincidence of the most recent phase of ice-frontal retreat at Skálafellsjökull (2006–2011) and warming summer temperatures is not unusual in the context of the last ~80 years. This highlights the need to place observations of contemporary glacier change in a broader, longer-term (centennial) context.”

Investigation Of Long-Term Ice Sheet Melt Rates For Greenland Reveal No Net Change In 80 Years
A total of 13 scientists (van As et al., 2016) contributed to another new paper entitled “Placing Greenland ice sheet ablation measurements in a multi-decadal context“, a comprehensive analysis of changes to the Greenland Ice Sheet since the 1880s.  Once again, the results do not advance the cause for alarm about modern ice sheet melt trends.  The longer-term temperature changes for the ice sheet indicate a sharp warming during the 1920s and 1930s, a pronounced cooling trend during the 1960s to early 1990s (which is once again used as the reference period for this study), and then a subsequent warming after about 1995.  Both temperature peak (1930s and 2006-’11) periods were similar in magnitude.
van As et al., 2016
[I]n southern Greenland ablation peaked significantly around 1930. While most of Greenland underwent relatively warm (summer) conditions in the 1930s (Cappelen 2015), this was most notable at the more southern locations, resulting in amplified ablation values according to our estimates. JJA [summer] temperatures were higher in 1928 and 1929 than in any other year of the Qaqortoq record, both attaining values of 9.2°C. This suggests that ablation in those years may have exceeded the largest net ablation measured on the Greenland ice sheet (2010).

Although van As et al. (2016) indicate that it is “likely” that the amplitude of the ablation (melting) volume in recent decades has been more pronounced than during the 1930s, the depicted trend lines for the (4) Greenland Ice Sheet regions that extend back to at least 1900 indicate that 3 out of the 4 ablation amplitudes for the 1930s were comparable to, or exceeded, what has occurred in recent decades.

In fact, a composite of the four trend lines (red) shown above suggests no significant differences in ablation rates between the 1920s-1930s and the 21st century.

Other scientists (Fettweis et al., 2008, below) have previously reached the conclusion that modern ice sheet and glacier recession is not only not unusual in the context of the last century, the surface mass balance loss in recent decades may have yet to exceed the losses from the 1930s period.   When also considering that the ice sheet cooled and gained mass between the 1960s and 1990s, it would be fair to say that there has been no net mass loss for the Greenland Ice Sheet in the last 80 years, or since anthropogenic forcing is believed to have exerted an “unprecedented” and potentially “catastrophic” influence on the climate.
Fettweis et al., 2008    “The rate of warming in 1920– 1930 is the most spectacular as pointed out by Chylek et al. (2006). Finally, Greenland climate was colder around 1920 and, in the 1970s and 1980s. The temperature minimum (resp. maximum) seems to have occurred in 1992 after the Mont Pinatubo eruption (resp. in 1931). The warm summers of recent years (1998, 2003, 2005), associated with large melt extent areas (Fettweis et al., 2007), seem to be less warm than these of the 1930s, as also pointed out by Hanna et al. (2007).”
“The absolute minimum [surface mass balance] occurred around 1930 with a SMB anomaly near −300 km3 yr−1 . Secondary (minor) SMB minima appear to have occurred in 1950 and 1960, equalling the surface mass loss rates of the last few years (1998, 2003, 2006). … After the 1990s, the GrIS SMB decreases slowly to reach the negative anomalies of the last few years, although the summers of the 2000s were not exceptional compared to 70 yr ago”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHigh profile German food chemist Udo Pollmer here at German public radio brings the following video to our attention.

In the video biologist and public speaker Allan Savory tells an audience how climate change and desertification has a lot more to do with the elimination of roaming herd animals over grasslands and vegetated areas over the 20th century.
Another tragedy of consensus science
Tragically, it used to be consensus science that the desertification of vast areas of land on all continents was caused by the over-grazing by herds of animals. As they chomped on the vegetation and moved on, they left the soil barren and exposed to evaporation and wind erosion. Animals that had lived there for thousands of years were suddenly deemed by consensus science to be the culprits.
Flawed wildlife management cause as much climate change as fossil fuels!
Savory recalls ordering the destruction of 40,000 elephants in the mid 20th century in order to protect vegetated land. Mass culling of wildlife was the answer to spreading desertification. Much to his horror, he later realized he had made a terrible mistake. The land on which the destroyed elephants inhabited later rapidly deteriorated and became barren – thus even wreaking havoc on the macro-climate.

It turned out that roaming herds, with the dung and urine they left behind, were essential elements in preserving green vegetation and preventing desertification. He concludes that in order for the planet to survive, it needs more land grazing animal herds and not less. At the 18:48 mark he says:
What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as I believe fossil fuels, and maybe more than fossil fuels. But worse than that it is causing hunger, poverty, violence and social breakdown and war.”
Savory then notes that reversing the damage to the ecosystem can be done at a very low cost. And by taking the measures he recommends, it will lead to taking CO2 out of the atmosphere and putting it back into the ground:
If we do what I am showing you here, we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grasslands soil for thousands of years, and if we do that on just half of the world’s grasslands that I’ve shown you, we can take us back to pre-industrial levels while feeding people.”
What’s interesting is that if the poor management of wildlife (particularly reducing grazing herds of animals) has led to half of the 20th century climate change, and the oceans and solar activity have played significant roles as well – as a large body of science shows – then there really isn’t much left to be chalked up to CO2. Increasingly it is becoming obvious that some climate scientists have obsessed with CO2 while ignoring the remaining universe of factors – see here, here, here and here.
Clearly our understanding of how climate and ecosystems function is far less than some “experts” would have us believe.

"More than 146 countries covering 87% of global greenhouse gas emissions have now submitted their national pledges to tackle climate change in advance of the major climate summit in Paris. These are known as Intended Nationally-Determined Contributions. Note the language: these aren’t commitments and are only “intended”. Since collectively these INDCs would still leave us on course for nearly 3℃ warming, some way beyond the 2℃ target that the international community has settled on as a safe threshold, the hope is that they will be ratcheted up at Paris and beyond.  But will countries stick to these pledges? And what happens if they don’t? Climate negotiations have a long history of countries failing to deliver on their commitments. More than 16 countries failed to meet their targets under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol up to 2012 and some major emitters like Canada simply reneged on their commitments without consequences.  But the problem of getting countries to implement their commitments is certainly not unique to climate change. Indeed it is a general feature of international relations that in the absence of a global police force and with weak judicial systems, there is no overriding central authority to force states to abide by national or international law. Essentially the only sanctions available are moral pressure (stigmatising non-compliant countries, as happens over human rights), trade sanctions (used to isolate governments such as the apartheid regime in South Africa) or military sanctions (applied to various countries in the Middle East in recent years). Military sanctions are clearly not going to be applied in this case. Trade measures have been used in climate policy however, sometimes controversially, such as subsidies to solar and wind industries or so-called border tax adjustments, where countries impose a fee on products coming from markets where carbon is not regulated or taxed giving them an unfair competitive advantage.  It is moral pressure that climate diplomacy really relies upon though. This has pressured the EU to adopt and maintain a leadership role, for example in setting out a more ambitious target than that adopted by many other major industrialised regions. Often, however, even that is ineffective. The pariah status that the Bush government earned for walking away from the Kyoto Protocol had only minimal effect on the US’s position at the time. A change of administration ultimately brought about a shift in policy.  There have been calls in the past for more ambitious approaches to enforcing climate commitments. In 1997 Brazil proposed the establishment of a Clean Development Fund to fine countries failing to meet their emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol. The funds generated from fines on richer (“annex 1” in UN language) countries would then have been distributed to poorer nations to meet their adaptation costs or fund local mitigation actions.  The proposal was vetoed and instead turned into the Clean Development Mechanism which allows richer countries to pay poorer ones to reduce emissions on their behalf. In a cunning political move, rather than targeting tougher compliance for richer countries, the solution became to pay poorer countries to comply instead. In reality, the tools that will be used to hold governments to account for their climate commitments will be a combination of public and civil society pressure and the threat of litigation on behalf of those people affected by inaction, of which we have seen an increase in recent years. The Dutch government was subject to the first climate liability case in June 2015, but there have been earlier attempts by affected indigenous groups in the Arctic to bring cases against the US government over its lack of action on climate change. We will likely see more such cases in future. This activism will increase thanks to a growing realisation of the gains to be made from moving rapidly to a lower carbon economy in terms of jobs, competitiveness and energy security. In other words, pressure from below is likely to be the driver of change as much as, if not more than, pressure from above."
"How’s it been for you? Annus horribilis or golden year? We’d love to hear from Upside fans about their 2019: what was the best thing that happened? The funniest thing you witnessed? The very best joke? The most promising dab of progress that you came across? Anything that made it good to feel alive? Email us at the usual address (theupside@theguardian.com). We’ll showcase a sample in next week’s festive edition, the last newsletter of the year. The best email wins a hole punch. For us, the most positive things of 2019 included: • The school strikes and mounting awareness of the climate emergency. • The fact that more people voted in elections than ever before. • The sudden awareness of the power of the tree. • The great progress in the battle against Aids and malaria. • The growing consumer backlash against environmental waste. • The cautious optimism about ketamine as a treatment for psychological disorders. • The numbers of companies successfully experimenting with four-day working weeks. • Upsider responses to our requests for unsung heroes – we will publish this as an alternative honours list between Christmas and new year. As for this week, an eclectic flurry of uplifting journalism, including: • Why Dutch prisons are so empty. Three-minute read. • A room with a view (to a career in journalism). One-minute read. • Young women take over Finnish government. Even shorter. • A new country for the Pacific? Ninety-second read. • The town giving families $500 a month. Two-minute read. The world will be 1C cooler by mid-century than it would have been had ozone-damaging CFCs not been banned under the 1987 Montreal protocol. So it IS possible … Oh, and as pointed out by Beautiful News, everything that kills children is in decline. In a week, a year, a decade of division, kudos to the BBC’s Crossing Divides series, which found 10 reasons why Brits are actually not that divided. We also liked this New York Times piece about people hosting recently released prisoners to give them a stable re-entry into civilian life. Our recent piece on biochar generated a prodigious response from you lot. New Yorker Miguel Hoffman wrote in from El Salvador: Biochar can be a wonderful component to a climate change mitigation program. However, it does not make sense, as some would suggest, to grow, kill and then char trees. So, we ask, what other sources could be pyrolysed and charred? The answer just might be at our fingertips and within reach all over the impoverished world. Throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America, stagnant or semi-stagnant lakes, lagoons, canals and reservoirs have become home to massive and persistent infestations of the beautiful violet flowering plant the floating water hyacinth. Why does it reproduce at such great velocity? Because nature assigned it a double role: to suction every type of contaminant in its midst and to absorb all the carbon dioxide it possibly can. Essentially, its purpose in this world is to decontaminate waterways and decarbonise the atmosphere. Not bad for such a maligned “pest”! There is an added bonus to the water hyacinth. The plant has high levels of cellulose, oils and lipids and low level of lignin. The cellulose, oils and lipids are the components for biofuels. The low level of lignin makes the other components accessible for production of a perfect substitute for fossil fuels. Cyrus Forouhar wrote in on a recently revived laptop: I have an idea for what should be covered: The short lifespan of smartphones and laptops that invariably end up in a tip because manufacturers make it hard, or very expensive, to change batteries and carry out repairs, in the expectation that consumers will throw them away and upgrade to the latest offering. Case in point: I have a five-year-old MacBook that was reborn when Apple fitted a new (and expensive) battery. I am pretty sure that in a few years when I have to change the battery again, I will not be able to find a replacement anywhere and a perfectly good machine will end up in a council dump, a huge and unnecessary waste of materials and resources. We need to dramatically slow down strip mining the planet to produce new shiny gadgets. And Bev Colgan from the western US got in touch early with her Christmas wish: Hello Upside Santa, What I would like from you this year is to free up a few elves to start a project that gives low- or no-cost loans and knowhow to people in working-class neighbourhoods like mine for little solar projects. We have so much sun out here in the western US! And here in my neighbourhood are plenty of people who have the skills to build a solar car port to charge an electric car, or install a few solar panels to heat a garage/workshop in the winter, or put in an a solar-powered attic exhaust fan. But they, and I, don’t have the extra couple thousand bucks to pay for materials, or any clue, really, about how to successfully set about it. And most of my neighbours believe that solar is very expensive and only for the rich people. I’d love for your elves to do a successful pilot project and then watch the ripple effect. Saving the planet – and money – is always good news. Finally, Dieter Lehmkuhl wrote in from Berlin: I just read your article Good company: the capitalists putting purpose ahead of profit. Maybe you also might want to cover, if you haven’t done yet, the economy of the common good (Gemeinwohl-Ökonomie), which is a concept worthwhile to consider as an ethical and sustainable business. At the Bridge Builder Awards, which doled out $1m in seed funding for ideas to help refugees and displaced people.

"The new Conservative government must urgently bring forward plans to fulfil its pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 or risk losing the fight against climate breakdown, green campaigners have urged. Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the Tory manifesto was “full of holes” on the environment and had been judged inadequate by green groups, and people would expect swift action.  “The weight of responsibility and growing public concern now rests on Boris Johnson’s shoulders to ensure the UK rises to the challenge, fights for climate justice and shows real leadership,” she said. “The next five years are make or break for the climate and nature emergencies, so we expect the new government to immediately roll out bold commitments to tackle the challenge. This should start with a climate emergency budget to pledge at least 5% government spending per year to deliver a fairer and greener economy for all.” Climate breakdown was one of the top concerns of younger voters during the election campaign, and Labour made it the centrepiece of its “green industrial revolution” pledge to voters. Environmental issues did not figure highly in the Tory manifesto, and Boris Johnson refused to attend a televised debate on the climate crisis, but the party remains committed to the 2050 target set as one of the last acts of Theresa May’s administration. In a Brexit-dominated election, climate concerns appear not to have been decisive in the crucial battlegrounds of the north of England and the Midlands. The Green party enjoyed an unexpected surge, with about 850,000 votes across the country compared with 300,000 in 2017, though it was still left with only one MP, Caroline Lucas, who increased her majority in Brighton Pavilion. In some key marginals, Green voters made a clear difference to the result. Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, held on to her Chipping Barnet seat against a Labour challenge by a margin smaller than the number of votes cast for the Green party candidate. Siân Berry, one of the Greens’ co-leaders, said: “The Green party piled on votes because this was a climate election – we set the agenda and we won the argument on massive investment in a green new deal. If Boris Johnson wants to unlock Britain’s potential, he must flood every region of this country with investment to kickstart a renewables revolution, retrofit millions of homes and build up decent local transport. We haven’t got five more years to waste.” Nick Molho, the chief executive of the Aldersgate Group of green companies, said businesses were eager for the government to quickly come up with detailed plans for the environment. “Businesses want the government to hit the ground running in 2020, with urgent policy decisions needed on the environmental and climate agenda,” he said. “Key priorities should include putting together credible plans to deliver and fund the net zero transition, and introducing an ambitious environment bill to safeguard the proper enforcement of environmental law and introduce legally binding environmental improvement targets.” Among the few green pledges in the Tory manifesto was a promise to spend more than £9bn on insulating and retrofitting homes and buildings to high environmental standards, and to encourage take-up of electric vehicles. Analysis before the election found that the record of the last three Tory and Tory-led governments since 2010 was patchy, with reversals on key policies such as renewable energy, support for electric cars and insulation. For international observers at the final day of the UN climate talks in Madrid, Johnson’s landslide victory cleared the way for the UK’s presidency of the COP26 talks scheduled for next November in Glasgow. There, the world will decide on the future of the Paris agreement and countries will be expected to come up with strengthened targets on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with scientific warnings. As host, the UK government will play a key role in the success or failure of the talks, and experts said behind-the-scenes diplomacy must begin in earnest now. “We saw in Paris that the degree of success depends very much on the presidency [of the host nation],” Nat Keohane, a senior vice-president at the US-based Environmental Defense Fund, told the Guardian. “The UK needs to being doing a full-court press on diplomacy right now to make this a success.” Tom Burke, the chair of the UK-based E3G environmental group, said: “Having just reaffirmed Britain’s commitment to climate change, the prime minister is now going to have to make a global success of COP26, and that will make for an interesting conversation with President Trump [who is withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement]. “This means he will need to put a minister with real political weight in charge of the preparations. Given the size of his majority, he will have no excuses if his government fails to deliver on its environmental promises.”"
"We are all aware that a number of controversies surround the concept of climate change. But if we put the possible causes to one side, there is a general scientific consensus that the climate is changing. A changing climate might, obviously, have a significant impact on us all but in a world of differing environments and, indeed, of inequalities, some societies seem set to be adversely affected more than others. As a means of representing those countries which may be more disproportionately affected, a block of 20 of these vulnerable countries has been formed: the “vulnerable20”, or “V20”. In this block, are countries that you might expect, such as the low-lying Pacific island states of Vanuatu and Tuvalu, but others may come as more of a surprise, including Bangladesh, Ethiopia and the Philippines. This demonstrates that the effects of climate change are both complex and far-reaching, so let’s look at some potential, lesser-known problems we have in store. With a warming climate, we can expect rising seas as the ice caps in the Arctic and Antarctic regions begin to melt. This stands to affect all low-lying regions of the globe without prejudice: from London, Amsterdam and Miami, to the precariously positioned Pacific Ocean atoll states.  But one country that may be overlooked in this context is Bangladesh, the nation ranked number one in the 2015 Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI).  This country of 168m people is located on the fertile but low-lying Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. Annual floods are normal here during the monsoon seasons but, with rising oceans, scientists fear that whole swathes of the country (up to 17%) may be permanently inundated by 2050, forcing the displacement of 18m people and causing the destruction of the country’s prime agricultural regions.  Rising sea levels also will certainly affect many of the world’s low-lying island nations – and those of the Pacific have been particularly vocal in their concerns of the potential impacts. But while we shouldn’t in any way belittle the justifiable concerns of these nations, some recent studies actually suggest that rather than being engulfed by a rising Pacific, the underlying coral of many reef islands – and the rubble they produce – actually appears to adjust to the prevailing conditions, including the possibility that they may adjust to a rise in sea level.  Where problems are more likely, however, are on the more heavily developed reef islands, such as Malé, the capital city of the Indian Ocean state of the Maldives and an island in its own right. There, urbanisation has led to the construction of artificial sea defences, including piers and harbours, which prevent the natural processes of coral growth, rubble accumulation and consequent island adaptation, arguably making this the most vulnerable reef island. Fortunately, urbanised reef islands are the exception and not the rule. There have been conflicting findings over recent years, but a number of studies have attempted to demonstrate that with a warming climate, storm patterns and frequencies are changing, too. One hurricane study, for example, shows that while we don’t seem to be experiencing any real increase in the overall number of storms, we are seeing more hurricanes in the the most intense and destructive categories, that is in the four and five categories.  The cause of these observations appears to be higher sea-surface temperatures (anything above 27°C) which aid the development of hurricanes and tropical storms. Countries at risk from these potential superstorms include those which border the Caribbean and those within the tropics, particularly in the Pacific Ocean.  The Philippines is one such vulnerable country, ranked eight in the CCVI, partly as a result of this potential climatic impact but augmented by inequality and a perceived lack of governmental capacity for climate change adaptation.  One irony of a warming climate is that it also acts as a double-edged sword in terms of how it affects global precipitation patterns. Over recent decades, for example, rainfall in the drought-prone region of the Sahel in Africa has increased by 10% over the past few decades. This appears to be good news for the region, and models suggest this trend will continue if the climate continues to change. But too much rain may also be a problem, potentially leading to flooding and the associated problems of displaced people and water-borne disease, so we cannot see climate change as a purely good thing for Africa.  In contrast, other parts of the world, such as California, are experiencing severe droughts which are predicted to intensify if global warming continues. It is also important to remember the possible relationship between climate change and tectonic activity. It is well-established that the construction of dams has, in the past, stimulated earthquake activity, a result of their heavy mass destabilising faults while providing plentiful water for lubrication of the underlying fault systems, allowing them to move more freely. The weight and lubricating properties of water have been attributed to earthquakes throughout the globe and even to the recent devastating earthquake in Nepal. Researchers have suggested that the redistribution of weight on the Earth’s surface as ice melts, oceans deepen and rainfall increases, may all add up to an increased seismic risk globally; indeed, seasonal earthquake patterns associated with monsoon rains have been noted. No one can predict what the full implications of climate change may be, but all the evidence points to a more hazardous world, a world of new interrelations that we cannot hope to understand – perhaps not until it is too late.  Some parts of the world may get off lightly, others may bear the brunt of the impact; the key will be adapting to these changes and, unfortunately, it is likely to be the most vulnerable places that are least able to evolve in time."
"Joyce Quin is right to draw attention to the links between trade agreements and responding to the climate crisis (Letters, 7 December). But the link goes way beyond the advantages of trading closer rather than more distantly. As the climate emergency grows more serious, the world’s nations will at last start having to make real choices about whether to respond seriously to the challenge. Those that do will be faced with the urgent dilemma of how to deal with those that don’t.  Lord Stern’s hope that all states would be amenable to rational analysis and persuasion seems to have proved overoptimistic. Thus the only real option (excluding military action for obvious reasons) will be to refuse to trade with those states that are unwilling to face their responsibilities, except in those sectors that are not damaging to the climate. There is some logic to this in that the economic policies and models of the states that are most hostile to effective emergency measures are also to a large extent those contributing most to climate change. Seriously damaging these economies would be brutal – but the alternative is even worse. The issue for the UK is where are we going to be when this choice has to be made. John HarwoodWoodstock, Oxfordshire • Adults need to stop telling Greta Thunberg how inspirational they find her and how wonderful she is (Thunberg, 16, is youngest ever recipient of Time person of the year, 12 December) and start apologising for not having done more themselves about climate change over the past three decades.Neil SinclairEdinburgh • The teachers who have left the classroom for Extinction Rebellion (‘Schools feed the problem’: Why Mr Jones rebelled against climate emergency inaction, 10 December) may feel that schools fail to teach about the ecological emergency, and they voice concerns about a lack of progress in relation to social mobility and climate change. However, they should be heartened to know that geography – the GCSE subject that teaches about climate change, ecosystems, biodiversity and resource management – is gaining more and more traction with young people from all backgrounds. Since 2010 this subject has experienced year-on-year growth, which has come disproportionately from disadvantaged pupils, black, Asian and minority ethnic pupils and those studying in comprehensive schools. Studying geography helps young people better understand the interdependencies between people, the environment and places – be they at the local or global scale. In this way, it is a subject that helps young people, regardless of background, discover the truth about our world and the environmental challenges we face.Steve BraceHead of education and outdoor learning, Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) • Re your article (Climate threat from Europe’s shipping emissions revealed, 10 December), a couple of months ago villagers of Shotley, a Suffolk village across the River Orwell from Felixstowe container port, questioned why the village was placed in a list of the top 10 unhealthiest places to live in the UK, with air pollution among the factors taken into consideration. I presume a sizable portion of pollution affecting Shotley is produced while ships run their oil-burning generators continuously while berthed. Would one way of reducing pollution be to provide quayside stations to which each ship has to connect a cable to draw mains electricity? The North Sea off the Suffolk and Essex coast is home to wind generation, with more to come. The more environmentally aware and cost-conscious shipping operators are using liquefied natural gas instead of oil for propulsion. A small number are trialling wind turbines mounted on deck for secondary propulsion. Why not stop using oil-generated power while berthed?Alan FrostHarwich, Essex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman flagship ARD public television recently broadcast a report on Germany’s Energiewende called: “The Battle Over Wind Turbines”
Meet the Schmidt’s in northern Germany. The family, like many Germans, once welcome wind turbines and viewed them as a responsible way to produce energy in an environmentally and climate friendly way. Today the ARD reports that they have long changed their minds ever since their home has since become surrounded by industrial wind parks in all directions. “They no longer recognize their landscape.”
They are the victims of a corrupt but powerful industry.

Industrial wind turbines litter Germany’s countryside, transforming it into a vast eyesore. Image cropped from ARD report here.
According to the ARD, wind park developers are simply steamrolling over local residents who oppose them, and installing the giant machines less than a few hundred meters away from homes, and many natural places where they don’t belong.
And even though there is no longer a demand for wind power in northern Germany, windparks continue to be built. Often turbines are shut down so as to not overload the grid (but they get paid no matter if they run or not – which is why they keep getting built).
At the 4-minute mark, one community in south Germany (Erlangen) actually installed wind turbines where there is not even enough wind for them to make a profit. Here the message of being “green” (and making easy money at consumers’ expense) trumps common sense. The madness knows no end. And there are plans to build even more in the area.
“Dirty business with clean energy”
With all the madness, the ARD reporter says at the 5:30 mark that it’s no wonder that trust in wind parks is disappearing in Germany. Another problem, the report states, is that often wind parks are approved by politician’s who have a direct interest and business dealings in them, meaning the industry is rampant crony capitalism – the very kind that Germans are typically famous for opposing. For example Rannungen mayor Fridolin Zehner had a wind turbine built where none is supposed to be built – on his own land – thus allowing the honorable mayor to cash in on lucrative leasing fees – to the tune of 10,000 euros annually.
The same type of sweet deal was worked out by town councilman Egon Sendelbach in Urspringen. Germany-wide local politicians and twoncouncilmen are profiteering from windparks at the full expense of the citizens and the common good. Sendelbach tells ARD he has no problems with it.
An ARD investigation uncovered that dozens of communities across Germany are seeing local politicians profiteering from dubious wind park permitting. According to law professor Michael Frey:
Research shows that we have a massive problem with the help-yourself” mentality when it comes to the zoning of wind parks. Many mayors and town councils vote in a way where they themselves profit. The extent of the problem is frightening and is nationwide.”
ARD calls it the “dirty business with clean energy.”
Environmental protection sold out

Back to northern Germany, the ARD focusses on the required setback distances from residential homes. That distance varies from state to state. Unfortunately in the Friesian region of Germany, wind parks can be built “right up close” to homes. Here the report features one family that is no longer able to sleep well at night due to the noise of the nearby turbines. Some wind turbines are even being installed in the middle of forests, which leads the ARD to ask “What’s with environmental protection?”
Germany’s leading environmental group BUND “loses its credibility”
Harry Neumann is a former head of BUND, one of Germany’s leading environmental protection groups. However he left the organization in protest, telling that the BUND is completely in bed with the wind industry, with top BUND officials even directly involved in the wind industry lobby. The depth and scale of the conflicts of interest and downright corruption is stunning. Former BUND member Stephan Schlitz: “In my eyes, the BUND has lost its credibility as an environmental organization.”
Former BUND founder Enoch zu Guttenberg, now one of Germany’s most vocal critics of the wind industry, says the wind lobby and the BUND are practically the same. He tells the ARD they’ve gone from being the lawyer for nature, to being the lawyer for the wind industry. “For nature it’s a catastrophe.”
Consumers can no longer afford electricity
At the 20-minute mark, the ARD focusses on who ends up paying for the wind energy bonanza: the struggling consumers (like Nina Albig) who are seeing their electric bills skyrocket.
Albig has seen her electric bill double since 2008 and is no longer able to afford it. Now the power company is threatening to cut her power off. Like so many other Germans who used to support rescuing the climate, she is “having doubts about the Energiewende“.
Paid demonstrators
But Germany’s Green Party refuses to believe any of it. In Berlin the Greens and the wind industry loudly protested the government’s recent plans to scale back the wind energy subsidies and support. Green Fraction Chairman Anton Hofreiter bellowed at the rally:
We need the wind turbines in order to save the foundations of our life, to rescue this planet, and our children!”
Increasingly persons like Hofreiter are finally beginning to be depicted by the ARD and Germany’s once ultra-green media as the charlatans of yesterday, still peddling snake oil that has long lost its magic.
It turns out that at the protest rally in Berlin most of the protesters who showed up were wind industry workers who were paid a day’s wages to show up – travel and accommodation costs included. Also speaking at the rally was the BUND itself.
Top CDU politician Michael Fuchs sums it up on the wind industry lobby:
It’s all about massive business interests. Totally massive business interests. Never have I experienced from any other lobby such a brutal approach, that parliamentarians have been pressured so much because of personal interests.”
Germany’s once loved wind industry is now looking more and more like a hated villain.

"An author of an international report that found Australia was ranked last or near last on a range of climate change measures has rejected Scott Morrison’s claim their work is not credible, saying the assessment was based on scientific criteria and official data. Germanwatch, a non-government organisation and one of the authors of the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index, said the rankings were developed using an independent monitoring tool that had a detailed and transparent methodology. The tool looks at national climate action across greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, energy use and policy. Australia was ranked as sixth-worst of 57 countries across the four categories. At a press conference on Thursday, Morrison said he completely rejected the index. Asked why, he said: “I don’t think it’s credible.” In a statement, Ursula Hagen, a policy adviser with Germanwatch, rejected Morrison’s rejection. She said the index had been published since 2005 and was an independent monitor of climate protection performance. It used standardised scientific criteria and drew on official statistics for 12 of its 14 indicators. She said experts, including from Australian non-government and environmental organisations, found the country’s performance had declined at both national and international level since the election.  “Experts observe a lack of progress to reduce the country’s very high level of emissions,” she said. “With greenhouse gas per capita emissions of 21.1 tonnes, Australia ranks last for the indicator on current levels in the greenhouse gas emissions category. Further, experts observe that the government is playing an increasingly regressive force in international negotiations.” The report was published to coincide with the UN climate conference in Madrid. With one scheduled day of negotiations to go, observers doubted the conference would lead to agreement on the rulebook for the Paris agreement and expected negotiations to drag into the weekend. At dispute is what is known as Article 6, which governs the use of carbon markets. Australia is fighting to remove from the text a proposed ban on the use of carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol. At least 100 countries support a ban. An analysis by science and policy institute Climate Analytics found there was no legal basis to use Kyoto protocol credits under the Paris agreement as they were separate treaties. It found neither deal included wording to suggest they should be linked. Officials told Senate estimates earlier this year that Australia was the only country planning to use them. Australia strongly opposes a ban and has factored in 411m tonnes of credits, which it describes as “overachievement”, as necessary for it to meet its Paris commitment. The Climate Analytics report, commissioned by the Australia Institute, said Australia’s claim to carryover credits was linked to Australia having massive emissions from deforestation in 1990, the year against which targets under the Kyoto deal are measured. Deforestation declined markedly in the years that followed, allowing Australia to increase fossil fuel emissions and still beat its first Kyoto target. The report says it would be perverse for Australia to be rewarded in 2030 for the existence of large-scale deforestation four decades earlier. It says the credits also resulted from Australia’s decision to give itself targets that were far less ambitious than other countries: an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2010, and what was equivalent to just a 0.5% cut below 1990 and 2020 (expressed as a 5% cut below 2000 levels). The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, left the conference on Wednesday, leaving negotiations to a delegation of officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade led by environment ambassador Jamie Isbister."
"The government’s cavalier approach to energy policy as it continually lunges from one policy on renewables to another, sometimes without any consultation, has cost investors in this sector dearly, led to more than 1,000 job losses. These were the investors and businesses that took the previous government at its word that the UK was on a low-carbon trajectory; they will now feel like mugs. How much more will the government – the taxpayer – have to pay in order to persuade a new cohort of investors to invest in renewables, when history shows them that any current policy could be torn up at a moment’s notice and previous investors who took it seriously hung out to dry? The government claims that it wishes to meet our statutory carbon reduction commitments in the most cost-effective way – an aim that most people would sign up to. So it seems bizarre that almost every energy policy announcement the government has made since the election has gone against that objective. The cheapest low-carbon electricity generation options are onshore wind, solar power and biomass, so you might have expected these to be first in line for support. You would be wrong. Support for onshore wind has been cut, with changes to the planning system making it harder to bring in new developments. The renewables obligation support mechanism, one of the main support schemes for large-scale solar and biomass projects is being closed a year early. An 87% subsidy reduction for small-scale solar is also being floated.  The government is even removing tax credits for community energy, which since 2010 have received a mere £7.4m to support 38 projects, a sum that has helped leverage a further £50m in private investment. Finally, without any kind of consultation, the government has removed the tax exemption for renewables, from the Climate Change Levy.  In the same breath the government has re-affirmed eye-watering subsidies to build the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C, and thrown in some investment guarantees for Chinese investors for good measure. The 35 years over which these subsidies will run will cost the electricity consumer far, far more than a continuation of the previous renewables policy. It will probably come to be seen as one of the biggest publicly-backed investment mistakes of the first quarter of this century, just as the last nuclear power programme was described by Dieter Helm, one of Britain’s leading energy economists, as “probably one of the biggest investment mistakes since the Second World War”. Amber Rudd, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, recently announced that coal-fired power stations will be phased out by 2025, to be replaced by gas-fired stations. No one will mourn the loss of coal stations, the dirtiest way to generate electricity, but their replacement by a new fleet of gas stations raises real questions about the government’s commitment to the UK’s carbon targets.  Those investing in new gas power stations will expect to be able to run them all the time, or given special payments not to so that they’re still available to cover any short periods when they are required to back up real low-carbon energy such as renewables. If lots of new stations do run all the time, then we will certainly not meet our carbon reduction targets – neither in the most cost-effective way, nor at all. All the research through the UK Energy Research Centre and elsewhere suggests that this will require UK electricity generation to be almost carbon-free (shrinking from 500 grammes CO2 per kWh to 50-100 grammes CO2 per kWh) by 2030. Perhaps most worrying about this cavalier approach is the effect it has had on businesses and investors. So why is the government behaving like this, you might ask. The only explanation I can come up with is that it has very little commitment to the UK’s carbon targets and an ideological hatred of renewables – ironic, given that polls show renewables to be the favourite energy source of the people the government is supposed to represent.  Just when renewables are becoming the energy technology of choice worldwide, and with governments due to assemble in Paris in a few weeks for the COP21 climate talks to (hopefully) discuss seriously what steps to take to avoid climate change, the UK government dresses up its ideologically-driven extravagant spending on nuclear power over renewables as a concern for the energy bills of “hard-working families”. You couldn’t make it up."
"A growing number of governments, including of every Australian state, Britain and the European Union, have set targets of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Few have mapped how to get there. It is a similar story in the corporate sector. Businesses are under increasing pressure from investors and shareholders to back up claims they are committed to the goals of the Paris agreement. Take BHP, one of the world’s 20 big emitters: it has set a mid-century net-zero emissions target but is yet to explain how it will reach it, and plans to invest more in oil and gas than climate solutions.  Martijn Wilder, long-time head of Baker & McKenzie’s global climate law and sustainable-finance practice and a founding board member of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, has seen up close the divide between the decision-making that goes into setting targets and establishing rules at United Nations climate talks and that drives spending decisions. Having moved in both diplomatic and investment circles, he found people in each who wanted to tackle the climate crisis but had little comprehension of how the other worked. The gap prompted him to leave a guaranteed stable future at the law firm, where he spent two decades, to set up Pollination, an ambitious – and, he and fellow founder Tony O’Sullivan say, unique – global climate advisory and investment firm. They say they will work across five areas: infrastructure investment, merchant banking, venture capital, non-profit work and an advisory arm. Two months after starting operation, the client list of their advisory business includes BHP, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, New Zealand’s a2 Milk Company and the NSW government. Wilder says the firm’s goals are to bring together experts who can break down barriers to the transition to a clean future, and redirect capital that has been committed but not to climate solutions. “Climate change is the central issue of our generation, but we’ve got this funding problem,” he says. “Families don’t know where to go [with their money], big investment funds can only write cheques of $1bn – what do you do with that? – and governments either don’t want to invest or it takes a lot of time, and are often restricted by legal barriers.” Beyond infrastructure, they say they want to back investments that protect natural capital and water security. Wilder says creating markets for climate adaptation and resilience will require coming up with financial solutions that could, for example, protect a reef or a mangrove, support a new technology that improves soil fertility or better manage water use. He says an increasing number of corporate players are talking about the climate emergency, but not moving quickly enough. Referring to the work of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD), a global body that aims to highlight companies’ exposure to risks related to the climate crisis, Wilder says many companies are attempting what he describes as “TCFD light” – acknowledging the issue, not yet matching it with action. But he believes the movement is in the right direction and picking up pace. “Any board anywhere in the world that thinks in 2019 that it should not be assessing climate risk will put its directors at significant exposure,” he says. “It is just no longer tenable for a board not to do that.” O’Sullivan, a former Australian head of investment banking at Lazard, says there is evidence investors, businesses and governments are increasingly turning their mind to what net-zero emissions means, pointing to a warning by the governor of the Bank of England that major corporations have two years to agree to rules for reporting climate risks before global regulators make them compulsory. He says the solution has to be more than “just building another solar farm”. “If you come out, as a lot of governments have done, with a deadline that says, ‘I’ve got 30 years to turn around an economy which has been based on fossil fuels for the last 200 years’, how do you transform an entire economy in that period?” O’Sullivan says from his base in London. “We really feel the advice we’re giving is going to transform governments and corporates.” Pollination’s management team includes Patrick Suckling, who until recently was Australia’s environment ambassador, and Rob Jesudason, the former chief financial officer of the Commonwealth Bank. Senior advisors include Sam Mostyn, chairwoman of Citi Australia, James Cameron, the founder of green merchant bank Climate Capital, and Christof Kutscher, the global chairman of AXA Investment Managers. The firm has offices in Sydney, London, New York, Chicago and Paris. Wilder says they want to extend into Singapore, Tokyo, Mumbai and, eventually, China."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFrank at his German-language blog here makes a good point on the potential and feasibility of renewable electricity storage using lithium batteries, which is supposed to be key to successfully using wind and solar energy.

Satellite images of the Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina (left), and Uyuni, Bolivia (right), salt flats that are rich in lithium. The lithium-rich brine is concentrated by pumping it into solar evaporation ponds (visible in the left image). Photo: NASA (public domain). 
Often proponents of renewable energies such as wind and sun like to claim that the problem can be solved simply by using the common lithium battery packs, similar to those that for example power your electric drill or notebook. They insist that today it’s no problem to install largescale battery storage units for powering homes and businesses whenever wind and solar energy stall, as they often do.
But is it really possible?
Frank asks how many battery powerpacks would be needed to bridge Germany’s entire power supply if the country indeed were running 100% on renewable energy.
In general one has to expect that to bridge over periods with little sun and wind, there would need to be at least three weeks worth of storage capacity to be on the safe side. But to make the calculation simpler, he calculates using the energy storage capacity to bridge over just a single week.

He found that Germany needs about 11.5 TWh (11,500 gigawatt-hours) of electricty each week. Would the current worldwide lithium battery production capacity be able to cover this?
According to Tesla here, total battery capacity production in 2013 was only 34 gigawatt-hours. Rounding the figure up to 35 giganwatt-hours, you would need to increase the global annual production of lithium-ion batteries by some 300-fold just to cover Germany’s power supply for a single week. Or in other words, the current global annual production capacity would be enough to cover Germany’s power demand for a whole 30 minutes!
Globally, an entire year’s production of lithium batteries would supply the global demand for about a single minute. And this is without taking losses from factors such as efficiency and age into account.
Of course today’s global production of storage batteries is higher than it was in 2013, and their efficiencies are probably higher as well. But the difference amounts only to a few extra seconds or minutes.
Powering the entire globe for any significant time with batteries would require boosting current production capacity by far over a thousand-fold. Mining the lithium needed to produce such a massive amount would pose major challenges. Time to sober up, people.
Naturally there are applications where using wind and sun makes perfectly good sense. But trying to power the entire global economy with them is lunacy. Why dig up the planet to extract lithium for inefficient, indirect energy production when you can just dig coal and get great quantities of energy quickly and directly?

"We’re here to reveal another side to “nature, red in tooth and claw”. Predators are commonly perceived as being ferocious successful hunters and their prey as having little or no chance of survival once the hunt is on. The truth however, is that hunts often fail. Even for the most powerful and formidable predators, failure is more common than success. The Hunt, a new OU/BBC series produced by Silverback Films and narrated by David Attenborough, looks at different habitats and the challenges each presents to both predators and prey. The show highlights how wild animals can only be understood by considering the habitat in which they evolved. While stealth, ingenuity or camouflage may work in one environment, stamina, strength or speed may be needed in another. Both predators and prey are caught up in an “evolutionary arms race” where over time predators evolve traits that make them better hunters and prey evolve more effective defenses to evade capture, and so on. So, for an antelope that relies on speed and agility to avoid capture, only the fastest, most agile survive but the same also applies to their predators.  The upshot is that both predator and prey become better adapted, but neither attain a significant survival advantage over the other. As the Queen said to Alice in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: “It takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place”. This is known as the Red Queen hypothesis: organisms constantly evolve to keep up with their opponents who themselves evolve in response.    The series, which we worked on as academic consultants, captures hunting behaviour that has not been filmed and in some cases not even seen before: polar bears climbing 300 metres up a cliff in search of chicks and eggs; Darwin’s bark spider, only described in 2010, constructing a web by spraying a strand of silk 25 metres across a river to serve as a bridging line from which the web is hung (the silk is ten times stronger than Kevlar, the material used in bullet-proof jackets); and footage of Arctic foxes leaping vertically into the air, plucking auks out of the sky. The series’ “car chase” footage of African wild dogs, achieved using gyro-stabilised camera mounted on a vehicle, puts you alongside the pack as they hunt. It illustrates why they are the most successful hunters on the plains and can bring down prey ten times their size: they hunt in co-ordinated packs led by a dominant individual and have immense stamina, travelling up to 60 km/h for up to 5 km. Unlike wild dogs who depend on stamina and cooperation, cheetahs are mostly solitary hunters relying on speed and agility. They are recognised as the fastest land mammal on earth. A recent study of naturally hunting cheetahs recorded a male, named Ferrari, at a top speed of 93 km/hr (58 mph).  But in spite of their ability to run incredibly fast, cheetahs rarely hunt at top speed; to be successful, they have to balance pace with the agility needed to catch animals like gazelles that use quick turns as an escape tactic. When going flat out, cheetahs can’t track these turns efficiently. They therefore make a trade off – speed for manoeuvrability – which is a common strategy in biological systems.   The slow motion photography used to film their hunts gives a sense of both nimbleness and speed but also their astounding power – 120 watts per kg of muscle – twice that of greyhounds and four times that of racehorses. Usain Bolt generated just 25 watts/kg during his 100 metre world record. The series also explores the tactics of some smaller, less familiar predators. Jumping spiders of the genus Portia feed on other spiders and display remarkably complex and flexible  hunting behaviour for an animal with a brain made up of just a few neurons.  In fact their capacity to innovate and learn is more reminiscent of dogs and cats. Their hunting behaviour is visually guided and includes aggressive mimicry, a form of deception where, on locating a spider, they manipulate the web by plucking it, imitating a small ensnared insect. Portia can generate an almost unlimited number of signals and adjusts them in response to feedback from prey. In other words, they derive signals through trial and error – problem-solving behaviour you wouldn’t expect from a spider.  If deception doesn’t work Portia switches tactic, planning the route to its prey and taking detours even when direct paths are available. For example when approaching a spitting spider they approach from the rear even if this means going out of their way. But even this behaviour is flexible, as spitting spiders that are carrying eggs and cannot spit are approached head on. Making pre-planned detours when hunting prey is the sort of sophisticated behaviour you see in lions; it seems by making best use of limited brain resources a small spider can achieve a predatory strategy that rivals that of a large mammal. The Hunt makes one acutely aware that many of the animals featured and many others on Earth are under threat because of conflict with humans. The final programme in the series addresses some of the conservation initiatives around the world that recognise many iconic predators are struggling to survive in a world that, for them, is shrinking rapidly.   Co-existing with big predators is possible, but requires commitment, compromise and dedication. Without concerted effort, large iconic predators such as lions, leopards, polar bears and harpy eagles as well as many small but equally important ones, could disappear completely from the wild. The new series presents predators in a refreshing and thought-provoking way – they are not just relentless killers but animals that work hard for a meal, relying on stealth, stamina, speed, ingenuity, cooperation and sometimes just luck. At times, instead of rooting for the hunted, you’ll find yourself cheering on the hunter."

Think about this.
Of course when you place your full faith in them, eventually you get brutally slammed by reality.
Make no mistake, I’m also stunned by Trump’s victory, as yesterday I thought he was a longshot. Yet, the huge crowds he drew at his rallies, clashed with what the polls were saying…like how all that snow we have today isn’t supposed to be there.
I see even sod, in his latest comment, is unable to find an argument to dispute this reality, and so had to seek refuge and consolation in his bed. So it shall be for tens of millions of practicing deniers today.

"Nearly every major aspect of the European economy is to be re-evaluated in light of the imperatives of the climate and ecological emergency, according to sweeping new plans set out by the European commission on Wednesday. The comprehensive nature of the European Green Deal – which encompasses the air we breathe to how food is grown, from how we travel to the buildings we inhabit – was set out in a flurry of documents as Ursula von der Leyen, the new commission president, made her appeal to member states and parliamentarians in Brussels to back the proposals, which would represent the biggest overhaul of policy since the foundation of the modern EU.  Von der Leyen said the package was aimed at economic growth and increasing prosperity. “[This] is our new growth strategy, for a growth that gives back more than it takes away,” she said. “It shows how to transform our way of living and working, of producing and consuming, so that we live healthier [lives] and make our businesses innovate. We will help our economy to be a global leader by moving first and moving fast.” As well as bidding to lead the world on climate action with a proposed target of net-zero carbon by 2050 and halving emissions by 2030, the EU will delve far more deeply into the root problems that contribute to carbon emissions and pollution. For instance, in manufacturing: in previous decades, the EU was content to set targets for recycling rates; under the European Green Deal, regulators would set specific standards on the manufacturing of goods to create a circular economy and phase out unnecessary plastic and other waste before it is created. From 2021, at least 40% of the budget for the common agricultural policy and 30% of fisheries subsidies would be devoted to tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, instead of contributing to higher emissions and environmental degradation, as many of these subsidies do at present. Toxic air and its health impacts would be tackled through tougher air quality requirements, and energy targets would be raised to generate more energy from renewable sources, up to 100% by 2050. More freight would be transported by rail and water, and greenhouse gas emissions from air travel would be reduced. The European Green Deal is the EU’s answer to what the European commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the “existential issue” of the climate emergency. Most EU countries have signed up to goal of a climate neutral EU by 2050, a goal demanding dramatic change in energy use, farming, housing, transport, trade and diplomacy. The European Green Deal is only the start of the journey: laws will have to be drafted and agreed by EU ministers and MEPs; money will have to be raised; plans will have to be implemented. It is a route map, rather than a destination, and time is running out. The emissions reduction target for 2030 was proposed at a level of 50-55%, with a new law enshrining the commitment to net zero carbon for 2050. As an inducement to the member states reluctant to sign up to the 2030 and 2050 targets – Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary – Von der Leyen promised€100bn (£84bn) to help finance the transition to a low-carbon economy, along with the potential for a carbon border tax to be levied on imports to the EU from countries without sufficiently stringent carbon targets of their own. Leaders will discuss the emissions goals when they meet in Brussels at a summit on Thursday, but agreement still appears some way off. Failure to agree a second time, following a previous attempt in June, would be a blow to the EU’s standing at the UN climate talks, now reaching their final days in Madrid. One senior EU official said: “One of the elements that the heads of state and government will have to take into account is the pressure outside the room on this. This is climate week, right. So there might be a deal, there might not be a deal.” The commission will also face a difficult task in gaining full backing for the rest of the package among all member states. As well as those concerned about the carbon targets, there are the powerful agricultural and fishing lobbies in several states with concerns over reforms to the subsidy regime, and industries such as car manufacturing and chemicals that will face new regulations In one indication of the troubles yet to come, the UK on Wednesday joined the Czech Republic and France in blocking a deal on a set of rules governing which financial products can be labelled “green” and “sustainable”. France was concerned that its nuclear industry would lose out from the “taxonomy for sustainable finance”. Negotiations among member states and the European parliament on the green financing proposals are expected to resume on Monday. Green campaigners welcomed the aims of the European Green Deal but called for more detail and higher ambition, including a strengthening of the emissions target to a 65% cut by 2030. Franziska Achterberg, EU spokesperson for Greenpeace, said: “The climate targets [the commission is] proposing would be too little too late. On protecting nature, much is aspirational and needs to be fleshed out. The detailed measures that will follow must tackle the production and consumption patterns that have brought us to the brink.” Some campaigners at the UN climate talks in Madrid also called for the EU to bring forward its international proposals faster, to give more momentum to the push for tougher carbon targets under the Paris agreement. Under the commission’s proposals, the plans could not be formally adopted until next summer, giving only a few months before the crunch 2020 climate conference in Glasgow. Wendel Trio of the Climate Action Network said: “Timing is everything. Now EU member states have a big responsibility to agree on a much higher 2030 climate target at the European Council in June 2020.” “The proposed package is comprehensive, identifying the right areas for action – from biodiversity and nature restoration to climate change and stopping deforestation,” said Ester Asin, director of the European policy office at WWF. “However, by emphasising continued economic growth as a key objective, the commission has missed an opportunity to challenge the traditional growth paradigm in favour of an approach that would respect planetary boundaries.”"

"Paris gives the EU an opportunity to make up for its quiet performance in Copenhagen six years ago, but myriad distractions and a lack of early ambition so far suggest it will settle for facilitating, rather than driving, a serious climate deal. Every country wants to have a clear international identity. And a good one at that. For the past 15 years, the European Union (EU) has wanted others to see it as an environmental pioneer, particularly regarding climate change. But at the Copenhagen talks in 2009 the EU ended up being quietly ignored while the US and China dominated. The Paris climate talks therefore represent a significant challenge. On the one hand, climate change mitigation policy is one of the EU’s favourite topics – and the conference is taking place on home turf, in France. If the EU can find its voice on any issue in the coming 12 months, it is at Paris. On the other hand, Europe is enduring a lingering eurozone crisis, failing to handle the large numbers of Syrian refugees on its doorstep and must acknowledge that other states, such as the US, China and India, are now more important to combating climate change. The recent Volkswagen crisis has also raised eyebrows at the EU’s much-vaunted leadership status. The EU’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) – in non-UN language: “target” – is a commitment to reducing greenhouse gases by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. This target represents one of the biggest reductions goals submitted so far. So why are green groups unhappy with the EU’s goal? The first thing to point out is European countries have been churning out greenhouse gases longer than anywhere else and their economies have benefited as a result. If anywhere has the biggest responsibility to make emissions cuts, it’s Europe. But the EU’s target is unlikely to keep temperature rises below 1.5℃; the threshold suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for preventing significant climate-related dangers. In other words, the target is reasonably ambitious, but it isn’t good enough to start a chain reaction among other countries. The EU also hasn’t been as transparent about its target as it has encouraged other states to be. As part of its INDC, the EU hasn’t stated how it will measure the impact of land use changes and forests – key factors when assessing emissions changes – which raises questions about just how ambitious the 40% target really is. The EU is also different to all other states taking part at the Paris talks, as it is really 28 very different countries acting together. It’s like a miniature version of the UN negotiations as a whole. Poland, for example, has been the main obstacle to tougher EU targets, as it is one of the poorest member states and depends heavily on brown coal. Expecting Poland to become as climate friendly as hydro-powered Sweden is a non-starter. This will effectively limit the EU’s ability to increase its ambition significantly once negotiations begin. Realistically, therefore, the Paris conference is Europe’s chance to facilitate ambition among the key players, rather than an opportunity to make headlines itself. In an ideal (metaphorical) world, the EU will be the creative footballer who makes some great passes, rather than the scorer of the winning goal. With this reality in mind, evidence suggests the EU has allowed environmental ambition to slip down the agenda in recent years, particularly since Jean-Claude Juncker became EU Commission president  in 2014. Juncker and his Commission are prioritising jobs and growth in a bid to restore confidence among increasingly eurosceptic member states. Meanwhile, the climate brief within the EC has been merged with energy, and located under a new vice-president for Energy Union. Energy security, not climate change, appears to be the priority. While the EU has produced incrementally larger targets in the run-up to Paris, it has not ramped up its climate ambition significantly. At the conference, poorer EU members will be reluctant to make bigger reductions unless they feel confident other states are making significant changes too. For the EU to be happy with the Paris agreement, it needs other heavyweights – China, the US and India – to make big promises. And it needs to be seen as helping to make those states more ambitious, too, if it’s going to reclaim its status as an important global actor on climate change."

Share this...FacebookTwitterChief Editor of ‘Science’ criticizes activism by climate scientists: PIK needs to define red line for employees
By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Luning
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The well-known journal ‘Science’ has a new chief editor. Jeremy Berg is a biochemist was among the leadership of the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) in Pennsylvania. Since July 1, 2016 he has been in charge of Science. At the website ‘Times Higher Education‘ Berg complained about a massive loss of trust the public has had with respect to science. In Berg’s opinion, climate scientists bear part of the blame because they’ve step over the line and made themselves vulnerable to attacks through their political lobby work. The Times article quotes Berg as follows:
But researchers are not entirely blameless for this rising hostility, thinks Berg. Too often they have gone beyond explaining the scientific situation and ventured into policy prescriptions, notably in the case of climate change, he thinks. ‘The policy issues should be informed by science, but they are separate questions,’ he says. ‘Scientists to some degree, intentionally or otherwise, have been mashing the two together,’ he adds, and urges scientists to be more ‘transparent’ about ‘where the firmness of your conclusions end’.”
The criticism of course is also aimed at Potsdam, where the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) was especially founded for that very purpose: to mix science and politics. A terrible structural error that the current German government vehemently ignores. Are they really able to just simply skip over the advisories coming from the “Scientific Champions League”?
It is indeed strange that the PIK, despite all its scientific errors, gaffes and blunders, can be showered with awards and prizes. A “thank you” for the political legwork for Germany’s precarious Energiewende?

"Some 22 groups representing health and medical professionals in Australia have issued a joint call to act on a “public health emergency” caused by smoke from the catastrophic bushfire season in New South Wales. In Sydney and others areas of NSW communities have been exposed to air pollution up to 11 times worse than “hazardous” levels. The group has produced a joint statement calling for political leadership while repeating a call for a national strategy to combat the health impacts of climate change. Dr Kate Charlesworth, a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, which signed the statement, said: “Climate-related health effects are having the most impact on our most vulnerable: babies, children, the elderly and people with pre-existing disease. There is no safe level of air pollution.” “To protect health, we need to shift rapidly away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner, healthier and safer forms of energy.” Among the 22 groups that signed the statement are the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine, Public Health Association of Australia, Australian College of Nursing, Australian Association of Social Workers and Lung Foundation Australia. The statement says the federal and NSW governments must “prioritise action to help reduce the risks to people’s health arising from hazardous air pollution”. Fiona Armstrong, executive of the Climate and Health Alliance, said: “This is a public health emergency.” She added: “Climate change is going to get much worse and we will see more and more of these events.” Dr Lai Heng Foong, of Doctors for the Environment Australia, which has also signed the statement, said: “Pollution from bushfire smoke remains hazardous to people, in the short term and also the long-term.”  Many of the groups that have signed the statement are also pushing for Australia to respond to the health impacts of climate change. Mark Brooke, CEO of Lung Foundation Australia CEO, said a national strategy was needed. “Climate change and air quality significantly contribute to poor lung health, increased health and economic burden, disability and death,” he said. “If we want to prevent the worst air pollution from bushfire smoke, one of the best things our governments can do, aside from fuel reduction burns, is to set stronger and better standards for everyday air quality.” In August, the Australian Medical Association declared that climate change was a “health emergency”, citing “clear scientific evidence indicating severe impacts for our patients and communities now and into the future.” The AMA called on the Morrison government to help Australia move away from fossil fuels, and to promote the health benefits of cutting greenhouse gas emissions."
"Who needs soil when you have a fish tank? “Aquaponics” combines growing plants in water, or hydroponics, with fish cultivation, or aquaculture. It’s a symbiotic process that has its roots in Asian farming practices reaching back thousands of years. When used well, aquaponics can increase local food production and make communities more resilient – all without creating pollution or using scarce resources, such as oil. It begins with fish poo and pee, both of which contain lots of ammonia. Worms that live in rooting substrates break the solids down and then bacteria convert the ammonia into nitrate, which acts as a fertiliser. The plants absorb the nitrate and effectively filter the water for the fish. By which point the fish will once again need the toilet, and so on. It’s a virtuous circle. The result is high-density food production that works equally well at home or in large industrial warehouses. It’s suitable in urban spaces or on land suffering from drought, pollution or soil depletion that is otherwise difficult to farm. It produces both fish and vegetables, reducing the load on our over-exploited and polluted oceans.  Year-round growing is possible (for indoor systems), and the system is even more water efficient than hydroponics, producing two products using the same water. Fish food is the only major input required, and it’s easier to use bio-controls against pests compared to soil-based agriculture. BBC presenter Kate Humble now runs the Humble by Nature teaching farm on a hill above the Wye valley in Wales. Her team have built a solar greenhouse with three large tanks of tilapia (a hardy, fast-growing fish) and 12 growbeds full of vibrant crops. One of us – Hamish – visited recently. Water is pumped constantly from the tanks into the growbeds, which each contain a clever gizmo called an autosiphon, which drains the bed as soon as it fills right to the top. The plant roots, and the worms and bacteria living under them, live in a continual flood-drain environment, which is very conducive to rapid growth (as demonstrated in various hydroponics systems). The plants soak up the fish waste, and the clean water is pumped back into the fish tanks: The technology is necessarily bio-organic: adding fertilisers or pesticides to the growbeds would soon damage the fish, while feeding the fish antibiotics would harm the plants. In any case, there is less need for agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals since aquaponics means less disease and faster growth. The widespread use of agrochemicals in our current food production makes us less resilient. Most food production is dependent on oil and thus vulnerable to volatile prices, and many inject toxicity into our environment and compromise long-term sustainability.  Aquaponics relies on a continuously balanced ecosystem of fish, veg, bacteria and (sometimes) worms. Sustaining this balance can be complex. Setup costs and energy usage are also an issue, varying according to climate and species of fish (from trout to sturgeon, tilapia to catfish – all have different requirements). Together with colleagues we’re working with recycled materials to bring down costs of construction, and setting up measurement experiments so that we can say exactly what it costs to grow different types of crops in a Sheffield or a London climate, for example. We’re also developing free, open source monitoring and control systems for aquaponics. These aggregate data via the cloud to create virtual communities of growers whose shared experience makes it easier for everyone.  But there’s still lots more to find out. We’re both part of an EU Aquaponics Hub that will try to better understand how fish and veg can work together, and will facilitate innovative ways to produce high-density, high quality and more sustainable food locally. We currently rely on shipping large amounts of food across the world, leaving us remarkably vulnerable to disruption from wars, climate chaos, or volatile oil prices. Growing as much food as possible locally could boost resilience and allow us to start taking more control of what we eat, and reduce the intake of salt, sugar and preservatives, which drive diabetes and heart disease. Aquaponics is a sustainable and intensive alternative to both growing in soil and to hydroponics."
"Chinese president Xi Jinping addressed the opening day of the Paris climate talks as leader of a nation more confident and assertive than it has been at any point since Mao declared it had “stood up” after a century of rebellion and invasion.  The changing status is reflected in the hopes for COP21.  If China was the villain of Copenhagen six years ago, Xi is attempting to portray the country in a different light these days. In Paris he says he wants greater compromise with the West with pledges to cut China’s greenhouse gas emissions, apparently recognising criticism over the country’s green record. However, China will not face such criticism alone. After decades of Maoist isolation, robust diplomacy means a significant number of developing nations are likely to support any motions that China proposes.  China has close ties with a number of African nations, for instance. After he leaves Paris, Xi will head to South Africa, for a summit with African leaders. At the same time, this “Chinese bloc” is not solely confined to Africa. Russia has sought to build closer ties with China in a bid to wean itself off the European market after being hit with sanctions after conflict in Ukraine. This can be seen in the number of trade deals between China and Russia as well as the growing political and military cooperation between the two states.   However, China has also pursued closer relations with a number of former Soviet states in what was traditionally viewed as Russia’s sphere of influence. Indeed, these states, most notably Kazakhstan, have viewed China as a possible balance to Russian ambitions in the region, as shown by Sinopec’s recent agreement to invest in Kazakh oil and gas.  These nations are scattered about the world but there are a number of common linkages. Many are rich in oil, gas, fertile farmland or other natural resources. Where Chinese foreign policy was once dominated by the simple pursuit of recognition, these days its diplomatic offensives are often motivated by a desire to control natural resources in order to fuel economic progress. In return for control of these resources, China provides development assistance and technical know how, most notably seen in the boom in infrastructure projects throughout Africa.  On the other hand, China provides Russia with an alternative market for its oil and gas as well as a source of trade deals favourable to China.       Many of China’s allies are also are governed by long-standing regimes such as Mugabe’s in Zimbabwe, the ANC in South Africa or Putin’s United Russia party without an obvious successor to their veteran leadership. Should these regimes be replaced, China’s relations with its allies could rapidly change. A certain hostility to the West is possibly the most controversial linkage between China’s allies, which in turn has led hawks to believe that the Chinese faction is anti-Western. After all, this bloc emerged at the same time as talk of the market-friendly “Washington Consensus” in international finance being replaced by a “Beijing Consensus” based on the Chinese economic model, along with the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, an Asian counterbalance to the EU, US and NATO. These international alliances put president Xi in a potentially formidable position in the Paris talks, and a degree of Chinese support will be necessary for any proposed motion to succeed.  However, at the same time, Xi perhaps has more power to make any changes and accommodate Western motions than his predecessor Hu had at Copenhagen.  This is China breaking with the status quo and playing a more integral global role. In Mao’s words, China has not just stood up, it stands tall."

Yes, it is great to be part of a “family” of dedicated men and women who are willing to sacrifice time and money to perform essential services. We are proud to be volunteers. But there are limits! There is a public perception that firefighting is heroic, but in reality, standing in front of a wall of fire armed with a hose is something firefighters try to avoid. Most firefighting is just bloody hard work, and often boring. Back-burning, blacking out, raking firebreaks, patrolling through the night, sitting around waiting to be tasked by an overwhelmed IMT, working 17 hour shifts without a break or food because the shit is hitting the fan, getting home at 1am only to be called out again at 4am to a non-existent fire because the community is on edge, extinguishing barbecues during total fire bans, false alarms. This is the reality of being a firefighter. We are proud to be volunteers. But there are limits! And then there are the unsung heroes, our families. The ones who worry if we will come home. The ones we leave to fend for themselves during severe fire weather. The ones we hardly see for days. The plans cancelled at the last minute. The jobs left undone. The cuppa and hug when we get home. The dirty PPE that is washed while we sleep. The stress that all this can put on even the strongest relationship. They didn’t volunteer for this, but they accept it, year after loyal year. They are proud we are volunteers. But there are limits! One, two, three...six. The weeks are dragging on and still the fires are uncontrolled. It is getting harder and harder to raise crews. People can’t afford the lost time and wages. Even those who are lucky enough to work for employers who continue to pay us during emergencies worry about the impact on our jobs. The stress and tensions increase over time. So the burden of manning the trucks falls increasingly on retired members. If this is the “new normal” then we need a new model. We are proud to be volunteers. But there are limits! We need a new support system that kicks in after certain period of time. Support that allows us to continue to contribute over increasingly long fire seasons. This could include funding so our employers can replace us with casual staff while we continue to be paid. This could include direct payment for the self-employed or unemployed. This could include refunds for daycare and after-school care. This could include laundry and meal allowances for those who live alone and are too exhausted to wash and cook when they arrive home. These are just some ideas, starting points for discussion. Any new system must be carefully designed in consultation with the volunteers, and it must be flexible because we each have different circumstances. But we need something, and soon. We are proud to be volunteers. We want to remain volunteers. But there are limits! Even “heroes” need a safety net.

"With the Paris climate conference taking place, we should be prepared for dissenters to pull out a few hoary old chestnuts to try to undermine the process. “Climate science isn’t settled” is a particular favourite, still repeated by various Republican presidential candidates as an excuse for inaction on global warming. It’s therefore worth remembering that an overwhelming majority of real climate scientists do actually agree on the existence, causes, and approximate magnitude of man-made climate change. Most of those old chestnuts have been laid to rest over and over again. They should be left to rot.  However, that is not to say that every aspect of climate science is completely resolved. Uncertainties remain, and since scientists are the real sceptics we still argue a lot. Here are five questions that are guaranteed to get the experts going: Clouds are tricky because they are patchy, and thus hard to model, and they have strong effects, both cooling (by day) and warming (by night). What’s more, those effects vary with cloud type, altitude, latitude or time of year. To make it worse, what we really want to know is not just how big their net effect is, but how it will change as the climate changes – what is known as a feedback effect. The best estimates we have right now suggest the effect is fairly small, but positive. This means clouds amplify any changes in the climate, however caused, making the overall system rather more sensitive to man-made interference.  It’s something we’d really like to understand much better though, and clouds have been top of the list of uncertainties in climate science for decades. We expect the sea level to rise as the ocean warms, just by regular thermal expansion. That’s the easy bit – and it won’t be all that much, or very fast. But, more significantly, the sea level will eventually also rise increasingly rapidly as land-based ice sheets melt (sea-ice floats and so has no effect if it melts, as Archimedes realised in his bath).  Curiously, we know rather well how much water is locked up in the ice-sheets and so how much the sea level would rise if much of it melted. It’s a lot: it could easily be 10 metres or more. What we don’t know at all well is how fast it’s likely to happen. It matters a lot to us whether it’s centimetres per century or meters per century – and it could be anywhere in between. The biological carbon cycle is another example of a climate feedback effect where any change makes it warmer (or cooler) as it warms, and vice versa. Plants draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere as they photosynthesise, and release it again as they respire or die. This operates both on land and in the sea, and respiration in both is known to be affected by temperature, but it’s less well understood than we would like.  There are very big reservoirs of carbon in both soils and in the oceans, so if they were released by warming more quickly than we think, our projections would be off. Methane locked up in permafrost has been a particular worry, but at present it looks likely that this will be released quite slowly. The ultimate size of these effects is still a moving target, though. We know the oceans are absorbing most of the extra heat from global warming, and much of the extra carbon dioxide that has caused it. However they only do so rather slowly, because the oceans are very deep and both heat and CO2 take a long time to penetrate beneath the surface. Mixing between surface water and the ocean depths is assisted by global “conveyor” currents, but we have good evidence these have varied in the past.  Will climate change cause further variations in future? And if so, by how much? It’s not yet known for sure, because we have too few observations to pin down the models, which disagree about this. We’ll probably see a gradual slow-down rather than the sort of shut-down “tipping point” seen in the movie The Day After Tomorrow – but we still can’t be certain. It’s still not easy to determine exactly how much climate change has been due to human activities and how much is natural. However, clever statistical attribution studies have analysed the “fingerprints” of various processes that may contribute – and these now unambiguously give the answer “most of it”. That’s a sufficient basis for taking action, and getting a more accurate answer would not change the outcome significantly. But it would still be nice to know. These still-to-be-settled issues are some of the main contributors to the uncertainty in our projections for the future. All those processes are included in present-day climate models, as well as we know how: refining them could shift the projections a bit, one way or the other, but is very unlikely to change the basic story.  The other big unknown is of course what we humans will do. Will we carry on burning fossil fuels regardless, or will we actually succeed in kicking the habit and switch to carbon-free sources of energy?  But that’s a societal question – not a scientific one."
"Australia’s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers says the thumping repudiation of Jeremy Corbyn in the British election shows centre-left parties don’t win elections by “preaching” to their base or by projecting a lack of competence on economic management. Chalmers told Sky News on Sunday the main lessons from Labour’s defeat in Britain late last week was “you don’t beat populism of the right with populism of the left” and centre-left parties needed “to build much bigger constituencies of support, and that begins with a bedrock of economic credibility”.  He said the lessons from the British election, and the Australian contest in May, were similar. “It’s self-evident we didn’t build a big enough constituency for change in our own election and our counterparts in the UK similarly – and we need to think long and hard about how we do that.” Chalmers said Labor needed to project to voters it was a safe pair of hands on the economy, and it needed to connect with people “who wanted to get ahead, not just get by”. The shadow treasurer was asked on Sunday about climate change, given Labor was caught between constituencies in the May election, with voters in the cities wanting meaningful action while voters in coal regions were concerned that meaningful action meant an end to their livelihoods. Chalmers did not commit to keeping the same emissions reduction targets Labor took to the election in May, but he said Labor would take a more ambitious policy than the Coalition to the next election. Labor took a 45% emissions reduction target to the May contest, while the government’s 2030 target is a 26% reduction, but after taking the Labor leadership post-election, Anthony Albanese said all of Labor’s election commitments were up for review. The shadow climate change minister Mark Butler told Guardian Australia in September Labor would implement the Paris agreement, look for policies that will keep warming below 2C, move to net zero emissions by 2050 and set medium-term emissions reduction targets “that are consistent with these principles and guided by the best available scientific and economic advice”. Chalmers said climate change was difficult for Labor because “this debate has become unnecessarily polarised, and I think Scott Morrison has fed that, because he is always looking for an excuse not to do anything on climate change”. “We’ll come up with a climate change plan that is more ambitious than the government’s, which takes genuine action, which is mindful of people’s lives and livelihoods, which recognises we can create new jobs in renewable energy without abandoning our traditional strengths,” he said. Asked about his right faction colleague Joel Fitzgibbon’s view that Labor should adopt the same emissions reduction targets at the government, Chalmers said while he “respected” everybody’s views, that wasn’t an option. “My personal view is we can take a more ambitious approach to the election than the government. “I think the government has been twiddling their fingers while Australia has burned, literally,” he said. “I think we need to have a proper conversation about what can be done here because whatever the Morrison government is doing is insufficient to deal with the real challenge we have about climate change in this country.” He said the majority of Australians wanted Labor to listen to experts and to take genuine action on climate change “in a way that is respectful of people’s lives and livelihoods in places like regional Queensland. I think that closely accords with what people want from Canberra”."
"The International Solar Alliance announced by India at the Paris climate conference invites together 120 countries to support the expansion of solar technologies in the developing world. The cost of solar cells has decreased spectacularly over the past four decades, and the trend seems likely to continue. Solar energy has moved from a niche market for providing power in remote places (at the very beginning in 1958 to space satellites) to a mainstream technology which feeds into the national grid. Most richer countries have been supporting solar power for some time and the rest of the world is now catching up, turning to solar not only for energy access in remote areas but to power cities. Emerging countries such as China, India, Brazil, Thailand, South Africa, Morocco or Egypt are investing in large solar plants with ambitious targets. In developing countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya,  Rwanda, Senegal or Ghana, solar farms or the large roll-out of solar home systems are a solution to unreliable and insufficient electricity supplies. Large solar farms can be built in just a few months – compared to several years for a coal plant and even longer for a nuclear plant – without generating massive environmental and health damages. Modular decentralised generation with solar is a way to increase access to energy while still remaining on top of rapidly increasing appetites for electricity. This alliance could boost the solar market in the Global South by accelerating the circulation of knowledge, facilitating technology transfer and securing investments. Such a partnership would aim to create a common culture among people working in solar energy. Permanent innovation is the key to success in a field where technologies evolve fast and where norms and standards are not yet established. So an alliance could help countries exchange policy ideas while benchmarking performance against each other. Indeed in developing countries, where regulations and regimes tend to be less stable, investments suffer from a perceived risk. Given that the initial construction of solar plants makes up most of their cost (sunlight, after all, is free so ongoing expenses are minimal), the business model requires them to run for a long period. High risk means higher costs of financing the initial investment. Countries with well-designed regulatory frameworks and policies can reduce risk and attract investors.    The alliance could also support a network of universities and local research centres in each country to capitalise on local experience and build knowledge. Research and development can then more easily target the specific needs of developing countries.  The intensification of globalisation and competition between technology firms and utilities is sparking a revolution in the electricity sector which could result in a new world of energy providers. A number of countries are keen to position themselves as leaders. For the moment, both China and India want massive investments in solar only on top of further investments in new coal and gas plants. They need to make their growth less carbon intensive – but do not yet consider solar power as a complete substitute for fossil fuels. But renewables accounted for nearly half of all new power generation capacity across the world last year. As the cost of solar power is falling to the same level as traditional energy supplies all over the world, some players in the electricity sector are – willingly or not – shifting away from fossil fuels. The decarbonisation of the electricity sector may be not just an empty political pledge, but an economic necessity."

According to an increasing body of scientific evidence, short-term cooling and ice sheet growth trends like the ones shown above may soon become long-term trends in the coming decades.  As shown recently, there have already been 18 scientific papers published in 2016 indicating that periods with high solar activity (i.e., the 20th/21st century Modern Maximum, the 11th century Medieval Maximum) are associated with centennial-scale warming trends, and periods with low solar activity (the 13th to 19th century Little Ice Age) are associated with centennial-scale cooling trends.
18 New Papers Link High Solar Activity To Medieval And Modern Warmth, Low Solar Activity To Little Ice Age Cooling

Within the last year and a half, there have also been many other papers published in scientific journals indicating that the Earth’s Modern Grand Maximum of high solar activity (which lasted from the early- to mid-20th century to the early 21st century) has recently come to an end, and will soon be replaced by several decades of low solar activity and the concomitant decline in temperatures reaching levels not seen since the Little Ice Age.
Listed below are 10 recently-published scientific papers projecting solar activity minimums and “deep cooling” in the coming decades, especially beginning by about 2030.  These papers would appear to run counter to the viewpoint that the coming decades will be characterized by unprecedented global warming that is dangerous and irreversible unless humans reduce or eliminate their consumption of fossil-fuel energies.
Abdussamatov, 2016
“The quasi-centennial epoch of the new Little Ice Age has started at the end 2015 after the maximum phase of solar cycle 24. The start of a solar grand minimum is anticipated in solar cycle 27 ± 1 in 2043 ± 11 and the beginning of phase of deep cooling in the new Little Ice Age in 2060 ± 11. The gradual weakening of the Gulf Stream leads to stronger cooling in the zone of its action in western Europe and the eastern parts of the United States and Canada. Quasi-bicentennial cyclic variations of TSI together with successive very important influences of the causal feedback effects are the main fundamental causes of corresponding alternations in climate variation from warming to the Little Ice Age.”
Yndestad and Solheim, 2016
“In 1890´s G. Spörer and E. W. Maunder (1890) reported that the solar activity stopped in a period of 70 years from 1645 to 1715. Later a reconstruction of the solar activity confirms the grand minima Maunder (1640-1720), Spörer (1390-1550), Wolf (1270-1340), and the minima Oort (1010-1070) and Dalton (1785-1810) since the year 1000 A.D. (Usoskin et al. 2007). These minimum periods have been associated with less irradiation from the Sun and cold climate periods on Earth. An identification of a three grand Maunder type periods and two Dalton type periods in a period thousand years, indicates that sooner or later there will be a colder climate on Earth from a new Maunder- or Dalton- type period. …. The result shows that the TSI variability and the sunspots variability have deterministic oscillations, controlled by the large planets Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, as the first cause. A deterministic model of TSI [total solar irradiance] variability and sunspot variability confirms the known minimum and grand minimum periods since 1000. From this deterministic model we may expect a new Maunder type sunspot minimum period from about 2018 to 2055. The deterministic model of a TSI ACRIM data series from 1700 computes a new Maunder type grand minimum period from 2015 to 2071. A model of the longer TSI ACRIM data series from 1000 computes a new Dalton to Maunder type minimum irradiation period from 2047 to 2068.”

“Conclusions Based on our results, we propose the use of the Wolf’s Number Oscillation Index (WNOI) – as a more uniform alternative to the ONI – in the range over 30 and below -30. The analysis of the material presented and the arguments discussed allows us to define a possible relationship between phenomena related to Solar Cycle, the ENSO, climatic conditions, as well as some criteria for the establishment of public policies for preservation and remediation of the environment in the long run. We can conclude that solar activity oscillations impact the earth climatic conditions to such a extent that they become measurable only in the long run. The magnitude of the Solar Cycle – from 7 to 17 and a mean of 11.2 years – seems to support this statement. Based on the similarities of the Solar Cycles 5 and 24 we can expect a longer period of cold weather for the years 2022 y/o 2034, corresponding to the Solar Cycles 24 and 25.”
Chiodo et al., 2016
“Solar variability represents a source of uncertainty in the future forcings used in climate model simulations. Current knowledge indicates that a descent of solar activity into an extended minimum state is a possible scenario. With aid of experiments from a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we investigate the impact of a future solar minimum on Northern Hemisphere climate change projections. This scenario is constructed from recent 11 year solar-cycle minima of the solar spectral irradiance, and is therefore more conservative than the ‘grand’ minima employed in some previous modeling studies. Despite the small reduction in total solar irradiance (0.36 W m−2), relatively large responses emerge in the winter Northern Hemisphere, with a reduction in regional-scale projected warming by up to 40%. To identify the origin of the enhanced regional signals, we assess the role of the different mechanisms by performing additional experiments forced only by irradiance changes at different wavelengths of the solar spectrum. We find that a reduction in visible irradiance drives changes in the stationary wave pattern of the North Pacific and sea–ice cover. A decrease in UV irradiance leads to smaller surface signals, although its regional effects are not negligible. These results point to a distinct but additive role of UV and visible irradiance in the Earth’s climate, and stress the need to account for solar forcing as a source of uncertainty in regional scale projections.”
Sanchez-Sesma, 2016
“This empirical modeling of solar recurrent patterns has also provided a consequent multi-millennial-scale experimental forecast, suggesting a solar decreasing trend toward grand (super) minimum conditions for the upcoming period, AD 2050–2250 (AD 3750–4450). … Solar activity (SA) has non-linear characteristics that influence multiple scales in solar processes (Vlahos and Georgoulis, 2004). For instance, millennia-scale solar oscillations have been recently detected, like those of about 6000 and 2400 years, by Xapsos and Burke (2009) and Charvátová (2000), respectively, with important and interesting influences in the near, past and future climate. These millennialscale patterns of reconstructed SA variability could justify epochs of low activity, such as the Maunder minimum, as well as epochs of enhanced activity, such as the current Modern Maximum, and the Medieval maximum in the 12th century.  … We can conclude that the evidence provided is sufficient to justify a complete updating and reviewing of present climate models to better consider these detected natural recurrences and lags in solar processes.“
Mörner, 2015
“By about 2030-2040, the Sun will experience a new grand solar minimum. This is evident from multiple studies of quite different characteristics: the phasing of sunspot cycles, the cyclic observations of North Atlantic behaviour over the past millennium, the cyclic pattern of cosmogenic radionuclides in natural terrestrial archives, the motions of the Sun with respect to the centre of mass, the planetary spin-orbit coupling, the planetary conjunction history and the general planetary-solar-terrestrial interaction. During the previous grand solar minima—i.e. the Sporer Minimum (ca 1440-1460), the Maunder Minimum (ca 1687-1703) and the Dalton Minimum (ca 1809-1821)—the climatic conditions deteriorated into Little Ice Age periods.”
Sánchez-Sesma, 2015
“Solar activity (SA) has non-linear characteristics that influence multiple scales in solar processes (Vlahos and Georgoulis, 2004). For instance, millennia-scale solar oscillations have been recently detected, like those of about 6000 and 2400 years, by Xapsos and Burke (2009) and Charvátová (2000), respectively, with important and interesting influences in the near past and future climate. These millennial-scale patterns of reconstructed solar activity variability could justify epochs of low activity, such as the Maunder Minimum, as well as epochs of enhanced activity, such as the current Modern Maximum, and the Medieval Maximum in the 12th century. Although the reason for these solar activity oscillations is unclear, it has been proposed that they are due to chaotic behavior of non-linear dynamo equations (Ruzmaikin, 1983), or stochastic instabilities forcing the solar dynamo, leading to on-off intermittency (Schmittet al., 1996), or planetary gravitational forcing with recurrent multi-decadal, multi-centennial and longer patterns (Fairbridge and Sanders, 1987; Fairbridge and Shirley,1987; Charvátová, 2000; Duhau and Jager, 2010; Perry and Hsu, 2000). It should be noted that all proponents of planetary forcing have forecasted a solar Grand Minimum for the upcoming decades, but one of them has also forecasted a Super Minimum for the next centuries (Perry and Hsu, 2000). In addition, during recent decades, statistical forecasts (with physically-based spectral information of reconstructed records) of solar magnetic activity predict a clear decrease in solar activity, reaching a minimum around AD 2100 (Steinhilber et al., 2013; S13, hereafter, Velasco et al., 2015).”
Zharkova, 2015
A new model of the Sun’s solar cycle is producing unprecedentedly accurate predictions of irregularities within the Sun’s 11-year heartbeat. The model draws on dynamo effects in two layers of the Sun, one close to the surface and one deep within its convection zone. Predictions from the model suggest that solar activity will fall by 60 per cent during the 2030s to conditions last seen during the ‘mini ice age’ that began in 1645.
Results will be presented today by Prof Valentina Zharkova at the National Astronomy Meeting in Llandudno. … Zharkova and her colleagues derived their model using a technique called ‘principal component analysis’ of the magnetic field observations from the Wilcox Solar Observatory in California. They examined three solar cycles-worth of magnetic field activity, covering the period from 1976-2008. In addition, they compared their predictions to average sunspot numbers, another strong marker of solar activity. All the predictions and observations were closely matched. “Combining both waves together and comparing to real data for the current solar cycle, we found that our predictions showed an accuracy of 97%,” said Zharkova.
“Effectively, when the waves are approximately in phase, they can show strong interaction, or resonance, and we have strong solar activity. When they are out of phase, we have solar minimums. When there is full phase separation, we have the conditions last seen during the Maunder minimum, 370 years ago.”
Lüdecke et al., 2015
“The Earth’s climate shows a rather regular oscillation of ∼ 200 year period during the last millennia. However, frequency, phase, and strength of the oscillation are found to vary in different time series of temperatures and for different times (see Figs. 4–6, and 5 8). Nonetheless, the relative historic stability of the cycle suggests that the periodic nature of the climate will persist also for the foreseeable future. Disregarding other conceivable forcings e.g. anthropogenic influences, an approximate prediction of the climate for the next 100 years suggests itself. Figure 9 shows the Tsine representation from AD 1800 to AD 2100 derived from the ∆Tsine representation by a π/2 phase shift. 10 It gives correctly the 1850–1900 temperature minimum and shows a temperature drop from present to ∼ AD 2080, the latter comparable with the minimum of 1870, as already predicted in the studies (Steinhilber and Beer, 2013; Liu et al., 2011) on the grounds of solar activity data alone.”
Velasco et al., 2015
“The estimation of solar activity for the next hundred years is one of the current problems in solar physics because the possible occurrence of a future grand solar minimum will probably have an impact on the Earth’s climate. … Depending on the composite used, PMOD (or ACRIM), we found a grand minimum for the 21st century, starting in ∼2004 (or 2002) and ending in ∼2075 (or 2063), with an average irradiance of 1365.5 (or 1360.5) Wm-2±1σ=0.3 (or 0.9) Wm-2. Moreover, we calculated an average radiative forcing between the present and the 21st century minima of ∼-0.1 (or −0.2) Wm-2, with an uncertainty range of-0.04 to -0.14 (or -0.12 to -0.33) Wm-2.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline national German daily ‘Die Welt’ here reported yesterday that Daimler Benz CEO Dieter Zetsche opposes a mandatory hasty exit from fossil fuel powered automobiles.
Recently Germany’s Federal Council voted to ban the registration of automobiles powered by gasoline or diesel fossil fuel by the year 2030 in a bid to reduce the country’s CO2 emissions. However, a number of Germany’s industrial and political leaders have already come out and called the proposed ban “absurd” and a “fairy tale”.
The German luxury car giant’s CEO told the Club of Hamburg Journalists: “We don’t need in Germany any mandatory measures,” and “Indeed we cannot tell the customers what they have to buy.”
Die Welt adds that “a regulation banning these motors has nothing to do with a market economy. Moreover it destroys the soicio-economic value that has been created by the development and manufacture of gasoline and diesel motors.”
However, Zetsche does say that he expects electric cars to become competitive in the future and that his company will be ready in about 5 to 10 years. By 2025 Zetsche believes 75% of new Daimler-Benz automobiles will still be equipped with internal combustion engines. According to Die Welt, the German CEO plans to launch already in 2019 an electric-driven SUV for the city that will offer a range of 500 kilometers and a charging time of only 30 minutes.
Zetsche also does not think much of government subsidies for electric cars, and says the state rather should focus more on providing the needed infrastructure for electric mobility.
Unfortunately here Zetsche and electric vehicle owners may be waiting a long time for this, as investment in Germany’s green power grid has been scaled back rather than expanded, this being due to an array of economic, financial, social and technical hurdles.

"Arsenal’s French midfielder Mathieu Flamini is set to revolutionise the green energy sector. The footballer recently revealed himself as the secret backer behind GF Biochemicals, an Italian company which will reportedly be the first to mass produce a chemical known as levulinic acid.  There are claims the acid could replace all forms of oil, and Flamini himself says he’s opening up a market potentially worth £20 billion. It’s certainly a very exciting substance. Levulinic acid is a white powder that dissolves easily in water and is relatively safe to handle due to its low toxicity, though it is known to be a skin irritant. You’re unlikely to ever directly see or touch it yourself, though you’ll certainly use products that depend on it. It is one of an emerging group of substances we call “platform chemicals” as they can be sustainably produced from plant material and in turn used to make a variety of valuable products.  However despite the hype, levulinic acid isn’t going to replace regular fuels anytime soon and acid-powered cars aren’t going to happen. Though it has been used to produce fuels, these fuels are most often seen as an additive, to be mixed with diesel for example. The acid has its greatest promise instead in other markets. It’s worth remembering that crude oil is not only used to make fuel but is also the major raw material for our chemical industry. Everything from plastic bottles to sunscreen ultimately depends on it. The challenge is to use chemicals from biomass – the organic matter from living or recently dead organisms – to replace those currently made from oil. Indeed, much research has already been carried out into the use of levulinic acid to make all sorts of different things such as pharmaceuticals, plastics, solvents, cosmetics, flavour and fragrances, and herbicides and pesticides for agriculture. GF Biochemical’s own website contains a long list of potential uses.  This flexibility puts Flamini and GF Biochem in a strong position. It allows for an easier shift between different markets when required; as demand for one product wains another may be increased and this can be exploited. In essence, the more products you can make from a particular chemical, the more markets you can potentially move into, which strikes me as a good game plan.  Levulinic acid has another string to its bow: it can be produced from wood chippings, straw and other bits of plants that would otherwise go to waste. Indeed, the company states that it has already used wastes such as wheatstraw and grass clippings.  The importance of using waste biomass cannot be overstated. It means land won’t be tied up growing crops solely for chemicals and fuels, and could instead be used to produce food. This would reduce both our mountain of waste and our reliance on depleting fossil resources. There are further benefits. Within the biomass it is predominately the cellulose that is converted to levulinic acid. The cell walls of most plants are made of cellulose, and as such it is easily available in very large quantities. It’s even present in some of our rubbish – cotton and paper, for instance, both come from plants. That means cotton football socks with a hole in the toe and leftover matchday programmes from the next Arsenal game could, in principle, be used since both are mainly cellulose. This again gives Flamini and the company flexibility; they can change the waste they use to make levulinic acid depending on what is readily available at the time, just as long as it contains cellulose. As levulinic acid can be produced using raw materials found anywhere plants grow, which is almost everywhere, there’s one final benefit: countries like the UK that currently rely heavily on imported oil to supply their chemical industry could instead use cellulose as a raw material. Of course, this won’t solve all our chemical needs. Other sustainable chemicals will also be required. Likewise, despite its potential, it’s still not going to be enough to fulfil our global fuel demands.  But since levulinic acid can be made from easily available raw materials and can be used to make many different products, Flamini does seem to have backed a winner. So if after his next match you see him collecting all the used paper cups and matchday programmes please, consider giving him a helping hand by donating yours."
"Floods caused by Storm Desmond left more than 2,500 homes without power, washed away bridges, closed schools and hospitals and caused serious damage to homes and businesses across swathes of northern England and Scotland.  Meanwhile, the closure of the Forth Road Bridge due to structural defects has left 100,000 people, along with major corporations such as Amazon, facing large diversions and substantial delays. At times such as this, a cottage industry in back-of-the-envelope calculations rushes to estimate the disastrous costs to the economy. Infrastructure failures and natural disasters are facts of life. While the agencies responsible for maintaining our infrastructure such as Network Rail and Transport Scotland seek to protect us against the biggest and most common problems, it rarely stacks up economically, financially or politically to guard against low probability, high risk events. And even if they did try to do this, they would be unable to cater for all possibilities. The risks posed by climate change and terrorism are notoriously difficult to predict, so significant failures of some kind would still occur.  Of course, the responses of emergency services and public transport providers do have a big impact on how quickly things can return to normal. Providing extra bus or rail services, and dedicated lanes for buses or goods vehicles, can help people to resume their daily routines. For example, in Edinburgh, an extra 11,000 bus seats and 6,500 rail seats are being provided to cope with the Forth Road Bridge closure. Even so, these measures are unlikely to match up to the numbers of people that would normally be on the roads, and train and bus stations probably are not ready to cope with such a big surge in demand.  So, instead of just trying to maintain our usual routines in the face of huge disruptions, we should see these events as opportunities to try out new ways of doing things and getting places. Indeed, there is a significant body of research which tells us that, if well managed, major changes to the availability or quality of transport and infrastructure services need not be catastrophic for quite so many people.  A good example is the success of the travel management strategies put in place for the London Olympics in 2012, and the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014. In both cities, significant efforts were made to adapt transport services. But these only worked when combined with the adaptability of businesses and the flexibility shown by commuters. Yet this capacity for social adaptation can’t simply be switched on and off – it needs to be developed. Most of us have regular and clearly defined travel patterns, developed around the demands of our day-to-day lives: we base our home, work, schooling and leisure choices around an increasingly complex and time constrained pattern of journeys. And for each of these journeys, we have a set of expectations as to its likely length and quality, based on different modes of transport.  If we can relax some of the constraints around which we structure our everyday lives, then it will be much easier for us to adapt when things don’t go according to plan.  For one thing, we can exercise a surprising amount of flexibility just by drawing on our social resources. Recent research on transport disruptions found that, for disturbances lasting up to a week, people were as likely to postpone and rearrange trips as to cancel them. Asking colleagues to assist with work trips, coordinating family or neighbours to help with school runs, and shopping in new locations can all help us to deal with disasters.  Likewise, where personal circumstances allow it, rearranging schedules and leaving earlier or later from jobs or activities can go a long way toward making disasters manageable. Workplace flexibility is crucial here: bosses must be adaptable when it comes to the timing of shifts, tolerating lateness or encouraging working from home. It is much easier to take alternative routes or means of transport when you’ve tried them out before. Those who are already familiar with more than one way of getting to work are better able to adapt. The good news is that two-thirds of people already use more than one means of transport each week. And planned outages, such as strikes, can also offer less chaotic opportunities to experiment with new routes and modes of transport. We will be more resilient to a range of problems if we foster a future where everyone is a little less dependent on their cars, and a little better equipped to manage without them. The added appeal of this approach is that travelling less by car more generally would also help us to tackle congestion problems, long-term climate change obligations and the obesity crisis, in ways which suring up our infrastructure will not. There’s no doubt that engineering solutions such as flood defences and investment in preventative bridge and road maintenance have a major role to play when it comes to trying to prevent catastrophes. But as a society, we should also be trying to make it easier for people to be more flexible and also more multi-modal, more of the time."
"Finland’s new prime minister, Sanna Marin, brushed aside the media furore over her appointment as the world’s youngest serving head of government, pledging a sharp focus on climate policies as she made her debut at an EU summit. Marin, 34, took office on Tuesday after the Centre party withdrew support from the Social Democrat leader Antti Rinne, forcing him to resign as prime minister. All five leaders of the parties in Marin’s coalition are women, four of them under 35.  “I haven’t concentrated that much on the media coverage of the change of government or my prime ministership. I have concentrated on the fact that we have a lot of work to do,” Marin told reporters on Thursday as she arrived for two days of European Union summit talks in Brussels. She has been congratulated by female political leaders around the world, including the European commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, who last month became the first female leader of the EU executive, as well as Hillary Clinton. “Interview requests keep pouring in from journalists,” Marin’s spokeswoman said. Marin, who has spoken about growing up in a disadvantaged family, is a left-winger within her party and a strong defender of Finland’s generous welfare state. A long-time fan of the alternative metal band Rage Against The Machine, she has said she “dreams of free daycare” for all to add to Finland’s public education system. Marin shook hands and talked with EU leaders as they gathered for a summit at which they will lock horns over climate change, with eastern European states threatening to stall the bloc’s new push to become climate neutral by 2050. “The new generations are expecting us to act and we have to fulfil the expectations of the people,” Marin said. “I’m worried about this climate issue. We have to do more, we have to do it faster.” "
"The Paris climate conference will set nations against each other, and kick off huge arguments over economic policies, green regulations and even personal lifestyle choices. But one thing isn’t up for debate: the evidence for climate change is unequivocal.  We still control the future, however, as the magnitude of shifting weather patterns and the frequency of extreme climate events depends on how much more greenhouse gas we emit. We aren’t facing the end of the world as envisaged by many environmentalists in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but if we do nothing to mitigate climate change then billions of people will suffer. Greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit some of the heat radiation given off by the Earth’s surface and warm the lower atmosphere. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapour, followed by carbon dioxide and methane, and without their warming presence in the atmosphere the Earth’s average surface temperature would be approximately -20°C. While many of these gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, humans are responsible for increasing their concentration through burning fossil fuels, deforestation and other land use changes. Records of air bubbles in ancient Antarctic ice show us that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are now at their highest concentrations for more than 800,000 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presents six main lines of evidence for climate change. We have tracked the unprecedented recent increase in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases since the beginning of the industrial revolution. We know from laboratory and atmospheric measurements that such greenhouse gases do indeed absorb heat when they are present in the atmosphere. We have tracked significant increase in global temperatures of at least 0.85°C and a sea level rise of 20cm over the past century. We have analysed the effects of natural events such as sunspots and volcanic eruptions on the climate, and though these are essential to understand the pattern of temperature changes over the past 150 years, they cannot explain the overall warming trend. We have observed significant changes in the Earth’s climate system including reduced snowfall in the Northern Hemisphere, retreat of sea ice in the Arctic, retreating glaciers on all continents, and shrinking of the area covered by permafrost and the increasing depth of its active layer. All of which are consistent with a warming global climate. We continually track global weather and have seen significant shifts in weather patterns and an increase in extreme events all around the world. Patterns of precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) have changed, with parts of North and South America, Europe and northern and central Asia becoming wetter, while the Sahel region of central Africa, southern Africa, the Mediterranean and southern Asia have become drier. Intense rainfall has become more frequent, along with major flooding. We’re also seeing more heat waves. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) between 1880 and the beginning of 2014, the 19 warmest years on record have all occurred within the past 20 years; and 2015 is set to be the warmest year ever recorded. The continued burning of fossil fuels will inevitably lead to further climate warming. The complexity of the climate system is such that the extent of this warming is difficult to predict, particularly as the largest unknown is how much greenhouse gas we keep emitting. The IPCC has developed a range of emissions scenarios or Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to examine the possible range of future climate change. Using scenarios ranging from business-as-usual to strong longer-term managed decline in emissions, the climate model projections suggest the global mean surface temperature could rise by between 2.8°C and 5.4°C by the end of the 21st century.  Even if all the current country pledges submitted to the Paris conference are achieved we would still only just be at the bottom end of this range. The sea level is projected to rise by between 52cm and 98cm by 2100, threatening coastal cities, low-lying deltas and small island nations. Snow cover and sea ice are projected to continue to reduce, and some models suggest that the Arctic could be ice-free in late summer by the latter part of the 21st century. Heat waves, droughts, extreme rain and flash flood risks are projected to increase, threatening ecosystems and human settlements, health and security. One major worry is that increased heat and humidity could make physical work outside impossible. Changes in precipitation are also expected to vary from place to place. In the high-latitude regions (central and northern regions of Europe, Asia and North America) the year-round average precipitation is projected to increase, while in most sub-tropical land regions it is projected to decrease by as much as 20%, increasing the risk of drought. In many other parts of the world, species and ecosystems may experience climatic conditions at the limits of their optimal or tolerable ranges or beyond. Human land use conversion for food, fuel, fibre and fodder, combined with targeted hunting and harvesting, has resulted in species extinctions some 100 to 1000 times higher than background rates. Climate change will only speed things up. This is the challenge our world leaders face. To keep global temperature rise below the agreed 2°C, global carbon emission must peak in the next decade and from 2070 onward must be negative: we must start sucking out carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.   Despite 30 years of climate change negotiations there has been no deviation in greenhouse gas emissions from the business-as-usual pathway, so many feel keeping global warming to less than 2°C will prove impossible. Previous failures, most notably at Copenhagen in 2009, set back meaningful global cuts in emissions by at least a decade. Paris, however, offers a glimmer of hope.   This is an updated version of an article first published in November 2014."

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The history of science is rich in discoveries, progress, falsehoods and confusion. How will future generations see the history of climate science? Where are they going to set the point that distinguishes alarmism from reasonable science?
August 12, 2016 could be an important date on the way to answering this question. On that date Vladimir Jankovic and David Schultz of the University of Manchester published in the journal Weather, Climate and Society an important paper of great clarity and openness. In doing so, they coined an important new term: Atmosfear, the fanning of fear through the use suspected processes occurring in the atmosphere.
Jankovic and Schultz do not mince any words. They criticize the simplistic view that extreme weather is always the consequence of man’s activity and that it could be tamed simply by reducing emissions. The recent rise in extreme weather damage can be traced back almost entirely to societal factors, i.e. the increased number of insurance companies, insured values and people settling more in areas of hazard.
The paper’s abstract tells us the important points:
Atmosfear: Communicating the Effects of Climate Change on Extreme Weather
 The potential and serious effects of anthropogenic climate change are often communicated through the soundbite that anthropogenic climate change will produce more extreme weather. This soundbite has become popular with scientists and the media to get the public and governments to act against further increases in global temperature and their associated effects through the communication of scary scenarios, what we term “atmosfear.” Underlying atmosfear’s appeal, however, are four premises. First, atmosfear reduces the complexity of climate change to an identifiable target in the form of anthropogenically forced weather extremes. Second, anthropogenically driven weather extremes mandate a responsibility to act to protect the planet and society from harmful and increased risk. Third, achieving these ethical goals is predicated on emissions policies. Fourth, the end-result of these policies—a non-anthropogenic climate—is assumed to be more benign than an anthropogenically influenced one. Atmosfear oversimplifies and misstates the true state of the science and policy concerns in three ways. First, weather extremes are only one of the predicted effects of climate change and are best addressed by measures other than emission policies. Second, a pre-industrial climate may remain a policy goal, but is unachievable in reality. Third, the damages caused by any anthropogenically driven extremes may be overshadowed by the damages caused by increased exposure and vulnerability to the future risk. In reality, recent increases in damages and losses due to extreme weather events are due to societal factors. Thus, invoking atmosfear through such approaches as attribution science is not an effective means of either stimulating or legitimizing climate policies.
And how did the German press deal with the study?
We googled “Atmosfear, Manchester, Extremwetter”. No hits. Yet another case of Total Silence (“Incredible String of Failures by Rahmstorf Continues“): New Study Finds no Robust Relationship Between Shrinking Sea Ice and European Cold Waves”, which the media completely ignored as well.

"The weather might seem like it creates weeks of dreary, grey drizzle. But it can also put on a truly sensational – and, often, deadly – show. But what explains these explosive events? The Earth’s atmosphere is driven by heating from the Sun. Weather is the response of the atmosphere to the uneven pattern of heat energy that it receives. Visible and ultraviolet light warms the Earth during the day, more strongly at low latitudes, but the Earth emits an almost exactly equal total amount of infrared radiation in all directions. On average, the Earth receives 340 W m-2 from the Sun. About one third of this energy is scattered straight back into space by clouds and ice on the surface. The remaining energy, roughly the equivalent of placing a small radiator every 2m in a lattice covering the Earth’s surface and running them continuously, is absorbed by the surface and atmosphere.  But the Sun’s power is focussed on the day side and, in particular, near the Equator. On average, the atmosphere and surface absorb over 300 W m-2 in the Tropics but less than 100 W m-2 in Polar Regions. The Earth’s surface at the equator is face-on to the Sun’s light, but at a large angle to it near the poles where the same power falls over a larger surface area. The Earth’s temperature does not show extreme variations, varying by less than 50° C between Equator and high latitudes, much less than on a body such as the Moon. This is because the atmosphere (and to a slightly lesser extent the oceans) transports heat from warmer to cooler regions. Atmospheric heat transport peaks at about 5 PW (5 petaWatts or 5 × 1015 W). For context, the largest nuclear power station has a capacity of 8 GW (8 × 109 W) and the total power consumed in all forms by humans today is estimated to be 18 TW (1.8 × 1013 W), over 250 times less. This vast power supply is what drives the heat engine of the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans, and the resulting motions of warm air to cooler regions. Along the journey, energy is transformed into many other forms and the rotation of the Earth has a profound influence on the form the weather takes, especially at middle latitudes. Here the prime means of heat transport changes from the longitudinally-symmetric over-turning Hadley Cells to wave-like motions, the surface manifestation of which are our familiar high and low pressure weather systems. Jet streams are very narrow ribbons (a few km deep and maybe 100km wide) of fast moving air that circle the Earth and form on the boundary of warmer and colder air masses at about 10 km altitude. In the core of a jet stream, winds can reach 200 km hr-1 and an amazing 656 km hr-1 has been recorded over the Outer Hebrides in December 1967. The location of these focused winds is vital to planning aircraft routes and clever use is the reason why it is faster to fly from west to east than the reverse journey.  The jet stream that most influences our weather is the northern polar jet stream which meanders in a varying route and guides the passage of weather systems around the globe, potentially leading to a series of storms and flooding. When the jet stream curves south then cold polar air will be brought down, when it curves to the north, warm air and settled weather may result. Tropical cyclones, better known as hurricanes in the Americas and typhoons in the Far East, are massively destructive weather events that at lower latitudes, begin as weaker, low-pressure weather systems. Tropical cyclones form over very warm seas, typically in late summer and autumn in each hemisphere. As they intensify they become driven by latent energy release from water vapour, which condenses to form the high storm clouds.  Wind speeds of over 200 km hr-1 have been recorded around the centre of a storm, but devastation is mainly caused by flooding as a result of the surge in sea surface height and the intense rainfall. The average UK annual rainfall may fall in less than two hours from the clouds around the eye of the storm.  The 1970 Bhola cyclone was one of the worst natural disasters of all time, killing half a million people in Bangladesh and West Bengal largely as a result of such flooding, but it was far from the most powerful tropical cyclone, rating a relatively moderate Category 3. The strongest, Category 5, storms include Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with winds of over 280 km hr-1. Tornadoes are smaller, violent whirlwinds that can form below a cumulonimbus storm cloud, a region of intense vertical convection. A funnel cloud forms in the centre of the vortex, although the strong winds circulate much further around it. The most extreme winds are almost 500 km hr-1, and result in extreme damage along their path. The Tri-State Tornado of March 1925, had the longest path length recorded at over 350km and killed 695 people in the Mississippi River Valley, US. It was part of an outbreak with a combined death toll of 747, but even that was exceeded in April 1989 by the Daulatpur–Saturia tornado in Bangladesh, when more than 1,300 people died and 80,000 were left homeless. Dust storms occur in many parts of the world and can transport sand and finer mineral grains from one continent to another. In North Africa these storms are known as haboobs and are often initiated by the high winds associated with thunderstorms. Similar storms occur in the drier parts of the Americas and Asia. Haboobs can reach heights of more than 1km, cover thousands of km2 and last for hours, the lofted dust absorbing sunlight, warming the air and intensifying winds at the storm’s edge.  On Earth, water droplets will nucleate on the finer dust grains, eventually removing them and limiting the growth of a storm, but on Mars, which is much drier, some dust storms can eventually cover the planet.

 Dust devils are small convective vortices, made visible by the dust that they lift from the surface. They are also driven by heat energy, where a cooler atmosphere is in contact with a warm surface. This is most common in desert-like regions, but they can happen even in temperate climates and there are recordings of “snow devils” on brightly-lit mountainsides. On Earth, they may reach 1km high and perhaps 10 metres in diameter; on Mars they have been seen over a much wider range of sizes, extending up to 20km high and 200 metres across and appear in many images from orbiting spacecraft. Lightning is a common phenomenon in Earth’s atmosphere, occurring in regions of strong vertical convection. About 2,000 thunderstorms are active at any moment. Air in the narrow centre of a lightning channel can briefly reach 30,000°C, five times the temperature of the surface of the Sun. The thunder sound comes from the rapid expansion of the heated air and trees that are struck are literally blown apart as water within them instantly boils. Hail is generally associated with thunderstorms and is also a warm weather, convective phenomenon. People often regard hail as a winter event, but late spring and summer is the only time that true hail occurs in the UK. When there are strong updrafts of air, hailstones can reach very large sizes, up to 20cm in diameter, and can weigh almost 1 kg. Hail storms can be truly deadly and sadly there are records of many hundreds of deaths. Possibly the deadliest hailstorm recorded killed more than 230 people and 1,600 livestock in Uttar Pradesh, Northern India in April 1888, and there are written records of fatalities in Warwickshire, England as far back as May 1411."
"“There are no climate change deniers around I can assure you,” Rupert Murdoch said last month at News Corp’s annual general meeting. His declaration that the publisher of the Daily Telegraph, the Australian and owner of Sky News was free of climate deniers was widely greeted with mirth.  The next day the geologist Ian Plimer proved Murdoch’s doubters correct when he published an opinion piece in the Australian claiming the major pollution in western nations was “the polluting of minds about the role of carbon dioxide”. “There are no carbon emissions,” he wrote. “If there were, we could not see because most carbon is black. Such terms are deliberately misleading, as are many claims.” That piece of commentary attracted the usual round of applause from pundits certain they knew better than climate scientists. Where once ignoring scientists and experts would result in a failing subject grade, in some sectors it’s now considered an “opt-in” belief. That’s despite 97% of scientists standing in agreement – and apparently now even Murdoch, albeit a little later than most would like. But perhaps someone should let his publications know. In the weeks since the media baron made his proclamation – including the tidbit “we have reduced our global carbon footprint by 25% six years ahead of schedule” – not all of News Corp’s writers received the message. The following stories appeared over the same duration that News Corp publications were putting out articles (in the hundreds) about climate change, including warnings from scientists about the need for action, glaciers melting and criticisms of Australia’s policies. Bushfires blind alarmists in media to climate reality – the Australian, 24 November Chris Kenny: Hysterical efforts to blame the fires on climate change continue, even though we have always faced this threat and always will ... Tinder-dry conditions on the eastern seaboard this year are attributable to drought but as I have reported before, according to the head of the UNSW centre for climate extremes, Professor Andy Pitman, there is insufficient evidence to directly link the drought to climate change. Much media ignores the history of worse conditions and fires, and the lack of long-term rainfall trends, and runs hard on climate causal links. SA bushfires prove where warmist beliefs fall down – the Herald Sun, 25 November Andrew Bolt: Let’s assume you’re silly enough to think global warming is causing worse bushfires around the world. (In fact a recent Nasa study found that the area burned by fire has dropped 24% over 18 years.) … True, the world has warmed slightly as it rebounds from the little ice age that stretched from 1300 to around 1870, but can we cool it on this panic? In that time of warming, life expectancy has shot up, world grain crops have set new records, and the death rate from extreme weather has been slashed by 99%. But, above all, can we drop our incredible arrogance in thinking man now has the power to change the climate? That just a few Australian politicians could do what we once believed would test even God? One-eyed ABC loses sight of wider, more diverse picture of Australia – the Australian, 30 November Richard Alston: … The ABC is, indeed, notorious for presenting only one side of the picture on many big issues, whether it be climate change, immigration, asylum-seekers, gay marriage, the Palestinians or the unspeakable Donald Trump … Have you ever heard an ABC interviewer stoutly cross-examine a refugee lawyer or put a climate change advocate through their paces? Therese Rein goes wild: Scott Morrison caused fires – the Herald Sun, 30 November Andrew Bolt: This is nuts. Therese Rein, wife of Kevin Rudd, thinks prime minister Scott Morrison could have stopped fires in NSW by changing the world’s climate. Wow. That’s religion talking, not science. This global warming hysteria is totally off the dial. ABC reporters the real climate deniers – the Australian, 2 December Chris Mitchell: Andrew Bolt told his viewers on Tuesday night that he had again complained to the ABC about the latest Media Watch segment. If you follow Bolt’s many writings about climate it is obvious he does accept the temperature is rising. It has risen one degree since the start of the 20th century. But Bolt also reports scientists from other disciplines who question parts of the science. Many say climate models are not yet sophisticated enough to account for the effective regulation of atmospheric CO2 by the deep oceans, forests and soils. Bolt and others criticised by Media Watch often point to effects from solar activity. Many writers, like many climate scientists, say CO2 is not the most important greenhouse gas, pointing to water vapour and methane. These are all facts. Greta Thunberg’s invincible ignorance has infected our smartest – the Herald Sun, 8 December Andrew Bolt: The science is clear: Morrison can do nothing to change the world’s climate and stop fires. Australia is just too small to make a difference. [Therese] Rein and other critics such as Malcolm Turnbull are plainly irrational to suggest Morrison could dial down some giant thermostat. Is there any point in also showing that the fires aren’t caused by global warming, and that a recent Nasa study shows fires are now burning less land, not more? [Scott] Morrison can do nothing to change the world’s climate and stop fires. No, facts have lost their power ever since postmodernism conquered our universities and reassured the stupid they were mere social constructs. Even conspiracies. To mention facts now is no longer to bring light into darkness, but to set fire to your reputation. Logic Crimes of the New York Times – the Daily Telegraph, 9 December Tim Blair: Formerly a newspaper of record, the New York Times has in recent decades has become a newspaper of leftist causes. Name any fashionable political trend and the New York Times is all over it. Climate change is of particular interest to the Times, which in 2014 ran this headline: ‘The End of Snow?’ But five years later the same paper reported: ‘A powerful winter storm socked much of Montana with a wave of heavy snowfall on Sunday, with weekend totals climbing to 40 inches in some places, and breaking century-long daily records.’ Unable to get things right in the US, the Times now turns to NSW and our bushfires. ‘In some countries, such widespread environmental effects have led to changes in policy,’ the Times notes. ‘In Australia, however – where the air in Sydney was ranked among the worst in the world last month – prime minister Scott Morrison has resisted.’ What is he meant to do? Pass a law against bushfire smoke? Turnbull and Q&A deceive viewers again on climate – the Herald Sun, 10 December Andrew Bolt: Tony Jones in his final Q&A as full-time host produces yet another anti-Liberal pack-attack, with nobody on the panel challenging Malcolm Turnbull’s wild global warming falsehoods: ‘We have to recognise we have a hotter and drier climate. That’s the consequence of global warming. That will mean more fires and hotter fires.’ Fact: NSW has not got drier this past century. Nor has Australia. Fact: this drought is not caused by global warming. Fact: fires around the world now burn less area. Fact: we’ve had worse fires and earlier ones. And the twist is that Turnbull, having just misled people so badly on the science, promptly accuses his critics instead of not following the facts: ‘On the right, they are treating what should be a question of physics and science and economics and engineering as though it were an issue of religion and belief. And it’s nuts.’ When it comes to global warming, it seems it’s now virtuous to tell untruths and evil to counter them with facts. And the ABC is on the side of untruth. Jane Fonda leads the world into the grip of anti-human hysteria over climate change – the Daily Telegraph, 10 December Kevin Donnelly: Environmental extremists like Fonda also refuse to acknowledge that the science of climate change is far from settled. In the scientific world the links between climate change and man-made fossil fuels is far from unanimous. Not only do many scientists argue carbon is an essential part of the atmosphere ensuring plant growth but they also argue such is the complexity involved in analysing cause and effect that it is simplistic and wrong to only focus on one cause."
