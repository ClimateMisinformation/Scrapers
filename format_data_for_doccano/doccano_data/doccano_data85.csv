Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German press and politicians are writing off this conference, already. It’s over, and nobody sings “Time to say goodbye” better than Europe does. Sit back and enjoy this lovely tribute to Cancun (pre-recorded).

Lovely! Isn’t this supposed to be a sad song? For me it’s a happy one.
When the media in Germany are this pessimistic about Cancun and are already rehearsing this beautiful tune, then you know it’s over.
Even German centre-left daily Die Zeit has the headline today: Germany Dampens Cancun Expectations.
Germany, led by Angela Merkel, is a leading proponent of a global climate treaty, actually believing it is possible to regulate the globe’s temperature. Japan, Canada and Russia are demanding a treaty that also commits China to limiting greenhouse gas emissions, which is a sure way to kill it. Die Zeit writes:
Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen (CDU) does not expect a breakthrough in Cancun.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) is not even taking part in the conference.

Even the UNEP Director, Achim Steiner, is dampening expectations: ‘Cancun is certainly not the summit that is going to bring about a breakthrough’, he said.”
If Germany has given up, then you can be 99.9999999999999% sure this thing is dead as a doornail.
To save face, countries of course will agree on token measures like protecting forests and signing pledges to continue efforts – next year. Of course, all the finger pointing is being directed at the USA and China. No blame for those that conjured up the idiotic idea that was nuts to begin with.
Die Zeit ends its piece with:
The Chairman of Environment and Nature Protection Germany, Hubert Weiger, calls on Röttgen to continue fighting together with Europe for a continuation of the Kyoto  Protocol. But observers see little chance for a breakthrough in the talks.”
Perhaps Europe ought to wake up and realise that the rest of the world is not interested in being constantly nagged and told what to do. Take care of your own problems. Nobody is listening to you.
And here’s another for Cancun (with well-deserved standing ovation)

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn reader comments yesterday, there was a little discussion about Peter Heller’s recap of the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy, here (German), which took place in Berlin last weekend.
Heller exposed a spy who had been sent over to check up on what was going down at the denier pow-wow on the other side of the Climate Science Iron Curtain. Heller writes:
In any case, by coincidence, I happened to sit down at lunch with a young lady, who outed herself as an employee of Hans Joachim Schellnhuber [PIK], completely forthright and without any reservation. She expressed her wonder at the political emphasis of the conference. She had obviously expected something esoteric and anti-science, probably, which would later allow her institute to gripe endlessly about. However, the conference offered none of that.”

For readers not familiar with PIK, it is the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which is directed by Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, and is the workplace for Stefan Rahmstorf and Wealth Redistributor Ottmar Edenhofer. It is, unfortunately, the primary scientific institute advising Angela Merkel on climate policy.
Obviously Schellnhuber didn’t want to be caught slumming it by being seen at such an event (or maybe he felt the risk of being caught peering through 2 holes cut in a copy of the Süddeutsche Zeitung was too high). So instead he opted to issue an underling an Ausreisegenehmigung (travel permit) to Denierland – with the mission to observe the capitalistically funded conference.
As a visiting blogger, I’m a little intrigued by all this. I’m told Greenpeace activists were sent over last year. This year we got a young spy. I view that as progress. The level of sophistication in dealing with skeptics is indeed climbing.
I can only speculate what may have gone through this young lady’s head as she listened to the speakers.
First of all, it must have made an impression on her that on the skeptic side of the Climate Iron Curtain people are much more positive and optimistic about the future, and not all mired in the doom, gloom and pessimism of the sort one finds at the PIK, where scientists constantly fret and wring their hands over the ever faster approaching climate catastrophe.
And working at the PIK, where a certain science dogma is rigidly enforced and nothing else is tolerated, she had to have appreciated the intellectual freedom that the skeptics enjoy, where everyone is free to think and express any view, and do so without fear of having to do time in a science gulag.
At RealClimate, how many scientists have had their comments deleted? How often do we hear Rahmstorf complain about newspapers openly expressing views he does not agree with? How many hours does Rahmstorf spend surfing the Internet in search of “denier” articles and rebutting them, smearing scientists as he does so?
Peter Heller writes that the political and economic emphasis at the conference appeared to confuse the young lady:
This seemed to be an aspect that she perceived as surprising. From our short discussion at the lunch table, she expected more a debate about climatic model certainty and the possibilities for their improvement. Instead, she was shown the risks that today’s climate protection policies entail, and the risks that politicians are willing to take and what their motives are. She did not want to accept the fact that climate policy in Germany is labelled with PIK, and carries the tags of Schellnhuber, Rahmstorf and Edenhofer, and that we certainly oppose these also with political arguments. Who, I ask myself, suffers here from cognitive dissonance?
It’s obviously all too much for the young lady, who by now has surely returned back to the PIK where she finds all the comforts that dogma and restricted intellectual freedom have to offer.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m beginning to wonder if Germany’s online Die Welt daily is still a serious publication. Certainly not its fiction fantasy alarmism science section, which has become an outlet for every wildly imaginable climate catastrophe scenario.
It’s become sort of a laughing stock, along with much of the rest of Germany’s established media.
Yesterday Die Welt reported here on how scientists at the University of Giessen’s Institute For Plant Ecology, based in the central German state of Hesse, have conducted experiments that have yielded “surprising and worrisome” results.
For 12 years scientists have been simulating climate change in a time lapse by pumping CO2 over a green pasture area at levels that are expected to be reached in the year 2030 (bought-and-paid-for junk science).
The results showed that the added CO2 did not lead to higher CO2 concentrations in the ground. Moreover, it led to higher emissions of nitrous oxide. The scientists found it “alarming”. In addition, the times at which plants blossom and foliage changes colours have changed. Plants have a phenological clock says Christoph Müller, Director of the Institute For Plant Ecology. He says:
One sees: The clock has shifted a little.
A little? Die Welt does not define how much “a little” actually is, but it must be enough to allow it to write:
The winters have shortened, the springs are starting earlier. According to projections, spring could begin already at the end of January after 2030.
According to Müller:

The climate in Hesse has changed. The vegetation has responded to climate change.”
That itself should not surprise anyone, unless of course one is among those who are ignorant of climatic and oceanic cycles, and who happen to believe that climate stagnation is the natural norm (when humans are not around). Maybe Müller believes this. In the Die Welt report he says 0.7°C temperature increase is something that took thousands of years to occur in earlier history. Today this is occurring in just 100 years!
Perhaps all those ice-bore proxies are wrong now. Maybe the earth needed thousands of years to come out of the ice age, and not hundreds as is thought to be the case.
And so it is in the “science” section of Die Welt.
And what can we do to avert this coming climate catastrophe? Christopher Müller demands we handle energy in a different way, and calls for another way of living.
One reader calling him/herself Impfstoffel commented at the end of the article:
This year (2010) spring 2010 didn’t not get started until the end of May – at least where I live!!
And living in northern Germany, allow me to add to that: Fall this year started already in August!
I wonder if the media and scientists realise how stupid they are making themselves look before the educated public. The Die Welt readers who have felt comments are laughing at the story by the usual 10 to 1 margin.
I’ve filed this post under a new category: “Stupid Predictions”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBecause of arrogance, dogma and the claim to have absolute knowledge.
I can’t recommend the following video (below) enough: h/t: Stu, reader at Climate Progress.
I admit I’m backpedalling, and took the 1010 clip too lightly. I realise now why some people are so very upset about it. They are right to be so. The following video hits it home as to why radical anything is so dangerous.
I’m not saying that environmentalists are that far, but the intolerant, radical ones are certainly well on their way. When one starts fantasizing about blowing up children with the push of a button, something is terribly amiss.
I watched the clip below 3 times. The following passages struck me.
Look for yourself. This is the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz. This is where people were turned into numbers.
Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some 4 million people. And that was not done by gas.

It was done by ARROGANCE. It was done by DOGMA. It was done by ignorance. When people believe they have ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE, with no test in reality, this is how they behave.
Every judgement in science stands at the edge of error, and is personal.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis has to be a short post as it’s 1 a.m. and I’m beat. The conference today ended at 9.30 and then I met up with some other German bloggers at the bar for a couple of drinks and good discussion.
The first day went very well with a slate of very interesting speakers. I feel it’s beginning to crumble, and I’m getting signals that some media outlets are beginning to shift gears. It only takes one domino to fall to get the rest of it going. The recent FOCUS feature was a sign.
None of the mainstream media outlets bothered to show up. But that’s okay becuase I scanned the headlines of all the big German newspapers while at the train station this morning, and they had nothing about Cancun! Summary: climate has lost its signficance – completely.
I’d say there were around 150 people attending today, with a good number of young faces, and so I was surprised by the turnout. Many of the talks today were about the cosmic radiation.cloud correlation. Scientists Henrik Borchert:
The German Weather Service has to start looking at their own data.”
One highlight was a live video feed of Lord Monckton and Roy Spencer from Cancun, who gave us a progress report there and we were able to ask questions directly.
I wanted to post a photo but I have to convert the photo and it’s too late. I’ll post more tomorrow.

"In 2007, an article in the Wall Street Journal appeared with the headline “Inconvenient youth”. A pun on Al Gore’s film An Inconvenient Truth, it described parents being badgered by their children to drive less or install low energy lighting to help climate change. It even included tips and strategies for fed-up parents to deflect these suggestions. A new study challenges this narrative. In 2015, a poster competition for Utah schools was launched to encourage teens to consider the air pollution implications of their driving privilege and to learn strategies to preserve air quality. Although the competition was directed at the teenagers, it soon became clear that they were talking to their parents and encouraging them to change behaviour too.  Changes included stopping engine idling, joining short trips together or walking instead of driving. In later rounds, researchers began to focus on this parent-teenager interaction. In contrast to the pessimistic Wall Street Journal article, only 6% of parents said the information from children was as annoying or irritating. The clear majority were proud of their child’s clean air actions and were motivated to change themselves.  Let’s hope our politicians are as open in listening to the thousands of school children taking to the streets each Friday."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve mentioned at least a couple of times at this blog how the German public school system is pounding the climate protection religion in school classrooms.
For example former minister of environment Sigmar Gabriel of the SPD socialist party was so impressed by Al Gore’s Inconvenient Truth propaganda film that he procured 6000 copies and had them distributed to Germany’s upper secondary schools for viewing by university-bound students.
Environmental groups like Germanwatch make the rounds through schools to spread panic by grossly exaggerating climate change scenarios (German port cities will be under water).
Greenpeace is even petitioning the German government to have Climate Protection” adopted in its Constititution:
‘Climate change is the most dangerous threat to our natural existence, yet it is neither mentioned in the Constitution nor in the UN Charter. The German Parliament must therefore anchor this as one of the most important duties of the state,’ says Stefan Krug, leader of the political representation of Greenpeace in Berlin.
But that doesn’t go far enough. Let’s take a page out of the Pyongyang playbook and start early – real early.  The German education system has assigned itself another new function beside education – environmental indoctrination. Germany’s sceptic site Readers Edition here has a piece today on the latest indoctrination program at schools called: klima on… s’cooltour 2009, again delivered by alarmist organization Germanwatch.
This program is initiated by the manufacturers of energy saving lights, like Philips – see video (in German).
These big greedy corporations are behind scaring kids in order to boost the sales of their poisonous, mercury-laden lights.

As the film shows, all kids are in uniform, dressed in “s’cool tour” T-shirts. and fed the junk science and environmental propaganda of rescuing the planet. First the kids are explained in simple terms “why the earth has a fever”, and, using an inverted glass jar, shown how heated air turns into storms.
And of course, they are taught that energy saving lights will rescue the polar bears in the Arctic.
The clip says: “thanks to the program, kids now better understand why storms are caused and that each person can make an “enormous contribution in reducing the earth’s fever”.  Indeed. In fact, Germany cutting its CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050 will lead to the enormous temperature reduction of 0.0072°C.
Says Lena Haller:
We are trying to change the behaviour of the kids and thus improve it.
It doesn’t matter what the science turns up. The enviro-brainwashers aren’t interested in it. They are into changing behaviour – getting everybody to believe their phoney doomsday scenarios and have them behave in fear accordingly. It hardly can get worse. Their target with the little ones is to turn them into greenshirts – like this:

"The US Senate defeated a motion to take up the Green New Deal, the non-binding proposal spearheaded by progressive Democratic lawmakers to radically reduce greenhouse gases and try to lessen social inequity. Republican leaders in the Senate had scheduled Tuesday’s vote in an effort to turn the proposal into a wedge issue in the 2020 elections, hoping to force Democrats on the record about their support – or opposition – for a proposal that is popular among the Democratic base but has been criticized by many conservatives. Democrats called the efforts by the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell a “sham”, and 43 of them voted “present” rather than casting an up-or-down vote. Lawmakers ultimately voted 57-0 against the proposal. Three Democrats and independent senator Angus King of Maine ultimately joined all 53 Republicans in opposing the plan. The Green New Deal aims to virtually eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and calls for the US to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal. It also urges national healthcare coverage and job guarantees, high-quality education and affordable housing, as well as “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States” to be energy-efficient. The proposal has broad support among Democratic activists, and all six of the 2020 presidential contenders serving in the Senate have signed on as cosponsors, putting it at the forefront of the party’s sprawling primary race. Republicans say the plan would devastate the economy and lead to a huge tax increase. They call it more evidence of the creep of “socialism” in the Democratic party, along with “Medicare for All” and a sweeping elections reform package that would allow public financing of congressional campaigns. McConnell said the proposal “might sound like a neat idea in places like San Francisco or New York” but would result in communities across the country being “absolutely crushed”. He argued the deal would “kill off entire domestic industries” and eliminate millions of jobs. Donald Trump also weighed in against the plan, which the White House called “job crushing”. At a luncheon with Senate Republicans, Trump urged lawmakers to keep the Green New Deal alive as an issue to use against Democrats. Mike Lee, a Republican senator from Utah, called the Green New Deal “ridiculous” and displayed pictures of dinosaurs, cartoon characters and babies as he derided the plan. He said he was treating it “with the seriousness it deserves”. Democrats derided the GOP moves and said they carried their own political risk by mocking an issue – climate change – that a growing number of Americans care deeply about. Climate change, they said, is deadly serious, citing floods in the midwest, wildfires in the west and hurricanes in the south. “Climate change is not a joke,” said Ed Markey, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and the resolution’s lead Senate author. “Mocking it is shameful.” “The GOP’s climate delaying is costing us lives [and is] destroying communities,” congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the plan’s sponsor in the House, tweeted. The GOP’s climate delaying is costing us lives + destroying communities.Iowa, Nebraska & many in the Midwest are catastrophically flooded right now, in one of the 1st major climate change disasters of 2019.A #GreenNewDeal urges us to pursue a plan on the scale of the problem. https://t.co/dWXe44hxWX  Ocasio-Cortez also said she had encouraged fellow Democrats to vote present, and questioned Republicans’ reluctance to schedule major hearings on the effects of climate change. Separately, speaking at a hearing of the House financial services committee on Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez sharply criticized the suggestion that concerns about the environment were “elitist” and condemned past inaction. “You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist? Tell that to the kids of the South Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates of child asthma in the country,” she said. “This is about our lives, and this should not be partisan,” she added. “Science should not be partisan.” By Tuesday evening, the clip of her comments had been shared thousands of times. Watch every second of this... @AOC is so incredibly spot on. pic.twitter.com/ESP4dC5TTo The New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of a half-dozen senators seeking the Democratic nomination for president, said Republicans treat climate change “as a game” and said Democrats “will not fall for this stunt”. Slowing climate change “should be our nation’s moonshot” in the 21st century, Gillibrand argued. “We don’t know if we can get to net-zero carbon emissions in 10 years, but why not try?” she said at a rally before the Senate vote."
"It is written into celebrity lore that the reason the boyband Blue never made it in the US isn’t because it looked as if the smouldering line-up of Lee Ryan, Duncan James and Simon Webbe were being forced to hang out with Antony Costa because their mums were all friends with his mum. The real reason is quite different: in the wake of the 9/11 attacks – in a let’s-break-America-with-our-wholesome-brand-of-banter interview – Ryan went off-piste and said: “This New York thing is being blown out of proportion. What about whales? They are ignoring animals that are more important. Animals need saving and that’s more important.” And lo: record contract revoked, tail-between-their-legs flight back to Britain, now the fragmented shards of Blue are the face of the home improvement company Ideal Boilers. Before we analyse whether Ryan was right all along and might be an underappreciated intellect-cum-soothsayer (whales are important! He’s right!) (But! With! Caveats!), I want to visit this quote from Grimes, the poptronica, Pitchfork-approved musician who granted a rare interview to the Wall Street Journal this week. “I want to make climate change fun,” she said, describing the theme of her upcoming concept album, Miss Anthropocene. “People don’t care about it, because we’re being guilted. I see the polar bear and want to kill myself. No one wants to look at it, you know? I want to make a reason to look at it. I want to make it beautiful.” Now read Ryan’s one about whales, then Grimes’s bit about the polar bears again. Oscillate between them. Here is my theory: this is the same quote, tumbled out of different mouths.  Yes, Grimes is back, and – as she insists to the WSJ – she wants to be known as c now (lower-case artist’s own, italics artist’s own). Grimes is a curious beast because she spent almost a decade in the indie pop backwaters – very much beloved by, how to say this, “men who wear glasses and make playlists for a hobby”, but not exactly known by anyone outside those one-craft-beer-then-home circles. Then, last year, she went to the Met Gala with Elon Musk – a billionaire whose legacy is either going to be “the guy who ended death” or “that guy who tried to eat the moon” – and now she and he have broken through into power couple mainstream. This seems to sit uneasily on c – how do you enter a legitimate album cycle when your career to date has been eclipsed by Azealia Banks calling you a “brittleboned meth-head” who “smells like a roll of nickels”? How can anyone take you seriously as an artist when your fanbase has recently been flooded with the sort of lads who write “Pickle Rick” under their religious beliefs section on application forms? The strategy so far seems to be: “affect the demeanour of a 2003-era MSN Messenger status come to life”. This is how we end up, here, with c earnestly suggesting we recast climate change as banter, something I can only imagine ends in doom for us all. Further highlights: c says the album’s central beautiful love song was inspired by watching the trailer for the movie Assassin’s Creed (36%, Rotten Tomatoes); that the interstitial persona of c is part of the world-building central to her career, like JRR Tolkien or George RR Martin (Game of Thrones, of course, very famously lenient on new-world kings who hoard excessive wealth – and they rarely get stabbed to death or get poisoned or go mad at all); the sheer m’ladyness of Musk’s emailed quote about his girlfriend, sent to the WSJ: “I love c’s wild fae artistic creativity and hyper intense work ethic.” At times it feels as if the Wall Street Journal gave up interviewing Grimes and instead talked to the nearest goth girl they could find smoking on a low wall behind some school tennis courts, wearing spidery fingerless gloves and lamenting the low grade they got at AS-level art. Finally, c hints at her nascent plans to murder the alter ego of Grimes in some extravagant way in the not too distant future. “It will be a public execution,” she says coyly, “followed by – by something else. I shouldn’t say yet.” What? Blow back so hard she explodes? A Doritos-and-watching-Queen-of-the-Damned-on-DVD session that lasts so long everyone involved expires? Absinthe overdose? It’s hard to know what the most AOL chat room-goth way of executing someone is, but be assured c will find it. Until then, and until climate change inevitably becomes fun, remember this: Grimes is just what would happen if Lee Ryan had access to a billionaire. A shuddering thought. Something has gone wrong with the ancient glowing runes buried deep beneath the moors that tell of who gets to be a celebrity. They’ve stopped spitting out the explain-it-to-the-camera irony-free Towie B-team and one-cap England footballers who pivot into entertainment after doing in their knee at 29. Now they have decided that our latest celebrity is to be Harry Redknapp, who absolutely does not want this and it shows. To recap: last year, former football manager Redknapp went on I’m a Celebrity, where he basically sat around looking deflated in a vest, talked endlessly about his wife, and refused to eat any food. Inexplicably, he won because of it. Harry’s time in the jungle was typified by 20-year-old Hollyoaks actors saying, without any provocation, “You’re a legend, mate” before then teaching him to rap as a joke. Now – and, again, this is unasked for by everyone, including the British public and, most especially, Redknapp himself – now, for some reason, this is being spun out into a fifth career: player, manager, pundit, dog accountant and reluctant celebrity. As every nascent flavour-of-the-weekend celebrity knows, you need an ITV reality show to launch from. Enter Harry’s Heroes: The Full English, a show seemingly commissioned from the inside of a turbulent Farage wet dream, where a dozen or so retired England internationals compete with each other over 12 weeks to lose their middle-age spread before a gala testimonial game in which they will stick it to the Germans. You can marvel at David Seaman softly chuckling about everything; Neil Ruddock starring in an insane GoPro-shot montage of him partying on a cruise ship before a flash-cut of him, in a doctor’s office, being told solemnly: “Razor, you’re due for a heart attack”; Paul Merson sobbing in a taxi; Robbie Fowler’s Puerto Banús hangover. And … a dearth of Harry Redknapp. Despite Redknapp as the hook, he basically spends the entire show trundling into or out of shot, trailed by carry-on luggage. At the meet-the-gang training session, he hands over weigh-in duty to a tank of a personal trainer, then goes outside and quietly banters with John Barnes about a knee injury. At the show’s centrepiece Spanish getaway, Redknapp turns up a full day late because he took his wife’s passport to the airport, in a move I cannot quite discount as being deliberate. Before the win-or-we-haven’t-got-a-show Germany game, he assembles everyone on the subs bench then gets someone else to read out how much weight they have lost (Matt Le Tissier dropped 10kg. Redknapp: “[extremely long, tired pause] … Well done”). His pep talk amounts to “Stick it to ’em, boys”, before turning away from the camera and rubbing his nose. The most effort he puts in is a scene where he meets ‘Razor’ Ruddock in a cafe to tell him he is going to die if he doesn’t lose weight, but did so in front of an irresistible poster shouting “ICE-CREAM MILKSHAKES”. The voiceover: structurally extensive, delivered with the all the elan of a great-aunt in a Harvester restaurant reading out the menu through some bifocals. The adverts: inexplicably all starring Redknapp, including a GoDaddy bit where he bakes jam roly-poly. I do not want to imagine the wastelands of this country, post-Brexit, where the only celebrity we are allowed is Redknapp – reluctantly attending prosecco-and-nibbles makeup launches in a sequined suit, hammering into the water from 10 metres in an ill-fated reboot of Splash! Or Redknapp bewildered on the panel of Celebrity Juice. And I don’t think he does either. Give the man a break. Stop making him famous. He doesn’t want it."
"The problems caused by apparent overabundance of cow faeces (Turd world: how poo is mucking up the environment, 25 March) are at least partly in the control of the farmers, who feed a broadband insecticide (Dimilin) to their cows. The purpose is to stop flies and beetles from feeding in the dung and thus breaking it down, a crucial step in the removal of the dung. Flies and beetles are thus no more a problem in intensive rearing units. Dimilin can remain active in the dung for a month or more, so when the dung is disposed of, it is still not possible for an insect (or many other species of arthropod) to survive or breed in it. Dimilin then becomes an added pollutant of run-off and water courses.  Its action is to disrupt the formation of a primary component (chitin) of the insect’s skin or shell. So the shell is never formed properly and breaks very easily, usually when the insect is expanding into its new shell after moulting. It can also affect the insect’s gut lining. I did some of the early work on Dimilin.Julian VincentBath • David Cox says we need a systemic approach to the disposal of farm animal dung, but that the most obvious use in fertilising land faces real obstacles. These could, however, be avoided if dung were fermented instead of decomposed. The right kind of fermentation (homolactic) kills bacteria so effectively that it even stops itself, producing a kind of pathogen-free preserve. When exposed to air, this becomes a harmless and attractive food for soil creatures, retains all of its original energy, carbon and nutrients, and smells sour rather than disgusting. It would make a perfect substitute for muck-spreading. The preserving process takes just a few weeks, as does the feeding frenzy in soil. In America, you can buy household fermentation for pet poo. Scaling up to farming is a huge undertaking but is surely doable. Environment departments everywhere, take note. Humans can use this, too. Hygienic dry toilets instead of sewage, anyone?Malcolm FowlesReading, Berkshire • I notice you have not included the problem of greenhouse gas emissions from ruminants, or the huge agricultural acreages that meat production requires. Given the last UN report on global warming, it is surely the time to start taking serious action. A tax on meat and eggs would reduce the demand for meat, encourage veganism, and reduce the problems of poo, greenhouse gas emissions and inefficient use of agricultural land. The tax could partly be used to subsidise independent butchers, and assist them to find other business opportunities. Farmers could also be helped to move towards greater crop production for human consumption. As schoolchildren are telling us, time is running out for them, and it is time we started to take action. The dairy industry is probably too complicated for any change, but our lives will have to change in so many ways if we really want to stop global warming.Philip StringerLewisham, London • It’s fair that your article should highlight the potential issues with conversion of animal poo into energy using anaerobic digestion (AD). Judging by the increasing number of UK companies seeking business angel funding in this area, I am pleased to say that market activity is strong. Many of the innovations pitched to us attempt to radically reduce a farm’s storage and operational footprint, in a move to so-called “micro AD”. The problems you outline are crucial, but business angels are helping many startup companies invest to resolve them.Cam RossDirector, Green Angel Syndicate • Peter Duckers (Letters, 26 March) is only 129 years late in suggesting the House of Commons as a receptacle for cow poo. William Morris got there first in News from Nowhere, his fantasy of a future socialist society: “Use them [Houses of Parliament]! Well, yes, they are used for a sort of subsidiary market, and a storage place for manure, and they are handy for that, being on the water-side.”Frank JacksonHarlow, Essex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"The largest five stock market listed oil and gas companies spend nearly $200m (£153m) a year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change, according to a new report. Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil were the main companies leading the field in direct lobbying to push against a climate policy to tackle global warming, the report said. Increasingly they are using social media to successfully push their agenda to weaken and oppose any meaningful legislation to tackle global warming. In the run-up to the US midterm elections last year $2m was spent on targeted Facebook and Instagram ads by global oil giants and their industry bodies, promoting the benefits of increased fossil fuel production, according to the report published on Friday by InfluenceMap.  Separately, BP donated $13m to a campaign, also supported by Chevron, that successfully stopped a carbon tax in Washington state – $1m of which was spent on social media ads, the research shows. Edward Collins, the report’s author, analysed corporate spending on lobbying, briefing and advertising, and assessed what proportion was dedicated to climate issues. He said: “Oil majors’ climate branding sounds increasingly hollow and their credibility is on the line. They publicly support climate action while lobbying against binding policy. They advocate low-carbon solutions but such investments are dwarfed by spending on expanding their fossil fuel business.” After the Paris climate agreement in 2015 the large integrated oil and gas companies said they supported a price on carbon and formed groups like the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative which promote voluntary measures. But, the report states, there is a glaring gap between their words and their actions. The five publicly listed oil majors – ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP and Total – now spend about $195m a year on branding campaigns suggesting they support action against climate change. But the report said these campaigns were misleading the public about the extent of the oil companies’ actions because while publicly endorsing the need to act, they are massively increasing investment in a huge expansion of oil and gas extraction. In 2019 their spending will increase to $115bn, with just 3% of that directed at low carbon projects. Shell said in a statement: “We firmly reject the premise of this report. We are very clear about our support for the Paris agreement, and the steps that we are taking to help meet society’s needs for more and cleaner energy. “We make no apology for talking to policymakers and regulators around the world to make our voice heard on crucial topics such as climate change and how to address it.” Chevron said it disagreed with the report’s findings. “Chevron is taking prudent, cost-effective actions and is committed to working with policymakers to design balanced and transparent greenhouse gas emissions reductions policies that address environmental goals and ensure consumers have access to affordable, reliable and ever cleaner energy.” The successful lobbying and direct opposition to policy measures to tackle global warming have hindered governments globally in their efforts to implement policies after the Paris agreement to meet climate targets and keep warming below 1.5C."
"The UK will miss almost all the 2020 nature targets it signed up to a decade ago, according to a report by the government’s official advisers. The nation is failing to protect threatened species; end the degradation of land; reduce agricultural pollution; and increase funding for green schemes, the assessment concludes. It also says the UK is not ending unsustainable fishing; stopping the arrival of invasive alien species; nor raising public awareness of the importance of biodiversity.  The targets were set in 2010 by the global Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the report from the joint nature conservation committee (JNCC) found insufficient progress was being made on 14 of the 19 targets. The news came on the day Britain formally launched its bid to host the UN climate change conference in 2020, seeking to prove its green credentials are not tarnished and to show the disarray that has been caused by Brexit does not mean the UK has forfeited its right to be a major international player. Speaking at a launch event for the bid in Downing Street, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said: “Britain has an exceptional record of hosting big international events, ranging from the G20 summit in 2009 to the London Olympics in 2012. “Most importantly of all, we are ambitious. If we are going to ensure that future generations do not pay a price for our prosperity today, we must collectively change our economies and societies. We believe this can be done and protecting the environment can go hand-in-hand with economic growth.” Hunt has not yet said if the UK bid will involve London as the venue. Critics of the government said the report showed wildlife and natural habitats were in deep crisis. The UK is “among the most nature-depleted countries in the world”, according to a separate 2016 report, with continuing declines in species such as skylarks, hedgehogs, many insects including butterflies and corn marigolds. “The JNCC report says nature in the UK is pretty bad, declining and not recovering, and that is in the context of an awful lot of rhetoric [from ministers] about being a world leader on the environment,” said Kate Jennings, the head of site conservation policy at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). “We are going to fail to meet the vast majority of our international commitments,” she said. “Some of the things presented as positive are where places are getting worse more slowly – if that’s the best achievement we’ve got, it’s a pretty sorry state of affairs.” The environment minister Thérèse Coffey said: “Nature matters. Our species and ecosystems are valued in their own right, but they also contribute to our wellbeing and economic prosperity. We acknowledge that in many areas there are ongoing declines in nature, but there are real points of progress on which we can build. Our 25 Year Environment Plan is a step-change in ambition.” A key CBD target is to improve the conservation status of threatened species but the report says “there have been widespread and significant ongoing declines across many species”, such as farmland birds and pollinating insects. Another of the 2020 targets is to cut the rate of loss and degradation of natural habitats to “close to zero”. While the report says some places have improved, there have been “ongoing losses of natural and semi-natural habitat, for example through neglect or development”. The target to cut fertiliser and other pollution to levels that do not harm biodiversity is being missed, the report says, with little reduction in sensitive habitats since 2010 and with 65% of inland and coastal waters remaining below target levels. Only about half of fish stocks are sustainably caught, the report says, meaning the target to end overfishing will be missed. The goal to prevent new invasive species entering the UK and harming wildlife, as the grey squirrel has, is also being missed. Despite strong action, the report says, the number of invasive species has increased in fresh and marine waters. The CBD targets also require that funding to support biodiversity should “increase substantially” but the report found a fall in government spend on biodiversity. Another goal is to eliminate subsidies that harm nature and increase those that boost it. But the report says: “The UK recognises some ongoing declines of woodland, farmland and marine biodiversity and some recent reductions in areas under agri-environment schemes.” The CBD targets also require the UK government to make the public aware of the value of biodiversity but the JNCC found “more than half of the UK public report no awareness of the threats to biodiversity … and there has been no significant increase since 2009”. “This report proves that behind the smoke and mirrors of [the environment secretary] Michael Gove’s press releases, photo opportunities and endless consultations, our natural world is in deep crisis,” said Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary. “This government doesn’t put its money where its mouth is when it comes to biodiversity.” The five targets the JNCC says are being met include implementing a national biodiversity action plan, improving scientific knowledge and integrating biodiversity values into planning processes. “The process box – not outcomes – is much easier to tick,” said Jennings. The JNCC also says the UK has exceeded the target of effectively conserving 17% of land and 10% of marine areas, with 28% of land and 24% of the sea now protected. But Jennings said the land total includes national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty, which are not managed for biodiversity. In England, she said, only 8.5% of land was protected for wildlife, and only 40% of that was in good condition. “I’m not sure how anything not in favourable condition can be said to be effectively managed.” The CBD targets are not legally binding. “Embarrassment is the only enforcement mechanism,” Jennings said. Martin Harper, also of the RSPB, said: “After decades of fudged targets and false promises on the environment, it’s crucial that we secure binding targets in new national legislation, and a robust watchdog.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Die Welt reports here (surprise! surprise!) that huge costs will be coming due because of the needed extra electrical infrastructure for feeding in green power from offshore wind farms and solar panels into the existing power grid. The current power grid is far too inadequate and has to be massively expanded.
Europe’s target is to provide 20% of its energy with alternative energy by 2020. Germany wants to produce 80% of its energy through alternatives by 2050. These extra costs, says Die Welt, will be “huge”.
The EU wants to have consumers contribute to the cost of the green electrical power offensive. The expansion of the power grid is going to be really expensive.
The energy offensive dubbed Energy Action Plan 2020 by the European Commission, wants to involve all 27 member countries in paying the grid expansion costs. EU Energy Commissar Günther Oettinger says:
Bringing offshore power from the North Sea to Cologne or Stuttgart costs money that we have to pay. We only have God and the citizens, and God doesn’t pay.
In Europe when consumers are expected by politicians “to contribute”, it means of course paying all of it.

"Researchers have documented what they are describing as the most severe coral bleaching to hit the world’s southern-most reef at Lord Howe Island. Scientists from Newcastle University, James Cook University, the University of New South Wales and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have spent the past two weeks surveying corals around the island in the far south Pacific Ocean after they were alerted to bleaching in isolated areas. Bill Leggat, a coral biologist at Newcastle University, said the worst of the bleaching was in shallow water closer to the shoreline. “It’s quite variable but where it’s severe it is actually quite severe,” he said. “Some of the sites are looking at 80-90% bleaching going very close inshore.” Other reef sites the scientists surveyed showed bleaching levels of 50%, 30% and some areas with as little as 5% bleaching. Lord Howe Island was named a Unesco world heritage site in 1982. It is habitat for species that are found nowhere else on earth. The bleaching has occurred over the past summer, with March the peak month of the year for coral bleaching due to warmer ocean temperatures. Scientists have documented three bleaching events at Lord Howe Island in the past but it has been some years since it last occurred. Leggat said although the bleaching was isolated to shallow areas, for scientists to be documenting 90% bleaching in some parts signalled the latest event “is really quite severe”. “As far as we know it’s the most severe we’ve ever seen it on Lord Howe Island,” he said. “Our concern now is we’re going to start seeing coral mortality.” Leggat said some areas still remained healthy but researchers doing surveys last week could see the bleaching was progressing. They will return in April to conduct fresh surveys to assess whether it has caused coral mortality. While much of Australia’s focus on coral bleaching has been centred on the Great Barrier Reef, it is a worldwide occurrence due to climate change. “Reefs around the world are being affected everywhere,” Leggat said. “We’re starting to see beaching in sites where wouldn’t have previously expected to see it.”"

"The Greens will propose 2030 as the cut-off point for thermal coal exports, and the shutdown date for Australia’s fleet of coal-fired power stations, in the party’s new climate and energy policy heading into the federal election. With Labor expected to unveil the remaining elements of its climate policy before next week’s budget, the Greens will on Thursday open the bidding on ambition, laying down markers for the policy bartering that could play out after the federal election in the event Labor wins power and the Greens remain significant crossbench players.  The new Greens policy proposes the creation of a new public authority, Renew Australia, to lead the transition to low emissions, and a new government-owned energy retailer with a mandate to deliver cheaper power. The party is proposing to phase out thermal coal exports by setting a yearly limit on coal exports from 2020, a set of procedures that would require resources companies to secure permits at auction in order to export product. The Greens say Renew Australia will determine the timetable for shutting down the coal fleet, but the policy scenarios accompanying its policy puts the cut-off point at 2030. The policy also advocates for vehicle emissions standards “that lead up to a complete ban on new internal combustion vehicles by 2030”, and a 17% tax on “luxury fossil fuel cars” to help cover the costs of scrapping registration fees, import tariffs, GST and stamp duty on electric vehicles, “reducing the cost of electric vehicles by around 20%”. The Greens policy comes as the Investor Group on Climate Change will also on Thursday release a new policy document setting out what institutional investors such as the major super funds see as the climate policy priorities for the Australian and New Zealand governments between now and 2022. The IGCC says from an investor perspective, three areas require action over the next four years. The first is developing durable policies that will create a pathway to a net zero emissions economy. The second is creating structures that allow the transition to be managed, including implementing stable policy, “using public sector finance to crowd in private sector investment” and pursuing mechanisms that allow a just transition for workers and business in carbon-intensive industries. The third is implementing national climate change adaptation strategies and strengthening the governance regime, including mandating climate-related disclosure requirements for companies and investors. Reflecting the impatience now endemic in the business and regulatory community after a decade of rancorous partisan warfare on climate change, the IGCC warns that investors are currently “exposed to systemic, climate-related physical, transition and litigation risks” – a message that also echoes a recent intervention by a deputy governor of Australia’s central bank. Guy Debelle issued a stark warning in the middle of March that climate change poses risks to Australia’s financial stability, and he argued that warming needed to be thought of by policymakers and business as a trend and not a cyclical event. The IGCC says a carbon price – implemented by Labor during the time of the Gillard government, and repealed by Tony Abbott in 2013, and still the epicentre of the partisan war – needs to be reinstated. “Pricing carbon embeds climate risk into the lifeblood of investment decisions,” the group says. “If carbon is priced, the cost of pollution can’t be ignored. Development of a carbon market that is transparent, liquid – many participants and free flowing trade – and focused on achieving net zero emissions will enable investors to better anticipate and plan for future carbon risks”. Labor has already released its policy for reducing emissions in the electricity sector and in the first instance will attempt to persuade the Liberals to revive their now abandoned national energy guarantee in an effort to achieve some bipartisanship. If that fails, it will pursue other measures. Shortly, the opposition will unveil the rest of its climate change policy, expected to include a trading scheme for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year; new vehicle emissions standards to bring down pollution in transport; and its final position on the use of international permits and Kyoto credits. The Greens have disavowed using Kyoto credits, which is an accounting system that allows countries to count credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris emissions reduction commitments for 2030. The Morrison government will bank a 367-megatonne contribution from carryovers as part of its recently released carbon budget, which details the emissions reductions from various programs that will be required to meet the Paris target. Labor has sent a number of public signals over recent weeks that it is unlikely to use Kyoto credits, but the opposition is expected to deploy international permits to help with the abatement task."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman readers know that after the Tagesschau (8 p.m. national news) on ARD German television, regular programming sometimes, but not very often, gets interrupted by a special news report on some sort of disaster that impacts the entire country. It takes something pretty big for this to happen.
This so-called special news report, during prime time, is called “Brennpunkt”; in English that’s “ignition-point”.
Well, we got a Brennpunkt this evening on ARD after the news – about the cold and snow that has wreaked havoc on the country and throughout Europe.
All transportation in Germany has been paralyzed or disrupted. Many trains have been idled, and numerous flights have been cancelled. Passengers are stranded everywhere.
28 people have died in Europe as a result of the cold. Temperatures are forecast to plummet to -25°C in some areas as winter’s onslaught continues unabated.
I think the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy, slated to start tomorrow, will be impacted too. It’ll go on, for sure, but some participants may be delayed. Berlin area has been hit pretty hard.
I was planning to leave by train tomorrow from Osnabrück, but with the situation as it is now, I don’t think I’ll be arriving in Berlin on time. But I’m going, and hoping the situation stabilises overnight and that I’ll manage to get there in the afternoon.
Damn global warming!

"The worsening effects of climate change and hotter, longer, drier summers are having an effect on our big summer outdoor festivals. There are the usual concerns: is there enough drinking water, sunscreen? What about shaded areas and ventilation in tents? But climate change has changed how large-scale public events run in previously unforeseen ways. Take Adelaide festival, for example, which wrapped up on Sunday. In recent years, the festival has run a venue on the River Torrens – The Palais, a floating pontoon, a nod to Adelaide’s 1920s floating dancehall, Palais de Danse, that sank in 1928. This year, the Palais was hosting events including a morning coffee and papers forum, as well as live music such as Washington and Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever.  But Rob Brookman, the festival’s executive director, says that the hot, dry summer and preceding dry winter has caused the water levels in the Torrens to fall – and that’s a worry for the pontoon. “If the level drops too far, the Palais could become bogged on the bottom and be unusable,” Brookman tells Guardian Australia. “On the other hand there is another recent climate-change related development of algal blooms in the Torrens. The only way to deal with the blooms is for the Department of Environment and Water to flush the river, which of course lifts the [water] level. So in a bizarre way we are almost hoping for an algal bloom so that the river is flushed and our pontoon stays afloat.” The opening weekend of Adelaide festival this year was marked by a heatwave, with temperatures hitting 41C. That did not deter thousands of people converging on festival sites, as well as the venues of other events such as the circus tents of the Fringe festival, trackside at Clipsal 500 or in the relatively cool, air conditioned climate of the Concert Hall. Brookman says climate change-proofing a festival does not happen overnight. “Climate change continues to be a boiling frog situation,” he says. “It’s far more gradual. The festival has dealt with all kinds of weather over the years but increasingly what we are dealing with is a less predictable pattern.” For most festivals, adjusting to climate change means managing the increasing likelihood of extreme heat. Laneway festival, an outdoor music festival that runs in Australia’s capital cities at the height of summer, has a range of measures in place to deal with extreme heat. Organiser Danny Rogers says to combat the effects of extreme weather, the festival provides free drinking water taps, “additional shade”, misting fans, “additional first aid resources”, water at stages, hoses at stages and “patron and staff messaging with weather updates, sun protection and appropriate clothing via socials, screens and staff induction pre- and during event.” Perth had a relatively mild summer but the Perth festival director, Wendy Martin, says she has been careful in her programming to account for more extreme temperatures. Five Short Blasts, an outdoor performance in Fremantle, took place at sunrise and sunset. “We do that for the beauty of the light,” Martin says. “But you don’t want to be on an open boat on a river in the middle of the day. It’s too hot and the sun is too sharp.” The festival has a large outdoor venue, the Chevron Gardens, which Martin says is only used at night. “You have to be mindful of the incredible heat when you are building venues,” she says. At the Perth writers’ festival, which occurs in February as part of Perth festival, author talks mostly take place in lecture theatres and tents in shady, tree-lined grounds of the University of Western Australia. The tents used to be air conditioned, Martin says, but the festival made the decision to use less carbon, so the tents are now open to encourage cross breezes and natural airflow. Likewise at the Byron Bay writers’ festival. Even though it’s held in winter, the weather has become increasingly unpredictable. Artistic director Edwina Johnson says, “We did make a decision to increase shaded area capacity in 2017 – more to keep our audience comfortable in all weather.” Martin says artists themselves are also tackling the themes of climate change in their shows. But not yet on the cards for Australia’s major festivals is reducing their carbon footprint by cutting the number of international acts that fly to Australia to perform. “Air travel is one of the gnarliest problems, in terms of ethical issues,” Brookman says. “Eliminating international travel would have a really deleterious effect. It would mean our world shrinks in terms of communication of culture and across borders. I always believed if you are prepared to listen to another culture’s music and read their literature it’s a lot harder to demonise and see them as the other.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterEd Caryl, author of One Of Our Hemispehere Is Missing and A Light In Siberia, brings us his latest essay. If history is an indicator, then today’s simultaneously declining PDO and AMO, in combination with a solar quiet period, mean that a “rapidly cooling situation” may be in the works, or we could even be “headed for a new ice age”.
Sunspots and Temperature
by Ed Caryl
Sunspots have been tracked systematically since 1700. Temperature has been recorded in Central England since 1659. We can compare these two records and measure the relationship. Both are plotted below.

Fig. 1: Sunspot activity and temperature
First, note that the trend lines for both temperature and sunspot number are parallel. Annual sunspots have been increasing since the Maunder Minimum at about 10 spots per century. Temperature has been increasing at about 0.4°C per century.
Sunspots drive the solar output. Here is a plot of solar irradiance as reconstructed by Judith Lean. (Lean, J. (2000). “Evolution of the Sun’s Spectral Irradiance Since the Maunder Minimum”. Geophysical Research Letters 27 (16): 2425–8. doi:10.1029/2000GL000043.)
Below, the irradiance data is plotted against the temperature data seen in Fig. 1 above. The irradiance is in watts per square meter. Notice that the since the Maunder Minimum, the irradiance as increased by almost 3 watts/m2, on the same order as the supposed recent CO2 warming.

Fig. 2: Temperature and Solar Irradiance.
Figure 3 follows, and is a scatter diagram of solar irradiance and temperature. Note that it also shows a trend of 1 degree from minimum irradiance to maximum. That also corresponds to 0.4 degrees per century.

Fig. 3: Temperature versus Irradiance
Another thing to notice is that warming takes place immediately as sunspots and irradiance increase, but cooling seems to be delayed by a few years. This is likely due to the oceans’ “flywheel” effect on land temperatures, as has been noted by Juraj Vanovcan here. The oceans take a long time to react to solar influence.
What does this say about the future?
The land temperature at the end of the Maunder Minimum was still falling after 50 years of no sunspots and minimum irradiance. During the Dalton Minimum from 1800 to 1835, it took almost 20 years for the Central England temperature to react by cooling. Other cooling events, in 1740 and 1880, have happened faster. The reaction time depends on timing with ocean cycles.
The Dalton Minimum took place during a high point in the PDO, but the PDO was falling in 1880. At this time, 2010, PDO has fallen, and AMO is starting to fall. With the solar cycle staying low, we may be in for a rapidly cooling situation.

What is the current irradiance? It is 2 watts/square meter below the minimum shown by Judith Lean, above. Hopefully there is a 2 watts/square meter offset error in her 2000 reconstruction, or we are headed for a new ice age.

Fig. 4: Solar Irradiance Trend. Source: here.
What about CO2? According to the U. K. Met Office, the rise in the Central England temperature record after 1974, “has been adjusted to allow for urban warming”. They don’t reveal what those adjustments were, so that portion of the record should be taken with a grain of salt, especially the last 10 years. No other evidence of anthropogenic temperature rise can be seen.

This is the real deal, with speakers like Fred Singer, Nir Shaviv and Henrik Svensmark on the roster.
More information here: 3rd International Energy and Climate Conference.
This conference is taking place concurrently with the United Nations Conference of Climate in Cancún. But in Berlin, leading international scientists in the fields of climate and energy will present the latest science and findings on climate and energy, and not the usual worn-out scare stories and dread.
This year will also include aspects of climate policy and their impacts. The conference thus covers a wide spectrum of natural science topics and the social-political impacts of energy policy.

Fred Singer 
I hope some readers here in Germany can still find a way to attend. I think it’ll be a highly worthwhile and interesting conference. Berlin is also lovely during Christmas-time – though it might be a good idea to leave the high-spending spouses home :).

I’m planning on attending – I just have a couple of small matters to settle, and hope it works out. But I expect to be there.
If any NoTricksZone readers plan to attend, send me an e-mail. Maybe we can all get together (first round of beer is on me!). That’s a limited offer! Anyway, as a blogger I hope to provide reports on news that will hopefully pop up. Looking at the following details, it sure looks like a good time to me.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I mentioned here how Stefan Rahmstorf spends more time organising PR campaigns than he does doing science (understandable I guess, as crystal ball gazing takes only a few minutes per day).
It took less than a day for him to confirm this observation.
EIKE posted here yesterday that ZDF television did a Frontal drive-by-shooting on the climate skeptics, particularly EIKE, and the Berlin Climate Conference, which took place last weekend. Of course, as is the case with all such attack reports of this kind, there’s always the same unhappy and increasingly nervous person behind it: Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research.
I was wondering what German readers think of the following ZDF clip:

Keep in mind that while almost all serious scientists say the sea level will rise around 30 cm over the next 90 years, Rahmstorf is one of the few oddballs who’s way out in left field, with a couple of other kooks like Al Gore, claiming sea levels will rise 1.4 meters or more.
Unfortunately for him, Jason/Topex shows a clear deceleration of sea level rise over the last years.
I’m wondering what the German readers think of the Frontal report.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago, biofuels were vigorously pushed with great enthusiasm and urgency by environmentalist groups, for example Greenpeace here:
Instead of cutting tax on fuels that wreck the climate, Gordon Brown should use this week’s budget to boost genuine green fuels like biodiesel, hydrogen and green electricity.
And Greenpeace here:
Although the plant-based fuel is not pollution-free, it is significantly cleaner than its petro equivalent and causes just half the damage to the climate.
Or take a look at this April 2007 Greenpeace Fact Sheet here. And so it was with many environmental groups.
And as a result, governments, pressured by the enviro-groups, and ever so eager to rescue the planet from the imminent climate catastrophe, went hog wild implementing programs and subsidies to launch the biofuels boom. The targets were ambitious.
By 2020 9.5% of Europe’s demand for fuel by its transportation sector would be supplied by biofuels made from climate-friendly sources like oilseed, palm oil, sugar cane or sugar beet. It became a boom for Europe’s agriculture. Thousands of farmers have since invested heavily in new agricultural machinery.
The race to be the greenest in Europe, and the whole world, was on.  The science of global warming was settled after all, and biofuels were a big part of the answer. Europe would lead the way in the planet’s rescue and be the hero.
Things have since gone terribly wrong.

Now, it turns out, according to the newest study (by the very groups that spurred the madness on to begin with), Europe’s targets are going to have the opposite effect on the planet. Fulfilling its biofuels plan will mean converting 69,000 square km of forests into agricultural land – that’s an area twice the size of Belgium.
Not surprisingly, few bothered to question the science behind global warming and the possible impacts biofuels would have on the earth’s ecosystems and food markets. Those  who did, were vilified and slapped down. Us sceptics are all too familiar with that.
Today the German online Mananger Magazine reports here:
According to a new study, the planned expansion of agricultural land for biolfuel will damage the climate more than the fossil energies they are supposed to replace. Millions of tonnes more CO2 have been released as a result.
Manager Magazine writes that nine major environmental organisations have commented on a new study put out by the London-based Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) saying biofuels will produce far more CO2 instead of less.
The growing use of biofuels in Europe will lead to an increase in climate damaging CO2 emissions because huge tracts of land will have to be transformed into agricultural crop fields worldwide to supply the needed biofuel.
IEEP researchers studied the official renewable energy plans of the 23 EU member countries up to 2020. Germany will be mixing 5.5 million tonnes of biofuel with its gasoline and diesel fuel.
As a result this means that annually up to 56 million tonnes of CO2 will emitted. That equals an additional 12 to 26 million cars on Europe’s streets.
A far more damning commentary appears here at the European Voice:
The next time Europe comes up with an idea to save the planet – run!!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Guardian frets that Obama’s schemes to curb “greenhouse” gases in the USA are dead, as “a slew of new climate change deniers” enter Congress. Read here Barack Obama’s green agenda crushed at the ballot box.
The whining and moaning by the Guardian is something to cherish and a must read.
Hopefully these new climate deniers joining Congress will slap USA lawmakers back awake to reality and get the government to focus on the real problems that demand immediate attention, like run-away deficits and  unemployment.
Even Obama now sees Crap & Trade as a useless venture.  The Guardian writes:
Obama in his post-election press conference indicated he was giving up on the idea of sweeping climate and energy legislation in the remaining two years of his term. He said he hoped to find compromise with Republicans on areas like fuel efficiency or electric cars. ‘Cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way,” he told reporters at the White House “I’m going to be looking for other means to address this problem.’
A little hope and change for Obama? Recall the change in direction by Bill Clinton in 1994. And here’s the part I like:
The new crop of Republican leaders in the house are way ahead of Palin, with plans for sweeping investigations of climate science and of Obama administration officials such as Lisa Jackson, who heads the EPA.
As far as the leaders are concerned, the science of climate change is far from settled. “We’re going to want to have a do-over,” Darrell Issa, a favourite to head the house oversight and investigations committee, told a recent interviewer.
Rep. Issa, let’s get it all out on the table where everyone can see it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI thought this kind of stuff didn’t happen way down there in the tropical Caribbean. All that global-warming-caused cold seems to be spreading everywhere.
The German online Die Zeit today has a video clip here, and writes:
According to meteorologists, it was the coldest December on the Carribean island in 50 years. In some regions the temperature fell to 1.9°C.”
In the clip one man is quoted as saying that 15°C is already cold for Cuba. The Head Cuban Meteorologist says “the weather is going to get more extreme and that hurricanes will be stronger”. Yeah yeah. The clip then adds:
Most Cubans can’t recall ever having such cold weather.”

Last winter was also a harsh one in Cuba. Last January, 26 patients at a psychiatric hospital in Havana died as a result of cold weather, so reports the M&C News here. But we can’t really blame climate change for that, now can we? There are accusations that the hospital was too poorly equipped to care for the patients. M&C reports:
Cuba provides free universal health care. The communist state admits that its system is in a poor state, but blames the US trade embargo, which makes it difficult to import medical supplies and equipment.
Sure – blame warming for all the cold, and so let’s blame US capitalism for failed socialism too. You Canadians may want to go elsewhere for your holidays this winter.
Cold In India
It’s also has been very cold in India too. The Swiss 20 min reports of “extreme cold”.  20min writes:
Alone in the state of Uttar Pradesh 24 people have died over the last days, reports the newspaper the «Times of India» on Monday. There were three additioonal deaths in the Indian part of Kaschmir, where temperatures on -23°C were measured over the weekend. According to forecasts by meteorologists.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel reports here on the latest ideas from climate activists to revitalize the stalled climate movement, which has run aground over the last year – thanks to Climategate and gross errors in the 2007 IPCC report. Hat-tip oekowatch.org.
Yawn – a “loser topic”
Surveys have found that the population is bored by the issue as a whole, and show that a majority of the public is not even interested in climate change. The topic is too technical, too dry and something that’s 100 years out into the future.
Der Spiegel writes that just one third of Dutch people are concerned about climate change, even though the country is highly vulnerable to rising sea levels! Der Spiegel writes:
Earlier, the telephone rang off the hook whenever we had extreme weather, recalls Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Now hardly anyone calls anymore. Climate has become a ‘loser topic’, he told a ‘Tagesspiegel’ editor on the German TV news program ‘Panorama’.”
Calls for the use of shock, emotion, sex and advocacy journalism
So what do you do to revitalise a dud issue? You repackage the product and re-market it. Der Spiegel piece presents the ideas that activists want to use to get the issue back into the headlines and in people’s minds.

According to the report, some activists want to use emotion, sex, critical debate, improved communication and a new scientific language to better communicate with the public. These are some of the less spectacular methods. Others are calling for more controversial methods, such as advocacy journalism. Der Spiegel writes:
Climate activists are currently financing million dollar training programs for environmental journalists. The target is to promote journalism that is interest-related.”
But experts warn this could backfire as the line between science and advertising becomes blurred. This could make the science even less credible than it is now (as impossible as that may seem).
A climate Martin Luther King /  and where’s Al Gore?
One particularly odd strategy activists are pushing for is the search for a charismatic Messiah. Der Spiegel writes:
A Messiah is needed: Like Martin Luther King spurred the black movement, we now need a climate-Messiah, so believes environmemtal scientist Andreas Ernst of the University of Kassel. The message could be something like: “I have a nightmare“. Al Gore, who for awhile played the role and won a Nobel Prize for his moving film, is hardly ever seen anymore.”
A Climate Messiah?  “I have a nightmare”?  Al Gore?
Folks, it’s over. What they need is Brünnhilde in Götterdämmerung.

"Our food makes up something like a quarter of our greenhouse gas footprint, and at the same time as cutting this we need to feed a growing population better than we are doing now, while rescuing our haemorrhaging biodiversity and avoiding an antibiotics crisis. There is no escaping the clear evidence that humans need to reduce their meat – especially beef and lamb – as well as dairy consumption. When we feed a soya bean to a cow, we get back only about 10% of the nutrition in beef, and it comes with a hefty dose of methane (a powerful greenhouse gas) and very likely some deforestation.  But there is no requirement for us to go all the way to either vegetarianism or veganism – it is all about the proportions. We do not even need to make all the changes overnight. We just need to start chipping away so that the proportions in our diets change radically over the next 10 or so years. And most of us can use this as an opportunity to eat more healthily.  Here is an inconvenient reality: a long-distance plane will typically burn though about 100 tonnes of fuel, turning it into almost four times that weight in carbon dioxide. Because of some complex high-altitude effects, the climate change impact of this is perhaps double what it would be if we burned that fuel on the runway. There are three options: biofuel (but the strain on our land is huge), synthetic fuels generated using solar power (but we already need all the solar power we can get), and fossil fuel counterbalanced with a mechanism for taking carbon back out of the air (but we do not yet know how to do this properly, and when we find out, we will already need to be doing this as fast as we can to mitigate non-flying climate impacts). Short-distance electric flights are almost becoming feasible but the need to save weight means that at the moment liquid hydrocarbons are the only suitable fuel for a long-haul flight. So, a bit of flying is still OK, but not as much.  Today’s global energy supply is only one seven-thousandth of the energy from the sun that lands on the planet. An area of solar panels 228 sq miles in a sunny part of the world could harness our entire global energy supply. Neither the cost nor the resource use is prohibitive. There are issues of distribution and storage, but the solutions to these problems are also coming along nicely.  The precise energy mix – plenty of solar with significant bits of wind, hydro and tidal – will vary from place to place. Australia has 200 times more sunlight per person than the UK, which is the fifth worst major country in the world on the sunlight per person stakes (ahead of Bangladesh, Belgium, the Netherlands and Rwanda). But the UK has better wind and tidal potential than most, so its energy mix will be more complex. To summarise, the transition is technically feasible if we invest enough, cap fossil fuels and moderate our energy consumption. With the right investment (made possible through redistribution from fossil fuels, and through a carbon tax, say) it is totally feasible to replace our energy supply over the next three decades. Somehow the world’s fossil fuel needs to stay in the ground. For that to happen it needs to be too expensive to extract. That requires a carbon price. I think the simplest way to achieve that is a carbon tax, although I would be happy with a cap and trade arrangement too – they have the same effect. A tax could be administered at the point of extraction, but it is also possible to levy it at the point of consumption – such as the household meter and the petrol station. What we are talking about is the creation of a huge pot of money that would fund the new green energy infrastructure, assist the countries and individuals that would otherwise stand to be losers in the transition to the low-carbon world, as well as support a suite of social and environmental goods.  Twelve billion careful people could live well together on our wonderful planet. One billion careless people can trash the place in no time. It is not just about the number of people, it is about how they live. It takes about 500 Malawians to clock up the carbon footprint of just one person in the UK. Every additional birth increases the need for everyone else to be slightly more careful. So is it bad to have kids? No. Is it responsible to have a big family? Perhaps not any more. Does it matter what lifestyle my children have? Absolutely. There are two aspects to the way people can make a difference. The first is to personally embark on more traditional low-carbon and sustainable living. It is still as important as ever because it brings integrity to everything else we do, it demonstrates commitment and, if done well, it makes it easier for everyone else to do likewise. The second is to push for the cultural and political change that we need, in every situation: how we influence our politicians (not just through our votes), and the things we say and do at work, at leisure and perhaps most challenging of all, at home. Grassroots pressure can change politics – the youth organisation Sunrise Movement has had remarkable success in pushing for the proposal of a Green New Deal in the US, forcing every Democratic hopeful to speak out on the climate. And two decades ago, the Jubilee 2000 campaign was widely credited with the cancelling of debt in developing countries.  After decades of talk and negotiation on climate change, years of personal actions and corporate targets, a mass of rhetoric, greenwash and, to be fair, occasional flashes of sincere action from the business world, there has been no dent whatsoever in the rising global carbon curve. Nothing at all. Talking about it has not been enough. Asking for it has not worked. Somehow, we have to insist. I think it needs to be thoughtfully done. The tone needs to be constructive: it is a better world we are pushing for and certainly not a violent one. How and where to take to the streets must be a deeply personal decision. But given where we have got to, and I do not write this lightly, it has to be one that each of us carefully asks. Mike Berners-Lee is the author of There is No Planet B. He is a professor at Lancaster University and the director of Small World Consulting."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe warmists continue to stay in denial about why the public isn’t buying the hoax, refusing to come to terms with the sloppy climate data behind the flakey AGW theory. Instead they prefer pretending that the public’s lack of acceptance is due to faulty communication, as illustrated by this video of Rutgers University professor Tony Broccoli.
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6L4jTypQKY&hl=de_DE&fs=1]
Read here at the Yale Forum On Climate Change And The Media.
It has finally dawned on the warmists that they’ve seriously underestimated the public’s ability to understand the issue. They’re dismayed that the public was smart enough as a whole not to fall for the hoax.
But they still think they can maybe turn things around by “communicating better”. which only means packaging and delivering the hoax in a diferent way. Now warm and extreme events are going to be called “teachable moments”. Cold and non-warming events will remain natural variability, I suppose.
Well, it’s not going to work.
Once a person sees through a hoax, there’s no way to make them go back and believe it. And it gets a lot harder the next time around because the trust is gone.
Finally, you just have got to love the question from Peach to Broccoli:
Let’s say I’m a journalist who knows nothing about climate science because all of the environmental reporters at my paper or station have been laid off. Do you have tips for me on how to grapple with climate change?
My advice: Wake up from the hoax and find real stories you know something about so that you yourself do not join the rest of the redundant journalists. View them as “teachable moments”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to climate models of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Potsdam Germany, the recent cold winters in Europe  are caused by low sea ice extent (due to AGW) in the Barents and Kara Seas. Juraj Vanovcan now has an essay that shows the opposite seems to be true. 
Debunking PIK’s Low Barents/Kara Sea Ice – Cold Winters Claim
By guest writer Juraj Vanovcan
In dealing with three consecutive cold winters in NW Europe, orthodox climatology is now doing all it can to avoid mentioning the changing trends in NAO/AO and the cooling Atlantic. Instead, various bizarre theories have been floated out – from the Big Oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico slowing down the Gulf Stream, to tremendous melting of Greenland ice sheets having the same effect. They all ignore the fact that the Gulf Stream is powered by tropical trade winds.
Fig 1 Selected areas for investigating the low ice extent – cold winter hypothesis
Another tactic that warmists have used for damage control is claiming that low sea ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea may cause changes in air circulation, thus allowing cold Arctic air to pour down to the mid-latitudes. But this theory is dubious, as we shall see. It is the prevailing direction of air circulation and not the “increased greenhouse effect” that rules the European winters.
Such attempts to tie the cold with warm elsewhere, here the alleged decrease of ice cover in a part of the Arctic, reminds us of Kevin Trenberth’s search for the “missing heat”.
Climate data are freely available via KNMI Climate Explorer, so let’s investigate the PIK claim.
Figure 1 shows the area of Barents and Kara Sea (65-80N, 10-100E), and North-West Europe (45-70N, 10W-15E), where it is being claimed low winter ice extent there is causing low winter temperatures and snow in Europe.
Figure 2 shows winter (D-J-F) ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea, combined with winter temperature anomalies over the Northwest Europe.

Figure 2  Barents/Kara winter sea extent and NW Europe winters, 1979-2010.

Eyeballing the relation between those two curves, there is a relation, but the opposite of what is claimed by PIK! For example, low winter sea ice extent in 2007 and 2008 were tied with mild European winters. Also cold winters in the mid-1980s happened despite rather high ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea. Figure 3 as follows shows the two parameters in direct relation:

Figure 3  Relation between Barents/Kara winter sea ice extent and NW European winters, 1979-2010.
Mathematicians could argue about the statistical significance of observed trend, but the trend itself is rather logical: Cold Barents/Kara Sea with more ice means cold winters in Northwest Europe. One does not know yet, where the 2010/2011 winter plot will appear on the graph above, but even if it is an outlier it will not change the overall trend.
The claim that cold European winters are caused by low ice extent in Barents and Kara Sea is therefore not supported by observed data.
Since the Arctic ice extent depends mainly on North Atlantic SST, as presented elsewhere, there is a good chance that in near future we will see remarkable growth. Figure 4 shows the North Pacific and North Atlantic SST monthly anomalies, based on Reynolds OI.v2 dataset.

Figure 4:  Monthly SST anomalies for North Pacific and North Atlantic since 1982.
There seems to be a 1-year lag between the two plots, with the Atlantic trailing the Pacific SST trend. Warm SST peak in Atlantic, observed in 2010, seems to mimic similar event in North Pacific in 2009. But Pacific SST have since dropped to levels seen only in the 80s. If the Atlantic follows, then 2011 summer sea ice extent may see a considerable gain.
Future attempts to explain increasing Arctic ice cover with warming somewhere else will no doubt raise more amusement and doubts about the ”scientific consensus”.

"The strong showing for independents and Greens on Sydney’s north shore in the New South Wales election, and the likely win for Labor in Coogee, have buoyed the two most high-profile independents contesting Sydney seats in the federal election. The independent MP for the federal seat of Wentworth, Kerryn Phelps, said the results showed the electorate was interested in strong female candidates and that climate change remained a major vote-changing issue. Phelps, who won the blue ribbon Liberal seat in October following the retirement of Malcolm Turnbull, will be contesting it again in May. The Olympian Zali Steggall is running against another former prime minister, Tony Abbott, in the northern beaches federal seat of Warringah. It is also regarded as a historically safe Liberal seat, but Abbott’s role in opposing his own party’s policies on climate change have turned off some voters in the affluent electorate. Phelps said she did not want to read too much into the state results. “There’s a big difference between the federal Liberal party and the moderate state Liberals,” she said. “But I think it shows that in the eastern suburbs climate change is a big issue, and it was said to be a big issue in Coogee.” On Sunday morning Coogee seemed likely to be the only Sydney seat to fall to Labor, although the outcome remained uncertain. The electorate overlaps with the southern part of Wentworth. The Labor candidate, Marjorie O’Neill, ran heavily on the party’s plans to address climate change at state level. “The Liberal party does not have a story to tell about how they will address climate change – in fact the story is inaction,” Phelps said. “There are people in the federal Liberals who want to continue with coal and fossil fuels, and the party depends on donations from the coal industry,” she said. “We also have to listened to the younger generation. I attended the Town Hall school rally and an in-school rally at Emmanuel college. Young people are very well informed on climate change science – they have read the IPCC reports – and they want action,” she said. Vaucluse, the other state seat overlapping with Wentworth, recorded a 5.6% swing to the Greens. Steggall said the re-election of the Berejiklian government had clarified an important local issue: the building of a tunnel from the northern beaches to alleviate congestion on the Spit Bridge. Both she and Abbott support the tunnel, but Steggall said she wanted to ensure that environmental concerns about the stacks were properly addressed. “The tunnel is Tony Abbott’s only policy, and it’s a state issue,” Steggall said. “A 13.8% swing away from the Liberals shows that the electorate wants change, and James Griffin [the Liberal MP for Manly] is a moderate and quite sensible,” she said. She also noted the 10% swing against the Liberal MP, Felicity Wilson, in North Shore, where the Mosman mayor Carolyn Corrigan won more than 20% of the primary vote as an independent. The seat overlaps with the Mosman part of Warringah."

"Prevention is better than the cure. No, it is not an argument about the merits of late-70s goth bands, but a medieval wisdom that seems to get more apposite with every year. Indeed, it is an idea that is not only relevant to human health, as the Upside team found out this week. When it comes to terrorism, Kenya is discovering that preventing radicalisation is a far better option than trying to “cure” it, as Jason Burke reported. With animal extinctions, of course, there is no cure, so it is prevention or nothing. New research has suggested a rather brutal way to forestall the extinction of about 10% of the world’s threatened species. Preventing climate change will likely be a much more effective strategy than trying to reverse it further down the line. There is much to be done. But at least some numbers are moving in the right direction, as per the latest data from the UK this week. Contraception is arguably one of the biggest prevention programmes in the history of mankind, though it has of course been womankind that has largely shouldered the burden. But for how much longer? And finally, when it comes to mental health, prevention is an essential part of the strategy. Fortunately there are a dizzying array of digital tools to help with this now. Ammar Kalia found out if they are any good. The CNN article about the Kenyan teacher who gives away 80% of his salary to the poor – and has now been rewarded with a $1m prize. Also, this surprising Vox article about what happened when Ecuador legalised gangs. What do you think happened – did the murder rate go up or down? The mentoring program in Mombasa is an interesting approach. You might also want to know about the Friends Church Peace Team, led by Peter Serete, which works in areas of conflict to create cultures of cooperation and non-violence. I believe they have a Facebook presence. Margaret Katranides, via email On the article about mental health apps, a few things really stood out as things we see as well: • People love the anonymity. • You *CAN* help people through an app, but you are always limited • Any “unnatural” mistake in conversation feels very jarring to the end user. • It doesn’t have to be about treatment but can be about boosting *everyday* mental health (this is what we promote -- be a little more content / a little happier, vs. “treat a disease”) Mike Nolet from LiveBetter, via email In south London, where a fine piece of investigative reporting by my colleague Harriet Grant resulted in an egregious injustice – a ban on poor children using a playground – being overturned.

"Faced with unprecedented challenges, politicians appear more divided than ever – that’s why Labour’s Clive Lewis and I are doing something bold. We are jointly tabling a bill in parliament designed to address two of the greatest threats we face – climate breakdown and spiralling inequality. Our bill would introduce a “green new deal” – an unprecedented mobilisation of resources invested to prevent climate breakdown, reverse inequality, and heal our communities. It demands major structural changes in our approach to the ecosystem, coupled with a radical transformation of the finance sector and the economy, to deliver both social justice and a livable planet. It’s an idea congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has recently reinvigorated in the US. And it could scarcely be more urgent. The UN’s top scientists have warned we have just 11 years to halve global emissions and avoid climate catastrophe. Global wildlife populations have collapsed by nearly 60% in our lifetimes. This has led 1.4 million young people to join the inspiring global school strikes movement to demand change. The response from ministers? To continue to force fracking on local communities, and to hand millions in tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry. Last week, unbelievably, a new coal mine was given a green-light on their watch.  The UK is also host to grotesque levels of inequality. More than 4 million children are living in poverty. Two-thirds of the country’s highest earners live in London and the south-east, while northern areas have been hit hardest by austerity and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says incomes of the poorest 20% fell in 2018. The prime minister’s announcement that austerity is coming to an end was a lie. Benefits for the poorest remain frozen, millions are still struggling to get by on universal credit, and headteachers are still having to cut crucial staff to keep the lights on in our schools. The response to these crises must be nothing short of a transformation of our economy, our environment and our constituents’ lives. The green new deal would launch an unprecedented programme of investment in clean energy, warm homes, affordable public transport, sustainable farming, and restored natural habitats – delivering a decent, well-paid job to everyone who wants one. It would force the government to finally start paying attention to once proud communities that have been hollowed out through de-industrialisation and austerity – and empower them to take up the opportunities of new zero-carbon industries. This once-in-a-lifetime government intervention would involve a 10-year strategy to completely and rapidly decarbonise our economy – as well as massively reduce economic inequality. It is not good enough to tinker with the status quo – we must reprogramme our economy so that it works for everyone. It’s about sharing our country’s wealth fairly and acknowledging that our planet’s finite resources cannot magically regenerate in an instant. This is purposely radical territory. We must push the boundaries of what is seen as politically possible. Because climate justice and social justice go hand in hand. It is the poorest who will bear the brunt of the fires, the floods, the storms and the droughts that come with climate breakdown, and it is the forests and wildlife of the global south that are being devastated to generate profits for the global north. And it is the young who will pay the highest price for our generation’s throwaway economy. Greater market regulation will be key to tackling the terrifying threat of planetary collapse. We have always known that markets can only thrive if they are managed and accountable to the societies in which they operate. Once monetary and financial systems regain their role as servants – not masters – to the real economy, then it will be possible to mobilise the financial resources to support the most urgent of challenges: the transformation of the economy away from its dependence on carbon, creating hundreds of thousands of good-quality jobs in the process. We know it can be done, because it has been done before, when singlehandedly, and almost overnight on the day of his inauguration, President Roosevelt dismantled the globalised financial system known as the gold standard. This freed his administration from the shackles of Wall Street and enabled him to tackle the ecological crisis that was the dust bowl, as well as America’s crisis of unemployment. In this moment of crisis, political idleness is unforgivable. When it comes to climate breakdown and spiralling inequality, doing nothing has consequences. By choosing to incentivise business as usual, to withhold investment from our communities, our government is robbing our young people of a future. Instead MPs from all parties must choose action – not to score political points or to make the other side look bad – but to deliver the hope people need. Parliament must get behind our bill to deliver a green new deal. • Caroline Lucas is the MP for Brighton Pavilion"

" Cuts to carbon emissions from vehicle efficiency standards have been left out of government projections for meeting Australia’s Paris climate commitments, indicating the policy has been shelved. The office of the transport minister, Michael McCormack, said the government had not made a decision on “how or when” standards to cut carbon pollution from vehicles might be implemented.  After almost five years of submissionsa spokesman said the government “is not going to rush into a regulatory solution” with regards to vehicle emissions. New data shows Australia’s emissions from transport are soaring and projected to be 82% higher in 2030 than they were in 1990. Australia lags behind the rest of the world in setting vehicle efficiency standards, with most countries in the OECD adopting policies to reduce emissions and improve the efficiency of cars. The ministerial forum on vehicle emissions was set up under the Turnbull government in 2015, and stakeholders are frustrated at the lack of progress. Fact sheets produced by the government that set out how it intends to reach Australia’s emissions reduction targets under the Paris agreement suggest any policy on vehicle emissions standards has been abandoned. In 2015, the government produced a graph indicating it expected to achieve cuts of about 100m tonnes between 2020 and 2030 through vehicle emissions standards. The government’s latest climate package contains no mention of this, and projects only about 10m tonnes of abatement through an electric vehicle strategy, with no reference to vehicle emissions standards. The Victorian government asked what progress had been made on vehicle standards at the December meeting of environment ministers, but its questions were dismissed, sources told Guardian Australia. Environment groups and the automotive lobby have asked for clarity before the election. The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, said it had hoped for more progress towards cleaning up the “woefully dirty” national car fleet. “But 18 months of radio silence and the removal of proposed standards from pollution abatement estimates out to 2030 strongly suggests the government now has no intention of establishing them.” In 2017, interest groups consulted as part of the ministerial forum were sent a model proposing a standard of 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre for Australian light vehicles, phased in from 2020 to 2025. The proposal would have brought Australia broadly into line with vehicle standards in the US and was forecast to deliver a net economic benefit of $13.9bn. But it faced opposition from the National party and the automotive lobby, and was painted as a carbon tax on cars. The independent senator Tim Storer, who chaired a Senate inquiry into electric vehicles last year, said the lack of progress was “embarrassing”, given there was “clear evidence of cost benefit” in bringing in the standards. Labor’s climate policy, due to be announced soon, is expected to point to a target of 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre. The Greens have proposed vehicle emissions standards “that lead up to a complete ban on new internal combustion vehicles by 2030”. The chief executive of the Australian Automobile Association, Michael Bradley, said the industry wanted both sides of politics to make their positions clear, but the AAA remained opposed to the 2017 model. “We’re supportive of an emissions standard but we’re supportive of one that’s reflective of Australians’ vehicle preferences and our market,” Bradley said. A spokesman for McCormack said the ministerial forum was exploring ways to encourage the uptake of electric and low emissions vehicles. “The government has not made a decision on how or when noxious emission or fuel efficiency standards may be implemented,” he said. “It is interested in developing a sensible framework that places savings for motorists and health benefits for the community front and centre while ensuring that the vehicles that Australians enjoy and love remain in the market.” He added: “The government is not going to rush into a regulatory solution, especially where it has the potential to increase the up-front costs of motor vehicles for Australians”. Much of the focus on Australia’s carbon emissions has been on the electricity sector. But climate scientists and environment groups have been calling for more attention to carbon pollution from other industries. Transport accounts for 18% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions, making it the second largest source. Modelling produced by climate scientist Bill Hare for the Australian Conservation Foundation shows emissions from transport are climbing fast and are projected to be 82% higher in 2030 than they were in 1990. Cars represent the largest source of transport emissions and have grown by 25% since 1990. Nearly 80% of new light duty vehicles sold globally, including in China, Japan, India, UK, the US and the EU, are subject to emission or fuel economy standards, while Australia has failed to implement any policy. “Australia is almost alone in not having any motor vehicle emissions standards for carbon dioxide and/or vehicle efficiency standards for litres per 100km,” Hare said. “That means that vehicles in Australia are much more inefficient and more costly to run than in the US or Europe or Japan.” Sarah Fumei, the project manager for ClimateWorks, said the federal government’s own estimates showed emissions from the transport sector would grow by a further 9% from 2018 to 2030. She said introducing standards would be “a win-win policy” for the environment and motorists’ hip pockets. “The Australian government should implement the strongest standard put forward in the 2016 Regulatory Impact Statement, which by 2030 would save motorists $500 a year on fuel and reduce emissions by 12m tonnes,” she said. “Weaker standards will not achieve the same benefits.”    "
"New analysis shows 22 of Australia’s largest companies are actively working to undermine the Paris agreement targets, betting shareholders’ money on strategies that assume global climate change action fails. Investor action group Market Forces says those companies – worth a combined $121bn and representing 7% of the ASX300 – are “out of line and out of time” and has called on shareholders to divest their holdings.  The group’s legal analyst, Will van de Pol, said it was the first time Market Forces had “named names” and called out companies whose business strategies relied on the world failing to meet the Paris targets to restrict the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. “A handful of Australian companies are undermining efforts to limit global warming by pursuing new fossil fuel projects, or basing their business plans on energy projection scenarios that would doom the Paris agreement to failure,” the report says. “These companies have now been given more than three years to align their business with the Paris goals, but have dismissed the notion.” The list of “uninvestables” includes mainly resource and energy companies, but also diversified investment vehicles including WH Soul Pattinson and Seven Group Holdings. The Market Forces study found that 199 ASX300 companies, representing 64% of total market capitalisation, faced heightened transitional climate risk but had not yet demonstrated business strategies consistent with the Paris agreement. There were 143 companies with policies “not overtly inconsistent with Paris”, and just eight had aligned their strategy with the agreement. Three companies – AGL, Origin and BHP – earned a reprieve from the list of the worst offenders, despite acting in a similar manner, because Market Forces said they had shown some progress towards aligning their goals with Paris. In recent years, the boardroom has become an increasingly important front for climate activism. This month, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, announced it would divest from firms that explored for oil and gas. Last month, Glencore said it would no longer back new coalmines in response to investor calls for the company to act on climate change. Pressure is also increasing on Australian companies, though many still refuse to even consider the financial risk posed to their businesses by climate change. In September, a report from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said “the law requires” relevant companies to “include a discussion of climate risk” in their annual report. In February, the Asic corporate governance council released new recommendations that directors and companies should make climate risk disclosures. The Market Forces report singled out “coal cowboys” Whitehaven and New Hope, which it said had plans to establish new coalmines, or expand existing ones, based on forecasts that assume the failure of Paris. Oil and gas companies Woodside, Santos and Oil Search had each “faced increased investor engagement over climate change in recent years, but this has done nothing to dissuade their plans to increase fossil fuel production”, the report said. “Investors determined to play their part in the fight against runaway climate change must immediately reallocate capital away from these companies.”"
"From Cyclone Idai, which has killed hundreds in south-east Africa, to flooding in Bangladesh – where my family is from – for decades climate change has been devastating communities in the global south. More recently these effects have begun to be felt by people in the UK too: just last month, wildfires raged on Saddleworth Moor, while where I live in Brixton, the air is so polluted I suffer from breathing problems. We all know that the impact of climate change is felt unequally, depending on where you live, how wealthy you are and how easily you can shield yourself from its effects. Less widely known, however, is that responsibility for the crisis is unequal too. In recent years we have been sold a lie: that ordinary people are to blame for the climate crisis. It’s our spending and our consumption habits that have created the mess we’re in, we are told, not the bankers, oil companies and a rich elite.  French president Emmanuel Macron’s fuel tax, which sparked the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement into life, exemplified this approach. The tax attacked the rural working poor – ordinary people are being pitted against planet. But there is another way. The truth is that the crises we face – economic, social and ecological – are the fault of an economic system that serves the few, not the majority. The rich have become richer, while austerity has hollowed out Britain, and the ecosystems sustaining life have been devastated. At the pinnacle of this system stands the fossil fuel industry. A report last year showed that just 100 companies have been responsible for over 70% of the world’s carbon emissions since 1988. The fossil fuel industry has wrecked the planet, while enacting violence and devastation across the global south. They brought about this crisis, and they should be the ones to pay for it. But fossil fuel companies aren’t the only ones to blame here. These companies are only able to finance their mines and oilfields with the help of banks. And believe it or not, these banks are increasing their financing for fossil fuel companies. A decade ago they crashed the economy; now they’re crashing the planet. According to the Banking on Climate Change report, the worst offender in Europe is Barclays. Since the Paris agreement was signed at the end of 2015, Barclays has funded the fossil fuel industry to the tune of $85bn, from fracking and coal here in Britain to the Dakota Access pipeline in North America. In each case this funding has been integral to fossil fuel companies undertaking ecocidal projects, sometimes forcefully, against the wishes of local communities. If we can pressure Barclays into stopping its fossil fuel finance, we will throw a spanner in the workings of a capitalist machine intent on extracting profit by any means, even at the expense of the planet. That’s why today, Momentum members around the country are launching a new campaign to bankrupt climate change and stop Barclays funding the fossil fuel industry. With over 40 creative direct actions planned at Barclays branches on the first day of the campaign alone, we will put huge political pressure on the bank to end its key role in financing climate chaos. In doing so, we are drawing on a rich history of protest. In the 1980s British students campaigned for Barclays to withdraw from apartheid South Africa – and won. More recently French campaigners successfully pressured banks into stopping funding coal projects. And just last month, renters’ unions across the UK, including Acorn, forced NatWest to drop a policy discriminating against welfare claimants. Our campaign can succeed too, especially in the context of an upsurge in climate activism. From the inspiring youth climate strikes, to the push for structural change by the Sunrise Movement in the US and Labour for a Green New Deal in the UK, people across the world are demanding not just the decarbonisation of our economies, but the transformation of the very basis of our societies too. Ordinary people will no longer accept the many being punished for the crimes of the few who caused the climate crisis. Instead, we’re pointing the finger squarely at the oil barons, the fossil fuel executives, and the corporate elites – and demanding something better. • Seema Syeda is a Momentum activist based in London"

When people believe they have ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE, with no test in reality, this is how they behave.
Every judgement in science stands on the edge of error, and is personal.

Hopefully other blogs, especially those who can really make a difference, can join in as well. We are only asking for a voice in the discussion, that’s all.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m just the messenger, so don’t beat the crap out of me! Blame global warming for all the cold that’s in the pipeline.
Here are the temperature forecasts for the next 16 days for most continents and regions. Many are forecast to be below normal. As you click on each link below, you’re going to be seeing blue (except for Canada). But in the period 10-18 January, Canada too is going to cool down from a dark red to a pink.
East Asia will shiver in January. See link below. 
Now I am going out on a limb by saying these temperature conditions will extend through much of the month of January and February, with zones shifting here and there, thanks to La Nina.
All in all I heard Joe Bastardi forecast here December global temps to drop to about +0.15 to 0.20 above the normal. I say expect a similar drop for January, meaning we’ll be in negative territory. Same goes for February. There just seems to be lots of cold out there.
Here are the color-coded temperature forecasts for much of the land mass on the globe.
1. United States is projected to be well below normal from 2-9 January. And 10-18 January will be even colder. COLD!
2. Canada is projected to be well above normal from 2-9 January, But many regions will get closer to normal from 10-18 January. Sea ice will expand much. WARM!
3. Europe on the whole will be around average from 2-9 January. But the next cold wave is forecast to hit in another week to 10 days. That means Europe too will be well below normal from 10-18 January. COLD!
4. East Asia: Look at all the blue from from 2-9 January – well below normal. And it doesn’t get better from 10-18 January. COLD!
5. South Asia is projected to be well below normal from 2-9 January, and not much change from 10-18 January. COLD!

6. Central Asia is projected to be well below normal from 2-9 January in western China and north above it. The Middle east and Turkey will be normal to warm, and not much change from 10-18 January. COOL!
7. Middle East will be in general cool from 2-9 January with some warming from 10-18 January. NORMAL!
8. Africa will be generally cool from 2-9 January with some warming from 10-18 January. NORMAL!
9. South America is projected to be below normal from 2-9 January. And 10-18 January will be even colder. COLD!
10. Australia is projected to be normal from 2-9 January. But 10-18 January will be cooler. COOL!
11. Antarctica has been COOL too.
Total it up: 5 cold, 3 cool, 2 normal and only 1 warm. Let’s see Tricky Jim Hansen fudge this. It’ll be interesting to see the satellite numbers in the months ahead.
The Danish Meteorological Institute also shows a cold Arctic.
Interestingly, Joe Bastardi’s forecast of a cold winter in Turkey looks to be elusive. Yesterday it looked like he would be right, but the latest computer outputs appear to confirm Piers Corbyn’s latest forecast of another winter grip steamrolling over northern and central Europe instead.
Of course we should not forget the oceans. Lots of blue there too. All that barking about global warming and 2010 being so hot that we’ve been hearing is about to get muzzled. Enjoy the silence.

Share this...FacebookTwitter“I’m a climate pig” – so confesses a climate sinner in a satirical new video clip produced by German public television ZDF. It is a spoof on the whole climate change movement, a parody on the climate religion, and this by an icon of politically correct media, ZDF, no less!
The video is also quite hip – thus targeting the young.
Are the German media now starting to take a satirical view of the whole climate-saving movement? That certainly would be a change of course. But let’s not get our hopes up too much.
The video pokes fun at the feelings of guilt that many people struggle with daily because of their self-perceived CO2 sins, which are simply impossible to avoid in modern living. We all do our best to avoid emitting the climate-killing stuff, but it just can’t be helped! The video starts with a person confessing his climate sins. Dear Father:
– Boiling water: 36 kg of CO2.
– Surfing in the Internet: 391 kg.
– Driving the car: 2 tons!
– Living in an old apartment in Berlin: 3.6 tons
– Holiday flight to New York: 4 tons!
Using this online climate calculator, I reach a total of more than 18 tons per year. But the scientists say I should emit no more than 2 tons per year!
Oh my God, what can I do? Cutting CO2 emissions that drastically would be totally painful. The guilt that’s felt is just unbearable.
But it’s got to be done. There’s no choice, at least so says Regine Günther, Director of Climate Protection and Energy WWF:
If we don’t, then we will be changed, and that in the form of traumatic climate change. And the consequences for people will be much much more painful then you could ever imagine.
Gulp! That’s pretty painful. I myself can imagine some pretty painful things – like root canal treatment without Novocaine. So climate change will be 10 times, no, a thousand times more painful than that? Then we better hurry up and make the brutal sacrifices today. ZDF asks how on earth are we supposed to do get down to just two tons?

Deliver our e-mails by bicycle?
Turn off the heat?
Dear Father, what am I to do? No matter what I do, I commit CO2 sins. Help me!
Norbert Bolz, media theorist, says everywhere there are feelings of guilt, people doing penance by performing acts of offsetting. “People are now praying to Mother Nature, who has taken over for God.”
The clip sarcastically points out that the average person causes 1.24 tons of emissions annually just by default existing, before even taking a breath, and that through government administration, autobahns, and taxation. ZDF asks: “Is there even a chance for me to live a climate-friendly life?”
The movement has become religious and is now even filled with rituals, explains Bolz, citing Germany’s obsession with separating it’s household garbage as a way of being a “good person” and doing penance for our environmental transgressions.
But don’t despair, now private industry allows you to buy offsets, thus allowing you to perform acts without having to feel so guilty. Now that’s service. Pay a little extra for that flight ticket, and bam! Everything is rosy again. Fly guilt-free! A good conscience in exchange for money. ZDF adds satirically:
For singles at COOL.de, there’s also the climate-neutral complete package for only 10 euros a month!” Is that the solution?
Not for WWF High Priest Regine Günther, who warns offsets are not enough:
The only good emissions are the ones that don’t happen. And for the ones that do occur, you have to try to avoid them. And if that isn’t possible, then you have to offset them. But that’s only possible over a transitionary period.”
So only for a little while? All this offset stuff is just temporary, and will have to go before too long. After that it’s going to be all cold cold turkey, and big time. ZDF on Günther’s warning:
I was afraid of that. First I was a waste sinner, and now I’m a climate sinner. Our Father, give me my daily CO2. Forgive me for my trespasses, and deliver me from climate change. Yours is the state, nature and the CO2 budget for eternity. Amen.
I’ll say Amen to that too.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I’m going to meander off into politics. It’s election day after all.
Here in Europe, that dreaded day has unfortunately arrived. This one is as welcome as a root canal treatment. Now that it’s here, for the European Establishment, it’s: let’s get it over with and hope the pain will be bearable.
In Germany the newsrooms and media are having a difficult time coming to terms with the inevitable results. The insults and nervous breakdowns are everywhere. The dreams of socialism, world goverment and climate theocracy are crumbling before their eyes.
Now, instead of being inspiring slogans, “Yes we can” and “Hope and Change” have become a big joke.
It’s that damn Tea Party, which is made up of unsophisticated, rather ignorant, white, racist, narrow minded, religious, ultra-conservative, angry gun-wielding Americans who are too stupid to know what’s good for them, all led by extremists like Sarah Palin – so laments much of the established media here. The Tea Partiers are so disinformed, e.g. many don’t even believe in the hard science of manmade global warming and believe the planet was created 6000 years ago.  If only Americans weren’t so stupid and ignorant.
Two years ago the German and European media made Obama their darling, portraying him as the savior that had delivered America and the world from the clutches of the evil Bush regime. A year later he was even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for doing so. But that has since turned out to be a certificate of failure (think Gore, Arafat and a host of others).
Now, as Europe views it, the Tea Party express places the whole grand global plan of a world nanny state rescuing the planet from climate catastrophe and capitalism in jeopardy. Nothing gets more villified in the European press than the Tea Party (except climate deniers, that is).
Many media outlets have complained that climate initiatives will soon be blocked by these new denier Republicans. Here are some excerpts of how the German print media feels about the upcoming Congressional overhaul and the reasons behind it.
Sueddeutsche Zeitung
The USA increasingly appears to be a giant that is paralyzed by polarity. On one side you have the political middle who are attempting to implement solutions for the big challenges that the nation faces. On the other side, there’s the Tea Party, TV network Fox News and the “no”-faction who say no to government, no to taxes, no to change, no to environmental protection. In this camp there are many who believe that climate change is a big conspiracy by intellectuals or by the Chinese.

In the meantime, reality has caught up to the Obama government. The promised hope and change has stalled time and again in committees and meetings, failing because of resistantance from the political opposition.
Die Welt
Many Americans are disappointed by the economic policy of the government, even though the financial and economic crisis began on Obama’s predecesssor George W. Bush’s watch. The right-wing populist Tea Party movement, which supported many candidiates, profited the most from the frustration.
Die Zeit
In the House, Obama has had a majority of 39 seats. They will lose 70 or even 80 seats to the Republicans. Soon the conservatives will have a majority and will appoint the Speaker of the House. In the Senate the Democrats have had a majority of 59 of the 100 seats. There are surely going to be losses there too. But most likely they will hang on to a slim majority with 51 or 52 seats.
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
It is mainly the conservative grassroots Tea Party that has provided the Republicans, who took it on the chin 2 years earlier, with a Renaissance. It’s likely that the Tea Party movement will also be a major factor in 2012 with its economically motivated demands for debt reduction, spending discipline, tax cuts and smaller governments.

"The UK’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 3% in 2018 as pollution from the energy sector continued to decrease, provisional government figures show. Emissions of the gases that drive climate change have fallen for six years in a row, and are 44% below the 1990 baseline for the UK. Emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, are at the lowest level since before the start of the 20th century, when Queen Victoria was still on the throne, government officials said.  The fall was mainly due to a 7% reduction in pollution from energy suppliers, as the power sector continued to switch away from coal to low-carbon technology such as renewables. There was also a 3% drop in emissions from transport, which have barely fallen since 1990 and now make up the biggest share of the UK’s climate pollution. Energy data also published on Thursday revealed that renewables accounted for a record third (33%) of electricity generation in 2018, while coal was just 5%, and gas was 39%. Low-carbon generation, which covers renewables and nuclear, rose to a record 53%, the figures show. Claire Perry, the energy and clean growth minister, said: “We can be proud that we continue to lead the way in reducing emissions while growing our economy. “More than half of our electricity comes from low-carbon sources thanks to more than £52bn of government support for renewable projects in the UK since 2010, all part of our modern industrial strategy.” Greenpeace argued transport emissions were falling at a “snail’s pace”. Morten Thaysen, a Greenpeace climate campaigner, said: “For years now we’ve known that transport is the UK’s leading driver of the climate emergency. “Both the government and the car industry are stalling when we need proper action. Ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, instead of the government’s date of 2040, would be a good starting point. “Matching this with new policies to promote electric vehicles and greater support for cheap, green public transport, walking and cycling is essential too.” The shadow energy secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said the new greenhouse gas figures “show that the government is failing on climate change when nothing less than a green industrial revolution is needed”. She added: “Public sector and residential emissions actually increased last year, while other sectors remain flat. Agricultural emissions are higher now than in the year 2000. Only a Labour government will tackle the climate emergency while revitalising whole swathes of the country that have been held back for decades.”"
"Greenhouse gas emissions from energy production rose strongly again last year, according to new data from the International Energy Agency, with a young fleet of coal-fired power plants in Asia accounting for a large proportion of the increase. Energy demand grew at its fastest pace this decade, with a 2.3% increase globally driving rises in fossil fuel consumption. Coal use in power stations was a third of the increase in energy consumption, and together gas and coal were responsible for nearly 70% of the growth in energy consumption, and while demand for solar and wind power also increased, it was by much less overall.  Gas consumption in the US leapt by 10%, or the equivalent of the UK’s entire gas consumption in a year. Fracking has been a key driver, and oil production in the US also grew, while the dismantling of government incentives intended to reduce reliance on fossil fuels has continued. Asia is now responsible for the majority of coal-fired power generation globally, and the average age of power plants there is now just 12 years, meaning they have decades to go before reaching their planned end of production in about 30 to 50 years. Heating and cooling accounted for a fifth of the increase in global energy demand – the cooling needed for many areas to cope with global warming is an increasing factor in the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, as temperatures in some regions rose to record levels as the result of climate change. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said last year had been a “golden” year for gas, which met nearly half of the growth in global demand for energy, but urged governments to take action that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “We have seen an extraordinary increase in global energy demand in 2018, growing at its fastest pace this decade,” he said. “Last year can also be considered another golden year for gas. But despite major growth in renewables, global emissions are still rising, demonstrating once again that more urgent action is needed on all fronts.” He called for greater development of non-fossil fuel energy sources, action from governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and investment in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide, as ways to reduce the impact of energy production on climate change. Energy efficiency has been increasingly ignored, the IEA found, despite the economic gains to be had from relatively simple measures to curb energy waste. Nuclear reactors met 9% of the increase in global electricity demand last year, according to the IEA’s analysis, as newly built plants in China came onstream and facilities in Japan were reopened after the Fukushima disaster at the beginning of the decade. • This article was amended on 26 March 2019 because coal use did not rise by a third, as an earlier version said, it accounted for a third of the rise in energy consumption."

"There’s no mistake that the UK is living in uncertain times. We all anxiously await the fate of Brexit and how the changes will impact our economy, our industries, our friends. But there exists an even graver threat to our daily existence – we are on course to run short of water in 25 years. And it is our economic structures and big corporations that are to blame. The demands of population growth and the threat of climate change have had a significant impact on our water supply. But these effects are exacerbated by the greed of the water industry that has prioritised profit over the people. Public services like water should be nationalised. That’s what campaigners such as Cat Hobbs from We Own It and more than three-quarters of the British public have been saying for years. Privatisation has failed. Water is the most essential resource on our planet. Our bodies are comprised of 70% water. . Without it, no life on this planet can survive and therefore it must be protected as a basic human right.  Yet during a time when our most precious resource grows more scarce and household bills continue to rise as private firms monopolise the water industry in different parts of England and Wales, they continue to receive tax breaks and windfall profits. According to a study from the National Audit Office, water bills have increased at a rate of 40% above inflation since the industry was privatised in 1989. Since 2010, shareholder dividends have soared upwards of £13.5bn in payouts, almost the amount the companies raked in in pre-tax profits. While these companies continue to profit from their customers, they carelessly waste our water supply by refusing to plug 3bn litres of leaks across the country. Private firms monopolise the water industry in England and Wales. We simply turn on our tap and use water from whatever company operates in our area. That means companies have little incentive to make the service better. They’ve grown greedy and unsustainable as a result – choosing to line their shareholders’ pockets, instead of reducing bills for ordinary people. Water is a human right and should be accessible to all. That principle is under threat. This is precisely why we must advocate to bring the water supply back into public ownership. Campaigners against privatisation, We Own It, along with SumOfUs have between us gathered more than 69,000 signatures calling for the nationalisation of Britain’s water industry. By nationalising our water supply, we can turn the tide and prevent a devastating water shortage. Private water corporations running public contracts, like Carillion, have already proven they’re not fit to run our public services. The catastrophic collapse of the giant construction firm once again came at a high cost for tax-paying consumers resulting in £148m in estimated losses. Our water supply belongs to all of us. Having our water industry run by public servants who are elected and are accountable to voters means that we can reinvest money in technologies, maintenance and systems that will ensure our water supply’s viability – instead of giving huge payouts to shareholders. Nationalising the UK water industry is what works best for consumers and what will ensure the conservation of our water supply for the next 25 years – and beyond. • Sondhya Gupta is a UK-based campaign manager at SumOfUs, an organisation using people power to hold the biggest companies in the world to account"
"As Africa climate week unfurls in Ghana, the countries of Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe count the costs of Cyclone Idai, which ripped through villages and towns, taking hundreds of lives and leaving a trail of destruction. For a continent already racked by the effects of the climate crisis, Idai is another chilling reminder of the destructive power of the kind of storms that will become more common as the world warms up. The cyclone made landfall on 14 March, the same day that the One Planet Summit started in Nairobi, called by French president Emmanuel Macron. After picking up speed, with winds of 195km/h (120mph) accompanied by lashing rains, Idai caused flooding and landslides, ruining crops and roads, and has already affected millions of people. The city of Beira in Mozambique was hit the hardest, with nearly 80% of homes and public infrastructure destroyed. While the most vulnerable communities are facing the real impact of climate change on the ground, national leaders at the One Planet Summit kept their talk inside comfortable and acclimatised rooms. During the summit, Macron encouraged global collaboration towards ensuring sustainable preservation of forests, and President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya made a pledge to achieve at least 10% forest cover in the next three years. These commitments would be laughable if it were not so tragic. Africa needs to do a lot more than that to build climate resilience. Cyclone Idai is another powerful demonstration of this. While many countries appear to be already reducing carbon emissions and moving towards an energy transition, Africa’s coalfields are open for business. Along with a few Asian countries (Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh in particular), our continent continues to be an El Dorado for the coal cheerleaders and big business determined to carry on its coal-onisation. New plants are being planned from South Africa to Senegal, from Kenya to Mozambique, as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Côte d’Ivoire. Most of them are co-financed by the African Development Bank, on whose board sit members of African, European, North and South American and Asian governments. This is the case for the coal-fired power plant projects in Bargny (in the suburbs of Dakar, Senegal), San-Pédro (Côte d’Ivoire), Lamu (Kenya), or the Thabametsi power station in Limpopo province, South Africa, near the border with Botswana. The situation is pretty similar for the oil industry, a source of energy that continues to attract investors in Africa, a continent that accounts for 8% of global production, with 7.5m barrels a day. Despite the drop in the price of oil over the last five years, new players are added yearly to the list of majors companies, such as Total, Shell, Exxon, BP and Eni. In Uganda, for example, a new field will be exploited, the fruit of the cooperation between Total, the Chinese company CNOOC, and the British company Tullow Oil. Perenco, a French-British company, has just set up in Gabon and DRC and plans to produce half a million barrels a day. In February 2019, Total announced the huge offshore discovery of gas-condensate and light oil in South Africa, which could contain 1bn barrels of total resources. Even though Africa is estimated to produce just 4% of global carbon emissions – compared to 80% by the most industrialised countries (G20), it is the continent that pays the highest price. For us, climate change is not a future risk, it’s already a reality evident in wrecked families, lands and livelihoods, and hopeless children and young people who have no choice but to seek a future by migrating. Everywhere on the continent, communities fear losing their land as each season hits one country after another with exceptional floods, unexpected storms and increasingly long droughts. Fauna and flora reserves have been running out, access to water has become a privilege, and extreme weather events have become more numerous and left families without homes or livelihoods. Some assume that increasing forest cover or granting new billions in funding to governments plagued by bad governance and corruption will prevent such disasters from happening and solve the issue of global warming. This is an insult to people facing untold suffering in every corner of the continent, while new coal and mining infrastructure and carbon commodification continue to be allowed. The proliferation of fossil-fuel projects is happening at the expense of people’s health, the climate and ecosystems. Yet the solutions to this crisis are also well known. They include ending coal extraction and mining, stopping the funding of new coal infrastructure – mines or power plants – and accelerating the investment in renewables. International cooperation and funding from industrialised economies are necessary to combat climate change. And such efforts should start by not promoting or funding any fossil fuel projects anywhere in the world. But before money, energy transition is a matter of vision and leadership. African countries have to step up efforts against environmental degradation and greenhouse gas emissions, for instance, by decentralising energy supply systems, and by promoting tax policies that favour solar and wind energy investments. African governments must do a better job of protecting their people, but fossil fuel companies must also be held accountable for the impact that decades of unregulated exploitation of coal, oil and gas have had on the continent, including before courts. Tired of vain promises and empty slogans, students and pupils around the world, including in South Africa, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda, organised a series of rallies and events last week asking their governments to take, without delay, the decisions needed to contain climate destabilisation. This organic mobilisation is likely to continue and grow until real action is taken. While regional leaders and development partners are gathered in Accra for the 2019 Africa climate week, they should refrain from promoting more false solutions or making empty promises while thousands of innocent citizens are perishing. Ending the extraction and use of coal and other fossil fuels in Africa is a decision that cannot be delayed any longer. The brutality of Cyclone Idai is another stark reminder that millions of lives depend on it. • Landry Ninteretse is the Africa lead for 350.org, which campaigns on climate change"

"More than two-thirds of all staff employed directly by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) are working on delivering Brexit, according to official figures released by the government. The response to a freedom of information request also shows that 320 staff have been transferred from other parts of Whitehall to help Michael Gove’s department cope with preparations for leaving the EU.  The figures show that by the end of last year, Defra had placed more than 2,700 staff into “EU exit roles”, amounting to 68% of the total 3,989 staff working for the department, not including its agencies. Last year, Defra said 400 staff had been seconded to Brexit-related work from the Environment Agency, which is responsible for enforcing rules on recycling, air pollution and flooding, and from Natural England, which protects animal habitats. Much of the work in Defra on Brexit will be on finding new arrangements for farmers if the UK no longer falls under the EU’s common agricultural policy. The work in Defra on Brexit also covers areas such as pet passports, fishing, chemicals and food imports. Tom Burke, the chair of independent climate-change thinktank E3G, said the figures showed Brexit was consuming time, effort and resources that could be used to tackle environmental challenges facing the country. The former government adviser on the environment said: “The government has already subjected the Environment Agency and Natural England to savage budget cuts, so that they are no longer able to do their job properly.” Calling for a second referendum in the interests of the environment, he said: “We are somehow unable to find the money we need to protect the environment but we can find all the cash we need to prepare for Brexit. “Whichever way you look at it, Brexit is bad for the environment. It takes us out of the European institutions that have successfully driven up environmental standards across Europe as well as in this country. It removes us from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, which has insisted that Britain starts reducing its air pollution. “At a time when the world is increasingly challenged by climate change and Britain is losing the battle to deliver breathable air, failing to meet our own targets for protecting nature and investing far too little in adapting to climate change, Brexit is a massive drain on the money and people necessary to meet the government’s promise to leave the environment in a better state than it found it.” A Defra spokesperson said: “As you’d expect, Defra and departments across Government are hard at work preparing for the UK’s exit from the EU. It’s the job of a responsible Government to ensure we’re prepared for all scenarios, and we are recruiting and prioritising our resources accordingly. “The Civil Service has always moved its staff to where they are most needed. But we will continue to deliver on the issues that matter to people, such as tackling single-use plastic and taking steps to improve animal welfare, as well as delivering on the promise of a Green Brexit.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMinggu lalu kami sudah mengulas informasi mengenai tata cara bermain judi bandar dominoQQ, dan pada kesempatan kali ini kami akan sangat senang bisa membagi informasi mengenai jenis kartu spesial judi online untuk semua player yang ingin megetahui lebih dalam seperti apa jajaran kartu spesial yang bisa membawa kemenangan besar untuk setiap participant ceme. Jadi dari artikel ini kami akan menjelaskan satu per satu seperti apa kelebihan dari kartu spesial judi over the internet yang banyak diharapkan oleh para player di internet.
Mengenal Kartu Spesial DominoQQ
 	Kartu qiu qiu
Kartu spesial pertama ini terkenal dengan sebutan qiu qiu atau jika diartikan dalam angka adalah kartu dengan angka 9 yang artinya merupakan kombinasi kartu dengan nilai tertinggi. Untuk mendapatkan kartu 9 ini maka kombinasi dari dua kartu yang dibagikan memiliki nilai 9, contoh 6 + 3, 5 + 4, 7 + 2 dan sebagainya. Dengan kartu dominoQQ ini maka kemenangan akan jauh lebih besar dari taruhan yang anda pasang. Anda akan menerima bayaran 2 kali lipat dari bandar karena memiliki kartu ini, namun kalau bandar dan person sama-sama memiliki kartu 9 maka kemenangan ada pada bandar. Misal anda bertaruh 1000 rupiah dan mendapatkan kartu 9 maka bayaran yang akan anda terima sebesar 1.970. jadi kalau pasang 1 juta anda menang 1.970.000, besar bukan ?
 	Kartu murni kecil dan murni besar
Kemudian kartu spesial dari permainan situs dominoqq yang paling sering didapatan oleh kebanyakan player adalah permainan judi kartu murni kecil dan besar, kombinasi kartu ini banyak didapatkan para person yang bermain di meja 8 orang. Jadi untuk kemenangan yang didapatkan hanya 50 ribu saja dengan pembelian jackpot sebesar 1000 rupiah setiap ronde permainan. Untuk mengetahui apakah kartu anda murni kecil atau besar silahkan simak baik-baik. Kartu murni kecil ditandai dengan dua kartu yang memiliki nilai 1 – 9. Contoh kartu anda 2 + bandar 4 = 6, maka masih termasuk murni kecil. Sedangkan kartu murni besar kartu anda berjumlah 20 dan bandar juga 20. Namun anda tidak perlu bingung untuk membacanya, karena ketika anda bermain secara otomatis sistem akan mendeteksi apakah kartu bandar dan person memiliki jackpot.
 	Kartu Balak
Selanjutnya kartu spesial dalam permainan judi dominoQQ yang tidak kalah menarik adalah kartu balak yang mempunyai nilai kemenangan jauh lebih besar yaitu maksimal Rp.200.000 untuk pembelian jackpot sebesar Rp.1000 rupiah saja, kartu balak ini adalah kartu kembar yang mana kedua kartu anda memiliki kombinasi seperti  ( 2 + 2 ) dan ( 4 + 4 ), namun tidak akan berlaku jika bandar tidak memiliki kartu kembar. Sekali lagi bahwa jackpot hanya akan terjadi jika bandar dan participant memiliki kartu spesial. 
 	Kartu Spesial 6 Dewa
Terakhir kartu spesial yang paling banyak di nantikan oleh para penikmat judi online adalah kartu spesial 6 dewa. Kartu satu ini cukup langka didapatkan, biasanya per hari hanya keluar beberapa saja di meja secara acak, jadi semua peluang pemain sama untuk mendapatkan kombinasi ini. Namun seperti yang sudah kami katakan tadi bahwa jackpot hanya akan terjadi jika participant dan bandar memiliki kartu jackpot. 
Demikian informasi dari artikel mengenai jenis-jenis kartu spesial dalam permainan judi ceme on the web. Terima kasih.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEnergy rationing begins. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
This is serious. A new law has been passed by the German government, quietly and almost unnoticed. Soon in the future, the government will tell its citizens how much energy they can consume. 
If the German State can pass this, then it can pretty much do whatever the hell it damn well pleases.
Gone are the days of a government that is there to serve its citizens. Here to stay is a group of elitists who are going to boss the citizens around and tell them how to live.
But of course it’s all in the name of saving planet from climate catastrophe. Never mind what Edenhofer of the PIK said awhile back, read here. They are moving quickly now, and Germany is now lost. Although climate scepticism is rising, it’s too late.
America – the last hope
I pray that the few remaining freedom-loving lawmakers in America are taking notice of this eco-martial law movement now sweeping across Europe. The greenshirts are already getting out of their cars in front of your homes (think EPA). Are you going to let them kick your doors down too? They are only waiting for the green light from Ms Lisa Jackson.
Germany’s first step in declaring eco-martial law
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) reports on the new German Energy Efficiency Law that was quietly passed on the 4th of November 2010 with nary a press report and under the noses of its citizens -passed under the guise of “necessary-to-implement EU Directives” to increase energy efficiency. The name of the law in German:
Gesetz über Energiedienstleistungen und andere Energieeffizienzmaßnahmen vom 4. November 2010 (BGBl. I S. 1483)
In English:
Law on Energy Services and other Energy Efficiency Measures dated 4 November 2010 (BGBl. I S. 1483)
Just call it the Energy Tyranny Act. Michael Limburg of EIKE has looked at this in detail and writes:
With this law, the free market is going to be abolished, carefully converted with efforts to…“remove existing market obstacles and deficiencies.“ 
Of course the law provides for the creation of a new bureaucracy to implement its provisions – with the state taking over authority. Limburg writes about what the Energy Tyranny Act means:
That means citizens will have to be and can be forced to make comprehensive energy savings in a very short time. And to make sure that functions:
Power companies, grid operators and energy retail companies are especially required to carry out special obligations in order to create the conditions for the development and promotion of a market for energy service companies and for creating other measures for improving energy efficiency for the consumer. Included in this are especially information, promotion and assurance obligations. These companies are also obligated to maintain infomational billing of energy consumption.

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




In plain English: Power and energy companies will be required to collect consumption data on each and every citizen and provide the means to meet energy efficiency targets.
Enforcement by the state
All this will have to be monitored of course – by a new powerful bureaucracy, which will have powers to run lives. Paragraph 9 of the law stipulates which government body will observe our energy consumption. The Federal Office for Economics and Export Control will take on the duties of the Federal Office for Energy Efficiency.
Some of these duties include the calculation of energy saving target values and monitoring the progress savings are made by the consumers. And if savings are not achieved quickly enough, Limburg writes:
In the event that the forces of the newly abolished free market are not sufficient, which of course will certainly turn out to be the case, they will be able to draw up proposals for forcing the citizens, and to sanction if necessary, to reach the ambitious targets.
EIKE reader Stefan Steger writes:
Maybe I’ve seen too much science fiction, but it appears the Orwellian surveillance society is becoming a reality; you could call it East Germany 2.0 . The whole thing has a system to it:
1. Implementation of smart grids.
2. Outsourcing of meter reading by public utilities.
3. State control of meter reading.
4. Regulating the energy consumption per person/ household etc.
5. Limiting of energy use by using intelligent meters and automatic shut-off  switches.
6. And liquidators will be sent to violating households.
Mike Limburg ends by quoting Kurt Tucholsky:
If people could change the course of politics through elections, then elections would have been banned long ago.”
That is indeed a sad but true commentary on the state of German democracy (what’s left of it) today.
The Great Menace – how far can this go?
This is just the start of the so-called “The Great Transformation” envisioned by extremists like Edenhofer, Schellnhuber and host of other social engineering zealots. It begins with rationing energy, but where does it end? What’s next?
Our water consumption? Our meat consumption? Our internet access? Our mobility? Our lights? Our weight?  How about sugar intake? The right to our organs? Our life span (death panels)? Our property and money we earn? Our freedom to speak?
They can do what they want and there is nothing now to stop them. Today there is no political opposition to this coming green tyranny – all parties in Germany, from right to left, are for it. They are only fighting each other to see who gets to have the fun of carrying out this dangerous experiment. They are all racing to see who can be Erich Honecker 2.0 first!
Urgently needed is an opposition…and maybe another D-Day.
=========================================================
UPDATE: http://www.greattransformation.e
Democratic regimes are not well prepared for the level of participation that is required: Can free democratic societies cope with the effects of grave changes in the global climate, or might authoritarian regimes possibly be better placed to enforce the necessary measures?”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome bloggers do a yearly wrap up, and so I thought I’d do a monthly and annual summary today.
2010 – the humble start of NTZ
This blog all started with me reading climate science skeptic sites like WUWT, IceCap, CA, Bishop Hill and many others since 2007. In March 2010 I happened to be at Donna Laframboise’s No Frakking Consensus and volunteered to be a citizen auditor for her IPCC 2007 audit of the literature cited in the report, which we found out was quite gray.
So through all this I got the invitation from WordPress to start my own blog. I thought: “Hey – why not!,” and started on April 1st. My humble target was to write a couple of posts per week and to reach a 1000 page-views by the end of the month.
When you start blogging, everything feeds on itself. You get your first reader comment, and it’s a thrill. And so you write more. I ended up writing much more of course, at least one post a day. And the visitors came gradually, 40 – 50 page-views a day at first. One day I had 179 – a post about the first Earth Day.
The big break
The big break came on April 23 when I came across a story at the German-language Ria Novosti which had a piece called Global Cooling Will Make Arctic Natural Resources Inaccessible – Scientist about a Russian scientist who warned of cooling. That story led me to write the post: Russian Scientist: Expect Cooling – Pols Sitting On The Wrong Horse. It was Friday afternoon I remember, and not much happened…until Marc Morano put it up as the big headline at Climate Depot a day later on Saturday. And the rest is history. That day, April 24, NTZ went from 50 page-views – to the thousands. NoTricksZone was born. I’ve been hopelessly addicted ever since. At the end of April I had over 8000 page views – well over the original target of 1000.
Thank you readers
I don’t like to give out numbers, but I am happy to say that in November NTZ went over the 150,000 page views plateau for that month, far beyond anything I ever imagined. Thank you readers!
I’ve made all the mistakes new bloggers could make. You find out what works and what doesn’t. I tend to rush things out too quickly, and need to be more patient. It really is best to post it in the morning after a night’s sleep. I’ve blown my top a couple of times, too. Hopefully there are no hard feelings out there.
It is important to stay on the good side of your fellow bloggers, as readers get referred back and forth and all. The sites I get the most traffic from (in random order!) are Tom Nelson, WUWT, Climate Depot and Bishop Hill. There are many others. But it’s not about getting traffic. To me it’s all about having fun doing it. If you have fun, then things naturally fall into place all by themselves.
December NTZ summary
December 3-4: The Climate Conference in Berlin where I got the chance to meet some of the other German bloggers and have even agreed to cooperate with them in an effort to get the German stories out to the world. That’s right, the spotlight is now on you German warmist scientists from now on – so behave yourselves.

December 7: The newest list of climate-gates was released: List of gates balloons to 129/. But I think that will be the last. There are just too many scandals out there to keep track of.
December 13: The failure of Cancun – Cancun complete travesty and rout/. The media and bureaucrats made it look like a success, but it was a failure throughout. But they sure did have a grand ol time down there (in the record cold)!

December 17: Der Spiegel’s 1974 article on a coming ice age was examined. Read here. It’s a bit hilarious that the chances of warming back then were pegged at 1 in 10,000 – at best!
December 18: And what would December 2010 be without all the news of the cold and snow that was supposed to be rare in Europe. Read here and here.
December 23: And the PIK trying to blame it all on warming.  PIK says expect warmer colder winters.
December 27: We also heard a German professor come out on German radio and slam all the global warming science put out by the warmists: German climate professor slams climate religion.
December 28: Matti Vooro’s research showed that there is a growing number of international scientists who, like Joe Bastardi, feel cooling is in the future. Cooling over the next 1 to 3 decades/.
Grand year for the skeptics
All in all, 2010 was a grand year for the skeptics, and a nightmare for the warmists, who were kept barely alive by an El Nino. But that baby won’t be there in 2011! By 2015, AGW will be relegated to a footnote in history and remain popular only among a few die-hard fringe kooks like fraudsters James Hansen and Michael Mann. Their days are numbered – start counting them off. I feel more optimistic than ever.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s because you’ve created them yourselves, or you’ve allowed yourselves to be blindly led into them.
I admit feeling a bit of Schadenfreude, reading the warminista blogs like Climate Progress, where they are all in shock. “Tell me it can’t be true!”
Come on guys, you couldn’t see this coming? Were you all so intoxicated and hypnotised by the movement that you couldn’t see it?

Betrayed this coutnry sound bite Al Gore sound bites

This spiral of violent behaviour started long ago and you were warned time and again. But your leaders told you not to listen. They told you that we are just deniers.
Climate Progress readers, and all you AGW religious faithful, the people who made this clip are your leaders, and they’re the ones who took you to this ghastly spot. Now you don’t want to believe it – again. How many times must this happen to you before you wake up?
First it was Climategate. But they took care of that for you. They whitewashed it, 3 times even, and that was enough so that you could manage to rationalise it away and begin to believe in the cause again. And so you continued to follow. When they cued you to chant “denier!, denier!” – you did so in unison, just as they instructed. When you were asked to call sceptics flat-earthers and to put them down – you obeyed, and on it went. You were taught and instructed to hate, and so you did.
And now this. The Truth.
It felt good while it lasted, though. You felt superior. And at the same time you had all these cool, hip and enlightened friends. You belonged. And you were saving the planet. You followed and followed. It was a cause.
Not long ago they had called on you to engage in civil disobedience, and many of you did that too, or you did what you could and cheered it on.
While your leaders orchestrated your thinking, they lived high on the hog making tons of money with it, flying all over the world in private jets, living in huge mansions, and decorated each other with awards.
Then they got the kids into the movement. After all it’s the future. The planet is at the tipping point. The kids have to be in fear along with the rest of you. And so you taught your kids to be afraid, to be very afraid, and that believer kids are cool, while sceptic kids are flat-earth deniers or just ignorant rednecks.
So let’s blow them up.

There isn’t enough room on the planet for them anyway. That’s what they kept telling you. Humans are parasites when you get down to it.
And what about parents? Well, many of them are just losers, stuck in yesterday. In fact they suck, too. They just want to ruin all the fun. So don’t listen to them. Either they’re with us, or they’re against us.

And what about the bastards who don’t believe and even have the audacity to argue against us? What shall we do with them? Well, we know where they live now, and where they work. Let’s drag them before Nuremberg trials and prosecute them for climate crimes. Yeah!
Trials? Come to think about it, why bother? Let’s just blow them up too – right there on the spot!

And now that your leaders have exposed themselves, look at how they’re trying to run and hide. Look at them deny they were involved. “It wasn’t us! We think the clip is disgusting too!”
You guys made the clip. It’s your work. Nice to see you finally think it’s disgusting.
Hopefully you followers will wake up this time.

"Insurers have warned that climate change could make cover for ordinary people unaffordable after the world’s largest reinsurance firm blamed global warming for $24bn (£18bn) of losses in the Californian wildfires. Ernst Rauch, Munich Re’s chief climatologist, told the Guardian that the costs could soon be widely felt, with premium rises already under discussion with clients holding asset concentrations in vulnerable parts of the state.  “If the risk from wildfires, flooding, storms or hail is increasing then the only sustainable option we have is to adjust our risk prices accordingly. In the long run it might become a social issue,” he said after Munich Re published a report into climate change’s impact on wildfires. “Affordability is so critical [because] some people on low and average incomes in some regions will no longer be able to buy insurance.” The lion’s share of California’s 20 worst forest blazes since the 1930s have occurred this millennium, in years characterised by abnormally high summer temperatures and “exceptional dryness” between May and October, according to a new analysis by Munich Re. Wetter and more humid winters spurred new forest growth which became tinder dry in heatwave conditions that preceded the wildfires, the report’s authors said. After comparing observational data spanning several decades with climate models, the report concluded that the wildfires, which killed 85 people, were “broadly consistent with climate change”. Nicolas Jeanmart, the head of personal insurance, general insurance and macroeconomics at Insurance Europe, which speaks for 34 national insurance associations, said the knock-on effects from rising premiums could pose a threat to social order. “The sector is concerned that continuing global increases in temperature could make it increasingly difficult to offer the affordable financial protection that people deserve, and that modern society requires to function properly,” he said. Munich Re’s insurance cover in hurricane-prone regions such as Florida is already higher than in northern Europe, by an order of magnitude. Premiums are also being adjusted in regions facing an increased threat from severe convective storms which hold an energy and severity primed by global warming. These include parts of Germany, Austria, France, south-west Italy and the US midwest. Increases in the intensity and frequency of California’s wildfire season are predicted by climate models, and the Munich Re analysis combines monthly meteorological data with financial losses to graph the trend’s rise since 2001. Average annual wildfire losses trailed well below $5bn even within this millennium, until 2017 and 2018, when they leapt to more than $20bn. Munich Re believes that global warming made a “significant contribution” to this. No insurer has linked wildfires to climate change before, although a Lloyds report into Superstorm Sandy in 2014 found that global warming-linked sea level rises had increased surge losses around Manhattan by 30%. Climate scientists say that linking extreme weather events to climate change is akin to attributing the performance of a steroid-taking sportsman to drug use – the connections are clearer in patterns than in individual disasters. Paul Fisher, the Bank of England’s former coordinator on climate change, and a fellow at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, said: “In general, one can’t prove that a single event is the result of climate change but it is likely to cause more such events of greater severity.” “It is very interesting if insurers conclude that climate change was a significant contributory factor to the event and will make the insurance companies think carefully about the pricing and availability of similar insurance policies.” It may also influence several court cases testing the liability of fossil fuel companies for the effects of global warming. Dr Ben Caldecott, the director of Oxford University’s sustainable finance programme, said: “Company directors and fiduciaries will ultimately be held responsible for avoidable climate-related damages and losses and urgently need to up their game to avoid litigation and liability.” Munich Re has divested its large thermal coal holdings. However, it maintains some gas and oil investments."

"Cities around the world were marking Earth Hour on Saturday by turning off lights at 8:30pm local time in a call for global action on climate change.  The Earth Hour gesture calls for greater awareness and more sparing use of resources, especially fossil fuels that produce carbon gases and lead to global warming. Beginning in Sydney in 2007, Earth Hour has spread to more than 180 countries, with tens of millions of people joining in. In Hong Kong, major buildings along Victoria Harbour turned off their non-essential lights and the city’s popular tourist attraction known as the Symphony of Lights was cancelled. More than 3,000 corporations in Hong Kong signed up for Earth Hour 2019, according to the WWF Hong Kong website. Skyscrapers including the Bank of China Tower and the HSBC Building in Central, the city’s major business district, switched off their lights in response to the global movement. The City of Lights also turned off the Eiffel Tower’s nightly twinkle to mark Earth Hour. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo dimmed the lights on the city’s most famous monument for an hour. In Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, the island’s tallest building, Taipei 101, joined surrounding buildings in shutting off the lights as part of the Earth Hour event. In coal-reliant Poland, top tourist sites also turned off their lights when local clocks hit 8:30pm. In the capital Warsaw, the spired landmark Palace of Culture and Science turned off its night illumination, along with some churches and Old Town walls. Lights were also switched off in several landmarks in the Greek capital. The Acropolis, Athens City Hall and Lycabettus Hill, towering above the Athens centre, went dark and the parliament building joined in. However, calls by the mayor of Athens for citizens to join in by turning off the lights in their houses went mostly unheeded. The Empire State Building in New York was planning to participate in Earth Hour at 8.30pm local time (12.30am GMT)."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRight now, like the east coast of the USA, Germany is in the middle of a heat wave. Indeed the eastern parts of Germany and Poland are expected to stay hot with temperatures over 35°C (95°F) without an end in sight. Luckily I’m living in the northwest part of Germany, and here temps are expected to moderate somewhat by early next week.
Let me remind you that Joe Bastardi forecast a hot summer for Central Europe – and he’s right again. He had also forecast a cold winter 2009/10, and he hit that right on too. Who needs the Met!
Well it’s official. The first 6 months of 2010 in Germany were the coldest in 14 years, this is reported by the Readers Edition here.
The measurements go back to 1761. The first 6 months of this year (January through June) recorded an average temperature of 5.9 °C , the coldest since 1996. This value was almost 0.5°C below the longterm average of the reference value from 1961-1990 (6.4 °C).
So how does the rest of the year look for Germany and Europe as a a whole? The Readers Edition posted this graphic from the warmist NOAA. Looks like a hot July, but then cooling off.

Of course the German mainstream media hardly mentioned the cool first half year. They’re too busy complaining about the current hot weather, which most Germans rarely get and are now enjoying. And you can be sure that when August rolls around, the media will be trumpeting the “unusually hot July” as yet another sign of global warming.

"Bill Shorten has signalled Labor is highly unlikely to use carryover credits from the Kyoto protocol as part of its climate change policy, which will be unveiled over the coming weeks. In his strongest comments to date, the Labor leader said over the weekend he recognised that other countries had resolved not to use the accounting system that allows countries to count credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris emissions reduction commitments for 2030.  “One thing I do recognise about the Kyoto credits point is that some other countries have moved away from using that, as a form of our calculation, the United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark,” Shorten told reporters. “We’re seriously considering that option and we’ll have more to say in coming weeks.” Shorten’s signal follows a similar hint a week ago from the climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, at a candidates’ forum in a key Victorian marginal seat. According to an attendee at the forum in the electorate of Corangamite on 18 March, Butler said he was not personally keen to use carryovers if Labor won the coming federal election. Labor has already released its policy for reducing emissions in the electricity sector. Shortly the opposition will unveil the rest of its policy measures, expected to include a trading scheme for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year; new vehicle emissions standards to bring down pollution in transport; measures for agriculture; and its final position on the use of international permits and Kyoto credits. The Morrison government is opposed to using international permits, but has recently confirmed it will bank a 367-megatonne contribution from carryovers as part of its recently released carbon budget, which details the emissions reductions from various programs that will be required to meet the Paris target. As well as the chunk it is counting from carryovers, the government is counting just under 100 megatonnes of abatement from “technology solutions”, which have not been specified, and “other sources of abatement”. Environmental groups are opposed to deploying carryover credits as part of the abatement toolkit, because it lowers the level of ambition in emissions reduction. The Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents institutional investors such as super funds, with total funds under management of about $2tn, has also warned against substituting accounting for practical abatement, arguing the practice is “fundamentally at odds with limiting warming in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement and driving global momentum for coordinated, and increased ambition”. The Greens have been limbering up to criticise Labor if it decided to use carryovers for the looming abatement task. The Greens climate change spokesman, Adam Bandt, argued recently it was possible the ALP was leaving its options open on Kyoto credits because it could be forced to rely on credits and permits to meet its target of a 45% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, which will be imposed if Labor wins in May. The Greens argue Labor’s decision to apply their economy-wide target of 45% to the electricity sector, instead of forcing steeper abatement in electricity, where it is comparatively cheaper to cut pollution, means it will have to chase more expensive abatement in sectors such as heavy industry, transport, agriculture and waste. Bandt has argued Labor may not be able to meet its target “without relying on Scott Morrison’s accounting trick”. "
"Melting glaciers on Mount Everest are exposing the dead bodies of climbers previously entombed in ice, as global warming causes temperatures to rise. Almost 300 climbers have been killed attempting to climb the mountain since the first attempt to scale it in 1922. As the spring climbing season begins bodies which are being exposed by the melting glaciers are being removed on the Chinese side of the peak, BBC News reported. “Because of global warming, the ice sheet and glaciers are fast melting and the dead bodies that remained buried all these years are now becoming exposed,” said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of Nepal Mountaineering Association. “We have brought down dead bodies of some mountaineers who died in recent years, but the old ones that remained buried are now coming out.” Officials with the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal (EOAN) said they were bringing down all ropes from the higher camps of Everest and Lhotse mountains this climbing season, but dealing with dead bodies was not as easy. Under Nepalese law government agencies must be involved when handling bodies. “This issue needs to be prioritised by both the government and the mountaineering industry,” said Dambar Parajuli, president of EOAN. “If they can do it on the Tibet side of Everest, we can do it here as well.” In 2017, the hand of a dead mountaineer appeared above the ground at camp one. Expedition operators said they deployed professional climbers of the Sherpa community to move the body. Mountaineers say in recent years most dead bodies have been surfacing at the Khumbu icefall, which has a reputation for being a particularly dangerous part of the climb, and in the final camp area, located in South Col. Removing a dead body can cost up to $80,000 (£61,000). A study in 2015 revealed that ponds on the Khumbu glacier, which are crossed by climbers as they attempt to reach the summit, were expanding and joining up because of accelerated melting. Nepal’s army drained the Imja lake near Mount Everest in 2016 after its water from rapid glacial melt had reached dangerous levels. Another team of researchers, including members from Leeds and Aberystwyth universities in the UK, last year drilled the Khumbu glacier and found the ice to be warmer than expected. The ice recorded a minimum temperature of only −3.3C, with even the coldest ice being a full 2C warmer than the mean annual air temperature."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGet ready for some short-term cooling in the months ahead. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has released its latest ENSO report.
The BOM says sea surface temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific have continued to cool, and so the tropical Pacific is now generally cooler than average.
Below the surface, temperatures also remain significantly cooler than average, with some areas more than 4°C cooler than normal. Trade winds in the western Pacific remain stronger than normal and cloudiness near the date-line continues to be suppressed.
The BOM adds:
These indicators, together with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), which has been positive since April, are consistent with the developing stages of a La Niña event.




Climate models also predict further tropical Pacific cooling during the coming months. Most models predict cooling beyond La Niña thresholds before the end of the southern winter.


 


So with the high global temperatures we’ve seen over the last few months fizzing out, it’s the last chance for the warmists to get a few last words in for a while. Now the question remains: How strong will the La Nina get?

"The disaster to hit Mozambique is reported as one of the worst tropical cyclones to visit the southern hemisphere, with hundreds dead and hundreds of thousands more needing urgent assistance. I note the Guardian was the only major newspaper to lead with this story on Wednesday (Race to find survivors after deadly cyclone, 20 March). People suffering in Mozambique and neighbouring countries didn’t create the climate crisis, but they are dying from more intense weather events like Cyclone Idai.  In the immediate instance, the people of central Mozambique need emergency relief. But what will help them, and large numbers of people across the planet, in the longer term is for rich countries to stop funding fossil-fuel extraction. It is this activity that contributes to a warming planet, increasing the likelihood and intensity of these extreme weather events. Climate scientists are clear: storms, cyclones and floods will worsen as the planet warms. Do we sit by inertly, safe in the knowledge that cyclones don’t yet cause deaths in Britain? Something can be done to make disasters of this scale less likely. The question is: will political leaders do it? In the UK this means stopping fracking, ending coal, not expanding Heathrow: these are the activities that worsen the climate crisis now affecting Mozambique. We need to join these up, and act.Craig BennettCEO, Friends of the Earth • Weather is how most of us experience climate change, and Bill Giles’s proposal to integrate global warming into UK weathercasts would offer a compelling way for people to connect the dots (Weather reports need climate change slots, says TV veteran, 19 March). A successful model for that essential undertaking already exists. Across the US, hundreds of TV weathercasters discuss climate change in their weather segments – in accessible, locally relevant terms. That’s thanks to Climate Central’s Climate Matters initiative, a project launched in 2012 in collaboration with researchers across the country that delivers climate-related media packages to US weather reporters – typically pegged to current news hooks, with data customised to each city. Polling shows that viewers trust their weathercasters to tell them the truth. Climate Matters’ rapid expansion has shown that weathercasters are eager to deliver it, helping to end the “TV news desert” around global warming. And access to Climate Matters isn’t restricted to weathercasters. Anyone can receive its free weekly bulletins. TV coverage of climate change need not make for heavy weather.Bernadette Woods PlackyChief meteorologist and climate matters director, Climate Central • How can we campaign for the BBC to do more to highlight climate change following the call by former weatherman Bill Giles for there to be a climate-change slot in its weather reports? If we only have 12 years left to try to limit the effects of climate change, the BBC and other broadcasters need to do much more.Caroline EvansWest Ealing, London  • Your editorial (Rising temperatures are no reason to be cheerful. Forecasts should face the facts, 20 March) advocates the inclusion of information on climate change in weather forecasting. However, it goes on to discuss weather forecasts as if there wasn’t one within the pages of the paper. It would be a simple matter for the Guardian to take the lead and include a “carbon counter to counter carbon”, to show the daily measurements from the Mauna Loa observatory (currently 411 parts per million) against the safe level of 300ppm.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, Oxfordshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Labor is set to unveil a climate policy that will beef up the Morrison government’s heavily criticised safeguard mechanism, creating new pollution reduction requirements for the aviation sector, cement, steel and aluminum, mining and gas, direct combustion and the non-electricity energy sectors. Currently the safeguard mechanism applies to businesses with direct emissions of more than 100 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent pollution each year, and Labor’s policy is expected to lower that threshold to 25 kilotonnes, which means more sectors and businesses will be covered.  It is anticipated Labor’s policy will allow over-achievement on the new, more stringent, baselines, which will allow businesses who cut pollution more aggressively to generate carbon credits that can be traded with other businesses that cannot meet their targets. In practice, this means the electricity sector, which Labor proposes to cover with a separate regulatory regime, will be able to sell carbon permits to heavy emitters. The policy is expected to include new land clearing regulations – but nothing more concrete for agriculture – and curbs on vehicle pollution. It is likely to point to a target of reducing CO2 emissions from vehicles to 105 grams of CO2 a kilometre, and also introduce incentives for electric vehicles and support for electric vehicle infrastructure. Labor is expected to unveil the remainder of its climate policy during the final hectic sitting days of the parliament, with MPs returning to Canberra at the weekend and on Monday for the budget session. As well as delivering the economic statement it hopes will be a positive springboard into the election – which could be called next weekend – the Morrison government will use the remaining parliamentary sitting days to pursue legislation making it a criminal offence for social media companies not to remove violent material, with errant executives to face imprisonment for three years. The prime minister met executives of social media companies earlier this week, and warned the government would legislate unless the companies gave assurances they would “immediately institute changes to prevent the use of their platforms, like what was filmed and shared by the perpetrators of the terrible offences in Christchurch”. The government was unhappy with the response to Scott Morrison’s overture on Tuesday, so resolved to legislate. The new offences would require platforms anywhere in the world to notify the Australian federal police if they become aware their service was streaming abhorrent violent conduct that was happening in Australia. The government said failure to comply would be punishable by imprisonment for Australian or overseas executives, or fines that could reach up to 10% of the platform’s global annual turnover. Morrison said social media platforms were being “weaponised by terrorists” so the parliament needed to take action. “Big social media companies have a responsibility to take every possible action to ensure their technology products are not exploited by murderous terrorists,” he said. “It should not just be a matter of just doing the right thing. It should be the law, and that is what my government will be doing next week to force social media companies to get their act together and work with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to defuse the threat their technologies can present to the safety of Australians.” Morrison is expected to write to the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, at the weekend to seek Labor’s support."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi here gives us a heads-up on what the planet has in store for us in the months ahead, warning:
…wait till you global temp watchers get a load of what is coming.
Joe is just using the NOAA’s own data. Look at the NOAA’s projection for the months ahead.

You can find this chart: NOAA here
Take a good look at surface temps at the poles for early next year. It’s no wonder Joe has been predicting massive Arctic sea ice recovery starting next year, and adds:
 I mean both poles cold and then 75% of the earth under normal? Geez, I know there is cooling that is going to go on, but this is a bit drastic.
 If it’s the almighty climate models that are the reason to keep forecasting warm, and they are showing this kind of crash ( such an event could take the running 13 month temp of the earth next year to -.2 or -.3…as this La Nina, low solar cycle and cumulative volcanic activity means business, then things may be quicker than I thought.
Joe’s been predicting something like this for many months. Some people have been scoffing at his forecasts. Well now even the alarmist NOAA is confirming Joe’s forecast. I always say: If you need pretty good forecasts, then Go to Joe!

" Australian researchers have discovered huge underwater lakes beneath the largest glacier in east Antarctica. The lakes were detected by scientists setting off small explosives 2m below the surface of the Totten glacier and listening to the reflected sound.  The Australian Antarctic Division glaciologist Dr Ben Galton-Fenzi said the research was critical to helping scientists predict how the melting of Antarctic glaciers would change the world’s oceans. The Totten glacier is 30km wide and up to two kilometres thick, and has the potential to raise sea levels by seven metres. “The explosives were a sound source for us … and it would then echo off different layers in the ice,” Galton-Fenzi told the Guardian. “We placed geophones [a series of microphones] along the surface of the glacier to listen to the reflected sound, giving us a picture of what lies beneath the ice.” He said the speed glaciers travel at is determined by what they move across. “If there’s bedrock under the glacier, it’s sticky and will move more slowly, but if there’s water or soft sediments, the glacier will move faster,” he said. Galton-Fenzi said the next step for researchers would be to drill down to take a sample of the lakes but he lamented there was no funding certainty for future research. “This is the single biggest problem we need to face and have answers to over the next couple of decades,” he said. “I’m not just a scientist saying ‘I need more money’ … I’ve got kids who are six and eight and [climate change] is a real threat for them.” The scientists, who were based at Casey research station, were among more than 550 expeditioners who travelled with the Australian Antarctic Program over the southern summer, working on more than 56 projects."
"The government’s fracking proposals would release the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions as almost 300 million new cars, fatally undermining ministers’ obligation to tackle the escalating climate crisis, according to new research. Analysis by the Labour party shows that the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere if the government’s plans go ahead would be the same as the lifetime emissions of 286 million cars – or 29 new coal-fired power plants.  The findings come as ministers’ efforts to kickstart their fracking proposals face growing resistance, with defeat in the courts, fierce local objections and opposition from Labour and Tory councils alike. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was in Lancashire on Saturday to join the anti-fracking campaign in the region, said a future Labour government would ban fracking “once and for all”. “The Conservatives’ fracking plans will damage our environment and fly in the face of community opposition,” he said. “There is a clear alternative to fracking. Clean, renewable energy is the future of our economy and will create more than 400,000 jobs as part of Labour’s green industrial revolution.” Concerns about drilling flared in the run-up to Christmas when energy company Cuadrilla was forced to pause operations near Blackpool three times after drilling caused small earthquakes that breached government safety limits. Several local authorities – including London, Manchester, Leeds, Wakefield, Hull and York – have expressed opposition to fracking. There is also opposition from many Tories. In Westminster, almost two dozen Tory MPs are reported to be against fracking and willing to “destroy the government’s majority” if it tries to weaken planning laws. Several Tory-run local authorities – including Derby, Dorset and Nottinghamshire – are fiercely opposed to a change in planning proposals, which would mean companies could drill test sites without applying for permission. Labour, which has vowed to oversee “an economic revolution to tackle the climate crisis”, says on top of the widespread opposition, the government’s plans would produce huge amounts of greenhouse gases, wrecking any chance of the UK complying with its Paris climate obligations. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, said: “Fracking can’t be part of the solution to climate change. These figures demonstrate the debt we owe to the communities and campaigners who have fought back against fracking and prevented the Tories from pushing our country off a climate cliff.” The government remains committed to fracking. Ministers argue fracked gas will play a vital part of the UK’s energy mix and will create thousands of jobs. The plans came in for criticism from one of the world’s leading climate scientists last year. James Hansen, who is known as the father of climate science, accused ministers of aping Donald Trump and ignoring scientific evidence. He said the industry would contribute to climate breakdown and warned future generations would judge ministers harshly. Earlier this month the plans received a setback in the high court when it ruled the government’s fracking guidelines were unlawful as they did not take into account the impact on climate change. Long-Bailey added: “The government needs to realise that it’s time to change course and ban fracking before it’s too late.”"
"Driving fast on a clear road is for many people one of the pleasures of modern life. It seems to express all the feelings of power and autonomy that the daily grind so cruelly denies us. Speed limits then become just another petty restriction to be shoved aside by people glorying in their proper freedom. But now, it seems, all this is to come to an end. A directive approved by the European commission, which will apply in the UK whether or not we leave the EU, will require all new cars sold after 2022 to contain devices that will discourage drivers from speeding, either by limiting the effect of the accelerator pedal or simply by nagging them as seatbelt warnings do today. This technology already exists and was in fact widely welcomed by the motoring press when it appeared on the mass market Ford Focus. Once it becomes mandatory in all new cars though, we can expect resistance to increase. It is almost impossible to construct a good argument against the technological enforcement of existing law, but this won’t stop people trying. One motoring journalist has already suggested that drivers will be so frustrated to find others are observing the speed limit that they will overtake them recklessly – and that will of course be the fault of the new technology, not the overtaking driver.  Speed limits are held to be an infringement of personal liberty in a way that only some drug laws are, and they are at present even more widely flouted. This is bad for two reasons. The most obvious is safety. Speed does kill. Other things being equal, a collision will be more dangerous at higher speeds. Arguments about driver skill are irrelevant here. For any given degree of skill, higher speeds give less time to react. Then there is the environmental argument: so long as cars are powered by non-renewable resources, whether directly or indirectly, the extra energy they use when driving faster must contribute to climate change. From the driver’s point of view, these are irrelevant externalities but everyone, driver or not, must also live on this burning planet. Perhaps the best arguments are those that concentrate on the hazards of automation more generally. There is a recognised tendency for drivers to put too much trust in automated systems, or to be bored into inattention by their apparent reliability. This has led to a couple of fatal crashes in the US. But those were the result of systems that offer to steer the car as well as to control its speed. It is difficult to imagine such problems of lethal boredom arising on the crowded twisty roads of Europe. The speed limitations are only part of the package of measures proposed. They may not even be the most important. It’s possible that the most significant will be the mandatory introduction of data recorders, like aeroplane black boxes, which can be interrogated after crashes to find their cause. The data will be for the most part anonymised and temporary, but this will help to make both cars and drivers safer."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNote there is no mention at all of “man-made” here.In the coming weeks Russian scientists plan to publish the results of their work on their investigation on the cause of the extremely hot 2010 Russian summer. This was reported yesterday in the German edition of Ria Novosti here.
The study was conducted by the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control (Rosgidromet), headed by Alexander Frolow, and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Both organizations analyzed the summer weather anomaly.
Ria Novosti writes:
According to Frolow, the situation was influenced by a group of causes, among them a stubborn high pressure area and an unfavorable combination of ocean temperature anomalies. The situation in the European part of Russia was worsened by dry winds coming from other regions.
According to estimates by the scientists, this weather  anomaly was caused 20% by global climate change.
Note there is no mention in the Ria Novosti report of “man-made climate change” – only “climate change”. Since climate is always changing naturally, in sync with other cycles like ocean and solar cycles, evidence of a human greenhouse gas fingerprint as the cause would seem to be impossible to discern.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis blog here is not a casino for high rollers. In fact, it’s not a casino at all. Yet, one warmist reader robhon left a comment here proposing a bet which I find quite interesting. Here’s what he proposes:
I’m taking bets with deniers that the decade from 2010 to 2019 will end with at least 7 of the warmest years on record (again, global temperature… you choose the data set, UAH, GISS, RSS, HadCRU…). So, if you genuinely believe that we are headed for a cooling trend, put your money where your mouth is. I will.”
I think what he wants to say is that the next decade will be warmer than the one we just finished. The next decade to me is 2011 – 2020. I propose the following:
I pledge to bet USD 50.00 (fifty US dollars) that the decade of 2011 – 2020 will be cooler globally on average than the decade 2001 – 2010. We will simply take the average of both decades and compare to see which is higher. I suggest using either UAH or RSS, or a composite of both satellite datasets.
Here’s how it looks so far:

You warmists are all saying it’s going to get warmer. What are you waiting for? Man, I can see that trendline just zooming right on up through the next decade – can’t you?
I’m even going to open this bet up for everyone, with all proceeds going to a charity like Children’s Hospice International.
All proceeds will go to a children’s charity.

Anyone who wishes to pledge a sum (min $5) will be able to send an e-mail to me and I will make a list of all those particpating and post it here. That total amount will then need to be matched by robhon and his warmist pals. We can place a limit so that it doesn’t get out of hand. The bet has to be accepted by February 1, 2011.
Anyone who wants to join in for a good cause, make your pledges by then. And then we will see if robhon is ready to go for it.
What do you say amigo?
If the 2011/20 decade averages to be warmer than 2001/10, then I will concede that the earth is indeed warming. But if the next decade turns out to be cooler or the same, then you will have to concede that the theory that CO2 is driving the climate is bunk.  We can work out the details in the days and weeks ahead.
Heck, the PIK ought to be the first to step up. Mr Rahmstorf made such a bet 2 years ago – and says he won!
Looking foraward to hearing your prompt reply.
P Gosselin
PS: I’ve I sent an e-mail to robhon to let him know.
=================================================
UPDATE:  Folks, the bet is on! Robhon has accepted, see his comment! He certainly is exuding quite a bit of confidence. Crap! Now I wish Dec. 2010 had been much warmer!

"The Greens are positioning to torpedo a key element of Labor’s new climate policy in the event Bill Shorten wins the federal election in May, telegraphing strong opposition to heavy polluters using international permits to meet their emissions reduction targets. The thumbs-down from the Greens, who will likely be the critical Senate bloc post-election in the event of a Labor victory, comes as the politically influential motoring lobby has also signalled it will push back on Labor’s proposal to introduce vehicle efficiency standards for light vehicles that would bring Australia broadly into line with carbon pollutions standards for cars in the US.  The Australian Industry Group, which represents some of Australia’s heavy emitters, also argued the 45% emissions target proposed by Labor would represent a “heavy lift” for many parts of the economy and “would be workable only if they were delivered in tandem with commitments to avoid trade distortions, allow many sources of flexibility and facilitate major low-carbon investments”. Labor on Monday, on budget eve and only days before the calling of the election, unveiled the final tranche of its climate policy. The policy includes more stringent pollution-reduction requirements for heavy industry, a new vehicle emissions standard imposed on car retailers, and new targets to increase the share of electric vehicles in the transport fleet. The Morrison government went on the political offensive immediately, likening the measures to a carbon “tax”. The prime minister claimed Labor’s beefed-up pollution requirements for big emitters would force companies to purchase international carbon credits, “sending money offshore to foreign carbon traders – carbon credits from Kazakhstan”. The Greens’ climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, used similar language to Morrison: “We cannot outsource our emissions reduction obligations to a pig farm in Ukraine.” Bandt said international offsets were “fake action because Australian polluters will buy overseas permits from other countries but keep polluting at home. International offsets delay climate action in Australia. More coal will be burnt at home and the transition to 100% renewables will be delayed”. Labor defended the decision to deploy permits as part of the abatement options. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said the government needed to explain why it supported Australian businesses trading in international markets, but not international carbon markets. “What we need are cuts in pollution, whether they are from the Australian carbon farming sector or overseas robust credible markets or the electricity sector – the important thing is for cuts in pollution to be achieved … in the most cost-effective and efficient manner possible,” Butler said. A pitched backroom lobbying campaign has prevented governments imposing vehicle emissions standards in Australia for years. The Australian Automobile Association warned on Tuesday “a poorly designed standard will drive up the cost of cars”, despite government modelling indicating vehicle efficiency standards would actually deliver billions of dollars in fuel savings for consumers. Labor has proposed a pollution regulation that will bring Australian cars in line with 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre, but will consult on the timeline for phasing in the change. The AAA remains opposed to a model that would mirror standards in the European Union or the US and has successfully argued for years that the needs of Australian drivers are unique. On Monday the AAA said it supports the introduction of an emissions standard that recognises the “unique needs and preferences of Australian motorists”, but that a “poorly-designed standard” would drive up the cost of cars and petrol.  The issue of vehicle efficiency standards has been politically toxic, with attempts by the current government to introduce them derailed by the National party and the motoring and petroleum lobbies. The consequence of that is Australia now lags behind the rest of the world in introducing standards that would help deal with the country’s second-highest source of emissions – the transport sector. One motor lobby, the NRMA, has taken a different position to the AAA and says Australia is so far behind it will have to look at banning internal combustion engine vehicle sales within the next decade. Labor has also proposed a national electric vehicle target of 50% of all new car sales by 2030. Other industry groups on Monday said they wanted to see more detail on how the opposition plans to implement its climate policies if it wins government in May. The Ai Group’s chief executive, Innes Willox, said proposed pollution requirements for different sectors under a beefed-up safeguard mechanism would need to be achieved through low-cost abatement anywhere in the domestic economy, as well as through credible international options. He warned assisting industries exposed as a result of the transition to a low-carbon economy could be difficult when many currently weren’t defined as emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries under government arrangements. Willox also said that options for low- and zero-carbon transition in industry needed to be more tangible. “The proposed Strategic Industries Fund could be useful, though important detail is lacking on coverage, level of matching and more,” Willox said. “In short, we should not underestimate how difficult the trade-offs would be between the expectations of different industries and other stakeholders. Close consultation with the breadth of affected industries would be essential to deliver on such ambitious goals.” Environment groups, meanwhile, said the package was a substantial step forward on climate but still fell short on issues including the need to replace coal-fired power and reduce deforestation. Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said: “There is still a cognitive dissidence in our national debate about the climate damage the coal we dig up and send overseas is causing. No party can claim to be truly serious on climate change until it stops Adani and develops a strategy to accelerate the transition away from coal.”  The Australia Institute’s Richie Merzian said the policy had the potential “to actually reduce emissions in line with a credible and achievable emission reduction target of 45% by 2030”."

Seriously, looking at the reactions at the other sites and comments, I see a lot of people using this to put thenselves high up on the moral pedestal, overdone indignation and grandstanding. Heck, you’d think the exploding people in the video were real people reading some of the comments. Sure the clip is in bad taste. But it’s just heavy, dark humour. Arguments could be made about the underlying message.
Will the video backfire? Definitely yes.
I think the Greenpeace hooded punk video is far worse. Here we have a kid that is brainwashed and trained to really hate (no humour there at all – pure hatred). Anyway, we see an emerging pattern of violent eco-activism.

Now that’s a clip to get upset about.

Share this...FacebookTwitterReaching an agreement in Cancun is out of reach. Representatives are desperate, and so they will go through every motion to give the appearance they are doing something  – anything. They are obligated to go through the formalities of trying, after all.
Der Spiegel reports here that Germany’s Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen is now singing a whole new tune. Instead of singing the blues, he’s now whistling Dixie! And that likely through his you know what. Der Spiegel wrote yesterday:
The German environment minister, it would seem, is tired of issuing dark warnings of impending climate change disaster. ‘In Germany, we have begun to see things in a different light in recent years,’ Norbert Röttgen said on Wednesday during his first appearance at the UN climate summit in Cancun, Mexico. ‘People in business, in politics and in the society at large no longer see climate change as a threat, but as an opportunity and a challenge.’
Suddenly it’s no longer a threat, and now climate change will bring us opportunities. Obviously leaders have realised that people are not being scared into acceptong policy anymore, and so now the new tactic is to try to lure them into policy with pretty pictures.
Face it, the panic tactic has failed. Climate change is 10,000 times more boring than watching grass grow. It’s a very slow process. Indeed it would take a human an entire lifetime to even notice today’s sea level rise rate. That’s why the tactic of pretty pictures and nice stories is now being tried.
Röttgen claims:
Our strategy of investing in renewable energies and energy efficiency proved itself successful in times of economic and financial crisis.

If we approach our target in an efficient manner, we will have created 500,000 additional jobs by 2020 and will spend over €20 billion ($27 billion) less on energy imports.”
Sounds good on the surface. But what is not mentioned is that consumers would be forced to buy up expensive renewable energy at, let’s say, 35 cents a kwh instead of importing it for 3 cents a kwh – or producing it domestically with conventional methods for 4 cents a kwh. In the end, its the poor consumer who would get screwed, and man-made climate change would still remain a fairy tale.
Don’t expect this new rosy facade put on by Röttgen to sway positions, which have long since been decided and cemented. Der Spiegel writes:
China, however, continues to resist concrete targets for cuts in its greenhouse gas emissions. Early in the week, there were some reports from the talks in Cancun that China may be prepared to compromise. Deputy Chinese climate negotiator Liu Zhenmin said on Monday, however, that such reports resulted from a “misunderstanding.” Pledges from Beijing, he said, are “voluntary” and “non-negotiable.”
Non-negotiable. And as far as the USA is concerned any bill reaching Congress would be DOA.
For those of you out there still worried that leaders might do something really stupid, and actually sign something – stop worrying. Merkel hasn’t jumped on any jet to Cancun, and she isn’t going to. Cancun was pronounced dead before it even got started.
Parading the dead body that is Cancun through the conference may make it look like it’s alive, but it’s still dead. Time to bury it.

Just got back, and here’s a recap of the conference, which I wrote on the train.
Yesterday’s first speaker was Vincent Courtillot, who spoke  about consensus. As soon as debate is abandoned, he says, then science stops. Overall he says the debate has to open up, and that it is surely poisoned by politics. I thought he gave an excellent speech.
Next, because Fred Singer couldn’t attend, we heard a 10 minute audio-message he had recorded earlier, where in it he said that there is no evidence of man made global warming, and that sea level rise for the next 90 years will rise around 18 cm, and not 1.5 m as the Propaganda Institute for Klima (PIK) claims. Singer also said he sees waning political will. He thinks the climate issue will be settled in five years. I think he’ll be right.
Prof Nir Shaviv 
Nir Shaviv then explained solar activity and climate, showing that the link between solar activity, cosmic rays and cloud formation is pretty much in the bag. CERN will be soon releasing results on this, too. Oceanic warming is not due to CO2, but to solar radiation. In fact, sea level rise rate correlates with the solar cycles, which I found interesting. Yet, in all presentations, the scientists cautioned against confusing correlation with causation. In summary, Shaviv theorises that the sun modulates the oceans, which in turn modulate the atmosphere (climate). The lag between solar activity and impact on climate was said to be about 3 years. Thus we ought to start seeing the impacts of the current low solar activity that has set in since about 2008.
Looking out the window, I’d say it’s about right!
The next presentation by Henrik Borchert complimented Shaviv’s presentation, supporting the solar link, which I think is the obvious place to look if you are going to look for what really drives climate. During many of these presentations, the CO2-driver theory was shown to have no merit, and was discarded every time. No wonder they don’t want to debate it.
Bob Carter
Bob Carter gave one of the most interesting talks, where he put the current warming in geological context. Conclusion: Nothing unnatural with today’s changes is detetctable. A later mathematical presentation by Horst-Joachim Lüdecke confirmed the same.
One point I found interesting was that most of today’s animals have their orgins from about 5 million years ago, meaning they’ve survived the wide climate variations of the ice ages, which means all the scare talk about biodiversity not surviving one or two degrees of temperature change is pure bunk. The only ones with a problem with a degree or two are the whiny warmists. They rest of the planet will be fine with it.
Lots of focus on proxies
Günter Ederer 
One of the most entertaining and interesting speeches came from veteran German journalist Günter Ederer, who has lots of contacts and thus has excellent insights as to what is going on. If you have the chance to hear him speak – don’t pass it up. He mentioned during the break that he will be coming out with a new book, and for sure it will be an interesting one. For Ederer: “The IPCC is not interested in science.” Indeed Ederer makes it clear where this is all taking us – some place really ugly.
Jan Veizer focused on sun evapo-transpiration and produced data and charts clearly showing that CO2 is not the driver. Also the claim that there is no correlation between solar irradiance and temperature over the last years was fabricated, and thus the solar theory cannot be discarded. They adjusted the solar irradiance data with no justification. Veizer presented a number of correlations showing the sun is the driver.
Why would that be difficult to believe?

I liked his analogy where he compared to CO2 to Lichtenstein. If warmists were economists, they would try to boost the entire European economy by stimulating the economy of tiny Lichtenstein. That’s pretty much how they want to control the climate.
Meteorologist Klaus-Eckhardt Puls, 3rd from left.
One presentation I enjoyed, and one that throws in lots more uncertainty, was by Ian Pilmer, a geologist. Fascinating was the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of volcanoes below the sea level and many under Antarctica, and not a bit of data has been collected on any of these. These emit huge amounts of CO2.
The best one! The most interesting presentation was made by meteorologist Klaus-Eckhart Puls. His lively, fast-paced presentation drove nails into the coffin of the AGW notion. First he showed that North Sea sea levels have been rising at the same rate for four hundred years now. NO SIGN OF ACCELERATED SEA LEVEL RISE! He also showed that the Sahara is shrinking as plant life is encroaching more and more. 300,000 sq km of trees were added over the last 20 years (as recently reported in FOCUS). He also debunked all the hyped up media claims of more storms and stronger this or that. His presentation had a good dose of humour and will be really worth watching when EIKE posts it.
During the break
The conference then ended with presentations by Dieter Ameling, Lutz Peters and Michael Limburg. Regrettably I couldn’t stay for the closing speech because trains don’t wait.
From a political and economic standpoint, the consensus is that the German government’s environmental and green economy policies are going to take Germany to hell in a hand basket – and quickly. But, being a guest here, I’ll refrain from commenting.
One speaker did point out that in communist times, you couldn’t say anything because they were always listening. But today, you can say anything you want, because they’ve stopped listening!
Now the big disappointment
I went there with high expectations because I kept hearing from the real climate scientists, who claim absolute knowledge, that the sceptics are funded by Big Oil. So I was hoping to go to Berlin Denier Conference and get some of that Big Oil money too.
But much to my dismay, the oil executives weren’t even there, and so I wasn’t able to close a disinformation for funding agreement. What crap! So I spoke to the gents at Science Sceptical, a German blog, and they also have to go without. So my dream of getting millions for doing this blog have completely vanished. All this blogging has been for nothing – fooled again by the warmists. When will I ever learn not to trust them?
Anyway, if there are any oil executives out there reading this blog, please note that I’m now seriously considering changing sides – and going where the big money is :).
Finally, my apologies for any misspelled names.

Steffen Hentrich of the Liberal Institute of the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundtaion for Freedom
Steffen Hentrich of the Liberal Institute at the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation for Liberty blasted the 10:10 No Pressure clip, calling it a manual for climate terrorism. Read here in German.
Here the term “Liberal” is the so-called “classic liberal, and not to be confused with the kind one finds in the USA.
He warns that the windmills turning in the wind and shiny solar panels on roofs are the harmless stage for a not-to-be excluded eco-dictatorship that would have zero respect for humanity.
Here are some excerpts of his comments I translated in English:
What do we do with people who do not wish to join in the climate protection movement propagated upon us by environmental activists and politicians? You just blow them up and justify it by claiming these few non-conformists are nothing when compared to the 300,000 people who have supposedly already died because of climate change so far. For this number there is no scientific basis, just climate models.

Just 65 years after the end of National Socialism, under whose dehumanizing ideology millions of human beings were murdered in the most brutal manner, and 21 years after the fall of communism, where its collective Weltanschauung claimed just as many lives, and only 9 years since the attacks on the WTC, which claimed thousands of lives because of religious fanaticism, a radical environmental movement today does not even bother to hide how it would like to deal with people who do not agree with its end of the world scenarios and prefer to opt out of its simplistic world rescue program.
Unfortunately the German mainstream media, big cheerleaders of the climate protection madness, have been completely silent thus far. Surely they are shocked by the clip’s content but are keeping a low profile. They’ve had three days now. Shame shame.
Where is that model of democracy and human rights which Germany has been since the end of WWII? Tragically many have been just too caught up in the eco-zealotry.
Steffen Hentrich in one of the few who has stood up and publicly denounced the clip and its message in Germany.
(He is also a regular contributor to the online Freie Welt daily.)

Der Spiegel
Stern
Die Welt
Focus
FAZ
For example I just called and spoke to a gentleman at Der Spiegel. The man I spoke to claimed he was not aware of the story. I actually had to spell “10:10 No Pressure” to him. “Is it written with numbers or letters?” he asked. In general he was not very friendly acted completely bored and arrogant about it. Indeed, a very touchy subject at Der Spiegel.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHat tip Ron de HaanSo far it’s been a really cold winter for much of Europe, and so you’d think we’d be due for a little relief. Think again!
Although western Europe will enjoy some milder temps this weekend, it isn’t going to last long. Already next week the bitter cold will be back. This is just the kind of winter weather that not only paralyzes economic activity, but also wreaks havoc on streets and highways – freeze-thaw-freeze cycles that rip asphalt surfaces apart. Expect major damage this winter and huge potholes later on.
Joe Bastardi’s latest video Europe Gets Hit by Extreme Cold is not good news. By Tuesday night the cold will spread over Central and Western Europe. Bastardi:
By the time we get to the latter part of next week and on into the Christmas week, this is a severe event, no question about it.
We’re looking at a top 5 or 10 cold December.
I feel we should warn you, things are going to be real nasty in the next 2 weeks, and perhaps 3 weeks.”
To me this is okay. All them warmist representatives thinking they were going to enjoy sun, beach and warmth in Cancun found themselves shivering there in 100-year record cold. And now they can come back and disembark from their planes and into the cold reality in Europe, and wonder where all the warming is.
Hint: it’s in the models and your dumb heads, and nowhere else.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s another from the “do as I say, and not as I do” hypocrites department. It’s World Cup time in South Africa and the world’s biggest sporting event is attracting the world’s biggest names (and environmentalists). 
The Financial Times has a report here on air traffic congestion caused by too many private jets flying to and from Durban, South Africa, all thanks in large part to celebrities and leaders; some of whom are well-known for environmental activism. Angela Merkel for example made the flight from Germany to South Africa to watch Germany’s quarterfinal game. Bill Clinton attended some USA matches.
But Leonardo DiCaprio emerges as the World Cup champion hypocrite. Enviro-Dicaprio thinks its okay to jet-set between his mansions, sporting events and Las Vegas nightclubs with Paris Hilton, after making his bust enviro-drama documentary, which admonishes the rest of the world to live more modestly.
Can you see the solar panels? Well, neither can I. 
Indeed, congestion caused by the environmentally destructive private jet traffic in Durban got so bad that it caused additional environmentally destructive rerouting of commercial jets. According to the Financial Times: 
The situation was described as “absolute chaos” by the pilot of one British Airways flight which took off from Cape Town in mid-afternoon but was diverted to Johannesburg.

The BA pilot added: 
…that the problem was caused by the airport allowing too many private jets to land at Durban, leaving the runways clogged up and unable to accept scheduled flights. 
The BA pilot also 
…told passengers he had no choice but to take the plane to Johannesburg because the plane’s fuel was starting to run low. 
Flights had to be rerouted to Johannesburg so as not to interfere with the travelling celebrities. 
The baggage hall at OR Tambo international airport in Johannesburg was filled with scores of angry fans, some of whom said they had spent up to R10,000 ($1,300) for their semi final tickets.

Der Spiegel reports on the growling-ever-louder Indonesian Merapi volcano in an article titled: Geologists Warning of Mega-Eruption of Merapi. Hat-tip to reader Ike.

The Merapi eruptions are becoming more violent – and the big bang could be just ahead. The Indonesian volcano has been spewing 800°C ash clouds for days.

//-->




According to Der Spiegel, 122 people have been killed, most on Friday. “Merapi is among the most dangerous volcanoes,” says geo-scientist Volker Steinbach of the German Federal Administration for Geoscience and Raw Materials (BGR). Der Spiegel adds:
Friday’s eruption is its worst this decade, says the chief geologist of the Energy Administration, Raden Sukhyiar, in the “Jakarta Post”. The biggest known eruptions occurred in 1006, 1369, 1786, 1822, 1872 – destroying a large number of villages – and 1930 when 1300 people perished.
Investigations of the volcano have revealed that an unprecedented Magma reservoir lurks underneath it, says Birger Lühr, a volcano researcher at the GFZ in Potsdam, Germany.
A rough estimate indicates that there is three times more magma than what was ejected by the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815 – the biggest eruption in the last 10,000 years, which led to a cooling of the climate globally.
Geoscientists aren’t sure what to make of this huge magma reservoir. As Der Spiegel reports, they are hesitant to make predictions of catastrophe (That’s only done in climate science, even though the odds are far less).

Word of a ‘mega-eruption’ is making the rounds among scientists. But apparently they are avoiding the use of the word to avoid being labelled preachers of disasters. ‘We can only speculate what the volcano will do,’ says Birger Lühr. Merapi is hardly predictable.

History shows, however, that volcanoes in Indonesia have a worrisome potential for catastrophic eruptions. Nature cannot be controlled. It can only be coped with.

Trash washes up in Tanzania. (Photo credit: Loranchet / Wikipedia)
We’ve heard about a giant patch of garbage supposedly floating out in the Pacific, yet another unmistakable sign of the scourge that man is to the planet. Read NatGeo here and The Independent here and NPR here, just to name a few.
It turns out that it’s all a huge exaggeration.
Caught red-handed again! Who can believe these media organizations any longer? Sadly this is routine procedure when reporting on climate change and evironment.
Wikipedia here calls it the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and describes it as the Pacific Trash Vortex, which is estimated to be an area the size of the state of Texas to one larger than the continental United States.
There’s just one problem, though. Wikipedia writes: 
Despite its size and density, the patch is not visible from satellite photography.”
Hmmm. Well, there’s a good reason for that. One reason is likely because it’s a heck of a lot smaller than what we have been led to believe. Today Jürgen Schönstein has a piece at science blogs titled The garbage patch is smaller than feared. Schönstein writes that marine biologist Assistant Professor Angel White of Oregon State University has come to the conclusion that the size and growth of the patch is “grossly exaggerated by the media”:

The amount of plastic out there isn’t trivial. But using the highest concentrations ever reported by scientists produces a patch that is a small fraction of the state of Texas, not twice the size.”
You can read the Oregon State Univsersity press release here. Well, you might say, Texas is a big place and even a small fraction is a lot. The press release writes:
The studies have shown is that if you look at the actual area of the plastic itself, rather than the entire North Pacific subtropical gyre, the hypothetically “cohesive” plastic patch is actually less than 1 percent of the geographic size of Texas.”
Simple mathematics tells us that the media exaggerated the patch size by a factor of more than 200. I’m not saying there isn’t problem with marine pollution. It’s just nowhere near as bad as we are told, like many other things – climate to name one.
In the end, pick up your trash and dispose of it properly. Don’t litter! White says:
If there is a takeaway message, it’s that we should consider it good news that the ‘garbage patch’ doesn’t seem to be as bad as advertised,” White said, “but since it would be prohibitively costly to remove the plastic, we need to focus our efforts on preventing more trash from fouling our oceans in the first place.”
One final note: Have you ever compared the aftermath of a Tea Party demonstration to the aftermath of a save-the-planet type of demonstration in terms of garbage left behind? That pretty much tells you who the real big slobs are. The same can be pretty much said about their carbon footprints too, i.e. think Gore, Hollywood, UN bureaucrats, “climate scientists” and activists flying all over the globe and living high on the hog.

Reports of the Australian flood have been in the airwaves and print media here in Germany too. Of course, according to this media, it was once again all predicted by “scientists”. Today all inconvenient weather events are man-made.
Weather extremes are nothing new. Flooding in Pittsburgh in 1936. (Credit: Wikipedia)
German ZDF public television (Germany’s BBC you could say) had this piece of propaganda where the anchorman tells his viewers:
For years they had a drought that made the land infertile and brought water-intensive agriculture to an end. Back then they prayed for rain, and now they’ve gotten it – and exactly how climate scientists had predicted it. Not as a relief, but as a new catastrophe.”
Well, it’s not unusual for that region to cycle between drought and flooding, which is all mainly caused by ocean cycles (not CO2). According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) ENSO report dated Dec. 22, 2010:
La Niña periods are generally associated with above normal winter, spring and summer rainfall, particularly over eastern and northern Australia. Night-time temperatures during La Niña periods are historically warmer than average and Tropical Cyclone occurrence for northern Australia is typically higher than normal during the cyclone season (November-April).”
Certainly the ZDF was not referring to these scientists. Floods are not new to the region. They’ve happened before. Read it all here.
NTZ reader Matti Vooro quotes the BOM here (after researching BOM records):
Flooding, unlike drought, is often quite localized, and therefore not as closely tied to broad-scale controls like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. However the La Niña years of 1916, 1917, 1950, 1954 through 1956, and 1973 through 1975, were accompanied by some of the worst and most widespread flooding this century. It can safely be said that, over much of Australia, flooding is more likely than usual during La Niña years, and less likely in El Niño years, though heavy rain and flooding often accompany the breakdown of El Niño in late summer or autumn.”
The graphic below shows that major Australian flood episodes are a function of the Southern Oscillation Index:

The BOM writes:
Extended periods of high SOI in 1916/17, the mid-1950s, and the early to mid-1970s, were periods of widespread, frequent flooding.”
Take the great Roper river flood of 1940, for example. The BOM writes:
This event was all the more remarkable because preceding conditions over the Roper River catchment had been very dry; in fact the river had stopped running for the first time in living memory during December 1939.”
The BOM writes that a tropical depression formed and dumped as much as 700mm of rain in six days.
Another example is The Big Wet – January 1974. BOM:
The year 1973 was one of the wettest known over much of Australia, and in keeping with the strong La Niña event that prevailed, the 1973/74 northern wet season started early. By the end of 1973 large areas of the country were saturated. Then came January 1974, which featured probably the biggest continent-wide drenching since European settlement, inundating vast areas of the country.”
Also take a look at the Katherine Flood of 1998. Tropical cyclone Les dumped 400-500mm of rain on areas of the Katherine, Roper and Daly River catchments. The BOM writes:
Such rainfall amounts falling over catchments already saturated from heavy rain earlier in the month had a dramatic impact. By the 27th the Katherine River had risen to more than 20 metres – the largest flood in Katherine’s history, eclipsing the previous record (set in 1957) by 0.7 metres.
You can go back in history and find floods that have been far worse. What what you won’t find was a media that ran around blaming it all on the sins of man to the extent done done today.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate science studies know no bounds. I’m not making this up.
The Austrian online Der Standard reports here that Spanish scientists at the University Almeria have determined that the average European emits 2 tonnes of CO2 annually just though eating habits and excretion, this in a study appearing in the International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment.
The lead author of the study Amadeo Fernandez-Alba writes:
The entire food cycle has an impact on the climate. The treatment of sewage water contributes to this and thus must be taken into account.
According to Der Standard:
He urges consumers to not only think about health and pleasure when buying food, but also to pay attention to the environment.
The researchers studied the entire food cycle of an average Spanish man and the CO2 produced. The result was two tons per person, which is 20% of the average European’s total output. The worst for the climate are meat and milk products. Most of the greenhouse gases are emitted during the food production process – especially agriculture.

Dr Fernandez Alba says that fruits and vegetbles are the best . but they too can be problematic. The researchers say:
Consumers orient themselves less and less on seasonal production. Instead they increasingly want their strawberries and asparagus year-round. In addition, an increasing amount of tropical fruit is being consumed. That increases Co2 emissions from transport immensely.
Human excrement taken into account for the first time
For the first time, the researchers also studied greenhouse gases produced by human excrement. It turns out that this by-product is in second place not that far behind food production in GHG emissions. The scientists say:
The culprits here are mainly nitrogen and phosphorous amounts, and also gases that are produced by sewage treatment plants.
Expect Europe to start regulating our eating habits and inspecting what goes through the toilet – soon. Poor Europe has got nothing better to do.

Update: Here’s more in English: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101102131108.htm

"When the colonists arrived in Australia, they saw themselves as conquering both the continent’s land and its people. In many respects, they didn’t differentiate between the two. The Bible commands believers (in Genesis 1:28) to “replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth”.  That injunction informed terra nullius. The settlers never believed Australia empty. They knew of its Indigenous inhabitants. But they didn’t believe the natives practised agriculture – and without agriculture (that “subjugation of the land”) the continent could, they thought, only be a wilderness. The remarkable, slow-building success of Bruce Pascoe’s book Dark Emu has done much to educate white society about how wrong the settlers were. Indigenous people did practise agriculture – they just did so in a different way. The “wilderness” that the settlers saw actually represented the work of Indigenous people over tens of thousands of years, systematically and consciously burning to encourage certain plants and animals, and discourage others. It was only because of human labour that the land, as Bill Gammage notes in The Biggest Estate on Earth, reminded explorers and colonists of the manicured parks treasured by English noblemen. The work of Pascoe and others should matter to all Australians because of its implications for racial justice. But it also offers hope in the midst of the current environmental emergency. At the frontier, the settlers understood themselves at the front line in a battle between (white) people and nature. On one side stood civilisation, knowledge, culture, religion and everything else that distinguished humanity from other species; on the other lay a wilderness, desolate spiritually and physically. Later, many environmentalists simply reversed that polarity. Seeing the destruction wreaked by industrialisation, they judged the cities stultifying rather than ennobling. Nature mattered, they thought, because of its uncontamination by humanity. “In wildness,” explained the pioneering American naturalist Henry David Thoreau, “is the preservation of the world.” That kind of Romanticism spurred many of the great environmental battles in Australian history. During the crucial struggle to prevent the Franklin Dam, for instance, the Wilderness Society argued that “the advocates of wilderness are linked by an intuitive conviction that to destroy these last fragments of wild Earth is akin to destroying ourselves”. From where we are today, the problems with that well-meaning rhetoric become far more apparent. In the Australian context, an environmentalism that defends “wilderness” negates Indigenous history and unwittingly revives terra nullius. Furthermore, as Emma Marris argues in her book Rambunctious Garden, it leads, in the 21st century, to a deep pessimism. “We cling,” she writes, “to fragments of ‘virgin’ or ‘old growth’ forests, to the ‘last great places’, the ever-rarer ‘intact ecosystems,’ but they slip through our fingers. Like slivers of soap, they shrink and disappear. And we mourn. We are always mourning, because we can’t make more of such places. Every year there are fewer of them than the year before.” In the era of the Anthropocene, with the presence of humanity felt all across the planet, wilderness – if by that we mean land untouched by people – no longer exists. That’s why it’s liberating to recognise that it never really did. In every continent, humanity has always shaped nature, just as nature has always shaped humanity. In Britain, many of the most beautiful “ancient woodlands” were deliberately planted centuries ago as a source of timber, fuel or game, just as the distinctive English moors resulted from tree-felling during the Bronze and Iron Ages. “The pristine wilderness notion,” Marris continues, “is a historically created idea about what ought to count as nature, and there is no reason why we can’t change it … And we do change it, a heretofore unthinkable, exciting and energising thought occurs: we can make more nature. We can make things on Earth better, not just less bad.” Indigenous history, in particular, demonstrates that we don’t need to assume an eternal antagonism between humanity and nature. We can change how we relate to the world, the specific form of our engagement with the planet. As Pascoe argues, Aboriginal people collectively controlled their metabolism with nature, using custom, culture and law to regulate burning, hunting, planting and other forms of labour. The colonists replaced that ancient system with a capitalist agriculture driven by the imperatives of individual enrichment. As a result, as Eric Rolls explained in A Million Wild Acres, “thousands of years of grass and soil changed in a few years”, and the parklike meadows vanished. Crucially, the incredibly rapid destruction wasn’t the consequence of population pressures or industrialisation in a still very small and underdeveloped colony. What mattered was an economic shift: the destruction of a system that carefully regulated the human metabolism with nature, and the implementation of a system that rewarded those who looted the environment for individual gain. Indigenous history shows there’s nothing inevitable about the environmental carnage being unleashed now. Aboriginal Australians lived on the continent for at least 50,000 years – and that human presence improved nature rather than diminished it. We urgently need to learn from that. Sure, we can’t return to the world that existed prior to 1788. But we have access today to science that makes it possible to understand – and thus control – our metabolism with nature in ways that were previously available. We don’t have to accept the anarchy of a capitalist production that’s done so much damage in so brief a time. We need, as a matter of urgency, a planned and democratic alternative. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist • Comments on this article have been pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is on the topics that have been written about in the article"

I ventured into the French websites and found this jewel of meteorological ignorance at the French sceptic site rechauffement mediatique.org. See video here Radio Canada (broadcast in October).
Featured in the piece is veteran Quebec meteorologist Jocelyne Blouin at Radio-Canada.
Last September (er, late summer) Blouin joined a Dutch expedition to southwest Greenland with journalists, tourists and meteorologists in order to observe firsthand the devastating impacts of “climate change” on Greenland. The video report of this expedition in French, with parts in English, just couldn’t be funnier. You think AIT was bad science?
Day 1
The expedition begins in southwest Greenland at Kangerlussuaq and takes the team 40 km inland to the Russel Glacier, where they set up camp 660 m above sea level. Ms Blouin comments:
It’s weird. It’s not even cold with temperatures near 0°C even though it’s the start of winter.
Last I heard, mid September is still late summer, and so it shouldn’t be a surprise that “it’s not even cold” and that they only have to wear parkas, mittens and ski hats. And isn’t it strange how these journalists only venture out to such places at times the ice is at a minimum?
Day 2
The team walks to a moulin where the ice is 200 to 300 m thick, and they act surprised that in late summer water is flowing down into it. Also someone explains that volcanic soot and pollution aerosols trapped in the ice serve to accelerate melting. Blouin adds:
The ice is filled with crevices – a sure sign that the ice is moving a lot. It’s incredible.
Then Blouin again mentions the melt. Remember – it’s late summer in Southern Greenland! Blouin laments:
The whole time you hear running water. You can even hear it running in the crevices. There’s way too much water.
Later in the day they return to camp “full of emotion”.
Day 3

The guide explains (in English) how the glacier works like a bulldozer and how the spot they are standing on was covered with ice 10 years earlier.
Again, at the end of summer, they are surprised that water is running. Moreover, they are astonished to see pieces of the leading edge of the glacier breaking off and falling into the lake. Just a week earlier the lake was much higher. But because ice blocking the outlet had melted (in the summertime), much of it emptied out. Blouin describes what she sees:
Everywhere the glacier is retreating.
You can hear it groaning and cracking. Water is running non-stop. It’s too hot. At this time of the year water is supposed to freeze. The glaciers are supposed to be sleeping. Yet you hear it moving – cracking.
Day 4
Back on terra firma, the team is in discussion.
– You can discuss it for years and years, but that won’t solve the problem!
– We just want to stop the discussion and do something! Act!
Blouin adds:
The others want to convince the sceptics. Everyone agrees. Global warming is causing damage and here in Greenland, we have the direct proof.
The guide adds:
This summer is probably the warmest in Greenland ever recorded. It’s the beginning of what’s to come.
And later makes an emotional plea:
That’s all you need to know, indeed. Look at the glaciers! they can tell you what will happen. And what these glaciers are telling me and the public is that you can’t deny global warming. It’s impossible!
Sorry dear Mr Guide and Ms Meteorologist Blouin,  it’s not all we need to know. There’s a lot more to it. You could start by finding out why they call it “Greenland” in the first place.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote here about an expedition that included a Canadian meteorologist/journalist Jocelyne Blouin whose documentary tried to convince us that a single receding glacier at a single location in Greenland over the last 10 years was “direct proof “of climate change and so was justification to “act now”. The target of the documentary of course was to spread panic and heighten the level of urgency.
Wondering just what might be going on up there in that part of Greenland, I decided to check the weather out records of stations located around Kangerlussuaq (3)67.0°N, 50°40’W.  The following is a map of Greenland with the locations I looked at. Kangerlussuaq where Blouin’s film was made, is no. 3.
Given the fact that Kangerlussuaq has a sizable airport, one would think it would have a weather station and weather records. But GISS appears not use it as a station. Therefore I checked the GISS temperature records of locations near Kangerlussuaq.
First I checked Jakobshavn (1), which is further north. We see that the GISS series stopped in 1980. Note how the temperature follows the AMO, and that temperature rose  from 1900 to 1940, but then cooled!

Next is Angmagssalik (2) in Southeastern Greenland. Here we have a complete temperature record and see rapid warming from 1900 to 1940 as well, and then followed by cooling, and then warming over the last 30 years. The temperature trend is in sync with the AMO. Hardly looks like a continuous steady rise to me. Smoothing would show that it was a tad warmer in the 1930s and 40s.

Next is Egedesminde (4) The temperature chart starts only at 1950, where a cooling trend continues until about 1990. Suddenly the temperature spikes upwards. Looking at Google maps, this station seems to have a lot of new buildings and asphalt in the vicinity. I haven’t been able to locate the station or Stevenson screen, which is likely near the airport.

The next station near Kangerlussuaq is Godthab Nuuk (5), which is a little south and bit more west. Except for a warm 2010, the overall trend is cooling. Rapid warming has occurred since 1995. Again, looking at the airport, where perhaps the station is placed, one sees a lot of asphalt, buildings and other potential heat sources. Overall, though, the chart shows no man made global warming.

The next temperature record is Ivigut Greenland (6), which is a ways down south. Unfortunately this series ends back around 1968. But again we see the warming from 1900 to 1940, and then the start of cooling – all in sync with the AMO.

Summary
All surrounding stations show a warm time back around 1940, and a warming trend beginning around 1980 or 90, which may be due to station siting issues. All stations seem to be heavily impacted by the AMO. The claim that there is a CO2 cause, as Blouin asserts, and that the warming is unusual has no merit. Also ice cores show that Greenland was very warm 900 years ago, during the MWP.  In short: Madame Blouin est plein merde.
