"Germany, Austria, Portugal and Luxembourg are leading calls for the EU to increase its 2030 climate targets in light of December’s Paris agreement.  At a webcast meeting of environment ministers on Friday, they criticised the European commission for advising no change was needed.  Several others spoke of the need to fully participate in the five-yearly reviews of national climate plans set out in the UN text. Officials’ response to the historic international pact lacked “oomph”, said Austria’s Andrä Rupprechter. “We would have expected more in the way of ambition.” Back in October 2014, members of the 28-state bloc agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions “at least 40%” from 1990 levels by 2030. That left the door open to increasing efforts, subject to a strong international deal. The Paris pact set a tougher global goal than many observers expected, to hold temperature rise this century “well below” 2C and aim for 1.5C. Yet Germany’s Jochen Flasbarth noted references to “at least” had disappeared, describing the communication as “very weak” on that point. Carole Dieschbourg, Luxembourg minister and one of the EU’s lead negotiators in Paris, called for the 2030 framework to be updated as soon as possible. “We mustn’t waste time,” she said. “We might find that our credibility is undermined if we don’t do this.” Other member states rejected the case for a higher target, however, with Hungary, Lithuania and Italy saying it was already hard to achieve. “This is not a time for divisive issues such as raising ambition,” said Italy’s Gian Luca Galletti. It comes as the EU embarks on reforms of its emissions trading scheme (ETS) and negotiations over effort-sharing between countries. Both are fiercely contentious. On the ETS, environmentalists argue radical changes are needed to push the carbon price up from current lows of €5 (£3.9) a tonne and spur clean investment. They face off with heavy industrial lobbies who complain this will make them uncompetitive, if not matched by similar measures overseas. For emissions not covered by the carbon market, there will be tussles over how to allocate national responsibility for the 40% goal. Hungary argued that needed to be settled before countries could ratify the Paris deal. Ségolène Royal, France’s environment minister and president of the climate talks since colleague Laurent Fabius stepped down last month, urged swift ratification. France hopes to start its national process before a UN signing ceremony in New York next month and complete the formalities this summer. It was important to reflect the 1.5C goal in revisions to the ETS, she added. “We have to ensure that we are very much at the forefront of low carbon economies.” At the New York meeting, the World Bank will convene a high level panel on carbon pricing, Royal highlighted. By encouraging taxes and trading schemes worldwide, it could address some concerns about “carbon leakage”."
"Daashka and his brother tear across the Mongolian steppe on a motorbike in a desperate search for somewhere to graze their herds. Pastureland is dwindling rapidly as the country is beset by a cycle of drought and harsh winter that is killing off livestock in droves. “The summer ends early now and the fall is short and dry. Then there’s the long winter,” said Daashka, a 19-year-old herder who uses just one name and lives in the central Ulziit region.  The family’s herd, mostly sheep and goats, has shrunk from about 1,000 animals to 600, Daashka said, leaning against the motorbike on an exposed patch of dirt that, in other years, would have been covered by the roots of grass and other vegetation. Mongolia is experiencing a natural disaster called a dzud. The phenomenon, unique to the country, usually occurs after a summer drought is followed by heavy winter snowfall that makes already scarce pastures inaccessible to livestock.  In the past, the country experienced widespread dzud about once in a decade, but they have recently been occurring every few years. Experts say the rising frequency is due to a combination of climate change and human activity, which has increased the size of herds to levels the grasslands cannot sustain. With temperatures dipping below -40C (-40F) in the evenings and extreme cold expected until April, Daashka’s family saved enough money to buy feed, which they hope will keep their herd alive until the spring.  Other nomads have not been so fortunate.  Half a mile away, about 100 dead goats and sheep were piled up among the rocks. The family was elsewhere with what remained of their herd, leaving one goat clinging to life near the relative warmth of a yurt, the traditional tent dwelling with a coal-burning heater inside. Mongolia’s foreign ministry last month asked for aid to help deal with the dzud. It estimated that about $4.4m (£3.09m) is required for emergency vehicles, warm clothes, medicine and food to assist herders, in addition to hay, animal feed and vaccinations to keep livestock alive. But the government has stopped short of declaring a state of emergency, which is required before some international agencies can allocate funding for emergency relief.  Impassable roads covered with thick snow and ice are making it difficult for aid workers to reach herders. More than 400,000 people in the northern and western parts of the country are at risk, with millions of livestock facing starvation in the weeks and months ahead, the Red Cross said in an appeal for funds last week.  “Global warming is causing about 50% of the problems and local forces cause the other 50%,” said Purevjav Gomboluudev, head of climate research at Mongolia’s information and research institute of meteorology, hydrology and environment.  About half of Mongolia’s 3 million people rely on livestock production. But with oversupply, prices have plunged on animal products such as milk, wool, meat and camel hair.  Each sheep or goat – the most common livestock – is worth about $30. A cow is worth $250-500, depending on meat quality. A camel is worth about $500, and a horse $200-250, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  “Consequently, there is an incentive to increase animal numbers, leading to the colossal numbers we see today, at over 50 million head of livestock, which degrades the precious pasturelands,” said Robert Schoellhammer, country director for the ADB. The trend has been devastating when combined with climate change. The average temperature in Mongolia has increased by 2.1C since 1940, more than double the rise of average global temperatures, according to the UN Environment Programme. In its 2014 global climate risk index (pdf), the advocacy group German Watch ranked Mongolia the eighth most vulnerable country to direct economic losses from weather-related events. According to a government report, 70% of pastoral land has been degraded, with less variety of vegetation. The intensification of dry conditions has increased the frequency of forest fires, which cut total forest area by 0.46% annually.  As more pasture is absorbed into the vast Gobi desert, the ancient herding lifestyle is disappearing with it. Paradoxically, the more their way of life is put at risk, the more herders engage in practices that put it in danger. “Most herder families want to increase their herd so they can increase their income,” said Uranchimeg, a herder in Bayankhongor province who attended university in Russia in the 1980s but chose the fresh air and open spaces of a nomad’s life over taking a job in a city.  “That is making things more challenging for everyone,” she said, looking out across the barren, snow-covered landscape."
"Michael Gillenwater is so tired he is mixing up his words, worn out from weeks of conference calls with the United Nations, the German government, and more. “I’m exhausted,” he says. In the wake of the Paris climate agreement last December, everyone wants advice from the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute (GHGMI) – Gillenwater’s non-profit organization based in Washington, DC – on how to step up the developing world’s capacity for counting carbon. The institute offers online courses in greenhouse gas monitoring to practitioners around the globe, and since the Paris agreement was reached, business has been brisk. “We’re excited,” he says. “There’s a window here to make something permanent happen.”  The work of these new, green accountants may not sound very sexy – calling them “accountants” conjures up the old image of bespectacled bean counters pushing oversized calculator buttons with the back of a pencil. But this new breed of accountant is, in essence, the overseer of the planet’s new rescue mission. They are responsible for tracking not income and expenses, but factory emissions and carbon-offset credits. They are now doing everything from calculating the environmental footprint of international companies like Wal-Mart, to monitoring the carbon stored in the Amazon rainforest, to checking that China’s power plants are really emitting what the government says they are.  The Paris agreement mandates that every nation make a commitment for its ‘nationally determined contributions’ of greenhouse gases. These have a startling array of baselines and target types. According to documents submitted before the conference, the oil-rich United Arab Emirates promises to bump up its clean energy contributions a hundredfold by 2021; South Sudan aims to plant 20 million trees; the tiny Cook Islands in the Pacific Ocean aim for an impressive 81% reduction in emissions by 2030. Mozambique has made its promise in tons of carbon rather than as a percentage of emissions; Malaysia’s target is given in terms of greenhouse gas intensity. Practically the only thing these promises have in common is a need – often a brand new need – to be able to monitor, report, and verify emissions.  “It’s really a transformation. It’s huge,” says Gillenwater. “Before it was basically the rich countries doing the reporting; the developing countries were doing very summary, little reports every five or six years. Now, all countries need to be reporting full data using the most up-to-date technical analyses.”  This is a big ask. But GHGMI and others are stepping up to the challenge.  The job of assessing a country’s emissions is heinously complicated. “It’s not like the mindless carbon calculators that people have on their iPhones to calculate their carbon footprint,” says Gillenwater.  On the most basic level, it is simply a matter of knowing how much fossil fuel is being burned by power plants and cars, and how much land is being used for forestry, crops, and livestock. But the devil, of course, is in the details. In the United States, a team of federal workers, mostly within the Environmental Protection Agency, works the equivalent of a handful of full-time jobs to take stock of greenhouse gas sources and sinks, says Gillenwater. The draft US inventory for 1990-2014, released this February, is 546 pages long and includes more than 50 source categories from cement production to landfills.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) wrote the bible for totting up national emissions But, like the Bible, it is long, there is plenty of room for interpretation, and a need to parse finer details.  The IPCC guidelines form a kind of “five-volume, hundreds-and-hundreds-and-hundreds of pages cookbook” for accountants to pick and choose methodologies and equations relevant to their country, says Gillenwater. For instance, should a nation’s accountants estimate greenhouse gas emissions from transport based on how much fuel is burned, or based on how far the cars are driving? And is the type of catalytic converters being used important to the result? (Answer: It depends.) The IPCC also specifies such things as where emissions should count; if you dig up oil in Canada, for example, the emissions from the digging count for Canada, but the burning of the oil counts for whichever nation imported it. The guidelines also offer default values for such things as how much biomass is stored in the landscape of a given ecosystem, from tropical moist deciduous forest to boreal tundra woodlands. There are countless different equations and methodologies for crunching the numbers. Just within forestry, for example, there are ways of accounting for the effects of flooding, drainage, timber exports, and forest fires. Much of the data needed for such accounting is supported by national statistics. Most countries keep track of their coal mining and wheat production, for example, for economic reasons, and that can be plugged in to some emissions calculations. But other things are more difficult to sort out. There may be no existing records of the production of fluorinated gases from the semiconductor industry, for example, as many of the chemical cocktails used by that industry are proprietary. “You really have to get on the phone, company by company,” says Gillenwater. The GHGMI offers correspondence diplomas in emissions monitoring, each involving about 200 hours of online coursework, along with a special ‘Paris Agreement Training Package’. Since its founding in 2007, the institute has had about 3,000 people from around the world take its courses; about 60 people are currently signed up for full diplomas. The center was born from Gillenwater’s work with the United Nations, where he trained an elite group of about 100 inspectors who audited national emissions numbers for the 1992 Kyoto Protocol. Gillenwater saw a need for lower-level practitioners – such as corporate consultants and carbon-offset market dealers – to gain the same expertise. Now there is a focus on international government workers who need to get their countries up to speed. The GHGMI’s alumni already span about 150 nations. Among them are people like Adama Moute, who helps to count biomass for Cameroon’s Ministry of Forests. “Cameroon does not have a system in place for accounting its national emissions,” Moute says, although it does have concrete plans for improving monitoring. Moute was one of 30 students at a GHGMI five-day intensive course at the National Forestry School in Mbalmayo, Cameroon last September. “I learned so many things but the most important was the practice exercises,” he says, for data collection and analysis.  Other programs are operating in concert. The US Agency for International Development (USAID), for example, has contracted the Virginia-based company ICF International to train Asian governments how to sustainably reduce emissions. Joshua Forgotson, senior technical officer for that program based out of Bangkok, says half a dozen countries have been sending representatives to training sessions for the past five years, including in-person classes based on GHGMI coursework. Now, he says, the Paris agreement has given many of these Asian countries the incentive they need to really invest in emissions tracking. “Lack of data is a serious issue. Population stats, fuel consumption, crops statistics – you wouldn’t expect countries in this part of the world to have had these things in their old data collection,” says Forgotson. It’s a new requirement. Paris has changed things.”  But challenges remain.  Even the US and Europe, where emissions reporting has been established for decades, there are still things like methane leaks from the fracking industry that people don’t have a good handle on. “People argue about 10 times of magnitude over that,” Gillenwater says.  Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon (INPA) in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil – one of the countries that has done a lot to calculate its biomass and the emissions saved through prevented deforestation – argues that the IPCC guidelines don’t properly account for methane emissions from tropical hydropower dams. Research still needs to fill in the holes so the accountants know what numbers to use in their bookkeeping.  Jerry Seager, chief program officer for Verified Carbon Standard, a registry for carbon credits, notes that things can get complicated. If you have a lot of cook stoves and diesel trucks, for example, the greenhouse effect of the emitted black carbon can be hard to quantify. “You don’t know if it’s going to fall on a glacier, for example,” he says. And in agriculture, emissions from fertilizers can depend heavily on how waterlogged the soils are. A more flexible strategy, a willingness to accept nonbinding commitments, and smart leadership by the French all helped secure a climate deal in Paris. The real work lies ahead, but Paris created a strong, if long overdue, foundation on which to begin building a carbon-free future. But in general, Seager adds, these are small details compared to the big picture. The challenge, he says, is not to boost the precision and accuracy of national inventories to this level of fine detail, but rather to make sure that a reasonable accounting can be done “efficiently and cost effectively”. Groups including the United Nations are now trying to organize funding schemes to provide money and guidance to developing nations to help them build up their emissions tracking capacity. That means not just training people, but also helping to make sure that the right people are speaking to each other. For example, government employees need to forge connections with universities where researchers are collecting relevant data, and all those involved need to be using compatible methodologies. Sometimes the sticking point is simply whether someone has enough time built into his or her job to do this kind of work. “You could train people with IPCC guidelines till you’re blue in the face and you won’t improve inventories,” says Forgotson. “You need people to be compensated for the work, to have it written into their job descriptions.”  What’s needed, says Seager, is a long-term commitment to helping the developing world with their accounting. “You have to get away from the model of consultant-flies-in, runs-workshop, consultant-flies-out,” he says. Hopefully, says Gillenwater, the Paris agreement will bring the training – and the accounting – up to a higher level."

"America’s international climate obligations carry a significant public health benefit, with new research finding that about 295,000 premature deaths could be prevented in the country by 2030 if deep cuts to greenhouse gas emissions are achieved. At a summit in Paris in December, 196 nations, including the US, agreed to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in order to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The agreement, the first to demand all countries slash emissions, will require major emissions reductions given that the world has already warmed by 1C during the past century.  A paper by Duke University calculates that in order to help achieve the Paris goal, the US will need to reduce its emissions by 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. This is a jump from the 26-28% reduction the US has promised to undertake by 2025. The US would prevent many premature deaths and save the economy billions of dollars should it make the necessary emissions cuts, the Duke study shows. A total of 295,000 Americans who would otherwise die from lung cancer, heart attacks or respiratory diseases by 2030 would be saved due to the reduction in air pollution.  Currently, the US experiences about 200,000 early deaths each year due to emissions from heavy industry, cars, trains and ships, as well as commercial and residential heating. Ozone and particulate matter released from the burning of fossil fuels are linked to 100,000 of these annual deaths. “If we continue on the current high trajectory of emissions we’ll continue to have a large number of pollution-caused deaths,” said Professor Drew Shindell, lead author of the research. “Climate change doesn’t feel immediate unless you have the kind of smog you have in China right now but the health benefits would happen right away if we acted. And they’d happen right here in the US. “People should realise that emissions are having a big impact already. You are talking about more than 100,000 deaths a year at a time when people spend a huge amount of time and money on a relatively small number of deaths from terrorist attacks or plane crashes. Air pollution is a very big health challenge, it’s having a major public health impact in the US.” Although coal is in decline in the US, the main national mechanism to reduce emissions has been put on hold by the supreme court, which is considering challenges from nearly 30 states to a plan by Barack Obama’s administration to limit emissions from power plants. To get to a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030, not only would this plan need to proceed unhindered, it would also have to be expanded to areas beyond electricity generation. Almost all of America’s car fleet would need to be electrified. “It’s a tall order, there’s no getting around that,” said Shindell. “We’d need the support of Congress and the supreme court. But it’s achievable if we really want it. The US does require a big jolt because we are nowhere near the path we need to be on. We are creating a very difficult climate for future generations.” The study, which has been published in Nature Climate Change, is based on a model of future emissions scenarios and the known health impact of air pollution. The economic cost was calculated from the value the Environmental Protection Agency places upon each avoided premature death. A 75% reduction in transport emissions would save 120,000 lives by 2030, the Duke study calculated, while a 63% cut in energy emissions would prevent a further 175,000 deaths. Most of these saved lives would be in cities and states that contain high concentrations of polluting industry, such as Ohio and Kentucky. The US would also gain economically from emissions cuts, with $800bn saved by 2030 due to the reduced health burden, increased consumer spending and transition to new clean energy opportunities. According to the World Health Organisation, about seven million people died in 2012 as a result of air pollution. WHO said this total – which represents one in eight of all total global deaths – shows that air pollution is the “world’s largest single environmental health risk”. Heart disease and stroke are the primary deadly consequences of air pollution."

"The UN’s climate chief said on Friday she will step down in July, at the end of a six-year term, and praised governments for reaching a 195-nation deal in Paris in December to shift the world economy from fossil fuels to cleaner energies. Christiana Figueres, a 59-year-old Costa Rican, said she would not accept any extension of her term as head of the Bonn-based UN Climate Change Secretariat after what she called the historic Paris Agreement.   “We now move into a phase of urgent implementation,” she wrote in a letter to governments, which agreed a goal in Paris to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2100 by shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind or solar power.  “The journey that lies ahead will require continued determination, ingenuity and, above all, our collective sense of humanity and purpose,” she wrote in the letter, dated 12 February and made public on Friday.  Figueres, a former Costa Rican climate negotiator, took over the UN job at a low point in 2010 after a summit in Copenhagen the year before collapsed in acrimony between rich and poor.  She patiently worked to build trust among governments with radically different interests, ranging from the United States and China to small island states worried by rising seas or OPEC nations fearing a loss of export revenues.  Nicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics who wrote a 2007 study about the economics of climate change, said Figueres had an “outstanding ability to see where we need to go as a world and to bring people together”.  Her successor is likely to come from a developed nation - Figueres succeeded Yvo de Boer, of the Netherlands.  Separately, Hela Cheikhrouhou, head of the UN’s Green Climate Fund set up to channel money to developing nations to help them cope with climate change, also said on Friday she would stand down in September after a three-year term. The fund has so far attracted about $10bn in pledges from 43 nations, after repeated delays. The cash will help developing nations cut emissions and adapt to impacts such as desertification, heat waves, floods and rising seas.  Earlier this week, former French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, main host of the Paris summit, also quit a post presiding over UN climate negotiations. French environment minister, Segolene Royal, will take over the job, overseeing talks until the next annual talks in Morocco in November."
"Cuts to the CSIRO’s climate modelling and measuring research will breach Australia’s obligations under the recent Paris agreement and will result in huge costs to the economy, a report by Australia’s Climate Council has found. The report adds to a chorus of eminent bodies and individuals criticising the move, which the CSIRO made after almost no consultation with its own scientists or other research institutions.  Earlier in the month it was revealed CSIRO would be cutting up to 350 staff from climate research programs over two years. Over the following weeks, the organisation’s chief executive Larry Marshall explained that would result in a loss of about 50% of the staff working in climate modelling and measuring. In a report titled “Flying Blind: Navigating Climate Change without the CSIRO,” the Climate Council said governments and businesses relied on the CSIRO’s climate modelling and measuring work to make billion-dollar decisions and if the cuts went ahead, would be relying on “guesswork”. The report notes Australia and the rest of the world agreed to strengthen commitments to climate science at COP21 in Paris in December. “The recently announced cuts to climate science mean that Australia has already reneged on one of its obligations under the Paris commitments,” it concludes. It cites a number of examples of decisions and industries that have relied on the modelling and measuring performed by the CSIRO: “If there’s one take-home message from the report it’s that you can’t just say ‘all right we know this, let’s cut the research and go onto something else’,” Will Steffen, a climate councillor and professor at the Australian National University told Guardian Australia. “For a problem that’s as big and complex and ongoing as climate change, that’s just crazy and makes no scientific sense at all.”  An open letter signed by more than 2800 scientists raised similar concerns. In response to the chorus of criticisms, Marshall initially said the response was more like religion than science, and compared climate scientists to oil lobbyists in the 1970s. Then chairman of the CSIRO board David Thodey released a written response, where he repeated that organisation would work to ensure these important capabilities would not be lost from Australia. Paul Durack from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US, who oraganised the open letter, told Guardian Australia the response was an “unfortunate dismissal of some legitimate concerns raised by the international climate community.” “The details contained in the letter have echoed the previous announcements and have provided no further details about how they plan to ensure that some of the key aspects that are ‘committed’ to be kept will continue beyond the next round of CSIRO cutbacks in the coming years,” Durack said. It was revealed in Senate estimates that CSIRO executives did not consult with organisations like the Bureau of Meteorology who depend on CSIRO modelling until 24 hours before the cuts were made public. Even Ken Lee, the director of the division that would take the brunt of the cuts was only told about the cuts four days before they were announced. The Climate Council, which produced the new report, is a crowd-funded body that seeks to provide authoritative information on climate change to the community. It was created after the Abbott government cut the Climate Commission when it took government in 2013, and seeks to perform the same job."
"Bill Gates has predicted researchers will “discover a clean energy breakthrough that will save our planet and power our world” within the next 15 years. In their annual open letter, Bill and Melinda Gates provide an update on their plans to stimulate innovation in technologies for tackling climate change, energy poverty, and gender inequality.  In Bill’s section of the letter, which is addressed to teenagers, the Microsoft founder and billionaire philanthropist argues it should be a development priority to deliver clean energy to the 1.3 billion people who do not have access to power. He also stresses that the new power needs to be low carbon in order to tackle the risks presented by climate change. “If we really want to help the world’s poorest families, we need to find a way to get them cheap, clean energy,” he writes. “Cheap because everyone must be able to afford it. Clean because it must not emit any carbon dioxide - which is driving climate change.” And Gates argues the goal has to be truly zero emission power. “Can’t we just aim to cut carbon emissions in half?’ I asked many scientists,” Gates wrote. “But they all agreed that wouldn’t be enough. The problem is that CO2 lingers in the atmosphere for decades. Even if we halted carbon emissions tomorrow, the temperature would still rise because of the carbon that’s already been released. No, we need to get all the way down to zero.” In something of a break from past comments when Gates has been critical of renewable energy technologies, once dismissing wind and solar power as “cute”, the letter welcomes recent rapid progress on renewable energy. “New green technologies are allowing the world to produce more carbon-free energy from solar and wind power,” he writes. “Maybe you live near a wind farm or have seen solar panels near your school. It’s great that these are getting cheaper and more people are using them. We should use more of them where it makes sense, like in places where it’s especially sunny or windy. And by installing special new power lines we could make even more use of solar and wind power.” However, he reiterates his view that to stop climate change and make energy affordable for everyone, the world will need “some new inventions”. “We need more powerful, more economical solutions,” Gates writes. “In short, we need an energy miracle. When I say “miracle,” I don’t mean something that’s impossible. I’ve seen miracles happen before. The personal computer. The Internet. The polio vaccine. None of them happened by chance. They are the result of research and development and the human capacity to innovate.” Gates argues that a combination of private sector research and development, such as his recently launched Energy Breakthrough Coalition, government action, and individual endeavour can combine to deliver a new generation of clean energy technologies. “We need a massive amount of research into thousands of new ideas – even ones that might sound a little crazy – if we want to get to zero emissions by the end of this century,” he said. “New ways to make solar and wind power available to everyone around the clock could be one solution. Some of the crazier inventions I’m excited about are a possible way to use solar energy to produce fuel, much like plants use sunlight to make food for themselves, and batteries the size of swimming pools with huge storage capacity. “Many of these ideas won’t work, but that’s okay. Each dead end will teach us something useful and keep us moving forward. As Thomas Edison famously said, ‘I have not failed 10,000 times. I’ve successfully found 10,000 ways that will not work’.” Gates also urged young people to engage with the energy challenge. “You may be wondering what you can do to help,” he wrote. “First, it’s important for everyone to get educated about this energy challenge. Many young people are already actively involved in climate and energy issues and I’m sure they could use more help. Your generation is one of the most globally minded in history, adept at looking at our world’s problems beyond national borders. This will be a valuable asset as we work on global solutions in the decades ahead. “Second, if you’re someone with some crazy-sounding ideas to solve our energy challenge, the world needs you. Study extra hard in your math and sciences. You might just have the answer.” In a separate interview to promote the letter with news agency Bloomberg, Gates provided more detail on how a global clean energy R&D push could be orchestrated and offered an insight into why he is so confident a breakthrough will materialise. “What we need to get that probability [of a breakthrough] up to be very high is to take 12 or so paths to get there,” he told the news agency. “Like carbon capture and sequestration is a path. Nuclear fission is a path. Nuclear fusion is a path. Solar fuels are a path. For every one of those paths, you need about five very diverse groups of scientists who think the other four groups are wrong and crazy.” He also revealed the Breakthrough Energy Coalition is working on new investment approaches that would provide more “patient capital” than that offered by traditional venture capital funds, allowing for greater investment in long term R&D efforts."
"The world is on track to reach dangerous levels of global warming much sooner than expected, according to new Australian research that highlights the alarming implications of rising energy demand.  University of Queensland and Griffith University researchers have developed a “global energy tracker” which predicts average world temperatures could climb 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by 2020. That forecast, based on new modelling using long-term average projections on economic growth, population growth and energy use per person, points to a 2C rise by 2030. The UN conference on climate change in Paris last year agreed to a 1.5C rise as the preferred limit to protect vulnerable island states, and a 2C rise as the absolute limit.  The new modelling is the brainchild of Ben Hankamer from UQ’s institute for molecular bioscience and Liam Wagner from Griffith University’s department of accounting, finance and economics, whose work was published in the journal Plos One on Thursday. It is the first model to include energy use per person – which has more than doubled since 1950 – alongside economic and population growth as a way of predicting carbon emissions and corresponding temperature increases. The researchers said the earlier than expected advance of global warming revealed by their modelling added a newfound urgency to the switch from fossil fuels to renewables. Hankamer said: “The more the economy grows, the more energy you use ... the conclusion really is that economists and environmentalists are on the same side and have both come to the same conclusion: we’ve got to act now and we don’t have much time.” Wagner said the model suggested the surge in energy consumption was not offset by improvements in energy efficiency. He said energy use per person was on track to rise sixfold by 2050, which had dire implications for temperatures when combined with economic growth of 3.9% a year (the six-decade average) and a world population of 9 billion. “Massive increases in energy consumption would be necessary to alleviate poverty for the nearly 50% of the world’s population who live on less than $2.50 a day,” Wagner said. “We have a choice: leave people in poverty and speed towards dangerous global warming through the increased use of fossil fuels, or transition rapidly to renewables.” Hankamer said: “When you think about statements like ‘coal is good for humanity’ because we’re pulling people out of poverty, it’s just not true”.  “You would have to burn so much coal in order to get the energy to provide people with a living to get them off $2.50 a day that [temperature rises] would just go through the roof very quickly.” The researchers suggested switching $500bn in subsidies for fossil fuels worldwide to renewables as a “cost neutral” way to fast-track the energy transition. Wagner said pulling the rug from out under the fossil fuels industry was a move of “creative destruction” and “more a political issue rather than an economic issue”. “If we swapped those subsidies globally, of course we could have rapid improvement and deployment of renewables to cover our shift from fossil fuels,” he said.  “You’re pushing a huge amount of capital into a different sector that requires an enormous amount of growth, so you would actually see a great deal more growth from putting it into renewables than providing it for fossil fuels.” Hankamer said the fact that about 80% of the world’s energy was for fuel, and only 20% for electricity, meant “we don’t have any easy solutions”. “If we want to do this, we need to do things like solar fuels, or think about how we do battery technologies and fully transition to electric,” he said. “The things that are going to be hard to replace are aviation fuels and things for heavy machinery and probably shipping. “We can do electric cars for short runs but those things are going to be really hard to switch.”"
"Eight years ago, when my friends and I started an international development organisation we were by all accounts completely unqualified. We were in our early twenties and had little or no formal training or experience. Most of us were tree-planting as a way of paying for university when one of our fellow planters, Jeff Schnurr, came back from a trip to a tiny tropical island named Pemba, just off the coast of Tanzania. He regaled us with tales of how he’d met Mbarouk Omar, the man who now heads up our local sister NGO, and had sketched out with him a dream to restore the island’s lost forests. He now wanted to know: would we go out there and help?  Fast-forward eight years and our NGO, Community Forests International, has helped to plant more than 1.5m trees across Pemba. Our movement has also blossomed from rural farmers managing low-tech nurseries into community-scale solar microgrids and regenerative agriculture. Pemba is becoming a place to watch for lessons in frontline climate change adaptation. And in the grand scheme of things, we’ve had next to nothing to do with it.   I say this because as development professionals we often overstate not only our achievements abroad but also our individual roles. This reinforces misconceptions among the general public that the communities we support in the global south cannot ever help themselves, let alone help us. Community Forests Pemba, the local NGO we partner with, is made up almost entirely of Tanzanians with decades of research and administrative experience as well as an intimate understanding of local challenges. They even taught us how to run our own organisation back in Canada, guiding us on issues such as good governance and building partnerships, and encouraging us to replicate the model we used in Pemba in other places. We wouldn’t have had half the success we have had without them, so why does the wider sector continue to recycle an old narrative that suggests solutions only flow from wealthy to poor societies but not the other way round? Here are some key lessons we’ve learned from our local partner: The first time I travelled to Pemba I spent three months trying to build a piece of technology to recycle discarded paper into seedling containers. I struggled because I couldn’t speak the language well enough to describe it to local tradespeople. Rather than looking to my colleagues in Pemba for direction, I blindly followed my own bias. It never really took off and I’m just lucky it turned out to be only a minor distraction. The real answer came later, when my friends there demonstrated how plastic containers could be reused if cared for properly – an embarrassingly simple solution.  Even the name of our organisation betrays our early naivety – the notion that reforestation in Pemba would be best advanced as a strictly community-based activity. We’ve had some great success with that approach, but also huge failures: we lost tens of thousands of trees and years of effort when our communal ideal just didn’t fit the realities on the ground. In one case, land use disputes resulted in shepherds purposely grazing livestock over a newly planted “community” forest. In another, farmers completely neglected a large community plot in favour of tending their own individual woodlots. Our work started to flourish when we stopped trying to dictate where and how trees were planted and focused instead on just supporting the people most committed to the effort.  The fact that none of us are experts by conventional standards has also put us in a unique position as development practitioners. We’ve been free to ask questions – hard questions or dumb questions as needs be – and to adapt as we learn. Being an expert isn’t necessarily bad for development, but assuming you have all the answers can be.  Being critical of our work and constantly questioning our effectiveness is uncomfortable but it is also fundamental to advancing our cause. The fact that a group of 20-year-old Canadians can found an international organisation is an expression of our own privilege. So is the fact that we speak a language of power and can navigate the esoteric world of proposal writing and donor relations more easily than our Swahili-speaking colleagues. At the same time, these privileges undeniably have been vital to the achievements we now share with our Tanzanian partners. Sadly, privilege is one of the most powerful things that we Canadians bring to the work – that, and our solidarity. People don’t like to talk about privilege, but it’s how you use it that matters: use it to level the playing field.  Changing how we practise development could be our best tool for addressing inequalities at the heart of development. Creating the space for underprivileged people to assume positions of leadership in our work, for example, and recognising the unmatched knowledge that our partners in the global south have of their own cultural and environmental context, offer small steps toward big systemic change.

"There was a huge global spike in one of the most potent greenhouse gases driving climate change over the last decade, and the U.S. may be the biggest culprit, according a new Harvard University study. The United States alone could be responsible for between 30-60% of the global growth in human-caused atmospheric methane emissions since 2002 because of a 30% spike in methane emissions across the country, the study says. The research shows that emissions increased the most in the middle of the country, but the authors said there is too little data to identify specific sources. However, the increase occurred at the same time as America’s shale oil and gas boom, which has been associated with large amounts of methane leaking from oil and gas wells and pipelines nationwide. “I’d say the biggest takeaway is that there is more we — the US — could be doing to reduce our methane emissions to combat climate change,” said study lead author Alex Turner, a Harvard University chemical engineering PhD candidate. The Aliso Canyon gas leak in California, which was plugged last week after a nearly four-month effort to contain it, has brought new attention to methane. The gas is roughly 86 times as potent as carbon dioxide as a driver of climate change over a period of 20 years, or 35 times as potent over the span of a century. The Aliso leak spewed enough methane into the atmosphere to equal the greenhouse gases emitted by more than 440,000 cars in a year. The US Environmental Protection Agency is trying to rein in methane emissions from oil and gas operations, and has proposed new rules to curb them from oil and gas wells. The Obama administration’s climate action plan seeks to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by up to 45% below 2012 levels by 2025. Global methane emissions have risen and fallen several times since the 1980s, Turner said, but they’ve been rising continuously since 2007. “The causes for this renewed growth are currently unknown,” he said, In the US, the government tally of the country’s annual human-caused methane emissions between 2002 and 2012 shows that emissions have been about 29 million metric tons annually, without any significant trends up or down. Research by Turner’s team, however, showed that emissions ranged from about 39 million tons to about 52 million tons during that period. The team based its findings on satellite data. The Harvard study, published last week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, adds to mounting research that shows that the government’sdata on methane emissions is not consistent with observations made by universities and other institutions. The official tally, taking what is known as a “bottom-up” approach, calculates methane emissions based on expected leak rates at oil and gas well sites, not actual measurements. The Harvard researchers used a “top-down” method, calculating emissions based on actual satellite measurements, showing that US methane emissions are far greater than those estimated by the government. Turner said he and other researchers are working with the EPA to reconcile those differences. “Both the bottom-up and top-down communities are trying to understand the sources of methane, but the different methods have different strengths, and we are working on making them more compatible,” he said. EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones said the Harvard study adds to a wide body of new research about how to best quantify methane emissions. The EPA is reviewing those studies, she said. With the US responsible for as much as 60% of global methane emissions growth, it’s critical that the country reduce natural gas use as quickly as possible, said Robert Howarth, a Cornell University ecologist and methane researcher who is unaffiliated with the Harvard study. Failing to do so could jeopardise commitments made as part of the Paris climate agreement’s goal of keeping global warming to below 2C. “There is simply no way to do that by reducing carbon dioxide emissions alone because of lags in the climate system,” he said. “Even with major carbon dioxide emission reductions starting now, the planet would reach 1.5C in 12 years and 2C in 35 years. But the planet responds much more rapidly to methane, so a reduction in methane emissions now would slow the rate of global warming immediately.” Howarth said the Turner team’s study is consistent with his own research. “I believe the US probably is responsible for this much of an increase in global methane emissions,” Howarth said. “And, the increase almost certainly must be coming from the fracking and from the increase in use of natural gas.” Raymond Pierrehumbert, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Oxford who is unaffiliated with the Harvard study, said its findings are useful, but don’t mean much for climate change in the long run. “It is always useful to know what the emissions of various greenhouse gases are, but methane is still just a sideshow, and relative to what the US. needs to do to fulfill its Paris commitments with regard to keeping the warming under 2C, even a substantial upward revision of methane leakage is almost completely irrelevant,” he said. “The warming due to steady methane emissions essentially stops increasing after just two decades, and is largely reversible once the leakage stops.” "
"A conservative entrepreneur pledged to bankroll Republican candidates who support clean energy on Tuesday in an attempt to break down the party’s wall of climate denial. Jay Faison, a North Carolina businessman, said he was making a significant intervention in the 2016 elections through his ClearPath foundation, in the hopes of promoting what he called a conservative clean energy agenda.  The effort, which involves raising $5m for a Super Pac, a $1m digital ad campaign, and the hiring of a number of key staffers for a Washington DC office, represents a renewed effort by Faison to get his party to change its position on energy and climate change. That vision would be unrecognisable to supporters of Barack Obama’s climate plan, however. Faison opposes the Environmental Protection Agency rules for clean power plants and is no fan of solar power or wind energy. But the businessman maintained he was trying to push his fellow Republicans into a cultural shift.   “Our mission is to make conservative clean energy a priority for the GOP,” Faison told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington.  Faison conceded $5m for a Super Pac was small beer amid this billion-dollar US presidential election, but he said such a sum could influence congressional races. “I think we can do it. It might take some time, but I think we can do it.” The intervention was part of a tentative effort among a very small number of Republicans to try to move the party away from a default position of climate denial and obstruction maintained since Obama’s first days in the White House. Faison first came on the scene last June when he announced he had sold his audio visual company SnapAV and was plunging his $165m into a foundation to promote climate science and market-based solutions to global warming. The businessman last year had focused more directly on opposing climate denial. His latest intervention, however, sidesteps the issue. Faison said neither party offered what he called conservative, or free market, approaches to clean energy. “We had windmills and sunshine on the left and we had ‘drill, baby, drill’ on the right,” Faison said. “I thought that was a vacuum we could fill.” Republicans’ current posture of climate denial was hurting the party, he added. Like his fellow Republicans in Congress, Faison admitted on Tuesday that he opposed the EPA rules cutting emissions from power plants. “We don’t think that the EPA structure, the clean power plan, is ideal,” he said. The ClearPath vision of clean energy relies exclusively on hydro power, clean coal technology, nuclear energy, and natural gas – and omits any reference to solar or wind power.  But Faison’s intervention, though limited, could still shake up a party whose leading presidential contenders openly deny the existence of climate change, or rely heavily on funding from the fossil fuel industry. Faison acknowledged his $5m Super Pac was unlikely to force Donald Trump or Ted Cruz to change their positions. “I don’t think I am a big enough dog in that fight to have that kind of an outcome,” he said. But he said he hoped to influence congressional races next November by supporting candidates who are both Republican and supporters of clean energy. The intervention comes at a time when some Republicans are beginning to edge away from climate denial – emboldened by the pope’s embrace of the issue, or fears of losing support from younger voters and women.  Some of the potential beneficiaries of Faison’s cash are already beginning to stick their heads above the parapets to call for action on climate change – such as the 10 Republicans who broke party ranks last September to call for movement on the issue.  Others are trying to overcome political divisions around climate change. Last month, two members of Congress from Miami – Carlos Curbelo, a Republican, and Ted Deutch, a Democrat – launched the Climate Solutions Caucus, in the first attempt in years to find a political consensus on climate change.   Faison, however, is focused on reforming his own party. He said his Super Pac would only fund Republicans, and that he is willing to overlook candidates’ positions on climate change, so long as they back his energy plan. “We support people that support conservative clean energy and we don’t have to agree on climate change,” he said."

"Environmental advocacy groups have criticized billionaire businessman Warren Buffett for his recent claims that climate change will be a manageable and profitable risk for the insurance industry. In his annual letter to shareholders of his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett pointed out that the potential devastation caused by climate change will benefit – not harm – his insurance subsidiaries. He laid out his argument in response to a shareholder proposal asking Berkshire to assess and report the financial risks of climate change on the insurance business. The proposal reflects concerns that the insurers of homes and other properties will have to pay out big money in climate change-related claims and lose lots of money as a result.  Scientific evidence shows that excessive manmade greenhouse gas emissions are causing temperatures to rise and will, over time, increase the number and intensity of disasters, such as floods and wildfires, in communities worldwide. “As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights,” Buffett wrote. “As a homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.” Buffett said his shareholders’ concerns are unwarranted. Insurers will be able to react quickly to any hike in the cost of doing business because each auto or home policy typically lasts for one year, not 10 or 20 years at fixed prices, so the premiums could climb along with the cost, he said. He also cited inflation as an example of how an increase in the cost of goods and services is good for the insurance business. “Over the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans involved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums,” he said. “So, paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable. If costs had remained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600m of business annually rather than one doing $23bn.”  Naomi Ages, climate liability campaigner at Greenpeace, said Buffett is making a false comparison between inflation and climate risks, which are far more unpredictable.  “Warren Buffett appears to assume that climate change is a manageable risk for insurers, but the damage caused by the increasing frequency and force of extreme weather events associated with a warming planet is set to become unmanageable,” she said. “And unmanageable risks bankrupt insurers.” Ages pointed to warnings from insurers, like Lloyd’s of London, that are pushing businesses to consider the impact of climate change because “the cost of catastrophes is going up” and they “will be at the vanguard of the industries whose bottom lines are affected by climate change”. That sentiment, Ages said, is “a nice way of saying ‘we could be bankrupted by these catastrophes first’”. Assessing the financial impact of climate change is difficult. As Buffett pointed out his letter, the insurance premiums for covering catastrophes have fallen in recent years, making that type of coverage less lucrative than before. Indeed, global financial losses from weather events in 2015 were lower than any other year since 2009, according to reinsurance giant Munich Re. But winter storms that battered the northeastern US and Canada a year ago still resulted in huge costs to the insurance industry, with insured losses reaching $2.1bn, Munich Re said.  While scientists say climate change will cause more severe storms, they can’t predict for certainty the number and severity at any point in future. “It is not yet possible to produce causal proof, but there is a logical chain of indices,” said Peter Höppe, head of Geo Risks Research at Munich Re, on the link between climate change and extreme weather events, in a statement.  Robert Hartwig, president and economist at the industry group, Insurance Information Institute, said the insurance industry isn’t taking the risk of climate change lightly, and neither does it plan to lose money from covering those risks. “We are exposed on every corner of the planet and are monitoring trends in real time,” said Hartwig. “The insurance industry is exceedingly well-capitalized and very well prepared to manage this and many other risks.” Buffett certainly understands the danger of miscalculating risks. In his 2007 shareholder letter, he wrote that “devastating storms” like Hurricane Katrina could “rock the insurance industry”. “We do know it would be a huge mistake to bet that evolving atmospheric changes are benign in their implications for insurers,” Buffett said then.

"Leading researchers have called on the world’s largest association of Earth and space scientists to reject sponsorship from ExxonMobil, because of the oil company’s record of funding climate denial. In a letter made available to the Guardian, climate scientists James Hansen (formerly of Nasa), Michael Mann (Penn State), Kerry Emanuel (MIT) and more than 100 other researchers said they were deeply troubled by the “well-documented complicity of ExxonMobil in climate denial and misinformation”. The scientists urged the American Geophysical Union to reject funding from Exxon, as a matter of scientific integrity. The AGU’s annual meetings are among the largest of their kind, drawing about 25,000 scientists. Exxon is under criminal investigation in New York and California for misleading investors and the public about the dangers of climate change. The Guardian, Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times reported last year that the oil company knew about climate risks and factored them into planning as early as the 1970s – but continued to fund organisations rejecting established science well into the 2000s. “In part [thanks] to Exxon, the American public remains confused and polarized about climate change,” the letter said. “And thanks in part to Exxon, climate science­-denying members of Congress and lobby groups operating at the state level remain a major obstacle to US efforts to mitigate climate change.” The letter said that history should disqualify Exxon as a sponsor, because of AGU rules barring financial ties to scientific disinformation. About 4,000 AGU members will gather in New Orleans on Monday for an oceans meeting. The AGU said in a blogpost that it would review Exxon’s current activities, and take up the issue at a board meeting in April. Last year, the association decided there was no reason to cut financial connections with the oil company. Exxon said news reporting about it’s activities was “inaccurate and deliberately misleading”.  “We reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research,” a spokesman said in an emailed statement. “This is an inaccurate distortion of ExxonMobil’s nearly 40-year history of climate research that was conducted publicly in conjunction with the Department of Energy, academics and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.” In a shift of tactics, campaigners are now working to expose the fossil fuel companies responsible for climate change and propping up climate-denial and corporate lobby groups opposing policies such as cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Those efforts have gathered pace over the last year as more details emerge about how Exxon reportedly concealed from the public evidence it had been gathering from its own scientists. “We were so struck by the recent revelations – how they covered up the climate science and how they were being investigated by the New York and California attorney generals,” said Ploy Achakulwisut, a PhD candidate in atmospheric chemistry at Harvard University who is one of the organisers of the petition. Organisers were disturbed to see Exxon listed among the sponsors of the Earth and space scientists’ most recent gathering in San Francisco. “It seems to me like an appropriately clear case for the scientific community to stand up and reject what amounts to greenwashing for Exxon,” said Ben Scandella, a PhD candidate in environmental science at MIT and another of the organisers.  “By accepting that sponsorship, the AGU gives up the ability to call out Exxon for their climate science disinformation activities. “For me, personally, it is disconcerting to learn that a company knew one thing and told the world something completely different, and I imagine a lot of scientists are bothered by the idea that our research would be distorted for the sake of obstructing legislation on controlling carbon emissions.”"

"Climate change could kill more than 500,000 people a year globally by 2050 by making their diets less healthy, according to new research published in the Lancet. The research is the first to assess how the impacts of global warming could affect the quality of the diets available to people and found fewer fruit and vegetables would be available as a result of climatic changes. These are vital in curbing heart disease, strokes and diet-related cancers, leading the study to conclude that the health risks of climate change are far greater than thought.  Climate change is already judged by doctors as the greatest threat to health in the 21st century, due to floods, droughts and increased infectious diseases, with the potential to roll back 50 years of progress.  Peter Scarborough, at the University of Oxford and part of the new research, said these direct impacts would affect tens of thousands of people at particular times: “But everyone in the world eats, so small changes in diet can quickly add up” to hundreds of thousands of deaths. “The health burden related to climate change is much bigger than we thought,” Scarborough said. But cutting carbon emissions and improving education and the availability of fruit and vegetables would reduce the number of deaths, he said. “The Lancet [study] digs deeper, and reports the most advanced projections so far of the effects of climate change on food and health,” according to professors Alistair Woodward at the University of Auckland and John Porter at the University of Copenhagen in a commentary on the work. They say that given the uncertainties involved in the complex analysis, it is understandable to limit projections to the next 35 years. But they warn that the worst-case impacts beyond 2050 could be even greater.  As an example, they cite work indicating that failure of the rice crop in southern China due to heatwaves could change from a one-in-a-100-year event to a one-in-four-year event in 2100. “A worst-case analysis is not unusual in risk assessments in other areas [such as national security] when the stakes are high,” they note. The new research involved linking a series of computer models, which covered crop production, economic development, trade and climate change, to consider a range of scenarios. The current trend in global nutrition is for fewer people to die from inadequate diets each year, due to increasing crop yields and poverty reduction.  But a continued rapid rise in carbon emissions would cut heavily into that positive trend. Severe climate change would cause changes in food availability, leading to 529,000 more people dying in 2050 than would have without warming, the research found. Even with very ambitious climate action, including sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, there would be 154,000 extra deaths in 2050. The research found that severe climate change would cut the fruit and vegetable available to people in 2050 by 4%, the calories available by 3% and the red and processed meat by 0.7%. By far the biggest cause of deaths was the reduction in fruit and vegetables, particularly in rich countries. The reduction in calories resulted in more people dying from lack of food, especially in India and China. However, almost exactly the same number of deaths were prevented elsewhere by reductions in obesity. The cut in red meat eating prevented 29,000 deaths. Nearly all nations are projected to suffer an increase in deaths due to the diet changes caused by climate change. But a few, in central America and southern Africa, could see a reduction in deaths as the reductions in obesity outweigh other factors. Scarborough accepted there are significant uncertainties in the projections and the study says the projected deaths in 2050 ranges between 314,000 and 736,000. But he said it is the best estimate so far and clearly shows that action to tackle climate change would have large-scale health benefits. Prof Andy Challinor, at the University of Leeds and not involved in the new work, said: “This is a valiant attempt to quantify the effects of climate change on the future of food production. It’s very difficult to estimate exactly what those impacts will be [but] what we can say for certain is that the pressures on agricultural production will certainly be greater because of climate change.” “Year-to-year variability of food production will become greater, which will make global food markets more unpredictable,” Challinor said. “And extreme climatic events will become more common, such as the wheat harvest failure in Russia in 2010 which affected UK food prices. The effects of such events on global food availability and prices will be felt in the UK and around the world.” The research was funded by the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food. "

"Wine grapes in Australia are ripening between one and two days earlier each year due to climate change in a trend viticultural experts say could see some traditional varieties abandoned in warmer areas. The Victorian wine industry is partway through what could shape up to be its earliest vintage on record, thanks to an exceptionally warm spring and warm summer.  Grape growers are also experiencing a compressed vintage with typically later-ripening red grape varieties demanding to be picked at the same time as earlier varieties such as chardonnay, causing congestion in the crushing bay as three months of grapes arrive in three weeks. Snow Barlow, honorary professor of agriculture and food systems at Melbourne University, said vintage dates had been shifting forward at a gradually accelerated rate over the past 30 years and the trend was set to continue, with grapes ripening an average of seven days earlier for every degree the climate warmed. “They clearly are the canary in the cage,” he told Guardian Australia. “You can say what you will about climate change but the plants don’t lie, they just react to what they feel, and they are reacting again.” A 2011 study by Barlow’s Melbourne University colleague, Leanne Webb, examined the vintage records of 44 vineyards, some of which went back as far as 115 years, and found that grapes had ripened at a rate of 1.7 days a year earlier between 1993 and 2009.  A later study, led by Webb and co-authored by Barlow, found that change was driven by a warmer temperatures and lower soil moisture content, even accounting for an industry-wide shift towards picking earlier to get low-alcohol wines. “It does mean that for particular varieties you really do have to think about moving,” Barlow said. “It sounds a bit ho-hum in some ways but the climate is changing and you really do have to analyse carefully when you are looking to set up an agricultural enterprise not only whether this is the place to do it now but whether this is still going to be the place to do it in 25 years time – whether you are going to have access to the water you need in 25 years. “The South Australian wine companies are looking at the Adelaide Hills and thinking well, do we really have enough water there?” The same trends have been observed in Europe, where records have been kept by generations of winemakers since the 1500s. The information is a valuable indicator of climatic change – there is an extensive global dataset noting the picking dates and, in later decades, the sugar levels, or Baumé, of individual vineyards. “Where it differs a bit in Europe is that for the most part they have probably pushed the boundaries a bit more than we have but more toward the cool side, so when you look at Bordeaux or look at Champagne and the worst years are sort of the cold and wet ones,” Barlow said. “So they’re talking about it as something that will help.” In Australia it’s the opposite effect: warm springs and hot summers can produce lower-quality wine, and if they’re coupled with bushfires there is, Snow said, “bugger all you can do” to save the wine being tainted by smoke. Damian Sheehan, chairman of Wine Victoria and general manager of Mount Langi Ghiran winery in the Grampians about 190km west of Melbourne, said grapes that ripened quickly risked “decoupling” their sugar and acid content, which meant they reached the desired alcohol level before the flavour was developed. “You have just got this very, very high (indicative) alcohol content and you want to make sure that you manage it so that you don’t end up with high alcohol wines,” he said. “You do start acclimatising and you start knowing what you are going to do to make sure that the alcohol levels are what you want to produce.” Sheehan said they would not know if it was a record early vintage until after the season ended, but that most vineyards appeared to be picking early. He said a number of companies were planting Spanish or Italian reds, rather than traditional French varieties, to cope with the warming climate. Others were looking to expand into cooler climates such as Tasmania. Andrew Weeks, executive director of Wine Grape Growers Australia, had not noticed the early trend, saying 2016 was “probably the most un-uniform vintage I have ever had anything to do with”. His own cabernet sauvignon vineyard in South Australia’s Riverlands was harvested at its usual time. Weeks said climate change fell behind economic challenges on the concerns listed by most growers he spoke to who worried about “whether the policy settings will see them viable in one to two years’ time”. “If you have got that sort of time frame, it’s hard to be concerned about what the climate might be doing in 20 or 30 years,” he said."
"Severe rainfall has increased throughout the world’s wettest and driest regions and is set to intensify this century, new research suggests.  Since 1950, daily extremes have risen 1-2% a decade, a study published in journal Nature said on Monday.  That trend is expected to last until at least 2100, prompting emergency planners to take precautions against flash flooding. Dry regions such as Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula or Australia, whose parched soil poorly absorbs excess water, would be most vulnerable. Global warming increases the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, leading to heavier downpours. The study led by Markus Donat at the University of New South Wales in Australia couldn’t say exactly where extreme rainfall would occur, but underlined the heightened risks. Tropical regions were most uncertain. Floods made up almost half of all weather-related disasters in the last two decades, according to the UN office for disaster risk reduction. They affected 2.3 billion people, 95% of whom were in Asia."

"Carbon emissions may have peaked already in China, years earlier than its leaders pledged, according to a study co-authored by the world-renowned economist Lord Stern.  The country’s emissions have fallen, partly as a result of its globally relevant economic slowdown, and partly owing to government policies to pursue a low-carbon path and reduce the rampant air pollution in its major cities.  If this trend continues it would show that the country’s emissions have already peaked, said Fergus Green, lead author of the report from the LSE. This would be a landmark in international efforts to tackle emissions and fight climate change, formalised in last December’s breakthrough international accord on climate change signed in Paris. At the summit China, the world’s second biggest economy and the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, agreed that its emissions should peak by 2030. In the new report, Green and Stern argue that if China’s emissions have not already peaked, then they are very likely to do so within the next decade, bringing the world’s biggest emitter to its internationally agreed target years earlier than expected. This is an important development, as it means that the world’s biggest emitter is likely to be finally on a downward path of carbon emissions. Although there is a possibility that China’s emissions will pick up if its growth rate recovers, the reduction in emissions is likely to continue, according to Green. “We are seeing a larger infrastructural change in China,” Green told the Guardian. This was the result of policies and changing industrial conditions, he said. A fall in China’s coal consumption in 2014 accelerated in 2015, according to government statistics published in February. Green also discounted the idea that a reduction in emissions in China, as it moves to a higher value economy rather than the low-wage, high-production model that has fuelled in its past two decades of high growth, would be wiped out by an increase in emissions in other developing economies that are following China’s example.  “It is almost inconceivable [that other countries would make up for these emissions], because China is so large,” he said. Under the Paris agreement, all countries - developed and developing - are called on to review their emissions targets every five years. Green said this could be key to reducing emissions further. “One of the virtues of the current agreement is the review mechanism, so China will be in a very strong position in 2020 to ratchet up its targets,” he said. In Europe, however, green campaigners were disappointed last week by a report from the European commission that focused on the core Paris commitment to cut emissions in line with a 2C rise in temperatures. Governments in Paris had also pledged to consider how to cut their carbon in order to limit temperature rises to no more than 1.5C , which would avoid more of the ravages of climate change, particularly on small islands at risk from rising sea levels, but which would be harder to meet. Bram Claeys, EU climate and energy policy advisor for Greenpeace, said: “The Commission must stop pretending Paris didn’t happen. It has a responsibility to step up climate action to reflect the Paris deal in legislation on renewables and energy efficiency. People won’t trust the EU if it continues to play fast and loose with global warming and delays Europe’s shift to 100% renewable energy.” On Friday, at a meeting of EU environment ministers, several countries pushed for a stronger 2030 emissions target from the EU than the one agreed at Paris. This was welcomed by green campaigners. Genevieve Pons, director of the European policy office of WWF, said: “We have seen huge support from member states for increasing the EU’s 2030 climate and energy targets. Doing so is the only way of standing by our commitments in Paris, working to limit temperature rises to 1.5C. EU countries have injected a welcome dose of ambition into the climate discussion, after the Commission’s lacklustre input.”"

"Europe’s chief climate negotiator has said he is open to increasing the EU’s carbon target for 2030, in a backdown by the European commission. Last week, the commission ruled out any increase in the bloc’s target of cutting emissions by 40% by 2030 on 1990 levels, sparking an outcry from several countries and green groups. Ministers and environmentalists said that Europe should be increasing its ambition in light of the Paris climate deal agreed in December, where nearly 200 countries pledged to pursue efforts to keep temperature rises to 1.5C. That was a much tougher goal than the existing 2C goal which Europe’s 40% cut is based on.   On Monday, the EUdirector of climate strategy, Artur Runge-Metzger, responded to the criticism: “The question of the level of ambition for 2030 is open, as long as it is a binding EU target of at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.” Brook Riley, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth, welcomed his comments. “It’s good to hear the commission saying that increased emission cuts are still on the table, even if this contradicts what it published last week. Without tougher targets Europe would be undermining and undoing the Paris agreement before it is even signed.”  Last Friday, the Austrian environment minister, Andrä Rupprechter, told a ministerial summit in Brussels: “We shouldn’t let our ambition droop. We should keep putting out strong signals.” The German environment minister, Jochen Flasbarth, added: “Our decision did not say that we would stay at a 40% emissions cut. It said we will cut ‘at least 40%’. The commission was a member of the ‘high ambition coalition’ in Paris so we would like to know how they intend to stand by this commitment.” No answer is likely before 2018. That is when the UN’s climate science panel, reports back to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees international climate negotiations, on the policy implications of faster and more far-reaching action. The first in a five-yearly series of “global stock-takes” on emissions cuts follows in 2023, and this will be the first opportunity for the EU to increase its pledge of a 40% cut by 2030. The EU is currently modelling the economic impacts of improved energy efficiency targets, after criticism of previous impact assessments used to set policy.  In a sign that Brussels lobbies are beginning to see signs of change, the head of the solar photovoltaic industry’s trade association today called on the EU to set a new target of members states sourcing 35% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030. “More ambition is needed in Europe to reach the objective of limiting global warming to just 1.5C, which the European Union signed up to in Paris,” said Oliver Schaefer, SolarPower Europe’s president. “The EU must review the targets suggested in 2014. It would be foolish to pretend that nothing has changed since COP21 [the Paris climate summit].”"
"Would that the battle for the White House were as congenial, sunny, optimistic and unabashedly inclusive and outward-looking as the symbolic handover for the job of liberal leader of the English-speaking world that took place on Thursday between Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau. The two leaders – Obama gray and nearing the end of his term, Trudeau in the first months of his prime ministership – affirmed that when it came to what they called the “big ideas” of climate change and economic inclusion the two shared a common global vision. Just as importantly, it seemed as if Obama had found a successor to champion those liberal causes in North America and on the global stage once he leaves office: a Robin to his Batman. “From my perspective, what’s not to like?” asked Obama at a joint news conference at the White House on Thursday morning. He recalled that Trudeau – like Obama seven years before – had come to power on a message of hope and change. Both took office as young, good-looking and charismatic figures whose political skills were underestimated by the establishment because they lacked conventional political résumés. Canada and the US have long claimed a special relationship – although that closeness acquired a tinge of frost under Stephen Harper, the former prime minister. But with Obama and Trudeau standing at their twin podiums under a brilliant sunshine, it seemed that the US president had found someone who would go on to champion action on climate change and the other causes that have animated his last months in the White House. Having Trudeau by his side would help rally countries around the climate change agreement reached at Paris, Obama said.  “On the big looming issues on the horizon it is vital for us to work together because the more aligned we are the more we can shape the international agenda,” Obama said. “Climate change is such an example.” That shared vision applied to policies of economic inclusion and diversity, Obama suggested. The average American and Canadian worker needed to be assured of future prosperity. “If they see societies in which a very few are doing better and better and middle class and working people are falling farther and farther behind that destablises the economy,” Obama said. “It also starts destabilising our politics and our democracies.” Obama did not refer explicitly to Trudeau’s decision to personally welcome Syrian refugees at Toronto’s airport last December, but he urged Americans not to retreat behind closed borders. “The world is big and we are going to help shape it,” Obama said.  Trudeau agreed, saying that when it came to the “big issues”, global challenges such as climate change, the two leaders were firmly on the same side.  “The president and I agree on many things, including of paramount importance, the directions we want to take our countries in to assure a clean and prosperous future,” the Canadian prime minister said.  Occasions such as this one – the first state visit to Washington by a Canadian leader in nearly 20 years – were bound to veer into grandiosity about the import of matters under discussions, as well as the closeness of the understanding between the two men. The visit did not however produce hoped for resolutions of prosaic trade matters such as softwood lumber. But it did appear to cement the mentor relationship that seems to have developed between the two leaders at their first meeting last November.  Obama was studiously neutral on the US presidential contest. But when it came to the global stage, Obama appeared to have come close to designating a successor – at least that was how Trudeau described it.  “I’ve learned a lot from President Obama. He is somebody who is a deep thinker. He is somebody with a big heart but also a big brain,” Trudeau told the press conference. “For me to be able to count on a friend who has lived through many of the things I am about to encounter on the political stage, on the international stage – it’s a great comfort to me.” He went on: “It is always great to have people you can trust, people you can count on personally.” Obama for his part seemed to relish the new role, joking that he had advised Trudeau about dying his hair before he went too obviously gray. And then, after ribbing reporters for consigning him to an elder stateman role before his time in the White House is up, the US president ushered the Canadian leader from the stage – with a protective pat on the back."

"Yet another global heat record has been beaten. It appears January 2016 - the most abnormally hot month in history, according to Nasa - will be comprehensively trounced once official figures come in for February.  Initial satellite measurements, compiled by Eric Holthaus at Slate, put February’s anomaly from the pre-industrial average between 1.15C and 1.4C. The UN Paris climate agreement struck in December seeks to limit warming to 1.5C if possible.  “Even the lower part of that range is extraordinary,” said Will Steffen, an emeritus professor of climate science at Australian National University and a councillor at Australia’s Climate Council.    It appears that on Wednesday, the northern hemisphere even slipped above the milestone 2C average for the first time in recorded history. This is the arbitrary limit above which scientists believe global temperature rise will be “dangerous”. The Arctic in particular experienced terrific warmth throughout the winter. Temperatures at the north pole approached 0C in late December – 30C to 35C above average.  Mark Serreze, the director of the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre, described the conditions as “absurd”. “The heat has been unrelenting over the entire season,” he said. “I’ve been studying Arctic climate for 35 years and have never seen anything like this before”. All this weirdness follows the record-smashing year of 2015, which was 0.9C above the 20th century average. This beat the previous record warmth of 2014 by 0.16C. These tumbling temperature records are often accompanied in media reports by the caveat that we are experiencing a particularly strong El Niño - perhaps the largest in history. But should El Niño and climate change be given equal billing? No, according to Professor Michael Mann, the director of Penn State Earth System Science Centre. He said it was possible to look back over the temperature records and assess the impact of an El Niño on global temperatures. “A number of folks have done this,” he said, “and come to the conclusion it was responsible for less than 0.1C of the anomalous warmth. In other words, we would have set an all-time global temperature record [in 2015] even without any help from El Niño.” Global surface temperature is the major yardstick used to track how we are changing the climate. It is the average the UN Paris agreement refers to. But the atmosphere doesn’t stop at the surface. In fact 93% of the extra energy trapped by the greenhouse gases humans have emitted gets sunk into the oceans – just 1% ends up in the atmosphere where temperature is most often and most thoroughly measured. During El Niño, which occurs every three to six years, currents in the Pacific Ocean bring warm water to the surface and heat up the air. Jeff Knight from the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, said their modelling set the additional heat from a big El Niño, like the current one, at about 0.2C. He said wind patterns in the northern hemisphere had added another 0.1C to recent monthly readings. “The bottom line is that the contributions of the current El Niño and wind patterns to the very warm conditions globally over the last couple of months are relatively small compared to the anthropogenically driven increase in global temperature since pre-industrial times,” he added. Steffen said the definitive assessment of this El Niño and its effect on the world’s temperature would only be possible once the event had run its course (it has now peaked and is expected to end in the second quarter of this year). But he agreed that past El Niño cycles could be an appropriate guide for the order of magnitude of the effect.  The picture becomes less clear cut when we talk about monthly records. Even weather trends can have small effects on the monthly average temperature, said Knight. The effect of El Niño traditionally increases as it dies, so Mann believes it may have added more than the “nominal” o.1C during the past three months. In the Arctic, the effect of El Niño is poorly understood but likely to be weak, said Knight. “Given that the Arctic has been very warm for a number of years, with record low sea ice, it is more likely that the warmth there currently is part of a long-term trend rather than the response to a episodic event like El Niño.” Steffen says quantifying the relative contributions of El Niño and climate change on a monthly or even annual basis cannot help to answer how fast the world is warming. Only trends over 30 years really matter. But the pile up of records we have had in the early part of this century are significant. All things being constant, record hot years should occur once every 150 years. Yet 1998, 2005, 2010, 2014 and 2015 have all been record breakers. A study published in January found that even without last year’s mammoth anomaly such a run was 600 to 130,000 times more likely to have occurred with human interference than without. “The fact that you are getting records so close, one after the other is really striking. And that is symptomatic of that long-term trend,” said Steffen. But while they may be poor signals for long-term climate change, record hot months and years do have an immediate and tangible impact.  “It’s making heat waves worse. Here in Australia it bumps up the bushfire danger weather really fast. It tends to lead to drier conditions in our part of the world. These things are exacerbated by El Niños, so I don’t want to downplay the importance of them for human suffering,” said Steffen."
"Energy UK, the trade association representing the big six energy suppliers, has in welcome - if belated - fashion come out in favour of a large-scale shift to low-carbon, renewable energy.   Their desire to not be left behind might seem rather academic, as they already have been - both by a warming climate and countries whose embrace of renewable energy is far advanced.  Their report on pathways to 2030 is littered with the buzzwords for a more sustainable energy system. It looks at everything from more decentralised energy generation to a “whole systems” approach, energy efficiency and even “reducing energy demand”. Contrary to previous official expectations of rising demand, it expects demand to remain roughly stable, but describes an otherwise substantially changing energy market overseen by uncertain government policies that threaten the investment needed for transformation.    Late in 2015 the Department for Energy and Climate Change cut its projection for new renewable energy capacity coming on stream by 2015 by more than one-third from 34 gigawatts (GW) to 22GW. It emerged around the same time that the big six energy suppliers represented by Energy UK had all dropped their green electricity tariffs. Both the big energy companies and government seem to lack any idea of the scale and speed of transition in infrastructure that nations are capable of. Perhaps they need a reminder. Taking a lesson from the dark side, our initial system-wide addiction to fossil fuels was a rapid affair. Starting in 1956 the US Interstate Highway System, for example, managed to build 47,000 miles of highway in just over three decades, “changing commerce and society”.  A century earlier, Britain demonstrated the capacity for the rapid rollout of a more benign transport system when just between the years of 1845 and 1852 there were 4,400 miles of railway track laid. A single weekend in 1892 saw the upgrading of 177 miles of track on the Great Western route by 4,200 well-coordinated workers. It is astonishing by the contemporary standards of apparent official impotence to solve the crisis in the housing market (also a key energy issue), that in Britain’s battered and far more indebted post-war condition, the number of homes built annually by local authorities in the early 1950s hit 250,000, and under a Conservative government. Under a Labour government social housing around 1967-68 still saw around 200,000 homes built with the private sector building a similar number, before such ambition fell off a cliff in the 1980s. In comparison, during 2014-15 just 1,350 homes were completed by local authorities in England and the private sector built less than half what it did during the mid 1960s. It is possible to transform societies in response to positive visions of “homes fit for heroes”, but also to mobilise rapidly to fight against the external threats that called for the heroes in the first place. Against significant, official intransigence, from 1936–39 dozens of factories were built or repurposed around Britain as part of a “shadow factories” programme to produce the military hardware for the war effort. And, when they were bombed, as they often were, in great adversity the factories were rapidly repaired and returned to production.  Compared to proven historical ability, even the boldest comments of the big energy companies appear tentative and insipid. Recent human migration in response to conflict and other drivers seems to stress our ability to adapt. But forms of large scale adaptation are happening all the time in response to economic and demographic change. It took an estimated 10,000 years for the world’s urban population to add up to 1 billion. Going from 2-3 billion took just 17 years, from 1985–2002. Somehow, however imperfectly and haphazardly, we adapted, responding with urban infrastructures to provide shelter and basic services.  What’s needed now is a more conscious, bold and planned programme to achieve the rapid transition of an energy system to respond to a known challenge with clear targets.  Denmark, as a small nation, provides in microcosm a classic example. An incentive scheme brought communities and investors together creating both grassroots support and a secure investment environment. In two decades from 1983, 3GW of wind energy capacity were installed. By 2014 wind power was providng 39% of Danish electricity.  Internationally things are changing fast. Even in the fossil fuel-hungry US, 8GW of wind were installed in 2015. And in China, for all its problems, nearly 20GW of wind power were introduced in a single year, 2014. Which is more than the UK’s current total installed capacity, onshore and offshore, of wind energy, of just over 14GW. We should applaud the change of tone from Energy UK, but remind them that what makes a real difference finally is: deeds not words."
"Rising sea levels are putting increasing pressure on US coastal cities, with a new analysis showing that human-driven climate change is to blame for three-quarters of the coastal flooding events over the past decade. The Climate Central research shows that coastal flooding days have more than doubled in the US since the 1980s, the primary drivers of which have been the warming of the atmosphere and oceans. The findings are based on a separate study, released on Monday, that found the Earth’s seas are rising at a pace unseen in the past 2,800 years.  Between 2005 and 2014, a gauge at Kings Point in New York showed there were 157 days where the water reached above an established “nuisance” level – double the total of the previous decade. A total of 96 of these flooding events are attributed to changes in the climate.  In Washington DC, a total of 522 human-induced flooding days have occurred since 1950, with just 336 deemed to have occurred regardless of the changes in our climate. In San Francisco, the number of human-caused flooding events is almost three times above the unaltered trend while Charleston in South Carolina endured 219 flooding days between 2005 and 2014, with the vast majority climate change-driven. The analysis compares the latest yearly estimates for human-caused global sea level rise with hourly water level records at 27 tide gauges around the US, to see the influence of climate change on nuisance flooding. The world’s oceans are estimated to have risen by an average of six inches compared with the 19th century, spurred by melting land ice and the thermal expansion of seawater. The results show that flooding events are being severely exacerbated by climate change, primarily in the upping of high tide marks. With even just a small increase in the high tide level, flooding can inundate areas, resulting in roads being cut off or houses and businesses becoming swamped. Across all the tidal gauges, climate change was responsible for three-quarters of these flooding events over the past decade. The US’s east coast is experiencing sea level increases above the global average, possibly due to a change in the Gulf stream that is causing warmer water to pile up along the Atlantic seaboard. “This human fingerprint on flooding is already interfering with people’s lives and local economies, as well as degrading local infrastructure,” said Dr Ben Strauss, who led the analysis. “We aren’t talking about buildings getting knocked over, but there are real effects to people’s lives. “There has been a sharp spike in flood rates over the past few decades, driven by us. This is only going to continue to accelerate and we will see more dramatic impacts in the coming decades. We can take adaptive measures but eventually a lot of land will be submerged. These flooding events are the warning bells.” Barrier islands, which are long offshore deposits of sediment or sand found in places such as New Jersey and North Carolina, will bear the brunt of the continued sea level increases. Miami Beach, which is re-engineering its flood controls to deal with regular inundations, is considered particularly vulnerable. “In the long run some places will have to be abandoned, but in the short term it’s not clear,” said Strauss. “It will all depend on how we plan. The better we plan for this, the better our chances will be.”  The study released on Monday, compiled by an international team of scientists, found that if greenhouse gas pollution continues at its current pace, the sea level will rise by a further 57cm to 131cm. If countries fulfil the treaty agreed upon last year in Paris and limit further warming to another 2C, sea level rise would be in the 28 to 56cm range."
"Cuts to climate research at Australia’s science agency, CSIRO, are a “catastrophic failure of public policy” that will damage the UN’s climate change work and will hinder Australia’s ability to represent its self-interest at international climate change negotiations, the Australian Senate has heard. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change produces the world’s most authoritative statements on the nature of climate change, its impacts, and how to adapt to and mitigate it. To do that, it combines a suite of climate models.  That process would be hampered by the CSIRO’s recent decision to shift resources away from climate modelling and monitoring, Karl Taylor, of the program for climate model diagnosis and intercomparison at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US, told a Senate committee hearing on Friday. “The CSIRO model ... has been involved in all of these international modelling activities that have contributed immensely to the IPCC’s understanding of climate change, and that would be cut dramatically,” he said. The cuts would also make it hard for the government to achieve the best results for Australia at international negotiations. “When the government prepares to go to the conferences annually where they discuss climate change policy – and negotiate, as they did in Paris this last year – they need advice,” he said. “And I think cutting the efforts at the CSIRO will undermine the government’s ability to really represent its own self-interest at those negotiations because they would lose the advice of the experts there.” Paul Durack, also from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said it did not make sense to cut from work on understanding climate change in order to shift towards work on adaptation and mitigation. He said the IPCC process demonstrated the problem with that logic. In that process, the IPCC publishes three chapters or “working groups”. The first is on the physical basis of climate change. The other two, which focus on the impacts and how to mitigate and adapt to them, are published later, and rely on the information published in the first chapter. “The way it occurs very much highlights the dependence between these different working groups and the requirement to actually have physical information about the climate system,” Durack said. “You can’t do these things independently and they’re very much dependent on one another.” David Karoly, from the University of Melbourne, told the committee the decision would be wasting millions of dollars of investment in expertise. “My estimate is it is of the order of 1,000 person years of experience or more,” he said. “And that’s at least $100m of investment. And it appears to be thrown away or put into a rubbish bin.” Snow Barlow, from the University of Melbourne, works on climate change adaptation and mitigation. He told the committee it was a mistake to take resources away from monitoring and modelling climate change to focus on adaptation and mitigation: “It’s a catastrophic failure in public policy.”  In a hearing on Wednesday, the same committee heard the CSIRO’s international reputation had already been “trashed” by the announced cuts, and a new science body was needed. Earlier, a report by the Climate Council said the cuts would breach Australia’s obligations under the recent Paris climate change agreement. The CSIRO’s chief executive, Larry Marshall, said in a radio interview last month the reaction to his planned cuts was more like religion than science, and compared climate science with the oil lobby in the 1970s. He later apologised for the reference to religion."

"The future of Europe’s energy supply is to rely heavily on natural gas for the coming two decades and beyond, according to a new strategy set out on Tuesday by the European commission. The plans were immediately attacked by green campaigners, who contrasted the continued role of fossil fuels with commitments to cut carbon dioxide made by the EU at the Paris climate summit two months ago.  Gas will have to be imported, from sources including Russia, Norway, Qatar and other Gulf states, under plans set out in the commission’s “Sustainable Energy Security Package”.  This will require tens of billions of euros of investment in infrastructure, including new cross-border pipelines, and the development of terminals for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Most LNG currently comes from the Gulf but which in future could also be supplied from the shale fields of the US. Miguel Arias Cañete, EU climate change commissioner, acknowledged the problems with gas supply that have haunted Europe in the recent past, such as Russia turning off supplies to the Ukraine for political ends. But he said that the renewed focus on diversifying supply and on constructing storage facilities would improve energy security. “After the gas crises of 2006 and 2009 that left many millions out in the cold, we said never again. But we are still far too vulnerable to major disruption of gas supplies, and the political tensions on our borders are a sharp reminder that this problem will not just go away,” he said. “Today’s proposals are about a reliable, competitive and flexible system in which energy flows across borders and consumers reap the benefits. They are about standing together to protect the most vulnerable. They are about securing our clean energy future.” While gas is a lower carbon fuel than coal, the implication of such a massive new investment in gas infrastructure is that its use will continue for decades to come. This could open up conflicts with the EU’s targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enshrined in last December’s Paris accord, which the EU played a major role in bringing about. Dustin Benton, head of energy and resources at the Green Alliance thinktank, told the Guardian: “This doesn’t deliver on the commission’s promise for an efficiency-first energy security strategy. Better markets for gas can help keep EU energy secure if combined with continued renewable energy growth, but this strategy won’t stop us wasting power stations worth of energy.” A contrast with the Paris agreement, at which the EU pledged to hold future temperature increases to no more than 2C or 1.5C, was inevitable, said Jiri Jerabek, energy policy adviser at Greenpeace EU. “It’s like the Paris agreement never happened, and the commission is stuck on gas, dishing out a costly proposal that will keep Europe hooked on energy imports. Only if Europe focuses on renewables and energy efficiency will Europe meet its climate targets and reduce dependence on foreign supplies.” Claude Turmes, energy spokesman for the Green MEP grouping in the European parliament, called the strategy “rolling out the red carpet for Gazprom”, Russia’s national energy giant. “The commission is basing its strategy on a huge over-estimation of demand for gas. Instead of pumping millions into projects that are doomed to fail, they should wait until new, more credible estimates for gas demand can be formulated.” Organisations focused on energy efficiency - under the previous commission, known as one of the “three pillars” of energy policy for 2020 - were disappointed at what they saw as a lack of commitment to reducing energy use. Proponents of renewable energy - another key target under the 2020 plans - also found little cheer in the new package. Dr David Clarke, chair of a Royal Academy of Engineering group on UK energy policy, told the Guardian that if gas use was to be continued at such levels in Europe, then fledgling technology for capturing and storing greenhouse gas emissions would become essential. He said: “If we are to meet 2050 carbon reduction targets it becomes necessary to completely eliminate CO2 from power generation. The post-2030 use of fossil fuels in power generation becomes increasingly challenging without the ability to implement CCS. Given that a logical part of replacing coal-fired capacity in the 2020s will be to build new gas-fired plant, it is important we progress demonstration of CCS on gas at the earliest opportunity.” Last November, days ahead of the Paris climate summit, the chancellor,George Osborne, cancelled the government-sponsored £1bn competition to build the first power-station scale CCS plant in the UK. There are now no major CCS projects at an advanced stage in Europe. About half of Europe’s energy goes to heating and cooling old and leaky buildings, according to the European Insulation Manufacturers Association. Jan te Bos, director general, said: “Buildings are Europe’s largest single user of energy so it is encouraging that the commission published a heating and cooling strategy as part of today’s package. What is needed next are concrete proposals for an EU wide building renovation plan ideally with targets - otherwise the strategy wastes a unique opportunity to properly reduce European dependence on energy imports.”"

"What’s a better way to celebrate your 78th birthday than giving away $400m to solve climate change?  Stanford University has announced that Nike co-founder and chairman Philip H Knight – one day before his 78th birthday – was contributing $400m to the school to create a new program called Knight-Hennessy Scholars. Graduate students chosen for the program will address the “increasingly complex challenges facing the world” such as poverty and climate change.  “We wanted to create something enduring, that would be unlike anything else currently available to the world’s brightest minds, and that would make the biggest impact possible toward solving global challenges affecting the environment, health, education and human rights,” said John Hennessy, the Stanford president. Hennessy will serve as the program’s inaugural director after stepping down from his current role at the end of this academic year. “This is using education to benefit mankind and I think it really could be transformative,” Knight told the New York Times. “I jumped on it right away.” According to Stanford, the total endowment to finance the program will be $750m. So far, thanks to donations from “dozens of Stanford benefactors” the school has raised more than $700m for the program, which will be the largest fully endowed scholarship program in the world. The Knight-Hennessy Scholars program will officially begin in 2018, offering full tuition and board to 100 students. Knight’s $400m donation is the largest cash gift that Stanford has received from an individual. It is equivalent to the $400m that John A Paulson, the billionaire manager of the Paulson & Co hedge fund, gave to Harvard last year."
"The former independent MP Tony Windsor has declared he is standing for New England on “issues of the future”, describing his stand against Barnaby Joyce as a “David and Goliath battle”. He has urged voters to stand up for policies of the future, including over climate change, the National Broadband Network, renewable energy and Gonski education funding. Windsor asked for the help of people inside and outside the electorate, characterising the deputy prime minister as a man of the last century, one of a “small group of right-wingers” including Tony Abbott and Eric Abetz, who were placing a “handbrake” on the future. It’s not about sending Barnaby Joyce a message,” Windsor said.  “It’s about winning the seat. I am serious ... and I’ll need the help of as many people as I can get from both within and outside the electorate,” Windsor said.  “One thing that can happen here, though, is that people can demonstrate if they’re serious about their own futures, they can send an enormous message to this place and fight the political machines that are going to move in on this in an attempt to grind me up.  “They might grind me up but if people are serious and it’s a challenge to the electorate and the people who live there, if you are serious, you’ve got a choice. If you are not, I would vote Joyce.” In an hour long press conference in Canberra, Windsor faced questions regarding the sale of part of his Werris Creek family farm to Whitehaven coal for more than $4.6m - given he was opposing the $1.2bn Shenhua coalmine.  He said legal advice suggested that Whitehaven, which owned the underground resources, had the right to mine on the land and the case would simply end up in the land and environment court. He said the Werris Creek mine was a very different situation to the the Watermark mine proposed on the Liverpool Plains, due to the water resources under the Plains and the highly fertile black soil above. The Werris Creek mine, he said, was on an old quarry, on “crap country, the type of land that should be mined”. Windsor ended months of speculation by announcing his decision, first on ABC Tamworth and then in Canberra.  Joyce had already held a press conference in New England to preempt the announcement. He told the ABC that Windsor was part of the “Labor Green independent alliance”. “It’s a democracy and I welcome any person and there will be a number of independent candidates, Mr Windsor’s one and that’s his choice,” Joyce said.  “There will be the Greens. I think overwhelmingly, people see Mr Windsor’s political journey as one where it started as an independent but ended up as a member of the Labor/Green/independent alliance.  “That’s his prerogative. I’ve been overwhelmed by the support that I’m getting. So if that’s the battle we have then I look forward to it.” While Joyce may be favourite, it presents a headache to the newly elevated Nationals leader, who is usually required to campaign across the country for other members. The competition in New England will tie him closer to home. Joyce holds the seat on a notional margin (after electoral redistributions) of 19.9%. In 2010 at his last election, Windsor won 61.9% of first preference votes. Windsor first held the balance of power in the NSW parliament and sided with the Liberal state government of Nick Greiner.  He first the federal seat of New England in the 2001 election as an independent and held it for 12 years. In 2010, he had joined fellow independents Rob Oakeshott and Andrew Wilkie to back Julia Gillard’s minority Labor government.  He retired in 2013 citing health issues. Windsor said if he held the balance of power in parliament again, he would not formally support one side over the other as he did in 2010. He said the parliament could continue as normal. “My leaning would be to being absolutely independent,” he said. Windsor also said he would not be directing preferences, which he considered an “insult” to voters, even though it is highly likely that, if he wins, that he will do so on the back of preferences.  Windsor won't be preferencing anybody. It is an ""insult"" to voters, can't tell them where to direct preferences. Windsor: ""We need across the nation to stand up and demand things that are about the future."" #NBN, #climatechange, #Gonski, water. “The electorate I live in, the electorate I love, the electorate I’ve worked for over many years, I see things stalling,” he told reporters. “I’m not prepared to see regional people, people in the electorate of New England, treated as second-class citizens with their education of their kids, the Gonski [reforms], with their telecommunications ... in relation to climate change.” Windsor criticised Joyce for doing “absolutely nothing” for the Murray-Darling basin plan and accused Joyce of ignoring climate change in the agricultural white paper. “We’ve got a current member who thinks renewable energy is a bit of a joke,” he said. Windsor told reporters the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had been talking about the future a lot but had been “handbraked” on many issues. “It is this small group of right-wingers of which Barnaby Joyce is one, Tony Abbott, [Eric] Abetz, you all know who they are, that have a handbrake on progress.”"

"Turning the emissions of power stations, steel mills and garbage dumps into liquid fuels has been demonstrated by MIT researchers using engineered microbes.  The process has been successfully trialled at a pilot plant in China and a much bigger facility is now planned.  Energy-dense liquids are vital to transport but are currently derived from oil, a fossil fuel, and transport produces about a quarter of the global carbon emissions driving climate change. Biofuels have been seen as possible replacement, but current biofuels compete with food production and have been blamed for driving up food prices. Using waste gases to create low-carbon liquid fuels would be a major advance in the battle against global warming if they could be made at low cost and large scale. Another company expects to be using different microbes to produce fuel from steel plants in Belgium and China in 2017. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) process uses bacteria to convert the waste gases into acetic acid - vinegar - then an engineered yeast to produce an oil. “It is quite an extraordinary story,” said Prof Gregory Stephanopoulos, an expert in chemical engineering and biotechnology at MIT in the US. “It started just four to five years ago with a post-doctoral project funded by the US Energy Department. We are looking at a very fast timescale [of development],”, he said. “We have pieced the system together into an integrated system, where you put gas in one end and get a liquid fuel out of the other end.” The research was published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The patents for the process are owned by MIT and have been licensed to GTL Biofuel Inc. Its pilot plant outside Shanghai ran successfully from September 2015 and a larger “semi-commercial’ demonstration plant, 20 times the size, is set to begin construction. This will test if the process can be scaled up and evaluate its costs and carbon footprint, said Prof Stephanopoulos: “It is one thing to do it on a scale of 1-2 litres in the lab, but a different story to move up 1,000 litres and then 20,000 litres in the demonstration plant.” “The bottom line, if one is aiming at making fuels from renewable resources, is we need to look very carefully at low-cost feed stocks,” he said. Garbage, along with manure and farm waste, is a particularly promising source of the “syngas” required, he said: “The volumes are staggering.” Furthermore, using the gas from municipal waste reduces the carbon footprint of the liquid fuel, compared to exhaust gases from fossil fuel plants.  Prof Stephanopoulos said there are already thousands of biogas sites across Europe, but he argues the current practice of burning this gas to produce electricity is wasteful: “It is very costly and can only survive due to subsidies.” Better, he said, is to use the gas to produce fuels that can replace gasoline or diesel. The MIT team are not the only people developing biotechnologies to turn exhaust gases into fuels. Like MIT, the US company Lanzatech uses microbes that can ferment gases into more complex molecules, a skill originally evolved so the bacteria could thrive at bubbling, hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. Lanzatech’s processes aim to produce either fuel or chemicals useful in industry. The company is currently building commercial units in Belgium with ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker; in China with Capital Steel and in Taiwan with China Steel, with the first unit expected to enter service in 2017. Another US company, Catalysta, is working on converting methane into hydrocarbon fuels."

"Making a political statement at the Oscars podium appears to have come back into fashion, after Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar-acceptance speech exhorting action over climate change led a string of wide-ranging statements at the 2016 ceremony – even if the expected controversy over Hollywood diversity was more muted than had been anticipated. The campaigning period, which had officially been kicked off by the nominations announcement on 14 January, had been dominated by talk of boycotts over the film industry’s diversity issues, and the associated #OscarsSoWhite hashtag. High profile figures such as Will and Jada Pinkett Smith chose to stay away, while up-and-coming directors Ava DuVernay and Ryan Coogler opted to attend a benefit even for the #JusticeForFlint campaign, over the water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan. Oscars host Chris Rock tackled the issue with a stream of gags, but the combative mood was blunted by the appearance of Fox News commentator Stacey Dash – a high profile critic of Black History Month – and a less-than-incendiary speech from musician Quincy Jones. In the event, however, DiCaprio’s intervention proved the most hard-hitting statement on the night. After being named as the winner of the best actor Oscar, DiCaprio said: “Making The Revenant was about man’s relationship to the natural world. A world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history. Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow.” DiCaprio, a committed environmental activist with a long record of backing campaigns added: “Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people out there who would be most affected by this. For our children’s children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed ... Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted.” DiCaprio’s sentiments were echoed by Jenny Beavan, winner of the best costume design Oscar for Mad Max: Fury Road, who said on receiving her award: “It could be horribly prophetic, Mad Max – if we’re not kinder to each other, and if we don’t stop polluting our atmosphere ... it could happen.” The producers of another of the evening’s high-profile pictures, Spotlight, also issued a call to arms designed to resonate beyond the Oscars. Spotlight dealt with clerical sex abuse in Boston, and the institutional cover-up that followed to protect the Catholic church. After the film won the best picture award, one of Spotlight’s producers, Michael Sugar, called on the church hierarchy to listen to its message. He said: “This film gave a voice to survivors, and this Oscar amplifies that voice, which we hope will become a choir that will resonate all the way to the Vatican ... Pope Francis, it’s time to protect the children and restore the faith.” An invitation to vice-president Joe Biden to introduce Lady Gaga’s performance of her Oscar-nominated song Til It Happens to You from the campus-rape documentary The Hunting Ground was a clear cue for a statement, and Biden told the Oscar audience: “Too many men and women around the country ... are still victims of sexual abuse.” He also asked his audience to “take the pledge that they “will intervene in situations where consent has not or cannot be given.” During Gaga’s impassioned performance, she was joined a group of sexual abuse survivors, with phrases such as “survivor” and “not your fault” written on their forearms. However, Sam Smith’s attempt to take a stand for the LGBT community appeared to backfire, after he won the Oscar for best song for Spectre’s Writing’s on the Wall. Referencing a Guardian article, he said: “I read an article a few months ago by Sir Ian McKellen and he said no openly gay man had won an Oscar ... If this is the case, I want to dedicate this to the LGBT community around the world. I stand here tonight as a proud gay man and I hope that we can all stand as equals one day.” However, McKellen had been specifically referring to the best actor Oscar, and Smith’s remark’s provoked something of a furore – not least from Dustin Lance Black, who won best original screenplay in 2009 for Milk. Black, who is engaged to Olympic diver Tom Daley, posted a withering Tweet, writing: “If you have no idea who I am, it may be time to stop texting my fiancé”. But the most baffling statement of all was the lack of appreciation for Jenny Beavan’s best costume design win. In a gesture normally reserved for controversial figures such as Elia Kazan, several members of the audience – including best director winner Alejandro González Iñárritu – conspicuously sat immobile as she walked up to receive her award; although Iñárritu can be seen half-heartedly joining in the applause as she reaches the podium. Whether it’s a case of simple apathy, or sexism as many have claimed, or something more concerted, we may never know."
"It’s been many years since the motorist had such a warm feeling at the petrol pump. Whoever thought they would be able to fill the car at prices as low as 90p a litre? Take advantage; fill up that tank. But don’t delude yourself that this is an unalloyed benefit. Instead be aware of the dynamic that has delivered cheap petrol to your tank, and of its serious implications. How did we get here? Since June 2014, the price of crude oil has fallen by over 70%. The reason is supply and demand, and the economics of oil markets. From the start of the Arab spring uprisings in Tunisia in January 2011, oil producers in the Middle East and north Africa sought higher oil revenues to keep people off the streets and out of the squares. That required higher oil prices – which for some time they managed to achieve. From 2011 to June 2014, prices averaged at $97 a barrel. The shale gas revolution in the US also had an impact. Production there increased by almost 5m barrels a day between 2008 and 2015 – unprecedented in the history of the industry. You don’t need a Nobel prize to realise that high prices in a market so oversupplied with oil were simply unsustainable.  In the summer of 2014, as prices began to slide, Saudi Arabia reduced its output to balance the market, but soon it had a rethink. Between 1980 and 1985 it reduced supply – from 10.5m to 2.5m barrels a day – to keep prices high, but suffered serious economic consequences. So in September 2014, Saudi drew a proverbial line in the sand, deciding not to protect the price but to prioritise defence of its market share. The conspiracy theorists had a field day: this was obviously a political attack targeted at Russia, at Iran, at Iraq, at the US, they said. The reality was much simpler. Saudi Arabia aimed to marginalise the high-cost producers to the benefit of low-cost producers – like Saudi Arabia. The fact that these high-cost producers were for the most part also American was purely coincidental. How long can we stay here? That’s hard to predict, because this is such an unusual place to be. An agreement was reached halfway through this month between Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar to limit their production, but this has no credibility whatsoever. Russia has been involved in such deals before and has rapidly reneged on them. After a brief flurry of interest the markets correctly dismissed the deal, and oil prices have since resumed their downward trend. Put into perspective, prices are low, but historically not that low. Between 1986 and 2004, the price in real terms hovered around $33 a barrel compared with the average price last week of about $32. However – and this is crucial – it is a much lower price compared with the last 10 years, when prices averaged $85 in real terms. It is trading at a price that few are accustomed to. So what should you be thinking as you fill your tank? In short, that lower prices in the UK mean good and bad news. You reap the benefit of the former; the price of petrol has fallen from about £1.40 a litre in 2011 to £1 and less in January this year. This is not as much as the fall in crude prices because of the fixed amount taken in tax. Of the price of oil products to the final consumer in 2014, more than 60% went as tax to the UK government. Nonetheless, lower prices put more money in consumers’ pockets with beneficial effects to the economy. In the good old days, when financial markets had some understanding of economics, lower oil prices would have also boosted expectations for growth and pushed up share prices. In today’s world of economic illiteracy and “irrational exuberance”, this is no longer true. Globally, falling oil prices are now seen as bad news for stock markets. But there is more bad news in the price you are paying. These lower prices are having serious impacts on employment. The North Sea is not as important to the UK as in the early 1980s, when it generated £12bn for government revenues, compared with £4.7bn today. Some 23,000 jobs are expected to go in the North Sea over the next five years and many will never come back as the workforce ages. Future British production is also in doubt. It will rely on existing platforms and pipelines, which are ageing and reaching their sell-by date, or investment in new infrastructure, which is unlikely to appear in this lower price world. The industry body Oil and Gas UK has said that less than £1bn is likely to be spent on new projects this year, as opposed to the £8bn spent on average every year over the past five years. British oil that is not produced in the next five to 10 years may never be produced. Think too of what it means around the world, for already there are dramatic reductions in investment in conventional oil production. In January the commercial intelligence analysts Wood Mackenzie estimated that $400bn of projects have been postponed or cancelled. This involves 68 that account for 27bn barrels of reserves, equivalent to the combined reserves of Norway, UK, Mexico and Oman. Assuming oil demand continues to grow, as the consensus argues, this lack of investment is very serious for an industry where the natural depletion of oil fields requires producers to run to a stand still. Over the next decade it is possible we’ll have an ever-tightening market, leading to instability and the threat of price shocks. There will be problems for large oil companies in this lower price world as their share values fall. And if you wonder if this matters to you, just remember the pensioners who depend on stock market valuations for their pensions. In February 2015, before the price collapse really started, oil firms accounted for more than 13% of the value of the FTSE 100 share index. Another source of concern is what lower prices mean for the drive to replace fossil fuels and offset the march of climate change. Suddenly, renewables begin to look relatively more expensive, and this could undermine the progress made last year at the Paris climate change talks to reduce burning carbon. But what should really occupy your thoughts is the geopolitics of oil. The price wars have contributed to poor relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Apart from any other consideration, this makes any agreement over ending the war in Syria distant, with potentially devastating consequences for the stability of the region. To find an earlier period of such instability in the Middle East you need to go back to 1918 – the end of the first world war and the collapse of the Ottoman empire. To be somewhat parochial, what this might mean for the flow of desperate refugees and migrants to Europe beggars belief. Furthermore, a consequence of many oil producers facing serious economic problems is that countries as diverse as Venezuela, Nigeria, Angola and Algeria, to name but a few, will face serious internal political dissent as their governments, short of revenue, find they no longer have the funds to buy off their populations. Human suffering, political unrest, delayed climate change action; surely it is worth thinking about all this when we fill up with cheap petrol?"
"Each year, investors eagerly await Warren Buffett’s annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders. And well they might: under his leadership, Berkshire’s compounded annual growth rate from 1965 to 2015 was 20.8%, far better than the 9.7% achieved by the S&P 500.  But this year, the storied “Sage of Omaha” expanded his focus to encompass larger issues. In his shareholder letter, he tackled the controversial subject of climate change, suggesting that, while it threatens the planet, it might also provide some business opportunities for Berkshire Hathaway.   The flashpoint in this struggle is a proposal that is scheduled to be discussed at Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholder meeting on April 30. Submitted by the Nebraska Peace Foundation, which owns exactly one share of Berkshire, the proposal asks the company to “report on the dangers that this change might present to our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats”.  Buffett is quick to acknowledge the existence – and dangers – of climate change, and it has likely informed his investments in the past. As he says in the shareholder letter, “It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet”. In fact, as he wrote in the letter, Berkshire Hathaway Energy “has invested $16bn in renewables and now owns 7% of the country’s wind generation and 6% of its solar generation”. But Buffett also predicts that climate change will increase the profits of insurance companies underwriting catastrophic risks, therefore it will be good for Berkshire’s insurance business. The key, Buffett suggests, is timing. Noting the concern about skyrocketing property losses from climate change, he explains that “such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- or twenty-year policies at fixed prices”. He says the short term nature of most policies should offset this problem: “Insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repriced annually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.” There are some potential flaws in Buffett’s argument. To begin with, recent developments in climate science show an accelerating rate of climatic change that could throw his timetable into disarray. Buffett also seems to lack an understanding of the severity of climate change-related weather: he says that “up to now, climate change has not produced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather related events covered by insurance”. This claim flies in the face of growing scientific evidence. In 2014, the federally funded National Climate Assessment stated that: “Certain types of extreme weather events with links to climate change have become more frequent and/or intense, including prolonged periods of heat, heavy downpours, and, in some regions, floods and droughts.”  Other insurers have already expressed concern about these changes. Carl Hedde, head of risk accumulation for insurer Munich Re America, says: “The number of loss-relevant, weather-related natural catastrophes worldwide has almost tripled since 1980 […] we do think that the warming climate – depending on region and peril concerned – does play a certain role.” Buffett does believe the possibility of more frequent and damaging hurricanes and floods in the future. Rather than costing his company money, he expects these future catastrophes will actually raise profits. He draws an analogy with Berkshire-owned car insurance company Geico. In 1951, he explains, Geico’s “average loss-per-policy was then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increase to about $1,000 per policy”. But rather than destroying Geico, these rising losses were actually indicative of handsome revenues. “[T]hese increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums,” Buffett explains. “So, paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable.” Buffett seems to argue that, as Geico paid out more in claims, it made more money with higher premiums. By extension, he seems to argue that increased premiums will more than balance the increased cost per policy that will come with global warming. But cost per policy and premium per policy weren’t the only variables affecting Geico’s profitability. Over time, cars have also gotten safer: between 1994 and 2013, the number of deadly auto accidents fell from 23.21 deaths per 100,000 licensed drivers in the US to 15.42 deaths per 100,000 licensed drivers.  This is where Buffett’s analogy breaks down. Unlike cars, the Earth isn’t getting safer; in fact, risks to insurers are increasing. A growing body of research suggests that the planet is in serious trouble. As warming melts arctic permafrost, it releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which further increases temperatures. Meanwhile, melting glaciers mean that the Earth can reflect less of the sun’s rays back into space, which also amplifies the warming effect.  As the rate of global warming increases, so will the rate of climate change-related disasters – and presumably the rate of insurance payouts. It’s a lot easier to make money off of declining risks – as in the case of auto accidents – than increasing risks, as in the case of climate change. Of course, Buffett argues that insurance prices can be adjusted upwards each year to take account of new climate information that emerges. But if climate change is accelerating, even a yearly “true-up” in insurance rates will not be enough to protect insurance company profit margins. Current rates will always lag behind accelerating growth in damages and claims. The annual adjustment will merely slow down the widening gap between them. Airlines illustrate just how hard it can be to keep rates rising in step with fluctuations in jet fuel prices. It would be rash to prematurely write off anything Buffett does, but it’s worth noting that he is definitely hedging his bets. While Buffett seems bullish on climate change, he has also been shifting his insurance portfolio away from its catastrophic risks.  Yet Berkshire still holds two reinsurance firms, which are the types of insurers that Buffett’s letter tells investors will insure risks that “no one else has the desire or the capital to take on”. Could the canny “Sage” be downplaying catastrophic risks because he is preparing to sell off these entities? Savvy investors will be watching his next move closely."
"There’s a well-paid vacancy at the United Nations going at the moment.After six years in the hot-seat, UN climate chief Christiana Figueres is off, with a global pact at the top of her CV. The hunt is on for her replacement, the UN job portal is open, the salary in the region of $200,000 (£143,000).  Applicants need to demonstrate vision, communication skills, experience of working with senior leaders and be a patient sort. With less than five years until a new global pact comes into force, it’s a critical time for whoever takes over, with the prospect of little glory but plenty of graft. On the downside you have to live in Bonn. On the upside it requires a lot of travel so you won’t be there much. The UN climate body has only had four heads: one from Malta, two from the Netherlands and the incumbent from Costa Rica. History favours candidates from small countries, not permanent members of the UN security council. Climate Home has canvassed opinion from the international climate change community – here’s a rundown of the top 10 names being discussed (in no particular order). Mexico’s ambassador to Germany is highly regarded in climate circles, having taken over the presidency of the UN talks in 2010 with the Copenhagen hangover still raging. Careful diplomacy and a tight alliance with Figueres saw the Cancun talks get back on track after the Danish disaster. If the UN wants to emphasise its commitment to implementation between now and 2020, the executive director of the International Energy Agency could be a decent bet. The Turkish economist is on the UN’s Sustainable Energy 4 All panel and is a respected media performer. Lima’s environment chief has an election coming up, potentially freeing him up for other pursuits. Credited with ensuring UN talks were more open and transparent in 2014, MPV was asked to assist COP21 president Laurent Fabius in Paris as a bridge with civil society groups. The lean and quiet environment minister of the Gambia lives on the frontline of climate change, a powerful advocate for investment in adaptation and loss and damage. One-time head of the Least Developed Countries group was chosen to be one of Fabius’ advisors in the closing stages of Paris. Diseko brought a touch of drama and glamour to UN talks through 2015, fiercely defending the 134-strong Group of 77 she was charged with leading. She’s an old hand at the UN and one of the key advisors to the South African government during the 2011 COP17 summit in Durban. Former chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, Grenada ambassador to the UN and Oxfam climate advisor, Williams is a UN talks veteran. She’s another potential candidate who lives on the climate frontline, often writing about the impact of rising sea levels on her home. An architecture critic, author, economist and diplomat, there are apparently few subjects Corrêa do Lago cannot discuss with authority. Brazil’s smooth and media-friendly ambassador to Japan was – until 2012 – its head of climate negotiations, and chief negotiator at the Rio+20 talks. Secretary of state for climate change between 2008-2011, Ribera now runs the Paris-based IDDRI thinktank, which played a key behind-the-scenes role helping the French government at COP21. An established name on the circuit, Ribera has also led IDDRI’s Latin American outreach. If Laurent Fabius was the face of the UN climate talks, Tubiana was the brains trust behind the project, advising the COP president on the technical aspects of a climate deal. A warm personality who made many new friends in the past year, it’s doubtful she’d want to swap Paris for Bonn. When Paris looked in trouble, France turned to Teixeira to resolve the developed v developing divide at UN talks. A robust negotiator and career civil servant who rarely smiles in public, she was the face of the Rio+20 talks and sits on the UN high level panel for post-2015 development. "
"Media Matters for America has published a report detailing US broadcast news coverage of climate change in 2015, and their findings are stunning. 2015 was a banner year for climate news. February, June, October, November, and December were each their respective hottest months on record, and 2015 shattered the record for hottest year. The pope delivered a climate encyclical. Investigative journalists at Inside Climate News discovered that Exxon knew about the dangers of human-caused global warming while it funded a climate misinformation campaign, and the New York attorney general launched an investigation into the company’s behavior. President Obama’s Clean Power Plan went into effect, and he rejected the Keystone XL pipeline. And most importantly, 195 countries agreed to cut carbon pollution as much as possible to stem global warming.  Despite all these critically important stories, as in the presidential debates, climate change was largely absent from US broadcast news. Climate coverage fell in 2015.  Most of the decline was due to ABC, which only spent 13 minutes in 2015 covering climate change – three times less than even Fox. While Fox’s coverage increased, most of the network’s climate segments featured interviews with guests who criticized efforts to address global warming. The Sunday shows (ABC’s This Week, CBS’ Face the Nation, NBC’s Meet the Press, and Fox Broadcasting Co.’s Fox News Sunday) and the network nightly news programs (ABC’s World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, and NBC Nightly News) each aired a combined 73 minutes of climate coverage in 2015, down a total of 8 minutes (a 5% decline) from 2014. The Public Broadcasting System (PBS) NewsHour program aired more segments addressing climate change (58) than the other nightly news shows combined (48). In particular, the award-winning Inside Climate News Exxon investigation and the launch of the Clean Power Plan were largely overlooked by the news networks.  When it came to interviewing or quoting scientists and doing segments about climate science research, PBS NewsHour again rose above its peers, while ABC’s World News Tonight flunked science class. Climate scientists were entirely absent from the Sunday news shows, with one exception. On CBS’ Face the Nation in December, anchor John Dickerson interviewed Dr. Marshall Shepherd, meteorologist and director of University of Georgia’s Atmospheric Sciences Program, to discuss the importance of the UN summit’s goal of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius. This was a sharp decline from 2014, in which climate scientists were interviewed or quoted on seven Sunday news shows. Climate change affects some of the most critical components of our society: food security, national defense, extreme weather, the economy, public health, the environment, and so on. The broadcast networks touched on some of these, like extreme weather, but largely missed others. Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) reacted to the Media Matters report: As the co-founder of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, I read Media Matters’ new study and it’s a wake up call to the news networks. The most important long term global and national issue shouldn’t be getting short-thrift. People need more information, not less.  These findings may help explain why Americans aren’t concerned about climate change. We rely on the media to inform the public, and on the most important issue of our time, the US broadcast news media are failing to adequately inform Americans. As Rep. Israel notes, they’re moving in the wrong direction and need to do much better."
"Sea levels are rising several times faster than they have in the past 2,800 years, with the process accelerating because of manmade global warming, according to new studies. An international team of scientists examined two dozen locations across the globe to chart rising and falling seas over centuries and millennia.   Until the 1880s and the world’s industrialisation, the fastest seas rose was about 3cm to 4cm a century. During that time global sea levels did not get much higher or lower than 7.6cm above or below the 2,000-year average. But in the 20th century the world’s seas rose 14cm.  Two different studies published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said that by 2100 the world’s oceans would rise between 28cm to 131cm, depending on how much heat-trapping gas Earth’s industries and vehicles expel. Rutgers earth and planetary sciences professor Bob Kopp, lead author of the study, which looked back at sea levels over the past three millennia, said: “There’s no question that the 20th century is the fastest. “It’s because of the temperature increase in the 20th century which has been driven by fossil fuel use.” Sea level rise in the 20th century was mostly manmade, the study authors said. A separate, not-yet-published study by Kopp and others found that since 1950 about two-thirds of the US coastal floods in 27 locales were linked to manmade warming. Study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said that if seas continued to rise as projected, another 45cm would cause lots of problems and expense, especially with surges during storms. “There is such a tight relationship between sea level and temperature,” Horton said. “I wish there wasn’t, then we wouldn’t be as worried.” If greenhouse gas pollution continues at the current pace, both studies project increases of about 57cm to 131cm. If countries fulfil the treaty agreed upon last year in Paris and limit further warming to another 2F, sea level rise would be in the 28 to 56cm range. Jonathan Overpeck at the University of Arizona, who wasn’t part of the studies, praised them, saying they show a clear cause and effect between warming and sea level rise."
"Climate models, and the predictions they make, are based on physics. We know how much more energy is trapped on Earth when we increase the greenhouse effect, and we have a good idea how much this trapped heat will warm the planet. We’ve understood these physical scientific concepts for over 150 years. When climate contrarians make their own predictions, they tend to throw physics out the window. For example, as documented in my book and a paper I recently published with Rasmus Benestad and colleagues, contrarians have made climate predictions based on things like the orbital cycles of Jupiter and Saturn, ocean cycles and sunspots, and “natural fluctuations,” but they often completely disregard the basic, long-understood physics of the increasing greenhouse effect.  And so we have the latest such unphysical climate prediction, made in a report by Loughborough University statistics professor Terence Mills, on behalf of the anti-climate policy advocacy group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). The report essentially fits a statistical model to past global and local surface temperature changes, and then uses that statistical model to forecast future temperature changes. It’s an approach that’s been used to predict financial market changes, for example. The obvious flaw in this application is that the Earth’s climate is a physical system, and the statistical model includes no physics whatsoever. You simply cannot accurately predict how a physical system will change if you ignore physics, like the increasing greenhouse effect. As DeSmogUK put it, the GWPF report predicts no global warming by ignoring the main cause of global warming. And as climate scientist James Annan wrote, The basic premise is that if you fit a nonsense model with no trend or drift, you generate a forecast with no trend or drift (though with huge uncertainty intervals, necessary to allow for the historical warming we’ve already seen). Amusingly, even with those huge uncertainty intervals, the temperature is already outside them Indeed, as NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Director Gavin Schmidt noted, temperatures have already risen outside of the GWPF forecasted range. @dougmcneall @LeoHickman @cwhope And amusingly, current temps (to 12/2015) already outside predicted range… pic.twitter.com/Lhiag8jE44 A number of other climate scientists immediately had a good laugh at the report’s and media’s expense. Are @thetimes so desperate for subscribers that they're reduced to covering daft GWPF reports for trashy clickbait? https://t.co/u8VqcNOOJc Wonder if @thegwpfcom checked cost of similar-sized advert in the 'Comedy' section of @thetimes? Cheaper than their fee to Mills! (h/t anon)  Unfortunately, the seemingly juicy story nevertheless made the rounds in the conservative media, including the Times, the Australian (both Murdoch-owned), the Express, Canada Free Press, and the Daily Mail. At least the Mail called the report “controversial” and noted the mockery from climate experts, who called the GWPF report “silly” and “daft.” Climate scientists Emily Shuckburgh and Ed Hawkins even took the time to write a letter to the Times to correct the story. Letter to @thetimes on their article about GWPF report which used no physics & found climate sensitivity was zero pic.twitter.com/bCxOTo9TmP James Annan used the opportunity to propose a modest wager based Professor Mills’ forecast. As Annan describes it, There followed a fruitless exchange in which [Mills] declined to comment on whether he thought the forecast was credible and refused to even discuss any possible bet. I’m still baffled as to what might motivate a statistics professor to put their name to such obvious drivel, it’s hardly something that will enhance his reputation in the academic community, or that he can feel proud to have written. As Mann et al. (2016) most recently showed, physics-based climate models are doing a very good job at predicting global warming and climate change. As expected based on our understanding of the greenhouse effect, if we keep pumping vast amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere, the planet will continue to warm dangerously rapidly. The reason mainstream climate scientists have accurately predicted global warming, while contrarian predictions have failed, is that the former are based on physics while the latter are based on wishful thinking. Regardless of how many misleading charts and unphysical models climate contrarians cook up, and how many stories conservative media outlets run about this nonsense non-science, it’s not going to change the physical reality of global warming."
"The European Union’s trade commissioner told the multinational oil company ExxonMobil that a major free trade deal being negotiated with the US would help remove obstacles to fossil fuel development in Africa and South America, documents obtained by the Guardian reveal. At a meeting in Brussels in October 2013, Karel de Gucht told the firm that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could address its concerns about regulations in developing countries that restrict the company’s activities.  The news emerged as a Greenpeace barricade delayed the resumption of talks between EU and US delegations on the TTIP deal, which both sides hope can be completed before President Obama leaves office next January. According to minutes of the October meeting, the hour-long conversation focused on shale gas; “geopolitical aspects”; EU plans to label tar sands as high-polluting; and a possible reconversion of ExxonMobil’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal in the US to export crude to Europe. This would be “costly and may take two-three years,” the minutes said. Heavily redacted records show that two officials from Exxon’s US and EU regions were present in the room with de Gucht, the then-trade commissioner, Claes Bengtsson, his cabinet member, and two other unidentified individuals.  According to a briefing paper for de Gucht, released to the Guardian under access to documents laws, the commission was keen to point out the advantages that a TTIP deal could offer ExxonMobil, with respect to countries not party to the trade deal. “TTIP is perhaps more relevant as setting a precedent vis-a-vis third countries than governing trade and investment bilaterally,” the paper says. “We think that this third country element is in the interest of the energy sector, and especially globally active companies like Shell or Exxonmobil. After all, companies like Shell or Exxonmobil face the same trade barriers when doing business in Africa, in Russia or in South America.” The commission was in effect saying that once the trade deal was in place, other countries outside it would be progressively forced to adopt the same measures, making it easier for companies such as ExxonMobil to expand into their markets. John Hilary, the executive director of the campaign group War on Want, accused the commission of overstepping its mandate in the talks. “It is tantamount to corruption that the European commission should be prepared to work hand in glove with such vested interests in crafting deals that will have a profound effect on our environment,” he told the Guardian. At the time that the brief was written, several countries in the “global south” were tightening regulations on fossil fuel companies for the first time in a decade, despite ExxonMobil’s ambitions to open up shale gas fracking wells in North Africa, Asia and South America. The briefing paper said that the TTIP talks were a unique chance to write a new rule-book for global trade that “could serve as a model for subsequent negotiations involving third countries”. “The commission’s clear priority is establishing a template for all future deals,” Hilary said. “It is critical because it means that no countries will be able to tighten the regulatory regime on fossil fuel companies operating on their territories.” Dr Valérie Marcel, associate energy fellow at Chatham House, said that in late 2013, fossil fuel firms had been increasingly fearful that the long-term investment climate was changing. “There was a growing trend of producing countries wanting to capture maximum windfalls from petroleum projects,” she said. “They were imposing windfall taxes or threatening to change contractual terms, so they [the oil companies] probably wanted to put political pressure on those governments.” ExxonMobil’s public response was to protest against regulatory frameworks, financial incentives and “protectionist policies,” which it said were holding industry back. It also called on the US to end its ban on exports of crude oil and LNG. This was a position the firm shared with the EU, and which informed debate at the meeting whose minutes the commission redacted because they “reveal possible strategies that the commission may adopt in the ongoing negotiations,” according to documents previously released to the Guardian. But commission officials deny offering ExxonMobil any advantages and, while declining comment on the discussions, insist that trade reform is needed. “EU and US companies face discrimination when they need access to resources,” a commission spokesman told the Guardian. “Once they have produced the energy goods, they do not get access to the grid, or access at less favourable conditions. Energy resource countries supply energy resources at below market prices to their domestic industry. The EU and US industry is put at a disadvantage.” Steve Kretzmann, the director of the campaign group Oil Change International, described the commission’s behaviour as a “scandalous” attempt to liberalise the global crude market that went beyond shale gas and shale oil. “I see it as standard setting because it would allow the EU to place greater diplomatic and political pressure on those [developing] countries to lower all their trade barriers,” he said. “If the US is not doing this protective policy anymore you shouldn’t either.” ExxonMobil would not respond directly to questions about the meeting. But Nikolaas Baeckelmans, the company’s vice-president of EU affairs, said: “ExxonMobil supports an open, unbiased, and rules-based trade and investment system. We see that as essential to global free enterprise and to promoting alignment of business interests, productivity, and economic growth.” "

"When I was a kid, bathtime was a once-a-week affair. We weren’t an unhygienic family – this is just how most of us lived in the 1960s, and I do not remember any horrific body odours resulting from it. By the time I was an adult, I was showering every day. With hindsight, I should have stuck to the old ways.  The average 10-minute shower uses 60 litres of water. A power shower uses three times that and a bath about 80 litres. So a family of four each having a daily 10-minute power shower (I know that is a very conservative estimate for some teenagers) will consume a staggering 0.25m litres of water every year. The annual average cost for electricity for four 10-minute showers per day would be up to about £400, or £1,200 if a power shower is involved. Even worse, the power-shower family would be emitting a staggering 3.5 tonnes of CO2. As we can afford only one tonne of carbon emissions per person – for everything from food to transport – if we are to keep global temperatures below the critical 2C threshold, this would consume nearly all of the family’s carbon budget. The daily bath or shower, then, is terrible for the environment and our bank balances. That’s one reason I have reverted to a weekly shower, with a daily sink-wash that includes my underarms and privates. But there are health consequences too. I first became aware of these when I was a touring ballet dancer and met a friend whose skin had been severely damaged by excessive use of soap products. He was condemned to treat himself with medical creams for the rest of his life. According to dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, parents should stop bathing babies and toddlers daily because early exposure to dirt and bacteria may help make skin less sensitive, even preventing conditions like eczema in the long run. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends three times a week or less as toddlers’ skin is more sensitive; and as the elderly have drier skin, they should not be frequently washing all of their bodies with soap. Doctors say that overuse of soap removes the skin’s natural protective oils and good bacteria. This can exacerbate or cause complaints such as dermatitis. The longer one stays in the shower, the more of the skin’s oils are removed. The only real beneficiaries of over-frequent baths and showers are the companies that make and market soaps and shampoos. It is clear my daily shower habit resulted from falsely imposed cultural norms, rather than any legitimate health benefits. We do need to wash our hands frequently, for obvious hygiene reasons. But our skin has its own natural cleansing mechanism and it is generally only our armpits, feet and privates that produce any odours if unwashed. There is a similar story with frequent shampooing. When I visited the Yanomami in the heart of the Amazon in 1992, I noticed that they had lovely shiny, healthy hair, despite not using any shampoo or soap at all. Frequent shampooing, it turns out, removes the hair’s natural protective oils, damaging and drying out the hair and scalp, in turn creating a lucrative market for so-called hair “conditioners” and “anti-dandruff” shampoos. I gave up shampooing after I came back from the Yanomami and now simply wash my hair with water. I never again suffered from dandruff or dry hair. Of course, if you are being intimate with somebody, whether it is your partner or a doctor who is examining you, it is nicer for both of you if you are fresh and clean. But that can just involve a quick sink-wash. So let’s ignore the advertising bullies and revert to the traditional weekly shower or bath, plus a daily sink-wash. Apart from anything else, think how much time we’ll save."
"Melbourne sweltered through its hottest March night on record on Tuesday, hovering around 30C after reaching a peak of 38.6C in the city at 5pm. The temperature dropped to an overnight minimum of 27.7C at 8.45am Wednesday, just before the 6am cut-off for overnight temperatures.  It broke a previous record for the warmest overnight minimum of 26.5C, which was set on March 13, 2013. However the daytime maximum of 38.9C fell short of the March record of 41.5C, set in 1940. Sydney has also been unseasonably warm, with a record-breaking 31 days in a row above 26C. Canberra has had a daily maximum temperature of more than 30C for every day of March so far. Alain Baillie, forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne, said the uncomfortable night was the result of a low-intensity heatwave, which has hovered over south-eastern Australia for the past week. That has been interrupted by a cool change in Melbourne, which saw the temperature drop from an expected high of 29.6C at 6am on Wednesday to 25.5C at 10am. The forecast maximum is 33C, but Baillie said it was possible that would not be reached. The cool change did not reach the north of the state, where a severe heatwave has seen Mildura, 540km north of Melbourne, suffer maximum temperatures of more than 40C for the past four days. Mildura has not had a daily maximum temperature below 36.7C since March began. The forecast is for Melbourne to return to normal early autumn temperatures in the mid-to-high 20s for the rest of the week, with the exception of Friday, when it is expected to reach 33C. The warm March temperatures follow a record-breaking heatwave in south-eastern Australia in December, which saw record high minimum overnight temperatures set in many areas of Victoria, Tasmania, eastern South Australia and southern New South Wales. Last year was the hottest year on record with global average temperatures 0.75C higher than the long-term average, smashing the previous record of global temperatures 0.57C higher than average set in 2015. A forecast issued by the UK Met Office in January suggested that 2016 could break that record again. Professor Will Steffan, from the Climate Council, said the heatwaves seen in south-eastern Australia “have the fingerprints of climate change all over them”. “Without serious action on climate change, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Canberra could all experience a doubling or tripling of days over 35C by 2070,” Steffan said. “But Australia’s emissions continue to go up in the absence of a credible plan to meet Australia’s commitments in Paris. “We need a rapid transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy if we are to protect Australians from worsening heat.”"
"The toughest sled dog race in the world didn’t disappoint in 2016. Blizzards, stranded mushers, charging bull moose – all featured on the 33rd annual Yukon Quest international sled dog race, an event that is more extreme wilderness challenge than competition.  “We were looking for the toughest sled dog race in the world, and this year we found it,” said Rob Cooke, an ex-Royal Navy British-Canadian who finished on Thursday despite nearly pulling out halfway through.  Overshadowed by the better-known Iditarod, the Yukon Quest starts in early February, travelling between Fairbanks, Alaska, and Whitehorse in Canada at a brutal time of year, when temperatures often drop to -40C (-40F) or worse. With only nine checkpoints over 1,000 miles, Quest mushers camp out on the trail and see nobody for hundreds of miles, traversing four mountain ranges and an area larger than France. The scale of the landscape guarantees an experience for the contestants, many of them self-described “Quest addicts” who return year after year to test their personal limits and tackle whatever Mother Nature throws at them. “This is the ultimate challenge for you and your team,” said Mike Ellis, who finished on Wednesday in 10th place. “I’m not out here racing against other teams, I’m out here racing against the clock and the trail and the weather and myself.” This year, a handful of teams got trapped by a blizzard, one musher was charged by an angry bull moose, search and rescue was called out for a dog who then instantly recovered, and a sudden, early thaw nearly sank the winner as he sped along the Yukon river to the finish line. Veteran Alaska musher Hugh Neff of Laughin’ Eyes Kennel in Tok took home the 2016 trophy, his second victory in 16 consecutive Quests. “This is about so much more than a trophy,” Neff said at the finish line. “It really is the dogs. All I do is take care of them.” Neff took nine days, one hour and 25 minutes to complete the trail, followed 80 minutes later by 2015 champion Brent Sass of Wild and Free Mushing in Eureka, Alaska. Allen Moore of SPK Kennels in Two Rivers, Alaska, placed third with a time of nine days, three hours and 59 minutes.  All three teams have signed up for the more expensive Iditarod, starting on 5 March, when 82 elite mushers will compete for a purse of $725,000, with $70,000 going to the winner. Neff took home just $25,000 for his Yukon Quest victory, or $10,000 after race expenses – a relatively tiny purse that is intentional, said John Firth, who travelled the inaugural trail in 1984, and has written a couple of books about the race. “The Quest appeals to the Joe Blow musher who wants to run the race but has no expectations of a pay packet at the end,” he said. And that emphasis upon survival, rather than speed, is reflected in the rules.  Mushers are allowed only 14 dogs and one sled, which must be repaired if it breaks. The sled carries enough food to feed 10,000 calories to each dog each day, along with a mandatory axe and pair of snowshoes. Dogs can be dropped at checkpoints, but a musher must have six dogs to finish. No two-way communication is allowed, and mushers must remain self-sufficient and all times, refusing any offers of help except from their handlers in Dawson City. Many mushers appreciate the emphasis on endurance rather than racing checkpoint to checkpoint in pursuit of a purse. “The Iditarod is about money and the big time and the flash, and everything I hate about mushing,” said Ellis. “The Quest is about dogs and trail and community and friends. Really the only similarity is they’re both 1,000 miles.” However, one-third of contestants scratch each year, suggesting that the Quest attracts mushers most likely to end up in difficulty. This year, trouble struck on the closed Top of the World Highway east of Dawson City, where the trail was rerouted after heavy jumble ice blocked the Yukon river.  The elite teams raced over the detour without difficulty, but mushers at the back of the pack reached the highway’s 3,000-foot summit in a blizzard as night fell. Lead dogs were up to their necks in snow, and refusing the move forward. Some teams gave up, camping out in deep cold and starting to succumb to fear and desperation.  Laura Neese, a 19-year old rookie from Michigan, was the only musher on the summit that night with a dogteam willing to move ahead no matter what.  Neese’s team leader Maple ploughed through snow so deep it threatened to bury her, breaking trail for both Neese and another team that was camped out in a makeshift shelter, and in a bad way. “I’d never seen anything like that before, with the drifting and the winds,” said Neese, after completing her first 1,000-mile race. “It was – well, I completely give my leader Maple all the credit for getting us to Dawson without either having to camp or me having to play lead dog for a while.” Neese is known for singing and whistling to her dogs as she beds them down in straw. The relationship between musher and dogs is absolutely what determines success.  “You have to have your mind right first, and let the dogs know you’re going to get them through this – and then they’re going to get you through it,” said Allen Moore, Quest champion in 2013 and 2014. “They have to know you’re going to take the best care of them.” Dogs have to pass a physical at the start, finish and all checkpoints and mushers are involuntarily withdrawn at the first sign of abuse.  Even so, bad things happen. One dog died on the 2016 Quest, experiencing a sudden gastric hemorrhage half an hour outside a checkpoint. The dog’s owner, Sebastian Dos Santos Borges of France, immediately scratched. “The mushers are usually the first to call us over,” said race veterinarian Lori Walker. “They love their dogs.” So much so that another musher hit his emergency locator beacon when his lead dog Charlie suddenly collapsed just outside a checkpoint. Within 30 minutes, Charlie was in the back of the vet’s SUV wagging her tail, licking the vet’s face, and begging for snacks. DeBruin was allowed to continue but ultimately scratched. Vets diagnosed Charlie with muscular myopathy, or muscle spasm. With the last musher due to finish on Friday – just in time for the annual banquet – pretty much every contestant said they would be back again in 2017.  Would rookie Laura Neese? Absolutely. “I loved it,” she said. “I thought I was addicted before, but I’m worse now.”"
"Climate change, and human resistance to making the changes needed to halt it, both continue apace: 2015 was the hottest year in recorded history, we may be on the brink of a major species extinction event in the ocean, and yet political will is woefully lacking to tackle this solvable problem.   Given these dire ecological trends, limited public funding and legislative gridlock, the time is ripe for a budget-neutral, executive-branch approach for managing our natural resources: triage. A science-based triage approach should be used to classify areas and species into one of three categories: not at immediate risk, in need of immediate attention or beyond help.  Refusing to apply triage implicitly assumes that we can save everything and prevent change, which we cannot. Prioritization will occur regardless, just ad hoc and shrouded. This triage system would replace the status quo of inadequately managing our full portfolio of over 1m square miles of public land and 1,589 threatened and endangered species. For areas or species not at immediate risk, we can delay action while monitoring to detect changes in that status. For example, increased temperatures and prolonged periods of drought may increase both wildfires and populations of tree-killing beetles in forests of the Pacific north-west. Knowing this, we can track these variables and explore management options that minimize risk without prematurely devoting disproportionate resources. For areas needing immediate help, we must act now. For the coral reefs of the Florida Keys and US Virgin Islands, all anthropogenic impacts (such as overfishing, pollution and coastal development) must be dramatically reduced. Otherwise, because the health of these coral reefs is currently so compromised, they are unlikely to survive the sea level rise, rising ocean temperatures and increasing acidification resulting from climate change. For species protections, it would be wise to focus on keystone species such as oysters (water filterers), parrotfish (algae eaters on overgrown coral reefs), bees (pollinators) and wolves (key predators). For areas we can no longer maintain, we must make the most difficult of choices – give up, and accept that change is not always preventable. In Alaska, it may be too late to prevent the climate change-induced shift from coniferous-dominated to deciduous-dominated stands, with unfortunate impacts on forest-dwelling species and the logging industry. In the ocean, entire fisheries can be lost from an area when species shift due to warming waters. This is not to say we should de-list endangered species or revoke area protections. Rather, management should account for shifts in climate and habitats and aim to maintain the services ecosystems provide (like pollination, soil fertility, air and water purification and recreation), but acknowledge it may be costly and futile to attempt to maintain a particular ecosystem configuration or species in a particular location.  However, even degraded coral reefs can supply key ecosystem services such as fisheries and storm protection. A river can continue to be a source of clean, fresh drinking water and provide habitat for a diversity of species even if it is no longer suitable for trout or salmon. For triage to be successful, categorization must be transparent, based on the best available science, and it must avoid politicization and subjectivity. This approach would require us to weigh the many benefits ecosystems provide against the cost effectiveness of various management options. Given the distribution of management authority and the value of local ecological knowledge, these discussions and decisions would need to be just as robust at the local and state levels as at the national level. Employing triage would enable us to holistically consider our natural resources, design strategic management, focus our energies and resources and save as much of our environment as possible for the benefit of this and future generations."
"Hundreds of thousands of students are swotting through their final years of high school right now, pondering what to do with their lives. But they have no idea what university courses are going to cost in the future or even whether they will still be offered under the Coalition’s yet-to-be-announced policy.  Universities are begging for policy certainty. The government has offered none – fuelling speculation that the Abbott government’s 20% spending cut and the resultant increase in the cost of degrees will remain when the policy is finally unveiled, maybe in the budget, or maybe during the election campaign. Labor has promised a net increase in funding, $2.5bn over the first four years and $13.8bn over the next decade. It says this means degrees should be cheaper. Thousands of women are pregnant right now and don’t know what paid maternity leave they will be entitled to. Last December the Turnbull government tweaked the Abbott government’s already drastically revised paid parental leave policy – but it is still proposing arrangements that would cut the entitlements of mothers who get maternity leave from their employers as well as from the state, for some by $10,000 or more. The changes are supposed to come into effect in July. They have not yet been presented in legislation. Labor opposes them. Those same families are probably pretty interested to know what childcare subsidies they’ll be entitled to. That government policy – also heavily revised – is also in Senate limbo. Hundreds of thousands of people are planning for their retirement right now. They don’t know whether the Coalition will push ahead with plans to gradually increase the pension age to 70 – still officially policy, but rejected by the Senate. And they don’t know what changes the Coalition will make to superannuation. Best guess is a reduction in the caps on contributions, but it’s still a guess. Labor will reduce tax breaks on the superannuation earnings of the wealthiest retirees.  Most Australians rely on public hospitals in a medical emergency but their future is also unclear. State governments, and now the Australian Medical Association, are warning that the $57b in cuts in Abbott’s first budget are about to create a funding “crisis”, a crisis that will mean patients wait longer for treatment and some services will have to close. As Guardian Australia revealed in February, Turnbull is in talks with premiers to offer some additional money to tide the system over while deeper changes are negotiated. But it remains unclear whether they can do a deal. Many Australians are also concerned about climate change, but as things stand neither major party has a detailed climate policy that could meet Australia’s international greenhouse gas reduction commitments. Labor has a vague commitment to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme and reach 50% renewable energy. The Coalition continues to insist, contrary to most expert opinion, that its Direct Action policy is fit for purpose. Political parties have always saved policies to be unveiled with great fanfare during election campaigns. But for the third election in a row the government is being led by a different prime minister than the one the public elected the last time, leaving policies and political direction uncertain.  And that uncertainty is exacerbated by the $10b in former Abbott government policies gathering dust somewhere outside the Senate chamber – zombie policies still technically the government’s live options and still calculated into the figuring of the federal budget, but politically dead. But these policies, critical one way or the other to the everyday lives of most Australians, are not what is causing the government to push the emergency button on Australia’s constitutional provisions to break deadlocks between the houses of parliament by calling a double dissolution election. The Turnbull government does not cite them as examples of “Senate obstruction”. In fact it’s not clear what the government wants to do with them, whether they will live or die when the government finally gets around to telling us its priorities. And even if they live, they are not lined up as double dissolution triggers that can then be passed at a joint sitting of the houses of parliament after a double dissolution poll. And for most of them there now isn’t enough time to get into that line-up. They are far more important to most Australians than the industrial relations laws that will be used to justify any double dissolution poll, the ones Malcolm Turnbull talked up on Sydney radio on Friday. But they seem to have been left off the list because the government hasn’t figured out its direction. Meanwhile, the political “debate” seems fixated on the date of the budget and the related question of the date of the election, and whether it will be a double dissolution, parsing the prime minister’s language and reading deep meaning into the fact that there has been a May 3 booking in the parliament’s main function hall. Aha, the sleuths cried, that must be a post-budget function after a budget brought down a week earlier than usual, which would mean an early election, which would mean ... well, we don’t know what that means in the case of a re-elected Turnbull government because we’re still in the dark about policies – far more so than is usual for this point in the electoral cycle. Instead of asking questions or demanding answers about what the government wants to do if it is re-elected, we are stuck on the question of when the election itself will be held. Sure, we’d all like to know the date of the election. And yes, it would be a significant and risky tactical decision by Malcolm Turnbull to hold a double dissolution and a long campaign. But the “what” questions and the “why” questions are far more important than the “when” question, especially since the answer to the “when” question can only possibly vary by a couple of months either way. We have been obsessing about the wrong question."
"The vast majority of global companies have no obligation to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Still, many of them try. But the overall efforts aren’t nearly enough to help deal with the potential devastating impacts of climate change, from increasing droughts and wildfires to the mass extinction of species. Critics say businesses need to do more, including setting more ambitious carbon reduction targets and proving they can hit those goals. Now, an increasing number of environmental consulting and advocacy groups are using science-based targets to describe the types of goals they say companies and businesses need to achieve in order to make a difference. But what are science-based targets? Here is what you need to know:  The term refers to carbon emission reduction goals that are line with the levels that a United Nations climate report said will be required to keep global warming in check. To help raise awareness of corporate climate action, the UN Global Compact has formed an initiative – simply titled Science Based Targets – in collaboration with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the World Resources Institute and the World Wildlife Fund to help guide companies in enforcing these targets. The UN climate report projects that manmade emissions will likely increase the global temperature 3.7C to 4.8C from the average temperature before Industrial Revolution by the end of this century due to manmade emissions. Just yesterday, new studies showed that global warming is causing sea levels to rise much faster than they have in the past 28 centuries. Scientific evidence has already prompted political leaders to agree that limiting the temperature rise to 2C would help to minimize the environmental and social devastation. The recent Paris climate agreement calls for limiting the increase to 1.5C. Business should use science to set benchmarks for their environmental initiatives as well.  There isn’t one definitive way to come up with a good target. The Science Based Targets initiative has outlined models and factors, such as taking into consideration the company’s contribution to the global gross domestic product, that companies should include in calculating the actual and projected emissions over time, and steps to reduce them. The initiative reviews and approves the targets set by participating companies, which have two years after signing up to come up with a game plan. So far, the initiative has approved plans from 12 companies, including Dell, Kellogg, NRG Energy and Pfizer. It has commitment from more than 100 companies to set new goals. Some of the companies, such as General Mills, plan to reduce emissions from the goods and services they purchase and their delivery and distribution operations. Setting ambitious targets is one thing, meeting them is another. Whether companies can meet the voluntary targets they created is far from certain. Critics also have pointed out that some companies grossly under-report their carbon footprint. Meanwhile, the public will most likely remain skeptical – particularly considering the actions of some companies like Volkswagen, which fail to follow environmental laws. "

"The EU has put plans to regulate inefficient kettles and toasters into cold storage amid fears in Brussels that they could galvanise support for the leave campaign in the UK’s 23 June referendum. Mobile phones, lifts, hair- and hand-dryers and vending machines are also on a shortlist of products for increased regulation in 2015-17. The measures had been expected to save the equivalent of 10m tonnes of CO2 emissions per year by 2030, helping EU countries to meet efficiency goals and consumers to cut their energy bills.  But EU sources say senior commission officials are stalling the draft plan, which has been ready for months and was supposed to have been published last year. Staff were offered no explanations for the delay but an official said it was linked to the British referendum. “Brexit is mentioned all the time, as you can imagine,” one official told the Guardian. Hostile UK tabloid campaigns were “part and parcel of doing European policy in this area”, the official added. Industry sources say they also understand that the plan has become “stuck at cabinet level” within the commission because of fears of UK tabloid attacks. “I think it has to do with broader political context and the referendum in Britain,” said Sylvie Feindt, the director of Digital Europe, which represents companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft in Brussels. “The ecodesign regulations have been disputed and the commission has had bad press, and maybe they are particularly sensitive about this.” But this did not prevent negative press last week after the Ukip MEP David Coburn mistakenly tweeted that existing regulations had weakened his toaster. Coburn alleged that it had taken his machine four attempts to satisfactorily grill bread on which to spread his marmalade. “They’ve turned [the toasters] all down, and that’s why you can’t get decent toast,” he claimed to Buzzfeed.  Claude Turmes, a Green MEP who helped negotiate the original efficiency package, said the fear of bad headlines had stalled the measures. “I understand that behind the decision to delay this legislation lies in Brexit and newspaper populism of the kind we saw with the toaster story,” he said. Ecodesign measures are one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions and have been strongly supported by successive UK governments, including David Cameron’s, Turmes added. The plan could force companies to improve the durability, repairability, upgradability and recyclability of their products. The coolproducts website says ecodesign legislation on lightbulbs, boilers and standby functions could save European consumers €79bn a year by 2020, an average of €350 (£275) per household."
"The relentless flow of refugees from the Middle East into Europe continues to raise tensions across the region. This weekend, fires ignited at a refugee camp in Calais, France, and countries are beginning to tighten their borders as more than 1 million people have streamed into Europe in the past year. The 1 million refugees represent just a portion of the 4.2 million that have fled Syria in all directions. And that’s on top of the 7.6 million people internally displaced in Syria who are trapped in limbo in their home country.  War has been the direct driver of the refugee flux and behind that is a complex mix of social and political factors both inside and outside the region. One fiercely studied and debated driver has been a recent dip into a series of severe droughts starting in the late 1990s. Previous work has prescribed some of the drought — and its impact on the socioeconomic fabric in the Middle East — to climate change. New findings published in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres put it in even starker context, showing that the drought is likely the worst to affect the region in 900 years. The Mediterranean as a whole has been subject to widespread drought at various points in the past 20 years. Climate models project that the region is likely to get drier in the future, which Ben Cook, a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said drove the new line of inquiry. “These recent drought events have motivated a lot of concern that this could be an indication of climate change, with the eastern Mediterranean and Syrian droughts being the most obvious,” Cook said. Using tree ring data that covered 900 years of drought history, Cook led a team of researchers to look at drought across different regions in the Mediterranean. Dry spells in parts of the western Mediterranean have been severe but still within the range of natural variability over that 900-year span. What stands out is the drought in the eastern Mediterranean, which includes war-torn Syria. Drought has had a firm grip on the region since 1998 and Cook’s findings show that the recent bone-dry spell is likely the driest period on record in 900 years and almost certainly the worst drought in 500 years. In either case, it’s well outside the norm of natural variability indicating that a climate change signal is likely emerging in the region. “This is a really important study that increases our understanding of low frequency (decadal to multidecadal) natural variability over the past 900 years and provides strong evidence that the severity of the recent drying in the eastern Mediterranean/Levant is human induced,” Colin Kelley, a drought expert who authored previous research on the region, said. Kelley’s work published last year showed that the influence of human greenhouse gas emissions had made recent drought in the region three times more likely. The new research puts that in historical context to show just how outside the norm the recent dry stretch has been. “What we’re seeing is a convergence of evidence of the climate change impacts in the region,” Cook said. The projections for the region show a continued drying trend throughout the coming century as climate change contributes to a shift in circulation patterns. That means what’s happening there now could just be the start of more prolonged, more severe drought. In a region already wracked by water scarcity and conflict, more drying could ratchet up tension even further. “This evidence also strongly implies that expected future drying will further stress resource availability and the lives of people in this region,” Kelley said."
"A financial institution set up by government to accelerate Britain’s green power revolution could end up being sold to private equity firms and fund windfarms in Germany. The Green Investment Bank (GIB), hailed as a world first for the UK when it was set up, is expected to bring in more than £4bn for the Treasury when it is privatised, probably by the end of this year. But it may be snapped up by foreign buyers and already has plans to expand significantly overseas. Announcing the sell-off at the lord mayor’s dinner in Mansion House, London, on Wednesday night, the business secretary, said a special share structure would ensure the company’s green mission continued. “The Green Investment Bank was a world first, and it is a sign of its success that the idea is being copied across the world. Having proven the business model works, we now want to make an even greater impact,” Sajid Javid said. “The challenge presented by climate change is clear – it is imperative we mobilise more funding for green energy projects. The special share structure protects the bank’s green mission meaning the Green Investment Bank will continue to do exactly what it says on the tin.” But critics question whether this can be guaranteed and warn that the bank could now switch to funding more lucrative schemes abroad. Shaun Kingsbury, the GIB’s chief executive, said he had received expressions of interest from private equity investors, sovereign wealth funds and large foreign investment banks. He added that the bank wanted to borrow money, rather than just use public funds, and to expand overseas and admitted it could in future be funding windfarms in Germany and Holland or even renewable power projects in India. Labour’s energy and climate spokeswoman criticised the sell-off plan. “Selling off the Green Investment Bank without protecting its green mandate is a reckless act that could jeopardise the crucial private investment in new clean power stations that we urgently need to power Britain,” Lisa Nandy said. “The sale should be stopped unless the bank’s special status is protected.” Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace, added: “A Green Investment Bank that is privatised needs to have its green credentials written in stone. If it becomes just another bank with a good corporate and social responsibility officer, then it ceases to drive extra private capital investment into the green energy sector and becomes just another private sector competitor for green projects. That’s no way to support green schemes and get clean energy money into the UK, just when we are crying out for delivery on infrastructure investment.” Lord Smith of Kelvin, chairman of the bank, said attracting new investors was vital if the bank was to fund its ambitious plans to double the size of its business, and expand into new parts of the UK green economy. Currently the lending group is focused on British low carbon projects, although it is involved in £200m international joint venture with the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Kingsbury dismissed fears that the bank would change its focus to “easier” projects, saying it has established a strong track record of “being green and profitable” that it wanted to capitalise on.  “I am confident that the sale process will provide GIB with good new owners who will support GIB’s continued growth and leadership role in the global green economy long into the future,” he said. The government plans to sell between 75% and 100% sale of the GIB , which was set up in 2012 to provide lending to green projects that would otherwise find it hard to secure finance. Since then it has invested in 66 infrastructure projects and seven funds. The GIB says it has directly committed £2.6bn to the UK’s green economy as part of wider transactions worth £10.6bn. Among the projects it has invested in are the Galloper windfarm off the coast of Suffolk, the Wick district heating network in the north of Scotland plus an energy from waste plant in Belfast. After the Paris climate change agreement was signed late last year, a report by the environmental audit committee recommended the British state keep a minority stake to ensure the bank’s objectives as well as its long-term strength.  Privatisation could compromise the bank’s green credentials, as well as encouraging it to fund easier and more immediately commercial projects rather than innovative, more complex ones, warned the committee.  The bank, which has 129 staff at its Edinburgh and London offices, said was producing an expected internal rate of return of more than 10%. “The business has strong and stable projected cash flow generation and costs are below or in line with industry benchmarks for a business of this kind.”"
"Australia’s biggest climate polluters increased their emissions in the year to July 2015, according to the latest data from Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator. Some of those companies have themselves called for stronger government policy to curb emissions, including calls from AGL for the government to mandate that the oldest or dirtiest coal-fired power stations should be shut.  In figures released last week, the  regulator reported 322m tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions were directly produced by Australia’s big emitters and energy producers, a 3.2% jump from the previous year. Indirect emissions – mostly those produced from electricity bought by those companies – also rose in the period. The Australian Conservation Foundation has compiled a report, Australia’s 10 Biggest Climate Polluters, by combining direct and indirect emissions for each company. It shows that all but three of the top 10 polluters increased their emissions in the latest period. AGL, which topped the list this year, more than doubled its emissions compared with the previous year, a result of purchasing coal-fired power stations in New South Wales as part of the acquisition of Macquarie Generation.  AGL has repeatedly called for the government to manage a transition away from coal by mandating the shutting of the dirtiest power stations, which would be likely to include some of theirs. AGL’s chief executive, Andrew Vesey, recently told Guardian Australia the company needed “to be out of the CO2 emissions business”. “The federal government says it is meeting its climate targets, but there is clearly something wrong with those targets if they can be met while pollution is rising,” said Geoff Cousins, president of ACF. “If you listen to the federal government you’d be forgiven for thinking Australia’s pollution levels were decreasing, when in fact Australia’s pollution increased by 1.3% in 2014-15 – that’s 7,200,000 additional tonnes of planet-warming pollution pumped into our skies in just one year,” he said. “ACF urges the federal government to close Australia’s coal-fired power stations in phases, starting with the dirtiest plants, help affected communities with the transition and draw up comprehensive plans to clean up and rehabilitate old mine sites and power stations.” Labor’s environment spokesman, Mark Butler, said the government had failed to take effective action on emissions. “This government has proven to be incapable of reducing emissions and taking any meaningful action on climate change,” a spokeswoman for Butler said.  A spokesman for the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the government was on track to beat its 2020 target by 28m tonnes.  The government’s 2020 target is 5% below 2000 levels, which its own Climate Change Authority has described as “not credible” and not in line with what the science says is required to keep temperatures below 2C of warming.  Australia has pledged to the United Nations to reduce emissions by between 5% and 25% by 2020. A 5% cut is what it said it would do if the rest of the world did nothing. Australia is also meeting the minimum goal via accounting rules and most forecasts show its emissions will rise by 2020. “Australia’s electricity sector is undergoing a significant transition with increased renewables and lower emissions, Hunt’s spokesman said. “Renewable energy under the Renewable Energy Target will double to 23.5% between over the next five years. “By 2022, based on announcements already made, Australia’s coal generation capacity is projected to be 19% below 2010 levels,” the spokesman said.  The emissions figures reported by the regulator include those from companies that produce more than a certain amount of emissions, or more than a certain amount of energy. They cover about 60% of Australia’s emissions, but do not include those from agriculture, residential property or private vehicles.  A report from the Wilderness Society has revealed that a land-clearing surge in Queensland is set to create more carbon dioxide emissions in just three years, equivalent to those the federal government claims it is avoiding by paying other farmers more than $670m to stop cutting down trees."

"Coral reefs are having their growth stunted by ocean acidification caused by global warming, new research has confirmed.  For the first time, scientists conducted an experiment on a natural coral reef which involved altering sea water chemistry to mimic the effect of excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.   The results provide strong evidence that ocean acidification linked to greenhouse gas emissions is already slowing coral reef growth, the team claims.  Without “deep cuts” in greenhouse gas emissions, the world’s coral reefs may not survive into the next century, scientists say.  Carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean where it reacts with seawater to increase acidity.  If the water becomes too acid it dissolves away the calcium carbonate corals that molluscs and creatures such as crabs and lobsters need to build their shells and stony skeletons.  Although previous studies have demonstrated large scale declines in coral reefs in recent decades, the reason for the trend has been harder to pinpoint.  Acidification is one possible cause, but others include warming, pollution and over-fishing.  To investigate the role played by greenhouse gas emissions, the US scientists manipulated the acidity of seawater flowing over a section of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia’s One Tree Island.  Bringing the reef’s pH value – a measurement of acidity or alkalinity – closer to what it would have been in pre-industrial times increased the rate at which calcium carbonate was deposited to grow hard coral exoskeletons.  Lead researcher, Dr Rebecca Albright, from the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC, said: “Our work provides the first strong evidence from experiments on a natural ecosystem that ocean acidification is already slowing coral reef growth.  “Ocean acidification is already taking its toll on coral reef communities. This is no longer a fear for the future; it is the reality of today.” The research is reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature.  Other work by Carnegie colleague Professor Ken Caldeira found that rates of reef calcification in 2008 and 2009 were 40% lower than they were in 1975 and 1976.  He said: “The only real, lasting way to protect coral reefs is to make deep cuts in our carbon dioxide emissions.  “If we don’t take action on this issue very rapidly, coral reefs - and everything that depends on them, including both wildlife and local communities – will not survive into the next century.”"

"Gas will have a severely limited role to play in the UK’s energy mix in the next two decades without the development of technology to capture and store carbon dioxide, a new report has found. The government has been proposing an expansion of gas use as a “bridging” technology that emits less carbon than coal, which ministers have said will be phased out as a power generation source by 2025.   But, according to a study published on Tuesday by the respected UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), the scope for gas without carbon capture and storage (CCS) is “very limited”. “If we are using the bridge analogy, then we are already some way across the bridge,” said Mike Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School. George Osborne, the chancellor, controversially cancelled the long-running £1bn government-sponsored competition to develop a demonstration plant for CCS last November. The move was a blow to plans to make the UK a pioneer in the fledgling technology, which has yet to be demonstrated at commercial scale. Without CCS, the UK will only be able to use 10% more gas in 2050 than it did in 2010, according to the UKERC study, if legally binding climate change targets are to be met. That will be a severe limitation to companies wishing to generate power from gas in the long term, and it poses a conundrum for the UK’s domestic heating, for which gas is the primary fuel. Few other sources of domestic heating have yet been explored, with renewable heating such as biomass boilers and heat pumps accounting for a tiny proportion of UK homes. Prof Bradshaw said that shale gas from the UK could still be used, but that this would depend on such gas production being proved commercially viable “and we are a long way from that”. He said that a new “dash for gas” to replace coal could provide “some short term gains” in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but he cautioned that this might not be cost-effective. “It is in fact a really dangerous assumption.” He said: “If all coal-fired power generation is to be removed by 2025, and we are no longer supporting the development of CCS, policy makers must think carefully about how best to replace that capacity. Gas can play only a modest role between now and 2020 and in the medium to long term has no role as a bridging fuel because the UK has already exploited a large amount of the decarbonisation potential in the power sector.” Prof Jim Watson, director of UKERC, noted that electricity generators were not building new gas-fired power stations, despite having planning permission to do so. He said this was a reflection of current policy and economics.  The likely future limitations to gas use for electricity generation, which UKERC has uncovered, are likely to prove a further deterrent to companies wishing to build such generation, unless government policies are amended. The government has slashed support for renewable energy since coming to power last May, as well as abruptly ending the CCS plans, while strongly backing shale gas exploration. Amber Rudd, energy and climate change secretary, told a meeting of the all-party parliamentary environment group last week that “new technological breakthroughs” were required to tackle emissions and avoid dangerous climate change, but she insisted that CCS was currently too expensive for the government to support. Watson said it was possible that the government was hoping CCS would be developed in another country, and the UK could then adopt the technology, but said this was “problematic” because the UK had previously been a pioneer in attempting to develop CCS. He said the UK’s climate change targets were “doable, but the policies have to be in place to get there”. Tony Bosworth, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “This report shows gas is not a long term solution to our energy problems. Building more gas-fired power stations, as the government wants, risks locking us into a high carbon future, making it harder to tackle climate change. The real answer to our energy problems is investing more in renewable power and improving energy efficiency.”"
"China’s coal consumption fell for the second year in a row, government data showed Monday, as the world’s biggest polluter attempts to tackle chronic pollution that accompanied economic growth. Coal use fell 3.7% last year compared to 2014 levels, according to a report from China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The drop follows a 2.9% decrease in 2014.  China’s rise to the world’s second largest economy was largely powered by cheap, dirty coal. As growth slows, the country has had a difficult time weaning itself off the fuel, even as the pollution it causes wreaks havoc on the environment and public health. China’s consumption of the fuel doubled in the decade to 2014, reaching more than four billion tonnes a year. Monday’s figures did not give an absolute total. It emerged in November that China had been under-reporting its consumption for years, after a different set of statistics were revised, with the figure for 2012 alone going up 17%, or 600 million tonnes.  There are widespread doubts over the accuracy of official statistics in China, which critics say can be subject to political manipulation. Coal fell to 64% of the country’s energy sources last year, Monday’s NBS report said, down from 66% in 2014. Observers reacted to the declines with tempered optimism. “These statistics show that China is on track to far surpass its Paris climate targets, which is great news for everyone,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior global campaigner on coal for Greenpeace. “However, the trend is not moving as fast as it could.” The government plans to lay off about 1.8 million workers in the steel and coal industries, a human resources and social security ministry official said at a press briefing on Monday. Both sectors have long been plagued by overcapacity. China’s President Xi Jinping has said that the country’s CO2 emissions, to which coal is a major contributor, will peak “around 2030”, as pledged in Paris last December. The State Council, China’s cabinet, has also announced plans to reduce by 60% the amount of “major pollutants” coming from its coal-fired power plants by 2020. Despite the decrease in coal use, many Chinese cities are often blanketed with toxic smog, much of it the result of using the fuel in industries like power generation and steel.  Nearly 300 Chinese cities failed to meet national standards for air quality last year, according to a Greenpeace report.  The green group said that in 2015 generating capacity grew by a “stunning” 34% for wind power and 74% for solar power."
"As humans emit heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, it’s causing the Earth to warm. It’s also causing the ocean waters to rise. In fact, water rise is one of the clearest signatures of a warming world. The questions we want to answer are, how much will sea levels rise, and how fast?  The answers to this have large implications on what societies should do. It isn’t just coastal communities that will be affected. While there are approximately 150 million people worldwide that live within 3 feet of today’s water levels, because of the interconnected economies and societies, ocean rise will affect us all. The prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recently published a series of sea level rise papers. One paper covers the Antarctic ice sheet, and the authors look back in time at the world’ largest ice sheet. The authors use three tools to advance our knowledge of the ice. First, they use a very accurate calculation approach to quantify how the ice sheet interacts with the atmosphere. Second, they incorporate potential ice fractures into their analysis. Finally, they use information about changes to oxygen isotopes to improve their calculations. What they find is that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide will soon be at levels not encountered since the Miocene period (23 million to 5 million years ago). They also find that newer computer calculations do a better job of quantifying changes to the ice sheet. A second paper published by Roelof Rietbroek and colleagues looked at the sources of sea level rise. They wanted to know how much of the current rise is from water that is warming and expanding, how much is from melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, how much is from melting glaciers, how much is from shifting continents, etc.  This study measured the mass of water in various regions of the Earth through special gravity-sensitive satellites that orbit the Earth. They conclude that the sea level rise from thermal expansion is higher than previously reported. The also find the water rise from melting of ice is consistent with measurements taken of ice melt around the world. Finally, they find that while the global oceans are rising steadily, there is tremendous regional variation so that some areas have very fast ocean water rise while others have slow ocean rise (or even ocean drop).  The third paper by Robert Kopp and his colleagues uses statistics to find the relationship between temperature and sea level for the Common Era. They find that the sea level rise accelerated in the early 19th century and the rate of water rise in the last century is likely higher than it has been in 2,700 years. Their findings were in good agreement with those of the most recent IPCC report. The final part of the foursome was authored by Matthias Mengel and his colleagues. That study uses historical information on sea level and climate change projections to make predictions about where ocean levels will be in the next 100 years or so. This study tries to separate how much sea level will rise because of various contributors, such as thermal expansion, melting mountain glaciers, the Greenland ice sheet, and the Antarctic ice sheet.  When projecting into the future, the authors have to make decisions about how much more heat-trapping gases will be emitted into the atmosphere. To make the projections, the authors use the IPCC scenarios (RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5). A comparison between the new paper and the IPCC projections show excellent agreement.  It appears that, unless societies make significant changes, we will see approximately 3 feet of sea level rise by 2100. That may not sound like a lot, but it’s enough to cause enormous economic and societal problems. What’s great about this paper is they also include a discussion on the limitations of their work. For instance, they state that their method cannot deal with processes that are independent of the warming rate (such as a sudden collapse of an ice sheet).  I wrote to the lead author to get his summary of the study and learn more about its importance. He told me,  Human influence on climate pushed the world’s oceans, glaciers and ice sheets away from their equilibrium so that they now all contribute to rising seas. As they are inert, a lot of their contribution will only be realized in the future. There is knowledge on how much they will add to sea level before they reach a new equilibrium, a process that can take thousands of years. We now combined this knowledge on long-term sea level rise with past observations into a small and efficient model. This allows us to make probabilistic projections of sea level rise incorporating the main uncertainties.  While stopping sea level rise within this century is unlikely, our projections confirm that the world can still choose from a spectrum of sea level futures. It mainly depends on how much heat-trapping gases will be emitted. To avoid the risk of 1.3 meter higher seas in 2100, mankind needs to cut its carbon emissions.  As we saw in my last post, the actual costs to human society will depend not only on the rate and amount of seal level rise, but on how we humans adapt to this new reality."
"We all know about the various organizations that fund or support the climate-change denial industry. Perhaps the best known is the Heartland Institute, which actually puts on climate “conferences” and publishes materials that appear at first glance to be scientifically sound. We who work and follow the climate change science and public discussions know enough to be skeptical about anything produced by groups like the Heartland Institute – their veneer of scientific credibility is very thin.  On the other hand, perhaps the intended audience isn’t scientists are even people who closely follow the science. Perhaps their intended audience is legislators, teachers, and others who have influence over society?  With this as a backdrop, I received a copy of a humorous report from an elected official in the USA. The report was entitled “Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming,” published by Heartland. Since elected officials have too much going on to do a thorough debunking, I looked into this report to see what substance was there. As a scientist, when I read any manuscript I ask a number of questions. Who wrote it and what is their expertise in the field? When statements and conclusions are made, what is the evidence? How do these conclusions fit into prior work in the field? Is the new study confirming prior work or in conflict with it? If there is conflict, why? The authors of this manuscript are Craig Idso, the late Robert Carter, and Fred Singer. These three are not exactly (or even nearly) a trio of reputable climate scientists. According to a literature search performed using the search engine SCOPUS, neither Idso nor Singer published a credible paper on global climate change or its implications in years. One way to measure the authors’ impact is by counting how many people have read and cited their work. For both of these authors, the number of people who have cited them is shockingly low. To put their impact in perspective, a scientist like Kevin Trenberth receives three times more citations each year than the combined citations of Singer and Idso in their entire careers. So, having these guys be lead author on a climate change document is a bit like hiring retired scientists or op-ed writers to do your research.  But just because they are not active and reputable scientists, could they be correct? Sure, they could be. So let’s look at the content. The central theme of this manuscript is an attack against the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. The consensus refers to the very strong and repeatable measure of what scientists think about climate change. What do the best scientists say? It turns out multiple groups have measured the consensus. The measurements have been done many different ways, all leading to the same conclusion – the consensus is strong. Not only is the consensus strong, contrarian scientists are less talented than those in the consensus. They publish less on the subject, and peer review has found the work of most high-profile contrarians to be faulty. So, on the one hand, you have approximately 97% of the best scientists in agreement, and on the other hand, you have about 3% of the less-talented scientists in dissent. Dr. Naomi Oreskes conducted the first major study that looked at consensus more than a decade ago. Dr. Oreskes examined the abstracts of hundreds of papers and found that they strongly confirmed the human influence on climate. In fact, she found no papers that dissented. The Heartland publication falsely calls Dr. Oreskes a “non-scientist.” In fact her scientific impact measured by citations is approximately four times that of the combination of Idso and Singer. Instead, they try to refute her with references to think-tank non-reviewed publications and websites. Peter Doran and Margaret Zimmerman performed the second major consensus study in 2009. This was the first peer-reviewed study that quantified that 97% agreement among climate scientists. The authors accessed a large database of Earth scientists and created a secure polling system to ask about their level of agreement.  The authors broke the scientists into groups based on whether climate change was their field of study and whether they published a majority of their papers in that field. Approximately 10% of the respondents were in the most expert category. There were a series of questions for the respondents and a very strong consensus that temperatures had increased and humans were the cause. The Heartland Institute falsely claimed that the survey was only two questions, and their sole reference used to rebut the paper was an article in the National Post. William Anderegg and his colleagues completed the third major measure of consensus in 2010. They created a database of the most prominent climate scientists by searching the scientific literature for papers and citations. They found that only 2% of the experts were unconvinced on the extent of human impact. Importantly, the contrarian scientists were found to publish less and publish less impactful studies – simply put, the best scientists agreed.  How does the Heartland document counter this study? They claimed that the mainstream scientists are “hyper productive.” They even accuse these scientists by saying “It is unlikely these scientists actually participated in most of the experiments or research contain in the articles bearing their name.” Next, they point out that the contrarians tend to be older and retired. I wouldn’t disagree with either of their conclusions. The 97% of scientists that agree are more productive and younger than those who disagree. The references that the Heartland uses to support its conclusions are from its own website, from the Wall Street Journal, and other non-scientific outlets. Not very convincing.  The Heartland document finally attacks the 2013 study by John Cook and colleagues of the scientific literature. The authors examined over 12,000 abstracts and found that among those taking a position, less than 3% rejected or minimized human-induced climate change. Among the abstracts that gave a position, 97% were in agreement. Just like before, in response to this the Heartland document cites no peer-reviewed scientific sources — just think-tank literature, websites, and blog posts. What was surprising was that the Heartland report actually cited a consensus in favor of their viewpoint. The article “Scientists’ Views about Attribution of Global Warming” was published in 2014. The authors found a strong correlation of expertise with recognition that humans are a cause of climate change. For instance, for scientists who have published more than 10 papers on the topic, there is a 90% consensus that human influences dominate.  I could go on, but you get the point. What we see is that it doesn’t matter how you measure the consensus. Whether you ask the scientists, whether you read the papers, or whether you trawl the literature in other ways. The results are reinforcing, which why we know there is such a strong consensus. While I won’t spend too much time on the scientifically incorrect or misleading statements in the Heartland report, I will mention a few. In chapter 4, they claim that a doubling of carbon dioxide would result in approximately 1°C warming. They neglected to remind the readers that we have nearly already reached that and we are nowhere near doubling of carbon dioxide yet. The report claims that meteorological observations are consistent with a climate sensitivity of 1°C but they provide no support for this assertion and in fact, the research does not support this.  The report falsely claims that climate models assume all the warming since the industrial revolution is from carbon dioxide. Climate models include many factors in addition to carbon dioxide. The report also falsely claims that models do not attempt to simulate internal climate oscillations. They claim that thawing of permafrost is not likely to emit dangerous methane, which will add to the warming, but they give no evidence to support their claim.  This is what happens when you have a fossil fuel-funded political organization parade a document as a scientific publication. You get nonsense and non-science. This is why we should be skeptical of anything published by an advocacy organization such as Heartland. Fortunately, we are used to their nonsense."

"A deadly algal bloom has hit the world’s second biggest salmon exporter, Chile, where nearly 23 million fish have already died and the economic impact from lost production has soared to $800m (£565m), industry and government sources told Reuters.  The dead fish could easily fill 14 Olympic-sized swimming pools, said Jose Miguel Burgos, the head of the government’s Sernapesca fisheries body.   Unusually high ocean temperatures, due in large part to the El Niño weather phenomenon, have fuelled the algal bloom that has affected 37 of the nearly 415 salmon farms operating in southern Chile. Most of the farms are in ocean enclosures or estuaries.  “Temperatures are 2 to 4C above average for this time of the year, there’s a lot of sunlight, a lack of rain and very mild winds, all of which are conditions for the micro algae to appear,” said Burgos.  El Niño leads to hotter sea temperatures in the west Pacific Ocean, which means more rain falls on South America and less in Australia and south-east Asia. But for Liesbeth van der Meer, who heads the Oceana environmental group in Chile, run-off from neighbouring livestock creates concentrations of nitrogen that when mixed with the above-normal temperatures, create the ideal scenario for the algae to grow.  Salmon farms near the southern city of Puerto Montt and the Chiloé island have borne the brunt of the toxic algal bloom.  Producers Marine Harvest, Australis Seafoods, Compania Pesquera Camanchaca, Blumar, Multiexport Foods, Cermaq Group AS and Empresas AquaChile have all seen some of their salmon farms affected, according to data provided by the Economy Ministry and company filings with Chile’s SVS securities regulator.  “The loss is likely equivalent to somewhere between 15 and 20% of Chile’s total production for the year ... the forecast for 2016 was around 750,000 to 760,000 tonnes but now that’s reduced to around 650,000 tonnes,” said Burgos.  The 100,000 tonnes in lost production, which includes Atlantic salmon, Coho and trout, is equivalent to some $800m in exports, he added.  Chile, the second largest salmon producer after Norway, last year exported $4.5bn of farmed salmon, on 800,000 tonnes of shipments.  Additionally, the situation will likely lead to job losses in the sector, according to industry group SalmonChile.  Cutting their losses, producers convert fish that can be saved into fishmeal, while the fish killed by the algal bloom are not destined for human consumption, the group added.  The latest blow to the local industry comes as Chile’s salmon farmers are using record levels of antibiotics to treat a virulent and pervasive bacteria, driving away some US retailers."
"Climate change will leave swaths of sub-Saharan Africa unable to produce staple crops such as maize, bananas and beans by the end of the century, according to a report that calls for an urgent transformation of the region’s agriculture. The study, led by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), says that rising temperatures and droughts will force “significant areas” to find alternative crops, improve irrigation systems or even abandon crop-based agriculture completely by the year 2100.   The authors warn that time is running out and say delays in taking the necessary adaptive steps now will further jeopardise food security and undermine the fight against poverty. Their report, published in Nature Climate Change, examines the likely impact that climate change will have on the nine crops that make up half of the food produced in the region: bananas; cassava; beans; groundnuts; maize; sorghum; yams; pearl millet and finger millet.  Although six of the crops are expected to remain stable despite moderate and extreme changes, up to 60% of bean-producing areas – and up to 30% of those growing maize and bananas – are projected to become unviable by the close of this century. Failure to switch to beans that can cope better with heat stress could prove particularly devastating: the report predicts that 1.85m hectares (4.6m acres) of bean-cropping systems in Uganda and Tanzania – which between them produce 41% of sub-Saharan Africa’s beans – will be unable to do so by 2100. West Africa’s banana-growing countries, such as Togo, Ghana and Benin, and maize-growing areas in southern Africa – Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique among them – will also need to undergo transformation within the next 10 years before the land becomes unsuitable. The report’s lead author, Julián Ramírez-Villegas, said the loss of bean-producing areas would have drastic consequences as beans, known as “the meat of the poor”, are a vital source of protein for many people in the region. “Although exact figures will be difficult to determine at this point, in a scenario where we take no action, you are talking of Ugandans – and more broadly also east Africans – having less available protein,” he said. “This would likely increase stunting rates and undernourishment.” Among the solutions the report proposes are: improving agronomy, irrigation options and agro-climatic services for farmers; breeding crops that are more resistant to heat and drought; switching to more resilient crops such as millet and sorghum; and, where necessary, moving from crops to livestock. The authors point to the success of intercropping banana with coffee, which has been found to raise incomes by 50% and build resilience in Uganda, and to the SMS and radio broadcasts offering climate information to more than 7 million rural people in Senegal. They also note that during the drought of 2005-06, many Kenyan pastoralists switched from cattle to camels as the latter need less water, feed on arid shrubs and produce six times more milk than indigenous cows. While the experts concede that adjusting the agricultural development and food security policies of different nations is a slow and complicated business, they warn that delays will carry a high human and economic cost. “Agriculture and farming are critical not only for the livelihoods of farmers but also more broadly for the diets of the region’s population,” said Ramírez-Villegas. “Unless timely adaptation actions are taken, we’re looking at a bleak picture in terms of food security and poverty throughout many areas of sub-Saharan Africa.”"
"Climate scientists have bad news for governments, energy companies, motorists, passengers and citizens everywhere in the world: to contain global warming to the limits agreed by 195 nations in Paris last December, they will have to cut fossil fuel combustion at an even faster rate than anybody had predicted. Joeri Rogelj, research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, and European and Canadian colleagues propose in Nature Climate Change that all previous estimates of the quantities of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere before the thermometer rises to potentially catastrophic levels are too generous.  Instead of a range of permissible emissions estimates that ranged up to 2,390 bn tons from 2015 onwards, the very most humans could release would be 1,240 bn tons. Available levels In effect, that halves the levels of diesel and petrol available for petrol tanks, coal for power stations, and natural gas for central heating and cooking available to humankind before the global average temperature – already 1C higher than it was at the start of the Industrial Revolution – reaches the notional 2C mark long agreed internationally as being the point of no return for the planet. In fact, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change summit in Paris agreed a target “well below” 2C, in recognition of ominous projections − one of which was that, at such planetary temperatures, sea levels would rise high enough to submerge several small island states. The Nature Climate Change paper is a restatement of a problem that has been clear for decades. Carbon dioxide proportions in the atmosphere are linked to planetary surface temperatures and, as they rise, so does average temperature. For most of human history, these proportions oscillated around 280 parts per million. The global exploitation, on a massive scale, of fossil fuels drove the expansion of agriculture, the growth of economies, a sevenfold growth in human population, a sea level rise of 14cms, and a temperature rise of, so far, 1C. To stop temperatures increasing another 3C or more and sea levels rising by more than a metre, humans have to reduce fossil fuel emissions. By how much these must be reduced is difficult to calculate.  The global carbon budget is really the balance between what animals emit – in this context, the word animals includes humans with cars and aeroplanes and factories – and what plants and algae can absorb. So the calculations are bedevilled by uncertainties about forests, grasslands and oceans. To make things simpler, climate scientists translate the target into the billions of tons of carbon dioxide that, ideally, may be released into the atmosphere from 2015 onwards. Even these, however, are estimates. There is general agreement that a limit of 590 bn tons would safely keep the world from overheating in ways that would impose ever greater strains on human society. The argument is about the upper limit of such estimates. Dr Rogelj says: “In order to have a reasonable chance of keeping global warming below 2C, we can only emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide, ever. That’s our carbon budget. “This has been understood for about a decade, and the physics behind this concept are well understood, but many different factors can lead to carbon budgets that are either slightly smaller or slightly larger. We wanted to understand these differences, and to provide clarity on the issue for policymakers and the public. “This study shows that, in some cases, we have been overestimating the budget by 50 to more than 200%. At the high end, this is a difference of more than 1,000 billion tons of carbon dioxide.” The same study takes a closer look at why estimates of the “safe” level of emissions have varied so widely. One complicating factor has been, of course, uncertainty about what humans might do, and another has been about the other more transient greenhouse gases, such as methane and the oxides of nitrogen. Although short-lived and released in smaller quantities, some of these are potentially far more potent than carbon dioxide as an influence on planetary temperatures. Complex calculations But Dr Rogelj and his colleagues found that a significant cause of variation was simply a consequence of the different assumptions and methodologies inherent in such complex calculations. So the researchers have re-examined both the options and the approaches, and have worked out a global figure that, they suggest, could be relevant to “real-world policy”. It takes into account the consequences of all human activity, and it embraces detailed outlines of possible low-carbon choices. It also offers, they say, a 66% chance of staying within the internationally-agreed limit. “We now better understand the carbon budget for keeping global warming below 2C,” Dr Rogelj says. “This carbon budget is very important to know because it defines how much carbon dioxide we are allowed to release into the atmosphere, ever. “We have figured out that this budget is at the low end of what studies indicated before, and if we don’t start reducing our emissions immediately, we will blow it in a few decades.” "

"Ed Miliband has assembled a group of cross-party MPs and campaigners to demand parliament enacts a law to to make the carbon emissions target agreed at the Paris climate talks legally binding. The former Labour leader – alongside Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, Green MP Caroline Lucas and two Conservative MPs – has called for legislation that would significantly extend the present UK target of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050.  His intervention follows December’s Paris summit, where global leaders accepted that the world must achieve net zero emissions in the second half of the century, as recommended by scientists. However, there is growing disquiet that even Paris’s limited aims are not being met. Last week, the Guardian revealed that the EU is expected to emit 2bn tonnes more CO2 than it promised at the Paris climate talks, threatening the agreement to cap global warming at 2C.  In a letter published by the Guardian, Miliband calls for the British government to take the lead by drawing up plans for a new law, with an implementation date set by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), an independent body which advises the UK government and was established under the Climate Change Act 2008.  As well as Farron and Lucas, he is also supported by Tory MPs Dan Poulter and Graham Stuart, as well as the NGOs Christian Aid, ClientEarth, ShareAction, Sandbag and WWF.   In his letter, Miliband states: “The UK government deserves significant credit for having helped deliver the Paris agreement. Now we urge it to follow up its high ambition internationally, with high ambition here at home.  “Specifically, it can build on the momentum from Paris by supporting the idea of enshrining net zero emissions in UK domestic law, with the date to be advised by the independent Committee on Climate Change.  “Just as the 2008 UK Climate Change Act, prompted by business and civil society, and passed with all-party support, sent a signal to the world, so we would do so again.” Before Christmas, Miliband said that having stood down as Labour leader after the election in May, he had decided throw his energy behind building a “high-ambition coalition” of UK businesses, trade unions and civic society to challenge the government’s “backward” environmental policies. “This is the thing my kids will judge me on,” he told the Guardian at the time. “Did you do something about this? Were you the last generation not to get it or the first generation to get it? I think that is in the balance now.” EU leaders are expected to discuss the possibility of raising Europe’s 2030 target at a summit between 17-18 March. But powerful figures in the European commission will try to ensure this happens through a revision of the bloc’s carbon market rules in 2023. The EU’s climate chief, Miguel Arias Cañete, has already signalled he would like Europe to ratify the Paris climate agreement at a conference in New York on 22 April. A 2C rise in global temperatures could have consequences including the migration of 20% of the world’s population from cities flooded by sea level rise, such as New York, London and Cairo, according to a study published last month. This summer, the government’s statutory climate advisers warned that the UK’s existing carbon budgets could be missed. The group’s chairman, for Tory minister Lord Gummer, took the unusual step of singling out Conservative policy changes such as scrapping a target for all new homes to be zero carbon."

"The UK is a global leader in international development. Our work fighting poverty, disease, climate change and conflict embodies British values, and is also in our national interest. We are writing not about the domestic political implications of Britain’s membership of the EU, but about the international implications. In our view, EU membership is a practical way to extend our reach and multiply our influence. Every pound of aid the UK spends through EU institutions is matched by £6 from other member states. This larger pool delivers better lives for the poorest people. It also helps tackle problems in areas where the UK has no large presence, for example in the Sahel and parts of west Africa. EU aid complements activities that other aid agencies cannot undertake, like police and security missions in fragile hotspots. Cooperation within the EU will be essential to tackling the humanitarian emergency in Syria, the migration crisis, and the wider issues of peace, security and development in the Middle East and north Africa. Beyond aid, partnership within the EU helped the UK achieve an ambitious outcome at the climate talks in Paris; and provides a platform for further work on trade, financial flows, corruption and human rights. In all these areas, the EU demonstrates the value of collective action on a global scale. Of course, there are things we want to change in the way the EU works. But British engagement raises standards and improves performance. In September last year, the UK and 192 other members of the UN signed up to the new sustainable development goals. These set the whole world, rich countries and poor, on a new path towards peace, prosperity, justice and sustainability. The values underlying the global goals are shared by the UK and embedded in EU treaties. Withdrawing from the EU would diminish the UK’s role in the world and set back our efforts to end global poverty.

"The boss of Australia’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases says his company needs to be out of the “CO2 emissions business” regardless of what they think of the science of climate change, simply to manage the financial risk.  “We’re not necessarily out of the coal business and it’s not fossil fuels because we’ll still use gas. We need to be out of the CO2 emissions business,” Andrew Vesey, the chief executive of AGL told Guardian Australia. “We’ve done a lot of thinking around this and we believe our view of the future will be restraints on carbon emissions.”  Vesey also admitted the expense of decommissioning power plants and mines and returning them to their natural state – the so-called rehabilitation cost – was a concern at the top of their “issues list”. AGL, established in 1837 as the Australian Gaslight Company, is a $12.3bn company and provides gas or electricity to 3.7 million people in eastern Australia. Before 2012, it was Australia’s biggest investor in renewable energy. Then it went on a buying spree of coal-fired power stations, making it also Australia’s biggest investor in coal power and Australia’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter. But in what appeared to be an about-face last year, less than six months after Vesey took control, AGL announced it would be not be involved with conventional coal-fired power generation after 2050 and said the company supported a target of less than 2C of global warming. “It’s nothing to do with the science – it’s irrelevant what I believe. If markets believe it, if customers believe it, if investors believe it, if government is making policy, then what I have is a significant risk in my portfolio that I have to mitigate,” Vesey told Guardian Australia this week. In practice, the announcement last year meant the company would run its coal-fired power stations through to the end of their life, including Loy Yang A, the country’s biggest-emitting generator, which produces 15m tonnes of CO2 each year. But it also meant AGL wouldn’t extend the life of those plants or invest in any others unless they had carbon capture and storage.  Critics said the move was merely window-dressing, arguing the closure of coal-fired power stations by mid century was inevitable. And it meant the country’s biggest polluter would continue running the most polluting power station until the middle of the century – something that seems at odds with a target of 2C of warming. But Vesey argued it was a significant move. “We fundamentally said we … are not going to extend the lives of the plants, which is quite a big commitment if you think about it because that’s a very low cost option. And the last thing you want to do as the manager of a company is close off options, but we did. And we said we wouldn’t finance any new plants and we wouldn’t acquire any new plants.” Critics also questioned the timeframe. “People immediately came out and said 2048 is too long,” Vesey said. But change needed to be managed carefully. “Change takes a long time but when it comes everybody is always surprised. The impacts on customers on communities and on shareholders are [more] significant the faster you do this. The quicker you want to try to do this, the more you need the intervention of government.” He said that announcement was a first move in an uncertain environment. “We did this in an environment where there was no clear policy about transition – there were no set goals.” At the time the Australian prime minister Tony Abbott had been trumpeting the importance of coal, having famously said it was “good for humanity”. “If things change, if there are other mechanisms, they could be brought forward – if there’s consensus in the policy framework,” Vesey said. “But we have been very clear about what we’re doing.” Vesey supports a price on carbon. And previously, he has said the government should simply mandate that old or dirty power plants be shut. Asked if that meant AGL would be looking for compensation for shutting plants, Vesey said he didn’t believe plants should be paid for closure. “We believe that you’ve made the investment and you take the upside of that. But if you’ve made an investment that is not right, there must be some accountability for investors.” But Vesey went on to say he’d be supportive of anything that helped develop consensus around the closure of ageing plants. He has previously been critical of an idea by Frank Jotzo from the Australian National University, where competitors would bid in a reverse auction for how much they needed to be paid by other companies to shut their plant. But Vesey now said the idea could work. “It’s not what we would have argued for,” Vesey said. “But if somebody comes up with this and it’s politically acceptable … if it’s doable and it gets capacity out of the market then we would take a very hard look at it. We won’t stand in the way of anything that does that.” But environmentalists have pointed out that shutting power plants and coalmines raises the prospect of decommissioning and rehabilitation costs that companies might not be prepared to pay for. A Credit Suisse report from January noted AGL only had $77m put aside for rehabilitating its Loy Yang power plant and associated mine, which will leave them $320m short when it closes in 2048. AGL disputes the way the way the provisioning is calculated to grow over that time, but Vesey admits that a blow-out of rehabilitation costs is at the top of their “issues list”. If mines are closed early, that could mean they need to find more money. But Vesey said he was more concerned about costs associated with stricter demands on rehabilitation in the future. “The world changes. So is there a sense that expectations in 2048 for rehab will be different than today? I’d say yes.” Since the first of AGL’s coal power plants closes in just six years and it is already beginning to deal with rehabilitation of the coal seam gas projects it’s pulling out of, Vesey said the company was confronting the issue now. “It’s becoming very real to us and we really want to take a position that is ahead of where we need to be so that we can have a conversation.” In December Vesey attended sideline talks at the Paris climate conference and shortly after announced a $3bn Powering Australian Renewables Fund (Parf).  It was met with headlines declaring AGL was going greener, but critics were quick to point out it aimed to create 1,000MW of renewable capacity, which is roughly AGL’s share of the government’s renewable energy target.  Vesey dismissed that criticism, saying that between the Parf and its other renewable ventures, “we’re going to blow the doors off the renewables target.” But to get renewables moving, Vesey argued the basic problem was the balance of supply and demand, and to fix that old coal-fired power stations needed to be shut down one way or another to lower supply. “The fact of the matter is you can’t continue to add capacity to a market that is over supplied.” If supply was lowered, wholesale prices would go up, which would make investment in new infrastructure more profitable, he said. “It’s 7,000MW oversupplied and we’re adding 5,000MW just to hit the RET target.” “Having the target, while good, is not enough. My view is that, you need to get to the fundamentals of what’s preventing private capital from moving.”"
"There’s a chart that’s become the favorite, go-to among those who distort climate science in order to justify opposition to climate policies. It’s shown up in many conservative media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and The Australian. It’s been presented by congressional Republicans’ favorite climate witness, John Christy, in recent hearings called by Ted Cruz and Lamar Smith. The chart, which tries to compare estimates of the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere to model simulations, is full of problems. Its purpose is clear – to make it appear that climate models are unreliable, and thus cast doubt on all of climate science and the tremendous risks posed by human-caused global warming. In other words, its purpose is to undermine climate policy efforts to reduce those risks by slowing global warming.   But as with all charts of such singular, unscientific purposes, it’s simply another example of cherry picked data being presented in a multiply misleading way, as the annotated version below illustrates (for an animated version, click here). To start, the observational and simulated model data are aligned at a single point at the start of the graph, in 1979. That choice serves to visually exaggerate any difference between the models and data. When doing this sort of comparison properly, climate scientists will average the data over a period called the “baseline,” usually between 10 and 30 years, so that any abnormally hot or cold single years in the data or model runs don’t throw off the alignment. In fact, there was recently a paper published by Hawkins & Sutton showing that the choice of baseline can significantly impact how accurate the models appear in this sort of comparison, and thus it’s important to carefully choose an appropriate baseline period and perhaps test the comparison with multiple different periods. Christy didn’t even use a baseline period to begin with! NASA Goddard director Gavin Schmidt did the comparison using a baseline period of 1979–1988, and as you can see, the result looks quite different. Normally, climate contrarians love to harp on uncertainties. In fact, the whole argument against implementing climate policies to slow global warming hinges upon the backwards logic that we don’t know enough to take action. However, in Christy’s chart, no uncertainty ranges are shown whatsoever. The difference this makes is clear in Schmidt’s version above, which shows the spread of individual climate model simulation runs (in grey), although doesn’t show the significant uncertainty in the observational data. When both are taken into account, the observations are consistent with the range of model projections. Christy’s graph also averages together multiple different observational data sets, which aren’t in terribly close agreement. Gavin Schmidt shows some of these in his version of the chart. Christy’s version also somehow glosses over the fact that atmospheric temperature estimates from satellites and weather balloons diverge in recent years. Another problem is that Christy doesn’t say which observational data sets he’s averaging together, but there are more than three groups that use satellite data to estimate the temperature of the atmosphere (Schmidt shows four of them in his chart). So he could be omitting some of the data that shows larger warming trends. We don’t know because this is “blog science.” The analysis hasn’t been vetted by other experts, or published in a scientific journal after being subjected to peer-review. We don’t even know if Christy is accurately representing the climate models, because they don’t produce a simple “bulk atmosphere temperature” output. As such, Christy’s chart should be taken with a grain of salt. The average elevation of the “bulk atmosphere” shown in Christy’s graph is 25,000 feet, which is just below the peak of Mount Everest, and not far below the elevation at which commercial aircraft generally fly. The temperature at such high elevations isn’t very relevant to humans. We live on the Earth’s surface, so we care about the global surface temperature. And because we live at the surface, we have an easier time measuring the temperature here, so we know average global surface temperatures with more certainty than the atmospheric temperatures that Christy focuses on.  Atmospheric temperatures are just one of the many climate changes simulated by climate models. For example, climate models have done an excellent job predicting how much temperatures at the Earth’s surface would warm (e.g. see Mann et al. 2015). They’ve also done well predicting the rate of sea level rise (e.g. see the Fifth IPCC Assessment report). Arctic sea ice is actually declining a bit faster than models predicted (e.g. see Stroeve et al. 2012). And then there’s ocean heating. Only about 1–2% of the energy imbalance causing global warming goes into warming the atmosphere, and only about 3% is used up melting ice. Over 90% of that energy goes into warming the oceans. And climate models are doing a very good job predicting the rate at which the oceans are heating up (e.g. see Cheng et al. 2015). As the statistician George Box said, “all models are wrong, but some are useful.” Climate models are certainly useful, and are doing a pretty darn good job predicting global warming. Their predictions have been far more accurate than those made by climate contrarians, who keep telling us that the Earth will start to cool any day now, as we keep breaking heat records. The only reason to focus on the temperature of the atmosphere, most of which is far above where humans actually live, which we can’t measure as accurately, and which only accounts for about 1–2% of overall global warming, is because it’s the only data that seems to indicate that climate models might not be accurate. That’s called cherry picking. And even then, to make that argument requires presenting the data in a multiply flawed, misleading way. Climate models are doing a good job because we understand basic physics. We know that as we keep increasing the greenhouse effect, more heat will be trapped, and the planet will keep warming. Ice will keep melting, sea levels will keep rising, and various bad things will happen, because we’re warming the planet much faster than it does naturally. That’s a dangerous physical reality we can’t escape just by creating cherry picked, misleading charts."

"Recently, The Guardian reported on a significant new study published in Nature Climate Change, finding that even if we meet our carbon reduction targets and stay below the 2°C global warming threshold, sea level rise will eventually inundate many major coastal cities around the world. 20% of the world’s population will eventually have to migrate away from coasts swamped by rising oceans. Cities including New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Calcutta, Jakarta and Shanghai would all be submerged.  The authors looked at past climate change events and model simulations of the future. They found a clear, strong relationship between the total amount of carbon pollution humans emit, and how far global sea levels will rise. The issue is that ice sheets melt quite slowly, but because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for a long time, the eventual melting and associated sea level rise are effectively locked in. As a result, the study authors found that due to the carbon pollution humans have emitted so far, we’ve committed the planet to an eventual sea level rise of 1.7 meters (5.5 feet). If we manage to stay within the 1 trillion ton carbon budget, which we hope will keep the planet below 2°C warming above pre-industrial levels, sea levels will nevertheless rise a total of about 9 meters (30 feet). If we continue on a fossil fuel-heavy path, we could trigger a staggering eventual 50 meters (165 feet) of sea level rise. Predicting how quickly sea levels will rise is a challenge. However, two other studies just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the Antarctic ice sheet could melt more quickly than previously thought, and thus contribute to relatively rapid sea level rise. Over the past century, global sea level has risen faster than at any time in the past two millennia, and most of the recent sea level rise is due to human-caused global warming. Several feet of sea level rise this century is likely, with a possibility of 5 feet or more. The Nature Climate Change study didn’t just look at sea level rise; it also looked at global temperature changes. Earth’s sharpest climate changes over the past half million years have occurred when the planet transitions from a ‘glacial’ to ‘interglacial’ period, and vice-versa.  Right now we’re in a warm interglacial period, having come out of the last ice age (when New York City and Chicago were under an ice sheet) about 12,000 years ago. During that transition, the Earth’s average surface temperature warmed about 4°C, but that temperature rise occurred over a period of about 10,000 years. In contrast, humans have caused nearly 1°C warming over the past 150 years, and we could trigger anywhere from another 1 to 4°C warming over the next 85 years, depending on how much more carbon we pump into the atmosphere. What humans are in the process of doing to the climate makes the transition out of the last ice age look like a casual stroll through the park. We’re already warming the Earth about 20 times faster than during the ice age transition, and over the next century that rate could increase to 50 times faster or more. We’re in the process of destabilizing the global climate far more quickly than happens even in some of the most severe natural climate change events. That rapid climate destabilization is what has climate scientists worried. It’s faster than many species can adapt to, and could therefore cause widespread extinctions, among other dangerous climate change consequences. Coastal flooding in places like Florida has already become much more common than it was just 50 years ago, and sea level rise is expected to keep accelerating. As Aaron Goldner, one of the Nature Climate Change study authors told me, the next 10–20 years are critical in determining which path we follow. There’s a big difference between an eventual sea level rise of 1.7 meters and one of 9 meters. The sooner we transition away from fossil fuels and cut our carbon pollution, the better we’ll be able to limit the climate destabilization and associated damages. It’s a sobering thought: our children, grandchildren, and future generations for hundreds, even thousands of years will feel the impacts of the choices we make over the next decade."
"Big Oil must thwart the movement to leave fossil fuels in the ground, the world’s most powerful oilman said on Tuesday. Addressing executives in Texas, Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi said the industry had to shed its “Dark Side” image and show it was a “force for good”.  “As an industry, we should be celebrating that fact, and better explaining the vital importance of these precious natural resources,” he said, according to a transcript from an event in Houston. “We should not be apologising. And we must not ignore the misguided campaign to ‘keep it in the ground’ and hope it will go away. For too long the oil industry has been portrayed as the Dark Side, but it is not. It is a force, yes, but a force for good.” The growing divestment campaign bids to blacklist the industry as others shunned tobacco producers or Apartheid-era South Africa. By last December, over 500 institutions including large insurers, funds and banks managing US$3.4tn of assets pledged to move out of fossil fuels for climate reasons. That’s a 70-fold rise on September 2014. Fossil fuels were not the problem, but their “harmful emissions,” said Al-Naimi, who represents the hydrocarbon-rich Middle Eastern kingdom at UN climate talks and stepped down as chairman of national oil company Aramco in 2015. The world must scale up technologies that capture carbon dioxide, instead of replacing the polluting fuels with renewable sources, he added. The US now leads Saudi Arabia as the world’s top oil producer following a revolution in techniques to extract it from shale rock, according to BP data. Al-Naimi denied his country had declared war on US producers following oil cartel Opec’s decision not to limit production. Crude prices have plummeted more than 70% since June 2014, bankrupting shale drillers.  “We must continue to work together and we must stick together if we want to achieve our common goal of supplying energy for the betterment of the world and humankind,” he said."
"A land-clearing surge in Queensland is set to create additional carbon dioxide emissions in just three years that are equivalent to those the federal government claims it is avoiding by paying other farmers more than $670m to stop cutting down trees, according to a new analysis. The Queensland land clearing along with weakening land clearing laws in several other states are threatening Australia’s chances of meeting the climate change targets it pledged in Paris last year and raising questions about the Coalition’s Direct Action climate policy. A new study of Australian tree-clearing by environmental services company CO2 Australia – obtained by Guardian Australia – has quantified the recent blow-out in greenhouse emissions from the weakened laws, after a decade in which declining tree clearing played a key role in Australia meeting its climate change commitments. The Queensland Labor government wants to repeal laws passed by Campbell Newman’s government that led to the sudden rise in tree clearing, but may not succeed in doing so and is facing fierce resistance from the Liberal National party and others.  Land clearing in Queensland, along with weakening land clearing laws in several other states, is threatening Australia’s chances of meeting the climate change targets it pledged in Paris last year. Tentative moves by federal environment minister Greg Hunt’s department to assess whether the clearing contravenes federal laws have also prompted a backlash - particularly from his own National party colleagues. But the CO2 study, commissioned by the Wilderness Society, shows the turnaround in clearing threatens to wipe out emission reductions bought by the Turnbull Government’s Direct Action scheme and jeopardise Australia’s chances of meeting its promise to reduce greenhouse emissions by 26-28% by 2030. The study quantifies the impact on emissions of the discrepancy between the federal government’s data on Queensland land clearing and state government data, as well as the absence of accurate national data to predict land clearing emissions as NSW and Western Australia also move to relax their rules. Part of the blow-out in emissions from land use and tree clearing was quietly acknowledged in the federal government’s latest report on Australia’s greenhouse emissions, released a few days before Christmas, which projected that emissions from land clearing would rise 24% from 2013 levels, from an average 37m tonnes to an average 46m tonnes a year up to 2020 and 44m tonnes a year between 2020 and 2030. In 2013-14, 300,000 hectares were cleared in Queensland alone, double the rate in 2011-12. Between 2012 and 2015 land clearing emissions in Australia rose 11 times faster than any other sector. But Queensland government data also released last year revealed a far higher rate of clearing than the federal data would suggests, a rate that would take national land clearings emissions to 55m tonnes a year between 2020 and 2030.  At that rate land clearing would emit an additional 118m tonnes of carbon dioxide over that decade – on top of the higher rates the federal government is already factoring in – a blow out of over 10% on the reductions the government pledged to make by 2030 in the agreement forged last December in Paris.  Professor Stuart Phinn, director of the remote sensing research centre at the University of Queensland, said Queensland’s approach was “world’s best practice.” “The Queensland approach is based on a long time series of satellite imagery, tied to field measurements of the amount of vegetation on the ground,” he said. “It’s been developed over 15 years.”  Both studies use Landsat satellite imagery, but in Queensland field officers drive out to check that changes in the satellite images are being correctly interpreted. The federal government insists its national data collection system has been ticked off as compatible with the United Nations climate change accounting process. Hunt’s office has been contacted for comment. But Lyndon Schneiders, national campaigns director of the Wilderness Society, says the new data shows Australia is “lying to the world and lying to ourselves” about the true state of greenhouse emissions. “Land clearing across the country has spiralled out of control in the last three years ... at exactly the same time as the national government is spending up to $2.7bn, in large part by trying to reduce land clearing,” he said. “... the state governments, particularly in Queensland and also in NSW, are handing out tree clearing permits like confetti. “The whole system is in disrepair. We are making commitments as a nation ... yet we are relying on data that is completely different to the data that is being generated out of the states, so we are lying to the international community and we are lying to ourselves.” The CO2 report confirms that at the same time land clearing laws are also being weakened around the country and in many states, there is patchy data to quantify the increase in tree clearing or its impact on greenhouse emissions. It says there is no connection between what the states are doing with vegetation management laws and what the federal government is promising to achieve in reducing greenhouse emissions. “There is a conflict between the emission reduction objectives of the Australian government ... and the recent trend for state and territory regulatory reform that has, in a number of cases, reduced barriers to vegetation clearing,” the CO2 report says. “There currently appears to be little incentive for state and territory governments to seriously consider the greenhouse gas implications associated with vegetation management ... reform.” In New South Wales, the Baird government is scrapping the Native Vegetation Act, which prevents the broad-scale clearing of native vegetation. Conservation groups have walked out of talks on replacement legislation because it offers what they consider to be unacceptably weak protections. In 2013, the Western Australian native vegetation regulations were relaxed to allow up to five hectares of clearing at a time, without a permit, and the re-clearing of regrowing forests up to 20 years old. The Queensland government, concerned about the land clearing rates, also requested that Hunt’s department write to some landholders with land clearing permits asking for information about possible breaches of the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, but those letters prompted a fierce backlash from agricultural groups and from National Party senator Barry O’Sullivan who attacked the “green activist inclinations” of the federal department. In late December, the federal environment department wrote to the landholders saying it was “concerned” that some of the clearing could have an impact on one of the “matters of national environmental significance” the EPBC act is designed to protect. These include nationally-listed threatened species, migratory species, and the Great Barrier Reef marine park, but not greenhouse emissions. The federal department then sent another letter to the landholders three weeks ago expressing “deep regret” if the previous letter had caused them distress. “We are keen to ensure, at the minister’s direct request, that all assistance is provided to ensure you are able to continue your business as soon as possible, in accordance with the law,” the February 5 letter states. Up until 2013 land clearing rates in Australia were declining and that was the primary reason Australia had been able to meet climate change goals. Australia “overshot” the greenhouse gas reductions it promised under the Kyoto Protocol largely because of land clearing restrictions in Queensland that had already been agreed at the time. This allowed Australia to “carry over” 128m tonnes of emissions reductions into the second stage of the international process, which ends in 2020, and meant we could easily meet the target we had promised for that date. Five other big developed countries announced in Paris that they had voluntarily cancelled emission reduction “credits” achieved by overshooting their first Kyoto protocol greenhouse targets, but Australia refused to follow suit. Over its first two auctions the emissions reduction fund has paid around $670m to buy 51m tonnes of land sector greenhouse gas abatement, according to the Clean Energy Regulator. Much of that - but not all of it - was avoided tree clearing. The blow-out in land clearing emissions contained in the national figures, but using the Queensland government figures for that state, adds 18m tonnes of emissions each year, undoing the ERF-purchased land sector emissions reductions in just three years."
"The 13 activists who chained themselves to Heathrow’s northern runway are likely to become the first climate change protesters to be jailed in the UK when they are sentenced on Wednesday morning, despite the support of prominent politicians. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said it would be a “disgrace” and that he was “shattered by the concept” of the Heathrow 13 being imprisoned, while the Green MP Caroline Lucas said it would be “deeply unjust”.   Heathrow executives said that the protesters had jeopardised safety at the airport and needed to face the consequences.  The activists, 13 men and women aged between 22 and 67, cut through the fence and blocked a runway at Britain’s biggest airport on 13 July 2015, causing various flights to be delayed and 25 to be cancelled. They were convicted in January of aggravated trespass and entering a restricted area of an aerodrome, and were warned by a district judge that prison sentences were almost inevitable.  McDonnell, whose constituency includes Heathrow and who has been a longstanding opponent of the airport’s expansion, said the protesters had been “motivated by best motives”.  He said: “We are fearful that the Heathrow 13 may receive a custodial sentence which frankly, I think, would be a disgrace … It is in the tradition of this country over centuries that people have taken direct action of this sort and it should not be one which receives a custodial sentence.”  Lucas, who will speak at a rally in support of the protesters outside Willesden magistrates court ahead of their sentencing on Wednesday, said: “Sending the Heathrow 13 to prison would be utterly unwarranted. They took a principled and non-violent stand against the colossal environmental cost of expanding an airport that already breaches air pollution laws – yet they’re being treated as if they are somehow a danger to society. “The real dangers we face are the toxic fumes emitted by airports and the looming threat of catastrophic climate change. Sending these committed activists to jail would be deeply unjust.” Lucas said that if the 13 were jailed, an early day motion would be lodged in parliament urging their release. Heathrow’s chief financial officer, Michael Uzielli, declined to say whether he felt the activists should be jailed. He said: “We absolutely support the right to peaceful protest, but our imperative has to be the safety of passengers and employees. They broke through the fence and entered the live runway, and if you do break the law there are going to be consequences.  “Peaceful protest happens quite often and we have a good track record of facilitating those without impacting on our passengers’ journeys.” The protesters who could be jailed on Wednesday, 10 of whom have no previous convictions, include charity workers, a retired professor, a climate scientist and local residents. The 13 are Danielle Paffard, 28; Rebecca Sanderson, 28; Richard Hawkins, 32; Kara Moses, 32; Ella Gilbert, 23; Melanie Strickland, 32; Graham Thompson, 42; Sheila Menon, 44; Cameron Kaye, 23; Edward Thacker, 26; Alistair Tamlit, 27; Sam Sender, 23; and Robert Basto, 67. During the trial, the 13 argued that their actions were reasonable, proportionate and necessary to prevent death and serious injury via air pollution and climate change, saying that 31 people a year die prematurely around Heathrow due to its pollution, and thousands die due to the effects of climate change.  In a statement on Tuesday, the Heathrow 13 said: “Clearly, none of us would choose to go to jail, but this shouldn’t be singled out as the main ‘injustice’. Climate change is the real injustice, with the majority of the world’s population, those in the global south, being the ones who continue to be most affected. “The science is clear … There can be no new runways in the UK if we are to take climate change seriously.” The action, which began at 3.30am and lasted around six hours before the last protester was removed from the runway, was part of the long-running Plane Stupid campaign against airport expansion. Its high-profile direct action was originally part of a campaign that eventually led to plans for a third runway at Heathrow being overturned in 2010 by David Cameron’s coalition government. The 2015 protest came soon after the airports commission recommended that a third runway should be constructed after all. "

"It is the greatest environmental hazard of the age. Nothing focuses our concern for the future more, divides rich and poor, exercises science, business, politicians, old and young. It is an existential threat, a generational battle. All political and financial resources must be concentrated on stopping climate change. But now that governments have signed up to the unambitious Paris climate agreement and pledged to try to limit greenhouse gas emissions, we must ask whether we have lost sight of everything else. Is the environment just about carbon and parts per million of gases in the atmosphere? What about the environment that we can smell, see and touch today?  For 20 years or more concerns about nuclear waste, food production, the quality of river water, the health of our soils and seas, the fate of our forests, the impact of road-building and many other important ecological issues have been steadily marginalised, starved of resources or pushed off the agenda by climate change. Climate has become for government an excuse to build nuclear power and ditch other green policies. Money for biodiversity has been slashed, planning laws revoked, pollution and waste controls weakened and sustainable development policies rejected. Most popular and ministerial attention has been focused on energy companies and big carbon polluters, and the wider environment has visibly deteriorated. Seeing trees as sticks of carbon, air as gas, or forests as sinks is abstract, esoteric and emotionally stultifying. Most heinous of all the sins of emissions is what has happened to our air quality since climate change climbed the political agenda 20 years ago. No government wants us to know that far more people will suffer grievous illnesses and will die from the filthy air shrouding our cities than from any warming of the atmosphere in the next 30 years. Climate change may give us a glimpse of the terrifying future we are heading towards if we don’t change our ways, but toxic air is already here, and killing us in ever greater numbers. New estimates from the Global Burden of Disease project and the World Health Organisation state that between 5.5 and 7 million people die from air pollution every year. That’s more than die from malaria and HIV/Aids put together; more than the population of Scotland. In the next 10 years we can expect as many people to die from breathing poisonous air as were killed in the second world war. Most of those deaths will be in China and India which, in the name of extreme poverty eradication, have been transforming their cities and are now having to pay for a health crisis of their own making. But we in rich countries do not have the same excuses. Our industries and governments have known for well over a century the health effects of polluted air. Yet they have fought in Europe to be allowed to continue polluting, and people have been encouraged to switch to diesel and more polluting fuels because they emit less CO2. In Britain, 29,000 people die a year from breathing in particles of unburned carbon and construction dust, and an estimated 23,500 more as a result of nitrogen dioxide. To condone these deaths is unforgivable; to actively seek to carry on polluting is like declaring war on the public. It’s saying, “We know that the whole of Christchurch or half the city of Worcester will be asphyxiated next year, but there is nothing we think we should do about it.” But those 50,000 or more deaths a year are just the tip of the iceberg, hiding hospital wards full of people with heart disease, cancers and respiratory and lung problems caused by lifetimes spent breathing toxic air. No one counts the heartbreak when parents die young, or when children are unable to breathe properly or when Granny develops dementia – which is now linked to air pollution too. Nor does government want us to tell us how much air pollution really costs. This is reckoned by the European environment agency to be over £10bn a year in damage to people’s health, buildings, soil and water. That is dozens of new hospitals and schools, thousands of extra nurses and teachers, and enough left over to protect most of Britain’s premier conservation sites. After 20 years of battling to get government to take the climate seriously, we must wake up to the fact that the very air we breathe is killing us and making us bankrupt, yet governments are deliberately making the situation worse. Despite the Volkswagen scandal – the German car giant admitted that it cheated emissions tests in the US – new pollution limits for diesel cars have been delayed until 2019. On the drawing board in Britain are a new runway and hundreds of thousands more planes every year in the southeast, a massive national road-building programme, several new road crossings for east London taking air pollution into the heart of some of the poorest areas, the £50bn HS2 rail line, fracking, giant infrastructure projects from nuclear power stations and new ports. All will add to air pollution and to climate emissions. The government has developed tunnel vision. Because it sees environmental problems as many separate issues, it does not understand the links between them and the benefits of addressing them together. Yet the science shows that if air pollution is addressed, there will be a significant decrease in climate emissions. Restoring peat bogs and investing in conservation will not only improve biodiversity, reduce flooding and make for a healthier environment, it will also reduce greenhouse gases. We have been distracted by climate change and have let governments dictate the agenda. Now we must return to basics, and address all those issues that have been conveniently dropped. Who will get angry about the degradation of water quality, the plague of plastic in our seas? Mining? What about computer and smart phone waste? Litter? Population control? Endangered species? Unless we address mass consumption – the root of our environmental crisis – climate change will not only worsen, we will be left with a degraded world. Rather than solely trying to tackle the vast problem of climate change, we must address all the many factors which make it worse. It’s a case of looking after the green pennies and letting the green pounds take care of themselves."

"Coral will become deformed and increasingly fall victim to outbreaks of herpes-like viruses as humans continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to two new studies. Combined, the two effects suggest coral reefs will have trouble recovering from bleaching events, like the the world is currently experiencing. When carbon dioxide is emitted from factories, cars and power plants, about 30% of it is absorbed by the ocean. As that happens, the acidity of the oceans increases, which makes it harder for corals to build their alkaline skeletons. But exactly how the increasing acidity impacts coral growth was hard to determine. “If you just look at survival rates of these things, effectively they all survive,” said Peta Clode from the University of Western Australia. “So if you look at that data you think nothing is wrong.” Even studies that used microscopes to examine how corals grow in more acidic water had trouble finding differences, she said. So Clode and colleagues went a step further and grew corals in a range of different temperatures and acidities, and then used a high-resolution three-dimensional x-ray microscope to examine how they grew. Published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, the images and videos they produced revealed striking deformities in corals grown under conditions the oceans are expected to see by the end of the century. Under normal conditions, baby corals grew skeletons that were symmetrical, strong and with thick walls. But when the acidity was raised to the level expected by 2100 if emissions are not cut drastically, the skeletons had some spines stunted in growth, while others grew longer. Some parts of the skeleton were completely absent. They grew into an asymmetrical shape and their walls became pitted and porous, and half of them had fractures in their deformed skeletons. “You think ‘oh my god, look at them.’ It is very dramatic,” said Clode. “You would expect they would not grow very well. But to see such deformity is surprising. We expected they might just grow less.” The effect of heat alone seemed to have little impact, and when combined with high acidity it had a beneficial effect, mitigating some of the deformities caused by the higher acidity. Clode said that was not completely surprising, since higher temperatures that did not stress coral – temperatures that were not too high or too suddenly raised – had been seen to improve coral growth before. The results showed that as the ocean acidifies, young coral reefs will have trouble re-establishing after they get damaged by events like bleaching or storms, Clode said. “The juveniles, they’re the reef formers of the future so to start out at a disadvantage like this, you start to worry about how [much] it can take,” said Tracy Ainsworth from James Cook University in Townsville, Australia. Ainsworth and colleagues recently published a different paper examining the struggles coral will experience in the future. They examined the viral loads in corals as they got bleached over three days in 2011 on part of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, publishing their results in the journal Frontiers of Microbiology. Bleaching occurs when corals are stressed by things including hot temperatures, being exposed to the air, or heavy rainfall that lowers the salinity of the water. Global warming is expected to increase the frequency of bleaching by pushing corals closer to the limits of temperatures they can tolerate. Ainsworth and colleagues found that as the coral bleached, a viral outbreak occurred. Among the many viruses they saw explode was a big spike in one that was similar to the herpes viruses that infect humans. Viral loads were up to four times higher than has ever been seen in corals before. Ainsworth said the viral loads of corals during a bleaching event hadn’t been studied before, and outbreaks like this might be normal.  That is bad news since it might be too much for corals to cope with as they bleach more frequently, she said. “When corals are under stress, it’s not just bleaching that they have to overcome,” she said. “It’s coupled with a change in the microbial communities that it has to deal with.”"
"World leaders and street protesters were struggling in a heatwave with temperatures hovering around 40C at Brisbane’s G20 meeting. Longreach in central Queensland had 13 days straight when the maximum temperature hit 40C (104F) or higher – four days longer than the town’s previous record.   Down in New South Wales and Tasmania, residents fought off bushfires. A few weeks earlier, South Australia had its hottest October on record.  This was the spring of 2014, Australia’s hottest September-November period on a record going back to 1910, beating the previous record by a 10th of a degree – a large margin in climatological terms.  “Temperatures were 1.67C above the 1961–1990 average, the largest such departure from the long-term average observed since national records began in 1910,” the Bureau of Meteorology said.  These sorts of spring conditions are perfect for priming bush areas for dangerous fire seasons (extreme fire weather is on the rise in Australia) that damage property, risk lives and devastate wilderness areas. But the spring of 2014 had been the second record breaker in a row. The previous hottest spring had been the year before, 2013. There had never been two record-breaking springs occurring back-to-back in Australia’s entire record, going back to 1910.  The most recent spring of 2015 was hotter than 2013, but not quite as hot as 2014. The hottest October on record was the one we just had.  So springs in Australia are starting to feel like summer, but could the so-called “lucky country” just be having a run of bad luck? If there had not been about 40% more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than there had been before the start of the industrial revolution, could Australians have still sweated through record-breaking springs? A new study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters by Dr Ailie Gallant, of Monash University, and Dr Sophie Lewis, of Australian National University, has come to a conclusion. Gallant told me:  When we examined a world without human-emitted greenhouse gases in climate models, we found zero instances when there were two consecutive years with record-breaking springtime temperatures like those we observed in 2013 and 2014.  But when we examined a world with these additional greenhouse gases, we saw that this happened somewhere between 1 in every 10 years and one in every four. This evidence suggests that this repeated record breaking that we saw in spring in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2015, is almost certainly due to greenhouse warming. Now this isn’t a surprising outcome. Australia has been warming at roughly the same rate as the rest of the globe, and the cause is the greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere, mainly from burning fossil fuels. Previous studies have found human fingerprints all over Australia’s recent heat records.  To carry out the study, Gallant and Lewis combined computer climate models. They ran the models to see if the results they gave matched what was happening in the real world. The differences were “statistically indistinguishable”. To see what impact greenhouse gases were having, they then removed the greenhouse gases from the models to make a comparison. What makes the study intriguing is that it not only tried to answer the question of the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, but also looked to find out exactly how they were affecting temperatures. Gallant says: We had just had two hot springs in a row and we were set for a third. They were really remarkable. They broke records by a long way. We wanted to know; is the weather we are experiencing changing, or is it just that we’ve warmed up.  The evidence is that the underlying air masses are warming, rather than the systems themselves changing. We are getting more record hot springs and it is highly unlikely that this is not due to climate change. But the reason we are getting more record hot springs is not because the weather systems are changing, it is just that everything is warmer. The study found the natural background conditions (such as atmospheric circulations and the state of the El Niño/La Niña cycle) that existed during those record-breaking springs “have occurred in the past” yet temperatures had been at least 0.21C cooler.  If the dignitaries at that Brisbane G20 meeting were wondering why they were struggling in such oppressive heat, then it seems they had the answer right in their hands.

"Right now, roughly a kilometre below the surface of an ocean near you, a yellow cylinder about the size of a golf bag is taking measurements of the temperature and saltiness of the water. Every couple of days, the float will drop deeper – down to 2km – and then rise to the surface to transmit its data, before disappearing back into the depths to do the whole thing again.  These floats do this for as long as eight years, until the poor little things die of exhaustion (well, their batteries run out).  There are about 3,800 of these floats scattered across the globe as part of a program called Argo, supported by more than 30 countries.  It’s likely you’ve never heard of Argo and much less likely you’ve ever seen one of the floats. But for the last decade, climate scientists and oceanographers have been using the data from these Argo floats to plug a gaping ocean-sized hole in our understanding of global warming. Scientific papers that use the data from these floats are now appearing in science journals at the rate of about one per day.  But now, scientists are sounding an alarm for the future of this ocean monitoring system. In a commentary in the journal Nature Climate Change, scientists say cracks are starting to appear in the network, largely because of uncertainties over funding.  The commentary predicts it could be only two years before the number of floats drops below a critical threshold of 3,200, which would “considerably undermine the ability of the observing system to monitor and measure the global ocean”. Australian Dr Paul Durack, of the US government-funded Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is one of the scientists sounding the alarm. He told me: Argo is an amazing entity – there are at least 30 nations involved – and it’s giving us observations that we have never had before. From about 2005, Argo gave us comprehensive ocean data – if you don’t have data you can’t say anything. Basically, it has completely changed the game. Knowing what’s happening in the globe’s oceans is critical. About 90% of the extra heat from human-caused global warming has ended up there.  When you get below a couple of hundred metres you see the inexorable growth of global warming happening in the oceans Some 31 countries have contributed to the Argo program, with floats costing about US$25,000 each. The United States funds about half, with about 2,142 of the floats currently in circulation.  France is the second-biggest supporter, with 356 floats, followed by Australia with 346. Two-thirds of the global ocean is in the southern hemisphere. CSIRO’s Dr Susan Wijffels is the co-chair of the global Argo program and also the lead scientist for Australia’s contribution to Argo. In the Nature Climate Change commentary, Wijffels says any drop in the number of deployments of floats could spell trouble. She told me: Argo is fundamental because this all comes back to the heat problem. The key thing that matters for the Earth is how much extra heat is retained in the system.  While we have seen this huge debate over the last 15 years about this so-called ‘hiatus’, really what Argo shows us is that surface variability [in temperature] is just a re-organisation of heat. When you get below a couple of hundred metres you see the inexorable growth of global warming happening in the oceans. That’s driving a good chunk of the sea level rise. It is telling us what the radiation imbalance is at the top of the atmosphere. Once that heat and that carbon is down there in the deep ocean it’s there for decades – if not longer – and it’s locking in that warming. We see that warming in Argo right down to the depths of our measurement – right down to two kilometres and its probably extending further. Oceanographer Prof Dean Roemmich, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, is also a co-chair of the global Argo program. He told me why there’s a fear the comprehensive coverage that Argo gives the world’s oceans could be at risk.  In most nations Argo is supported by research funds – rather than as operational oceanography – with no mechanism for inflation or for long-term funding. So far Argo has been successful in increasing the lifetime of floats so that less deployments are needed to maintain the array and bringing in new national programs to sustain the level of total deployments.  Durack points out these advances are difficult to sustain and without them the array would decline. This is an important caution, and along with it we need to continue making the case for Argo’s great value in order to increase support from Argo national programs. Roemmich says Australian scientists are “world leaders in basic research using Argo data, particularly in the Southern Ocean” and that the country also provides critical operational support. Tim Moltmann is the director of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), a program funded by the Department of Education and Training and which has provided about half the funding for Australia’s Argo program over the past decade. It has been revolutionary. What we knew about the subsurface ocean before Argo was pretty much limited to what we could get from ships – dropping instruments into the water and getting measurements. You can imagine that’s pretty sparse What’s critically important from an Australian perspective is that from a historical point of view, measurements of the oceans have been dominated by the northern hemisphere. Argo has been critically important for Australia and the southern hemisphere because it has enabled us to bootstrap our subsurface observing capability in a remarkable way.  That’s how we know that ocean heat content is changing. That’s how we know that so-called ‘pause’ [in global warming] isn’t really a pause if you look at the whole system, because the heat has been building up in the ocean. IMOS has funded about half of Australia’s Argo effort so far, says Moltmann. Over the past decade, about 20% of the funding for Australia’s Argo program has come from the CSIRO, which also employs about four full-time staff who work to understand and interpret the data and maintain the floats. Paul Durack is also the scientist who helped to coordinate an open letter signed by almost 3,000 scientists from 60 countries calling on CSIRO to reconsider planned cuts to its climate change research. He is worried those cuts could make matters worse for Argo. In the commentary, written before the cuts were announced, Durack writes: Future forecasts are inherently difficult to generate, due to the short-term nature of national budgets, along with unanticipated technology and deployment problems or new technology breakthroughs. These are further confounded by a critical dependence on each and every nation that contributes to the array – and a loss of just one of these key contributors will have a profound impact. CSIRO chairman David Thodey wrote last week that the agency was “committed” to “contribute to the international Argo floats program”. But when I asked for details of the commitment and whether the cuts would impact on Argo, a CSIRO spokesperson would only say the agency was “currently working through the impacts of the strategic realignment” with staff and research partners. "
