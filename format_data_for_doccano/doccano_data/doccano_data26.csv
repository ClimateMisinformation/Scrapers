Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that a day has passed since the Munich Blackout, the Munich City Utility (Stadtwerke) still has not been able to determine the cause. It’s a mystery!
Many naughty citizens are speculating that Germany’s frantic, hasty rush to renewable energy may have contributed to the blackout because of growing grid instability caused by the wildly fluctuating wind and solar power feed-in.
The green mainstream media have reacted testily and hissy about such suspicions, insisting that the “blackout had nothing to do” with Germany’s use of the “clean” planet-saving energy. It’s like: “how dare you suspect renewable energy!”
Much higher prices for a much crappier supply
If unstable grids, blackouts and crappy supply aren’t bad enough, today we learn that we will are going to have to pay a hell of a more for this crap power in 2013. What a deal! It’s the story of the green economy: much crappier products – astronomically higher prices.

Electricity bills to take record hike in January
Millions of German householders will see their energy bills rise from January, with electricity firms publishing revised price plans this week – Vattenfall said its prices would increase by 13 percent. The average hike will be around 10 percent, it seems, now hundreds of providers have tweaked their prices ahead of next weeks’ deadline for new rates. The increases have been described as the biggest ever seen in generally price-stable Germany.
…The main reason given for price increases is the government’s guarantee of a rate for energy from sustainable sources that is well above market prices.
The biggest beneficiary of the environmental levy is the state, which is set to cash in €1.4 billion through the system in 2013.
Keep reading here.
There you have it: “the biggest beneficiary is the state…”
In the meantime, I’m now developing the habit of hitting the “SAVE” button every minute.

"To be rich is a thing that many in our society spend their whole lives striving for. Not having to worry about money and indeed, splashing it on designer clothes, chains of diamonds and private planes is seen by some to be the ultimate dream. But life like this comes at more of a cost than we realise. To coincide with the 2017 World Economic Forum, Oxfam published a new report, which claimed that the eight richest people in the world control the same wealth as half of the world’s population. A vital debate certainly – and yet not the only one that needs to be had.  We know that “wealthy” countries in Europe, North America and parts of Asia have higher per-capita environmental burdens than poorer countries, and that the people of the former are living beyond the bio-physical boundaries – the limits of the environment – in order to do so. But those at the top levels of these countries are practising lifestyles with even higher environmental consequences, enabled by their own wealth. In an average mature economy like the UK’s, the ecological footprint is 6.69 global hectares per person. That means if everybody in the world had this lifestyle we would need 3.7 planets to support us all. Yes, there are those who are living with a smaller footprint, but that is not a life the majority are striving for. The wealthy few who embrace luxurious and extravagant lifestyles impose a great burden on the environment because they acquire so many possessions, and then use them in particularly profligate ways. Many have private jets and super-yachts. Of course, those of us who are not in the elite minority could just be envious of those with affluent lifestyles. Or maybe many of those at the top have been deflecting or otherwise containing the debate, side-steppping it as they are so often accused of doing with taxation. It may even be that we all ignore the environmental consequences because modern society sees the “jet-set” lifestyle as one to aspire to, not denigrate. Perhaps all of us have some guilt in the knowledge that we too have recklessly extravagant elements to our lives, and that these may be rather difficult to change.  The luxury consumption and sustainability debate is one that Plato had back in 380 BC. But then, the threats of climate change and other environmental issues were not so pressing.  Now, the future of the planet relies on humans worldwide creating policies to mitigate our own environmental burdens. But by targeting those affluent lifestyles which are doing more ecological damage, we might be able to address the disproportionate cost. However, it is not as easy as saying we need to limit how many mansions one person owns; there are several components to the ecological burdens of wealth. Neither is this something that can be expressed simply by looking at above-average carbon emissions – though that certainly is one important dimension.  Take a look at this example: the annual average personal carbon footprint was 7.3 tonnes in 2010, and yet the estimated sustainable footprint we should all have by 2050 is 1.5 tonnes per annum. A Learjet private plane, flying on one trip from Aspen, Colorado to San Francisco – 1,386.6km (861 miles) – would, according to our calculations, have CO₂ emissions of 4,411.8kg. By contrast, driving the average car 10,000km (6,213 miles) over a year would emit about 1,600kg of CO₂. But to live an affluent lifestyle, one does more than hop on a jet. There are the houses, cars, boats, clothes, jewellery, technology – money is no object so there is no limit to the amount of objects one can possess.  You might be wondering how simply owning a lot of “things” can damage the environment. One way to understand this is through the ecological rucksack concept. This measures the total quantity in kilograms of materials moved from nature to create a product or service, minus the actual weight of the product. Aluminium, for example has a rucksack “factor” of 85:1, so 85kg of material is required to make 1kg of aluminium. Diamonds on the other hand have a factor of 53,000:1.  Though we all know what a standard lifestyle of the rich looks like nowadays, in truth the ecological footprint is largely unknown beyond the individual acts we can analyse. We could be dangerously underestimating the damage that a handful of people are doing to the environment, and not properly mitigating it.  This is not just a call for research into affluent lifestyles, we must name and shame those who are being reckless with the environment for the sake of themselves, and instigate policy action to stop them.  Eight billionaires might not account for half of the world’s environmental problems – and perhaps they do a lot of good, too – but the ecological burdens they create are surely greater than eight subsistence farmers in India. And it is about time we knew just how much more damage they are doing."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German media are now naturally asking what is behind the terrible tornado that struck near Oklahoma City.

Tornado frequency. Source NOAA
To fool the public, German ZDF public television here, Germany’s version of the BBC, sought out “one of Germany’s most renown climate scientists” Prof Mojib Latif of the IFM-GEOMAR, Kiel, the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences. Latif is often a frequent guest on radio and television whenever the climate topic arises in Germany.
The interview actually was quite good, until the 2:25 mark. Latif did a good job explaining why tornadoes occur very often in Tornado Alley, and why early warning systems are difficult.
But any skeptic watching could feel the TV anchorman and Latif were building up to the climate-change moment, which came at the 2:25 mark. At this point the interview turned into the usual state-sponsored climate propaganda circus.
The anchorman asks:
Herr Latif, just briefly on climate change. Do you expect an increase in frequency because of climate change or is there no relationship?”
Latif answers, making another one of his famous laughing stock predictions:

Yeah, at the moment we cannot see it. As I said these are rare events and the data just are not sufficient. But I suspect that when global warming continues over the course of decades, then such weather situations with very severe thunderstorms will occur more frequently, and then the frequency for tornadoes will be higher than what the case is today.”
The anchorman replies:
Thank you very much for that estimation, and this is actually no good news for these people in Tornado Alley.”
Plain as day, complete BS from ZDF and Prof Latif. There’s data out there, but not the kind that the ZDF and Latif want to see, or us to see. Here it is for readers:

Plot of NOAA data.
How Latif comes up with the idea that we should expect more tornadoes as warming and CO2 increases is a mystery to me.
Then again in the year 2000 (April 1st) Latif made the notorious prediction that snow and hard frosts would become rare in Germany in the wintertime. The exact opposite has happened. In fact, snow is the forecast for parts of Germany today, and it’s May 22!
Why can’t these people just be honest for once, and skip the constant BS. These people need to be fired.

"Semi-naked environmental campaigners have been drenched in fake oil at the National Portrait Gallery to protest against its sponsorship by BP. To the surprise of visitors on Sunday afternoon, activists from Extinction Rebellion wearing just underwear suddenly assumed the foetal position while others poured the “oil” on their bodies in the Ondaatje Wing main hall, where a collection of pieces sponsored by BP is on display.  The protest performance piece, titled Crude Truth, was to mark the end of the BP Portrait Award exhibition. After a monologue by clothed protester Eden, 19, calling on arts organisations to sever ties with companies “funding extinction”, one activist led a brief chant of “NPG, drop BP”. “Who will there be left to see, who will there be left to paint, if we have no earth and no people?” recited Eden. “We cannot be artists on a dead planet. Oil means the end, but art means the beginning.” The three activists covered in black liquid lay down for about five minutes on a plastic sheet before standing up again, wiping themselves down with towels, and cleaning up. Gallery workers had appeared to briefly close the doors to the room. However, the action, which was applauded by onlookers, passed uninterrupted. The UK group of Extinction Rebellion has three core demands: 1) Tell the truthThe government must tell the truth about the scale of the ecological crisis by declaring a climate emergency, “working with other groups and institutions to communicate the urgent need for change”. 2) Net zero emissions by 2025The UK must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions, hitting net zero by 2025. 3) Citizens’ assemblyThe government must create a citizens’ assembly to hear evidence and devise policy to tackle the climate crisis. Citizens’ assemblies bring together ordinary people to investigate, discuss and make recommendations on how to respond, in this case, to the ecological emergency. In the US activists have added a further demand: “A just transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice.” Matthew Taylor One of the activists said the government and the cultural establishment were not working fast enough to deal with the climate emergency. “We need everyone to do what they can,” said Samantha, 37. “The Portrait Gallery is very influential and they need to be leading the way on these issues. But instead they’re doing the opposite by being sponsored by a company who is living in the past when we have the technological knowhow to make renewable energies.”Tommy, 18, also among the activists who took part in the performance, said: “It’s atrocious that BP can try to cover themselves up by investing in art. No one should work alongside them. The oil poured into oceans is killing animals.” Other activists handed out literature criticising oil extraction plans and BP’s contribution to climate change. Security guards arrived after about 15 minutes, once the protesters had left. The three decades of support the institution has received from BP is celebrated on display boards in the gallery. The National Portrait Gallery said BP’s support for its portrait award encouraged the work of artists around the world and allowed for free admission to the exhibition, which had drawn more than 300,000 visitors this year. “The ongoing debate around BP’s sponsorship of the arts raises important questions about both the environment and arts funding, and we are listening carefully to voices on all sides,” it said in a statement.  On Friday, Extinction Rebellion protested outside BP’s headquarters with members of the Free West Papua campaign group, while the company reportedly delivered a report on its activities in the Indonesian province. The Royal Shakespeare Company this month announced it would end its sponsorship deal with BP amid growing public discontent with its eight-year relationship with the oil multinational. Tate ended its relationship with BP in 2016. In February, activists occupied the British Museum to protest against BP sponsorship highlight how the company lobbied the British government to help it gain access to Iraq’s oil reserves prior to the war in the country. The institution later rejected calls to sever its ties with BP. Almost 1,800 people were arrested over the past two weeks of Extinction Rebellion demonstrations, with activists blockading the BBC, preventing trains from departing and defacing government buildings."
"Beef from Brazil, avocados from Mexico, lamb from New Zealand, wines from South Africa and green beans from Kenya – food shopping lists have a distinctly international flavour. And with many questioning the sustainability of importing so much food from so far away, we are beginning to ask if switching to a vegetarian diet to cut emissions caused by meat production is as sustainable as one might think. The influence of the global trade of food on local diets and cultural choices has exploded over recent years. Food supply chains operate globally and deliver rural produce to nearly 4 billion people now living in cities and towns. It was this principle that established the world’s first agricultural research station some 150 years ago when the founders of Rothamsted saw the potential of the agricultural land surrounding London to supply a growing urban population. In the 21st century, the whole world can be your bread basket.   Many are conscious of what they eat – both from a health and environmental perspective. But what is the impact of this? We’re increasingly encouraged to eat less meat to tackle climate change. And meat consumption, in the European Union at least, has reduced and stabilised at around 42m tonnes over the last 15 years. There are also now new labels for different types of meat eaters: flexitarians (only eat meat sometimes) or the reducetarian (aim to eat less meat) that reflect the ways different groups are trying to cut down.  But what about all those fruit, vegetable and staples crossing the globe – can we really label them as more sustainable than eating meat? The growth of ethical food purchases now make up close to 10% of grocery purchases in the UK, which is double that of tobacco. But in addition to the impact of air miles, global land and resource use determine the sustainability of the food we eat – food production can destroy or displace natural resources in order to supply growing demand. Changing land use to expand avocado production in Mexico, for example, is displacing the rainforest. Or the devastating impact of non-certificated palm oil, used in food but also a whole host of other products. And then there is the issue of food wastage. However, the first thing we need to be able to do is measure the environmental impact of the food we eat. We can do this for different food supply chains using carbon footprinting methods. The difficulty is that consumers choose foods based on what they like – and this frequently changes but rarely considers the impact of climate change.  From this we can say that a vegetarian diet does deliver a decreased carbon footprint. But it also shows us that food miles and global distribution can be the least of our problems. This is because food wastage can be up to 20% of food purchases and food losses across the supply chain can be far greater than this. Food waste in turn increases the carbon footprint which counters the positive gains. And perishable fresh fruit and vegetables are more likely to be thrown away than fresh meat and fish. Ultimately, we cannot say that eating a vegan or vegetarian or meat diet is any better for the environment. This is because all can be appropriate if production systems are sustainable, there is no waste and positive health outcomes are achieved. There are clearly trade-offs in choosing foods. Air freighting of green beans from Kenya into the UK was seen as unsustainable because of air miles but it also supports up to 1.5m people and livelihoods in some of the poorest regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. It’s not just meat that increase greenhouse gases. Rice – produced on 163m hectares, around 12% of the global arable area – has one of the greatest plant carbon footprints because it produces a lot of methane. But a fall in production of rice is not only unlikely, it could also disrupt greenhouse gases held in the soil. But there are different ways to do things – draining off paddies at particular times in the growing season, for example. Or using different fertilisers or rice varieties that are less susceptible to the heat.    Consumers need to understand trade-offs and to keep up to date on information of what is best to buy. It is important to spot food trends, for example, and project any sustainability impacts. The number of gluten-free products available is doubling year-on-year in Europe and the US. This has resulted in an increase in the consumption of plant proteins from beans and lentils. These kinds of foods are arguably more eco-friendly than meat but – whatever your thoughts about gluten-free eating – it will change how protein crops are distributed globally and may divert pulses or increase the price of them for countries such as India that depend of non-livestock proteins.  Sustainability certifications have changed how we shop, giving us guidance on ethical purchases including sustainable fishing, rainforest produce and so on. This is one way to make sure that what you eat is less damaging and/or helps sustain livelihoods and good agricultural practices.  But it is day-to-day food waste – both at home and in supply chains – that can make any diet unsustainable whether you choose to be vegan, vegetarian, a meat eater or a combination of these. Different preservation formats can reduce food waste to zero. In the case of frozen food we know food waste can be halved compared with fresh foods – less of it is thrown away. Despite what you might think, frozen compares well to fresh and can be just as nutritious. We all choose foods based on what we like, what we can access and what we can afford. But continued surveillance and interest in sustainable production will mean we can buy produce we know has a better supply chain. There isn’t currently a certification that shows food produced with less waste (there should be), but we can aim to cut down our own and keep up with suppliers who show better commitments.  We might have an avocado – but maybe not five in a week. And of course we can source more food locally and seasonally as well as considering preserved options if we want to cut down on air miles. Like eating less meat, there are ways to make your footprint better."

"The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the global financial system is backing carbon-producing projects that will raise the temperature of the planet by over 4C – more than double the pledge to limit increases to well below 2C contained in the Paris Agreement. In a stark warning over global heating, Mark Carney said the multitrillion-dollar international capital markets – where companies raise funds by selling shares and bonds to investors – are financing activities that would lift global temperatures to more than 4C above pre-industrial levels. World leaders agreed in the Paris climate accords to keep the temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5C. But in a stark illustration of the scale of the decarbonisation challenge facing the world economy, Carney suggested companies had already secured financing from investors in the global capital markets – worth $85tn (£67.2tn) for stocks and $100tn for bonds – that will keep the world on a trajectory consistent with catastrophic global heating. The risks associated with temperatures at or above 4C include a 9-metre rise in sea levels – affecting up to 760 million people – searing heatwaves and droughts, serious food supply problems and half of all animal and plant species facing local extinction. Speaking to MPs on the Commons Treasury committee, Carney did not give a timescale for the temperature rise, but said: “The objectives are there, but policy is not yet consistent with stabilising temperatures below 2C. “There are some companies out ahead, either because of stakeholders, or because they’re anticipating that that will change. But there are others that are waiting for the policies to adjust.” Carney sounded the alarm in the wake of the Guardian last week revealing the 20 biggest companies behind a third of all carbon emissions. The Bank’s governor said the financial system was now starting to wake up to the risks of global heating. He said some investment companies have analysed the carbon-linked assets in their portfolios, including Japan’s $1.6tn Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF). Carney told the committee that GPIF’s analysis showed it held assets consistent with 3.7C heating, and that the fund was now trying to manage this down. He said that AXA, the French insurance group, priced US government bonds at 5.4C, to reflect the carbon-intensive nature of the American economy. The UK is much lower, he said. Based on these assessments, “it indicates that if you price the capital markets – and I’m not giving you a precise figure – that all of the assets are probably north of 4C for the capital markets as a whole,” he said. “We can observe where the market is in terms of pricing the transition. It’s at least 3C or 3.75C, it’s probably north of 4C. That tells you something in terms of the sum of global climate policy.” The Bank’s governor has spoken at length about the need for the financial system to accelerate its efforts to tackle the climate emergency, warning that firms that ignore the crisis will go bankrupt. He said that banks should be forced to disclose their climate-linked risks within the next two years, and said that more information would prompt investors to penalise and reward firms accordingly. Threadneedle Street is currently drafting a stress test for the UK’s banks based on their climate exposures, he added. However, the governor said the transition to a low-carbon world economy would still require investors to back firms with significant carbon footprints, given the scale of the adjustment required. “It’s not as simple as saying, ‘Well I’m going to invest in only renewable energy.’ The system as a whole cannot invest only in renewable energy. “The contribution of manufacturing or an industrial company in terms of lowering their carbon footprint over the next decade, a big reduction in that, can be as significant if not more significant than further development in the short term on renewables,” he said. Carney also dropped a heavy hint that the government would shake-up the Bank’s remit for financial supervision to take account of climate risks at the budget on 6 November. “Remits normally come with the budget, so we’ll see what is in that … Every indication is there is a comprehensive strategy being developed consistent with the objective of net-zero [carbon emissions],” he added."
"Take the ferry to the beautiful Greek islands of Santorini and you will sail into a truly unique landscape forged by a cataclysm towards the end of the Bronze Age. From either the north or south your ship will leave the brilliant blue seas of the Aegean and enter a natural harbour flanked by majestic cliffs. Ferries pass between the large island of Thira and the smaller island of Thirasia, while straight ahead a small island in the centre of the natural harbour, Nea Kameni, looks like a molehill surrounded by mountains.  It is on Nea Kameni, among hot springs and sulphurous vents, that you can begin to understand the natural history and formation of this island. The harbour, the cliffs, the elegant white houses with blue roofs; all are part of a huge volcano. Sometime during the mid-second millennium BC, Santorini erupted. It was one of the biggest volcanic events in human history. In the past 800 years only Mount Tambora in Indonesia has erupted with such force, and Tambora was responsible for a global “year without a summer” in 1816. The eruption sent devastating tsunamis across the eastern Mediterranean that smashed into the Minoans on Crete, at the time one of the world’s most advanced civilisations.  The Santorini volcano is a caldera, a type of volcano that erupts so violently that its middle collapses in on itself forming a huge crater. How this crater came to be is the focus of a new paper in Nature Communications by Paraskevi Nomikou and colleagues. They have published high-resolution seabed maps and combined these with seismic evidence for what rocks the seabed is made of in the caldera to explain how the volcano collapsed, filled with water and might have produced tsunamis. Prior to the eruption the modern caldera did not exist. Instead a smaller caldera, from a much older eruption, formed a lagoon at the north of the solitary island. Near the modern town of Akrotiri stood a Minoan settlement, a bustling town with three-storey buildings, narrow streets and courtyards, quite different from the palace complexes found in the Minoan homeland of Crete. The prehistoric Akrotiri may have been home to hundreds or thousands of people, and was probably an important trading port for the eastern Mediterranean. The eruption first blasted ash high into the sky, which settled back down onto the settlements and farmland. This terrifying but not immediately catastrophic stage might have given the locals early warning and caused them to abandon the island (no bodies have been found among the archaeology, which implies residents probably fled).  As the ash continued to be thrown into the air, the island would have been eerily dark with fragments falling from the sky – imagine a severe rainstorm, but of ash and dust. As the ash column grew to its full height it entered the stratosphere and began to spread out and drift east. Ash from this eruption has been found in Turkey, the Aegean islands and Crete.  In the next stage of the eruption pyroclastic flows, hot landslides of volcanic material that travel faster than F1 cars, charged out of the volcanic cone building up large fans that blocked the northwest straits and isolated the caldera from the Mediterranean Sea. The eruption continued to increase in violence with multiple cones sending out considerable amounts of pyroclastic flows. Deposits of these flows reach 60 metres thick (the height of around 14 double decker buses) and engulfed the Minoan settlement at Akrotiri, creating a Bronze Age Pompeii and a spectacular window into an ancient civilisation in the 1600s BC.  It is during this stage that Nomikou and colleagues propose that tsunamis would have been generated. In Crete, 120km away, a nine metre-high wave tore up the northern side of the island leaving devastation and debris in its wake. The waves may have reached western Turkey and even Israel. The seas eventually settled, the eruption ended, and the modern caldera began to form. Erosion by the sea and a catastrophic landslide opened the north-west strait, filling the caldera from the surrounding Mediterranean in a couple of days; further landslides into this full caldera formed the southwestern straits. Completing the modern geography would take several thousand years more as the island of Nea Kameni, an active volcano, gradually erupted above sea-level. While catastrophic, terrifying and probably life-changing for large numbers of people, the Minoans themselves didn’t die out. Though Santorini was not recolonised, evidence from pottery shows civilisation on Crete continued for several generations. However, as a society built on maritime trade the loss of the port of Santorini, which had direct links to the important bronze-producing island of Cyprus, might have diminished their position among the trading powers of the eastern Mediterranean."
"Andrea Leadsom recently delivered a keynote speech on the future of British agriculture to a farming conference in Oxford – which was exactly what you’d expect the UK environment minister to do amid the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Unfortunately, her agenda-setting address opened with the following mistake: For an industry that’s been around as long as mankind itself, farming has been at the centre of human achievement. While there is no reason to expect our national leadership to be well versed in human prehistory and evolution, it would be good to think that some of the fundamentals of our trajectory on this planet were a little better understood.  Crucially, I’d argue, understanding where agriculture as a basis of human subsistence fits into the narrative of human development might have important implications for how, at both national and international levels, the past and future impacts of farming might be better understood. So first some basics. The term “mankind” is a dated and gendered term that has no place in public discourse. The language of “man the hunter”, “man the toolmaker”, “Neanderthal Man” or “Rhodesian Man” should just be consigned to the history books as part of an anthropological vocabulary which did much to separate our species along ever finer lines of division. We should talk about humans and humanity, and that’s what I am going to do here. Now when we consider how long humans have been around, we get to play a little with definitions. If we want to be generous and welcoming to other closely related – but now extinct – species of relatively large-brained, tool-using, bipedal primates we might extend the definition of humanity to include all species of the genus Homo. On the basis of current fossil evidence this might take us back to 2.7m years ago. If we wish to exclude Homo habilis, Homo erectus, antecessor, heidelbergensis, neanderthalensis, floriensis, and all other non-modern humans, from that definition we might focus on our own species Homo sapiens, which we can trace in the fossil record for around some 200,000 years. Working with either extreme of this definition (or any definition of humanity you might care to use in between), the domestication of plant and animal species – which define farming as mentioned by Leadsom – dates only to around 12,000 years ago.  So, however you choose to look at it, agriculture is a very recent addition to the repertoire of human subsistence, say between 1% and 5% of our time on the planet, depending on our definition of “human”. I’d argue that understanding this fact is really important if we are going to manage our continued existence on the planet. In terms of the UK environment agriculture arrived, quite possibly, with colonising populations from France around 6,000 years ago. The arrival of Neolithic culture in the British Isles brought to the end a landscape which, until that time, had responded only to the rhythms of global climate change, wild herbivore grazing and the activities of the hunting and gathering populations of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods. Agriculture, as it grew, spread and intensified across Britain and brought with it the same transformations in human society and environment which we see with its appearance elsewhere on the planet – big changes in forest cover, soil erosion rates, hydrology, human population levels and social dynamics. The adoption and spread of agriculture therefore underpinned a remarkable and rapid transformation of human society and the natural environment of the planet. Humanity, which evolved alongside quite dramatic cycles of global climate change for 3m years, has emerged in the few millennia since the adoption of farming as a significant force in shaping our planet’s future and have begun its first tentative steps on other planetary bodies.  Understanding quite how rapidly this change has come about in evolutionary time is important. The perspective, which the environment minister appears to share, which sees agriculture and the societies and technology predicated on farming as some immeasurably old and stable human condition does not help us put impact of modern agriculture on the planet in a useful perspective.  Along the human timeline, farming should be seen as a relatively recent innovation – and I have little doubt it will form one of the key defining, planet-changing features of the Anthropocene era we have entered. It is therefore important to recognise how recent, in evolutionary time, the appearance of human agricultural societies are and what a truly transformative process engineering parts of the planet’s surface for crops and livestock has been.  Human societies are reliant on, and have been transformed by, agriculture – and there is no going back. To continue to expand and intensify global agriculture without safeguards to the environment – or without fully understanding our impact on the planet – is to stumble blindly and dangerously into the future.  Similarly, disregarding the trajectory of our prehistoric past, and failing to appreciate just how radical the changes of the past 12,000 years have been for our species, leaves us open to complacency at a time when we can afford to be anything but."
"“Sea-level rise” is a loaded statement and instils concern, scepticism and humour. From a sceptical stand point one could think about your own experience. I have been going to the beach near my parents’ house on the south coast of England for nearly 30 years. In all that time I can’t ever remember paddling in the water and thinking, “gosh, this is higher than it was last year”. Yet, over a similar period of time satellite observations show a global average sea-level rise of around 8cm. In fact a trend has been shown to go back further, to the late 19th and early 20th century. The record of observations over the past 100 years or so begs the question, will this rise continue? A new study that colleagues and I have published in PNAS looks at what happens to the sea level at 2°C warming and beyond. Our work, led by Svetlana Jevrejeva of the UK’s National Oceanography Centre, shows two key things.  First, that for an emissions scenario that causes global temperature to rise by 2°C and 5°C relative to the global temperature around 1870, there are a range of sea levels projected from 53cm to 178cm above the level in 2000. Second, that while the global average is projected to increase with rising temperatures, sea levels will not increase by the same amount everywhere. Let’s start with the second point as it will help answer the first. The sea is not level. In fact, it is anything but level. The reason is gravity. The force that keeps your feet firmly on the ground is also acting upon the ocean. The ocean is continually adjusting itself so that its surface – the sea level – feels the same gravitational pull everywhere (called an equipotential surface).  Large things sitting on land, such as ice sheets, are big enough to pull (via their own gravity) the ocean towards them. If bits of an ice sheet or glacier fall off then their ability to pull the ocean towards them is less, so the ocean adjusts, and you have just added water to the ocean that wasn’t in it before which alters the sea level as well. This adjustment is happening all the time. Around 20,000 years ago there used to be some enormous ice sheets over North America and Scandinavia, which pushed down the land surface in those places. As the ice sheets melted the land surface rebounded and is still doing so today. Further from where these ice sheets used to be, the land subsided and its still doing so today. And there was the small matter of all that melted ice raising global sea level by about 120m, which was adjusting itself to keep gravity equal across its surface. The ocean itself has currents (which govern the large-scale transport of heat, freshwater, and nutrients) whose strength cause local increases in the height of sea level. The ocean is also warming up. And a warmer ocean causes the sea level to rise since liquids expand as their temperature increases. Each of the components that contribute to sea level (glaciers, ocean warming, ice sheets and so on) has a unique pattern for how much it will add to sea level in a particular place. If we add them up we get the total sea level at that point and also how much each component has contributed.  This leads us back to the first point, where I said that for each temperature rise there are a range of possible projected sea levels. Scientists have run computer simulations of how different levels of greenhouse gases and aerosols could affect the climate (atmosphere and ocean), the size and shape of glaciers and ice sheets, the amount of water on land that humans can dam and extract, and the way the land and ocean respond to adding and removing ice and water.  The (really really) short result of all this research is that each component shows a range of possible responses to each scenario. By running the computer simulations many times, it appears that certain responses are more likely to happen than others. This allows us to say something about how likely a certain sea-level rise could occur in the future. This is best shown with an example. Let’s take Jakarta. The Indonesian capital is home to around 12m people, of whom nearly 1.6m live less than 450cm above sea-level.  Our most likely projection for a temperature rise of 5°C is 85cm, which is pretty much the same as the global average. However, we can also think about what all those possible responses of each component are for a 5°C warming. In these situations there is a less than 5% chance of sea level being less than 49cm and less than 5% chance of sea level being more than 180cm. In the two cases, different components contribute a different amount (remember they each have a unique pattern). In the “lower” projection (49cm) it is ocean warming that dominates, while in the “higher” projection (180cm) it is the Antarctic ice sheet that dominates, followed by not insignificant contributions from ocean warming, glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet. Of course there are other things going on locally other than these components. For Jakarta, the gravest concern is subsidence. This mega city is sinking, mainly because of groundwater extraction. Projections of subsidence by 2100 for Jakarta are 230-300cm. Put these together with our higher sea level projection and we get 410-480cm of local sea-level rise. Remember the 1.6m people currently who live below 450cm? That number is likely to rise with a growing population. We started with the phrase “sea-level rise”. It is really important that we unpack this sort of phrase to fully understand what it means. We must recognise the difference between a global number and a local number. For Jakarta, global sea-level is important, but the local sea-level matters too. The sea level is not level – we should accept this fact and embrace the complexity of what makes up rising seas."
"We all know the score: current trends predict there will be 9.7 billion mouths to feed by 2050. Producing enough food without using more land, exacerbating climate change or putting more pressure on water, soil and energy reserves will be challenging.  In the past, food security researchers have focused on production with less attention paid to consumer demand and how food is ultimately used in meals. However as developing nations aspire towards the “Western diet”, demand for meat and animal products is rapidly climbing. This is bad news for the planet. Meat is a luxury item and comes at a huge environmental cost. Shuttling crops through animals to make protein is highly inefficient: in US beef, just 5% of the original protein survives the journey from animal feed to meat on the plate. Even milk, which has the best conversion efficiency, has just 40% of the original protein. Consequently, livestock farming requires huge amounts of water and land for grazing and feed production, taking up an estimated 70% of all agricultural land and 27% of the human water footprint. Much of this land is becoming steadily degraded through overgrazing and erosion, prompting farmers to expand into new areas; 70% of cleared forest in the Amazon, for instance, is now pastureland. Livestock production is also one of the greatest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, including 65% of man-made nitrous oxide emissions (which have a global warming potential 296 times greater than CO₂). Nevertheless, millions of people in developing countries still suffer from protein malnutrition. The burden, therefore, must fall on people in richer nations to reduce their meat consumption and embrace other sources of protein. Enter the pulses: beans, peas and lentils. Although generally cheaper than meat, these are rich sources of protein and also come with essential micronutrients including iron, zinc, magnesium and folate. As low GI (glycaemic index) foods, they release their energy slowly over time, preventing surges in blood glucose. Naturally gluten-free, they are also ideal for the rising numbers of those with coeliac disease. Besides being rich in goodness, pulses are also low in many undesirables including cholesterol, fat and sodium, which all contribute to heart and blood issues. In fact, pulses seem to actively protect against these maladies. Numerous studies confirm legume-rich diets can decrease cholesterol levels and when 50g of lentils were added to the diet of diabetic patients, their fasting blood sugar levels significantly decreased. Meanwhile, populations with the greatest lentil consumption also have the lowest rates of breast, prostate and colorectal cancer. This may be partly due to the high fibre content of pulses: increasingly, a high-fibre diet is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. Fibre content may also explain the satiating effect of pulses: for example, incorporating lentils into energy-equivalent meals causes greater fullness and leads to a lower calorie consumption later in the day. Just as they are good for us, beans, lentils and peas are also good for the environment. As they work with bacteria that convert atmospheric nitrogen into useful ammonia or nitrates, legumes actually improve soil fertility and reduce dependence on energy-intensive fertilisers. Pulses are also highly water-efficient; for each gram of protein, the average global water footprint of pulses is only 34% that of pork and 17% that of beef. Meanwhile, the carbon footprint of pulses is less than half that of winter wheat and on average 48 times lower than the equivalent weight of British beef cattle. Despite all this, the potential of pulses is largely unrecognised. Currently demand is dominated by India and Pakistan, however poor yields mean the two countries import more than 20% of global pulse production. Even big exporters like Australia and Canada remain inefficient, achieving barely half the yield per acre found in Croatia. This “yield gap” exists because these countries typically grow pulses as animal feed or to break up crop rotations. Optimising pulse harvests in both developing and developed nations could thus be an easy way to boost global protein production. Nevertheless, pulses face traditional barriers in the West, including the need for overnight soaking, unappealing tastes and potential flatulence from a high-fibre diet. To overcome these, ingredient manufacturers have developed pulses into new functional ingredients that provide all the benefits of eating whole pulses. These already include pasta, crackers, batters, flours and egg/meat-replacement products.  Even so, we should all consider how much meat we really need. A more plant-based diet is a winning strategy for our wallets, our health and the environment. Falafel, anyone?"

Hans von Storch’s blogsite Klimazwiebel has a good excellent article written by one of the world’s leading meteorologists, Lennart Bengtsson, who writes that the alarmist hype needs to be toned down, and that the problem of energy be taken more seriously.

Lennart Bengtsson, a warmist, is the former director of Germany’s Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, which unfortunately has recently turned emotional and alarmist on the topic of climate change.
Here are some cherry-picked excerpts that pretty much set the tone of the article:
“Natural processes drive climate and practically all kinds of extreme weather have always been part of the climate and are practically unrelated to the modest warming we so far have had. The effect of increasing greenhouse gases is a slow but relentless process that will have to be dealt with but will require more time and better insight in key processes.”
“Since the end of the 19th century the global warming amounts to about ¾ °C. This is a very modest increase…”
“The lack of any significant warming in the tropical troposphere since the beginning of space observations in 1979 is particularly intriguing in particular as present models show a warming trend over the same time of 0.3-0.4°C in the average, figure 2.”
“…global warming has been taken out of the hands of the meteorologists and traditional climatologists and is now run by professional media experts…”
“…very emotional climate debate today…hardly possible to have a sensible and balanced exchange of views. If you do not support climate catastrophes…you are placed into a deniers box... Some of our colleagues are exposed to a powerful group pressure, …”
For Greenpeace and the WWF, “a threatening climate warming have become a necessity and a source of extra income.”
“…feedbacks of the climate system dominate the outcome but are unfortunately so far not well handled by models…”
“…climate is in fact warming much slower than anticipated.”

UPDATE: QUESTION TO PROF BENGTSSON FROM ED CARYL
Dear Dr. Bengtsson, Why Is it CO2 And Not The Sun?
I have several problems with the assumptions made by Lennart Bengtsson in his article Global climate change and its relevance for a global energy policy, but this one is central to the whole argument, and it is a point I raised last week in my article Global Warming Has Peaked…Set To Switch To Cooling. “If You Look At History, This Is Easy To See”. All the CAGW Climatologists make a first, and nearly only, assumption that CO2 drives the global temperature to the exclusion of anything else. I just wish to point out the similarity between his Figure 1, and my graphs below.

Figure 1 is Lennart Bengtsson’s Figure 1.

Figure 2a and 2b are my Figures 6 and 7.
The ratio of y-axis scale in Bengtsson’s Figure 1 is 0.314 °K per W/m2 for CO2 forcing, and in my figures is 0.2875 °C per W/m2 for solar forcing, a difference of less than 10%.
My question to Prof. Bengtsson: So which do you think is driving temperature? A response would be very much appreciated.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA team of scientists led by HE YuXin of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Hong Kong examined two lake cores extracted from the Tibetan Plateau in order to reconstruct the past temperature development.

The two cores coming from two different lakes go back 2600 and 2200 years respectively.
Here’s the paper’s abstract (my emphasis):
Considerable efforts have been made to extend temperature records beyond the instrumental period through proxy reconstructions, in order to further understand the mechanisms of past climate variability. Yet, the global coverage of existing temperature records is still limited, especially for some key regions like the Tibetan Plateau and for earlier times including the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Here we present decadally-resolved, alkenone-based, temperature records from two lakes on the northern Tibetan Plateau. Characterized by marked temperature variability, our records provide evidence that temperatures during the MWP were slightly higher than the modern period in this region. Further, our temperature reconstructions, within age uncertainty, can be well correlated with solar irradiance changes, suggesting a possible link between solar forcing and natural climate variability, at least on the northern Tibetan Plateau.

You can downnload or read the entire paper here.
Here we see that the Medieval Warm Period also very much existed in Asia, and was not just a local European phenomenon, as some scientists tried to suggest in the past. The past 2000 years have been marked by temperature variability  – despite CO2 remaining constant at about 280 ppm – with a strong correlation to solar activity.

The paper’s conclusion also adds:

Our records show that the regional temperatures during the MWP exceeded those in the recent warm period. The estimated warmth during the MWP optimum relative to the recent level could be bracketed by the ~1.9°C estimated from Lake Gahai and ~0.5°C from Lake Qinghai. Therefore, the MWP warmth was probably in a climate state beyond the climate variability captured by the recent warm period, joining a growing body of such evidence elsewhere.

The paper proposes a “possible link between solar forcing and natural variability“. My my, aren’t we surprised!

Share this...FacebookTwitterBig, embarrassing news for German climate scientists.
With 11 days remaining, Germany this year is set for its 5th colder-than-normal winter (DJF) in a row (a record), this according to high-profile German meteorologist Dominik Jung at www.wetter.net here (photo left). Jung is an often-quoted meteorology expert of the German media.
I’m really quite (pleasantly) surprised because I recall sharply criticizing, even berating, Jung in a post about a year or two ago for believing all the warmist rubbish. I guess five cold, snowy winters in a row have been enough to get Jung to take closer look. His tone and music have changed completely.
Jung begins his post with:
Just a few years ago climate experts prophesied that Germany would no longer experience winters with ice and snow in the future. In the 1990s there had been an entire series of milder and stormier winters. […] However, this trend has not been observed over the last years. To the contrary: winters have again gotten considerably colder and the huge storms like those in the 1990s have more or less disappeared. […]. Climate experts prophesied in the year 2000 that winters with snow and ice in Germany would cease to exist.”
Jung then presents the data for Germany’s last 4 winters and that of the current winter, and compares them to the 1980-2010 mean winter temperature, which was 0.8°C above the 1960-1990 mean.
– 2008/2009: 1.0 °C cooler
– 2009/2010: 2.0 °C cooler
– 2010/2011:  1.3 °C cooler
– 2011/2012: 0.1 °C cooler
– 2012/2013 (so far): 0.4°C. cooler
We should recall that whatever applies for Germany, also applies for much of Central Europe. Moreover, Jung mentions that the results are the same if you compare the five winters to the 1970 -2000 period. Jung summarizes the results:
With the current winter, we now have 5 winters in a row that have been colder than the long-term average! Crafty scientists at first explained that climate warming was just taking a timeout. Strangely, this timeout has now been going on for 5 years without interruption. Accordingly things have gotten very quiet in the climate warming debate.”
Yes indeed it has. Germany’s prestigious research institutes and leading climatologists, such as “internationally recognized” Prof. Dr. Mojib Latif, Head of both the Research Division Ocean Circulation and Climate Dynamics and the Research Unit Marine Meteorology of the IFM-GEOMAR of Kiel, Germany, and “renowned” Prof. Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf of the influential Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research (PIK), or Prof. Dr. Jochem Marotzke of the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg are now stumped, baffled and confused by this unexpected development, which completely contradicts their earlier super-computer models. Indeed, most of the German warmist modellers have since gone back and revamped their models, and are now suddenly claiming that the colder winters are actually a sign of global warming! But for much of the remaining German science community, these once prestigious scientists are beginning to increasingly look like laughing stocks of the new century.

Jung did his homework, and also checked to see how the earlier models have been doing for the summers (JJA). Jung writes:
By the way, according to many climate projections, also summers in Germany were supposed to get increasingly drier and hotter. Over the last 10 summers, only one summer was too dry, and that was the summer of 2003. Otherwise all summers were either average or much too wet.”
The models got the summers wrong 9 consecutive years in a row! So expect the Latif and the other hapless scientists to roll out new models soon. Jung continues:
The earlier climate projections and prognoses of the 80s and 90s are more or less way off, at least for Germany and Europe. Because of the current situation with the facts, they simply no longer fit and must be urgently revamped, otherwise we will wind up with credibility problems here.”
Too late. As mentioned above, the scientists are already laughing stocks and many of us have been rolling on the floor with laughter for quite some time. Jung:
People aren’t stupid and they recognise what the facts are. So let’s look and see just how much longer this timeout is supposed to go.”
If he hasn’t done so already, Jung ought to pick up a copy of Die kalte Sonne. It’ll remove any remaining doubts he may have.
There you have it. The climate models have been wrong in the winter 5 years in a row, and wrong in the summer nine years in a row. That’s even far worse then random guessing. This is an incredible performance.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRoger at Tallbloke’s Talkshop here has gotten a letter from CRU lawyers suggesting he not mess around with the recently released Climategate e-mails, which are accessible using a password. The CRU apparently is very concerned about personal data ending up in public, which is a legitimate, of course. Yet, we can’t help but think they are really much more concerned about something else, e.g. the exposure of science shenanigans and possible large-scale fraud taking place at the UEA.
Luckily Lord Christopher Monckton is watching out for the bloggers, and has kindly provided some legal advice, which I am taking the privilege of disseminating further. Naturally privacy laws vary from country to country, and so you should check them out.
Here’s Christopher Monckton’s suggested response, in the event it can be of help to anyone else:
Roger: You do not need a lawyer for this one. Reply as follows:
Gentlemen, – I have received an email from you in which you purport to act for the University of East Anglia. I do not require any lectures from this corrupt institution or from its purported lawyers about how to behave. I neither confirm nor deny having received the password to which you refer. If I choose to reproduce any emails that may become available to me, I shall exercise my own discretion and common sense without benefit of your unsolicited instruction.
Inferentially, the Climategate emails were released by a whistleblower at the University who was as horrified as are all true lovers of science at the systematic scientific corruption and fraud that is made evident in the emails. The whistleblower says he wished to warn the world that the scientific basis for the diversion of trillions from the taxpayers’ pockets to various global-warming profiteers was in doubt. I am unable to contact the whistleblower, but he has done a great service to science by releasing the emails.
In the light of your email, I shall now convey all information in my possession to an international investigation team that is scrutinizing the fraudulent aspects of climate science, including without limitation the Climategate emails. I shall be inviting the team – which includes eminent police officers specializing in the investigation of complex international frauds and organized crime – to consider the role that the University, its vice-chancellor, its head of research, its climate research unit and (in the light of your bullying email and of the University’s previous misconduct in sicking anti-terrorist police on to me) its lawyers may have played in conspiring to perpetrate and to perpetuate the fraud, whether as instigators or as accessories during or after the fact of the fraud.
You will no doubt recall the adage about the pot that called the kettle black. – Tallbloke”

Today more than 40 years later the planet has a population of over 7 billion and experts are warning of another global menace: obesity.

Ehrlich’s prophesy was pure rubbish.
At the Achse des Guten website here Benny Peiser brings our attention to a short report in the German media. The report is good news and is of global significance, and so you’d think it would be worthy of front page news. Not so with today’s cynical, catastrophe-obsessed media. The best they could do was write an obscure itty-bitty blurb and bury it deep in their website pages. The public doesn’t need to know about this.
The online German RP writes:
According estimates of the UN Agricultural Organization, the global grain production will reach a record high with 2.5 billion tonnes. That means an increase of 7% over a year earlier. Wheat production will increase by almost 7% to a high of 700 million tonnes. Therefore it will be able to more than offset the drop of last year.”
Rice production also has not withered away, rising 2%, the RP writes.
So what about all the bad climate change that was supposed to have a massively negative impact on crops? All silly Ehrlich-type scare stories as usual. Agricultural output continues its overall climb. There’s even food to burn in millions of cars.

"A recent Conversation piece pointed out that the British electricity mix in 2016 was the cleanest in 60 years, with record capacity from renewable energy, mainly from wind and solar power. But one problem with this great expansion in renewables is they are intermittent, meaning they depend on weather conditions such as the wind blowing or sun shining. Unlike conventional power, this means they can’t necessarily meet surges in demand. Hence many press headlines in recent years about the “lights going out”.  National Grid, the UK grid operator, has several ways of ensuring supply can always meet demand. For shorter gaps in generation, it asks electricity suppliers to run their conventional power stations at below maximum potential output and ramp up as needed.  For longer gaps, it ensures power stations, particularly gas-based ones, are kept on standby. Some stations may only be asked to generate power for between several dozen and a few hundred hours a year. Besides contributing to carbon emissions, operating power plants for such short interventions is expensive.  The question is what to do about this problem. We could build less renewable power and make conventional power “greener” instead by removing the CO₂ and burying it underground. Opinion divides on when these carbon capture technologies can be made commercially viable on a large scale. In the UK, unfortunately two government kickstarter projects have floundered due to concerns about costs and departmental disagreements. An alternative is to install very big (“grid scale”) batteries capable of storing renewable power to be released when required. This has generated a lot of interest lately. But given the costs of current battery technology, grid-scale storage requires expensive upfront investments.  While researchers study these problems, the UK is developing an alternative known as demand-side response. One aspect involves rewarding certain electricity consumers for reducing their usage at short notice. This can range from large industrial customers to smaller consumers using power for heating rooms, cooling, lighting or even refrigeration.  The other aspect of demand response involves asking customers who own equipment that can store power to help balance surges in demand. For example, the owners of a house equipped with solar panels and corresponding battery storage might reduce repayment costs on the equipment by making the battery units available to the grid. Other equipment in this category includes electric vehicles and hospital/university uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units.  Both types of demand response are happening already. Some industrial power customers and certain other companies such as hotel operators have contracts for reducing power, while National Grid has been attracting much bidder interest for power storage schemes and has some underway in parts of the country. This storage is an alternative to deploying large-scale batteries, and  promises to be much more economical if we can make it work on a large enough scale.  The problem is that these schemes get more complicated once the pool of customers gets beyond a certain size. Knowing which customers to sign up and what tariffs to offer requires understanding to what extent devices will be available and at what cost, for example.  Once a pool of customers is set up, some devices might not always be available for storage or reducing demand when needed. This needs to be factored into the calculations both to minimise grid disruption and incentivise customers to participate at these times.  There can also be undesired effects, such as large simultaneous rebounds in consumption. For example many refrigerators will draw extra power to get their internal temperature below the required level when a demand response period ends.  Finally there’s a potential major security issue: a central system that collects data about energy usage from many devices may be prone to malicious attacks and information tampering. This could undermine both grid balancing and keeping track of what customers are owed.  Emerging artificial intelligence technologies look like providing answers to these challenges. To select the best participants, for example, grid operators will be able to use sophisticated machine-learning techniques to model the behaviour of individual devices and battery storage units by reviewing data from smart meters and sensors.  Once signed up for grid storage, it should be possible to estimate the useful lifetime of a battery pack or unit by applying prognostic algorithms to its charging/discharging data. Owners will then receive appropriate compensation, plus the added incentive of knowing how long their battery will last.  When it comes to managing devices in the pool, people used to think we could use individual smart meters or control devices to feed a central server in the cloud. But meters are expensive and the short response times require the cloud server to analyse data in milliseconds, which looks unfeasible once many thousands of units are in a pool.  An alternative is to have metering devices which detect demand levels on the grid themselves and reduce power accordingly. These take pressure off the central server and it only requires metering at site level, rather than for every electrical device. But it still leaves you with a complex control problem in coordinating all these individual decisions. We at Heriot-Watt are working on a solution to this using AI-based algorithms.  Another line of AI research draws on insights from algorithmic game theory to develop reward/penalty mechanisms which ensure enough customers in the pool are willing to participate, and actually respond when necessary. Researchers are also optimistic that blockchain protocols, using the same technology as Bitcoin, could underpin a decentralised ledger system that would get round the security risk of having a single storage point for user data.   Numerous AI research groups, both in the UK and elsewhere, have been addressing these challenges, while a number of start-ups have started developing such systems in practice – relatively simple versions of machine learning are now beginning to be used, for instance. The UK has a good chance to be at the forefront of international efforts to make smarter demand response a reality over the next few years."
"In Kaziranga, a national park in north-eastern India, rangers shoot people to protect rhinos. The park’s aggressive policing is, of course, controversial, but the results are clear: despite rising demand for illegal rhino horn, and plummeting numbers throughout Africa and South-East Asia, rhinos in Kaziranga are flourishing.  Yet Kaziranga, which features in a new BBC investigation, highlights some of the conflicts that characterise contemporary conservation, as the need to protect endangered species comes into contact with the lives and rights of people who live in and around the increasingly threatened national parks. India must balance modernisation and development with protections for the rights of local people – all while ensuring its development is ecologically sustainable. To understand what’s at stake in Kaziranga, consider these three crucial issues: The BBC feature shows park rangers who have been given the license to “shoot-on-sight”, a power they have used with deadly effect. In 2015 more than 20 poachers were killed – more than the numbers of rhino poached that year.  The programme accuses the rangers of extra-judicial killings of suspected rhino poachers. This resonates with a wider trend in the use of violence in defence of the world’s protected areas and the growing use of military surveillance technologies to support the efforts of conservation agencies. In India, the Forest Department, which is responsible for the protection of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, has always been a “uniformed” service. Rangers wear military-style khakis, are allowed to carry arms, and have powers to prosecute offenders. Recently, the government allowed them to use drones as an anti-poaching measure in Kaziranga. To justify such escalation and its talk of a “war” against poaching, the government cites the growing power and sophistication of the crime syndicates involved in the illegal wildlife trade. However, as with all wars, a serious conflict over rhinos risks collateral damage. The worry is that increased militarisation is not conducted within strict legal limits or subject to judicial scrutiny. The BBC alleges that such checks and balances were not in place in Kaziranga. The BBC story also points to the growing conflict in and around Kaziranga between the interests and rights of local and indigenous people and the need to protect threatened species. Groups including Survival International – which features in the BBC story – claim that well-meaning conservation projects have denied and undermined the rights of indigenous groups around the world. The group calls for these rights to be placed at the heart of modern approaches to conservation – and most enlightened environmentalists now agree. It’s increasingly hard to look at conservation without also considering human rights and social issues.  The context for these struggles in India is the colonial legacy of forest settlement, which reserved forests for the imperial state, but failed to take account of the rights of people who already lived there. This injustice was recognised in 2006, in landmark legislation known colloquially as the Forest Rights Act, which restored both individual and community rights based on evidence of historic access and use. Yet there remains significant tension between India’s wildlife conservation lobby, which perceives the Forest Rights Act as the death-knell for nature, and groups such as Survival International which argue that it is only by recognising the rights of local people that the country’s wildlife will be protected. To protect threatened species across the world, conservationists have called for more and more land to be placed under protection. Renowned biologist EO Wilson, for instance, wants us to set aside “half the planet”. In an unconstrained world, dedicating half the earth to the protection of the most threatened species and the world’s important habitats might seem like a sensible way to avoid the risks of what people fear might trigger the next great extinction. In reality, there are few places left where such a proposal might practically be implemented. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in rapidly developing India. The country already has a population of 1.3 billion – and it aspires to both develop as a global economic powerhouse and lift its poorest people out of poverty. This development requires land and resources, with little space left for nature. Plans to double the size of Kaziranga means villagers are being displaced with little due process and there are documented cases of violence and even death. This is a violent “green grab”, where land is usurped for ostensibly progressive environmental objectives, but which results in the dispossession of some of the most vulnerable people on this planet. Kaziranga illustrates the dilemmas of contemporary conservation. If it is to be successful, environmentalism in India must be seen as part of the changing social and economic context, and not set itself up in opposition to these wider trends. Conservation needs to recognise the need to build bridges, sometimes with its fiercest critics. While Kaziranga is in many ways a remarkable conservation success, its costs are considerable. The forces driving the world to overuse its resources haven’t gone away, and finding sustainable futures for both people and the planet requires coalitions that work together – let’s begin with Kaziranga."

"Ready to get over your post-festive comedown by booking an escape to the sun? For many of you, that will involve flying. And while I’m sorry to put a downer on your holiday plans, there are several problems with this from a climate perspective. The first is that aviation is essentially a fossil fuel industry, one which guzzles an eye-watering 5m barrels of oil every day. Burning that fuel currently contributes around 2.5% to total carbon emissions, a proportion which could rise to 22% by 2050 as other sectors emit less. The second problem is, as Air Asia puts it, “Now everyone can fly”. And in “generation easyJet”, those who already fly, fly more than ever. This increasing demand from new and existing travellers means the number of passenger aircraft in our skies is set to double by 2035. The third problem is that unlike other sectors where there might be a greener alternative (solar not coal, LEDs not lightbulbs etc), there is currently no way to fly 8m people every day without burning lots of dirty kerosene. Aircraft are becoming more fuel-efficient, but not quickly enough to offset the huge demand in growth. Electric planes remain decades away, weighed down by batteries that can’t deliver nearly as much power per kilo as jet fuel.  But here’s the peculiar thing: although no other human activity pushes individual emission levels as fast and as high as air travel, most of us don’t stop to think about its carbon impact.  While in many countries new cars, domestic appliances, and even houses now have mandatory energy efficiency disclosures, air travel’s carbon footprint is largely invisible, despite it being relatively much bigger. For instance, a return trip from Europe to Australia creates about 4.5 tonnes of carbon. You could drive a car for 2,000 kilometres and still emit less than that. And the average per capita emissions globally is around 1 tonne. Several studies have found people to be quite ignorant of how their own flying behaviour contributes to climate change. It’s not hard to see why. Research into airline websites shows little mention of environmental impact. Green NGOs are often quiet on the issue, perhaps being reluctant to “preach” to their members to fly less, and concerned over accusations of hypocrisy as their own staff fly around the world to conferences. Political leaders are also unwilling to point the finger at passenger-voters. Indeed, Tony Blair asked as prime minister in 2005 “how many politicians facing a potential election would vote to end cheap air travel?” His answer: zero. The political strategy seems to be passing the buck to the airline industry, and hoping for the best. Aviation is a golden goose for politicians. In the UK, where sources of future post-Brexit economic growth are hard to identify, the industry looks set to continue its enviable historic growth-rate of 4-5% annually. The main problem for airlines now is finding enough space to accommodate planes at crowded airports such as Heathrow. Airlines’ seductive message to politicians is “If you build it, they will come.” And the primary reason that they will come is because flying is kept artificially cheap, while trains and cars become more expensive. The main reason for this is the so-called “Chicago Convention”, agreed in 1944 by a then much smaller air industry, which prohibits countries from imposing jet fuel tax and VAT on international flights. Taxes on other forms of transport have increased dramatically since 1944 but thanks to the convention aviation has remained almost unscathed. Things have actually moved in the other direction since the 1990s, when an influx of low-cost carriers led to big cost savings and even lower ticket prices. What is to be done? Aviation, along with shipping, was given special status and excluded from the Kyoto and Paris climate change agreements. The industry was tasked to come up with its own solutions instead. After much foot-dragging, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), finally addressed aviation emissions in 2016, proposing a market-based mechanism, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under CORSIA, countries’ airlines are given allowances to emit carbon, and if they exceed their allowances (which they will) then they must buy offsets from other sectors. Yet the plan is not nearly radical enough. It doesn’t even come into power for another decade, and it does nothing to stifle demand – unlike a carbon tax. As we can see, regulating the environmental impact of flying is a complex business. Ignorance and inaction is an appealing reaction to complexity, but we need to act before aviation gobbles up more of the increasingly small wriggle-room for emission cuts. We can try and reduce the number of flights taken, buy carbon offsets for unavoidable flights, and question the broader logic of allowing the industry to grow ad infinitum. Just using a carbon calculator to learn about the carbon impact of our sunny escapades is a good start. If citizens remain blissfully unaware of aviation emissions, then airlines and governments are unlikely to do anything about them. Alternatively, if governments ever wish to place a global carbon tax on flights, then they will need to create political “buy-in” from citizens who increasingly see cheap flights as a right."
"The Democratic governor of Wisconsin is launching a taskforce to brainstorm ways to cut climate pollution, despite inevitable pushback from the state’s Republican-controlled legislature. Tony Evers has vowed Wisconsin will meet the goals of the international Paris climate agreement, even as Donald Trump aims to leave the pact and has discounted climate science, rescinded pollution efforts and promoted fossil fuels.  Evers’ executive order establishing the taskforce calls the climate crisis “a grave threat to the health, safety and economic wellbeing of people and communities throughout the state of Wisconsin”. Evers is one of two dozen governors in the Climate Alliance, whose members have pledged to reduce their states’ heat-trapping pollution at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025. Wisconsin is also trying to use only carbon-free electricity by 2050, even though it currently gets about half its power from coal. Eliminating Wisconsin’s climate footprint would require transformative changes to its electrical, transportation, industrial and agricultural sectors. Wisconsin’s lieutenant governor, Mandela Barnes, who will lead the taskforce, said that to achieve its full potential, Wisconsin needs a federal government “that is less ridiculous than the federal government we have now”. “But there are still opportunities for states. And that’s why you see so many governors who joined the US Climate Alliance,” Barnes said. The taskforce’s recommendations are due in less than a year, but there is no timeline outlined for implementing the suggestions. Barnes acknowledged that state Republicans will argue any climate efforts would raise costs, but he said Wisconsin voters want action. “I want us to get back to a place where we look at our manufacturing roots here in Wisconsin. Where we’re building wind turbines, we’re building solar panels. That should honestly get Republicans excited as well – I don’t see why they’re so reluctant to ignore the largest sector of opportunity in the economy,” Barnes said. The state’s ambitions demonstrate a divide in American government that is halting progress on the climate crisis. While Democrats are moving forward with climate proposals, they face opposition from Republicans. Even if climate-minded cities and states achieve their goals, they will fall short of what the US has pledged to the world. They don’t have the same level of authority the federal government has to restrict high-polluting cars and trucks, limit plane pollution and encourage interstate power lines that could carry clean electricity. And the Trump administration has fought back against some of the steps taken, including California’s laws to require automakers to produce more efficient vehicles that use less gasoline. The Wisconsin taskforce will look at ways to limit pollution and adapt to rising temperatures and more extreme weather. Paul Graham, another taskforce member and president of the Central Waters Brewing Company, said he’s “hopeful but realistic” that the group will come up with feasible solutions that could move forward, given the split government. State Republicans have fought climate action across the board. Some have sought harsher penalties for protesters around energy infrastructure, like oil and gas pipelines. Others advanced legislation to prohibit local bans on plastic bags. Amber Meyer Smith, a taskforce member and government relations director of the advocacy group Clean Wisconsin, said the state has been “far behind the curve”. “We know that the public wants to see action – there are so many consequences of climate change that we are dealing with right now,” Smith said. Xcel Energy, one of the state’s greenest power companies, praised the creation of the group. More than half of the utility’s electricity sources for Wisconsin – 56% – are carbon-free. “We think this makes good sense for us, good business sense, good economic sense, and it’s the right thing to do,” said Mark Stoering, the company’s president in Wisconsin and Michigan."

The Sun in June 2013 – on the way to a grand minimum? New study on the possible consequences

by Frank Bosse
Solar activity has also been very modest this month. One has been able to observe only 48% of the mean value of the activity of the previous cycles for the current cycle, the sunspot number was only 52,5. Here’s how it looks graphically:

Sunspot number (SSN) versus months after the start of the cycle.
With respect to the previous month, with 78.7 it is a significant decrease. This is clear when compared to Cycle No. 5, which here has long been used as a reference for a weak 11 year Schwabe cycle. In the middle curve it is plain to see that statistically, the maximum is already passed. And in the case of the current SC24? An anyswer may be provided by the polar magnetic field of the sun, the poles reverse at the maximum:
 

Source: leif.org
The difference between the field strength of the northern and southern polar fields has clearly reversed signs, meaning the SC24’s maximum is most likely history. It had already occurred in November 1997 with a SSN of 96.7 . The comparison of the summed sunspot anomaly taking into account the the discontinuity of the counting method about 1945 shows that the current SC 24 is the weakest in almost 200 years:

In our monthly series in consideration of solar activity, a number of authors have been brought up who think it’s probable that the sun is headed for a grand minimum similar to the Maunder- Minimums of 1649-1715. That may already manifest itself in 2020. There have already been studies that attempt to project the impacts on global temperatures. Included here is a study from Meehl et al. 2013. As an input the authors look at an approximately 0.25% reduction in Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) between 2020 and 2070:

Source: Meehl et al. 2013
They fed this into a climate model. Result: global temperatures could drop around 0,2…0,3 degrees Celsius with local peak values of up to 0.8°C, especially in the middle and upper latitudes of the northern hemispheres:

Source: Figure 3c of Meehl et al. 2013. 
The model used by Meehl et al. employs a high climate sensitivity with respect to greenhouse gases, foremost CO2, and it is thus little wonder that the shown cooling with respect to the warming on top of it in the simulation only has a temporary effect and a moderate braking effect. The questions that a critical observer may ask are the following:

Is the magnitude of sensitivity with regards to GHG in the model really assured when we consider the current stagnation of global temperatures since at least 2001 – while CO2 has steadily increased?
Is the TSI in the paper, viewed as the “motor”, solely what one could expect to act or does spectral variation (especially UV) make an additional contribution? The same needs to be asked about the significantly increasing galactic cosmic radiation.

We see: Forecasts are very difficult – especially when they concern the future.”

"Summer seems to have finally arrived, and many people are enjoying the temporary warmth of the British coastlines. Unfortunately, this has been accompanied by a plethora of Jaws-inspired shark sightings and lurid newspaper articles.  I’m here to tell you to ignore those headlines. Sharks in the British Isles are something to be cherished, not feared. Every year newspapers sensationalise shark sightings, taking every opportunity to sell more papers and have fleeting fame with viral articles. While our fascination with sharks is undeniable, whether it is from admiration or fearfulness, many of these articles are misrepresenting sharks and creating unnecessary panic among beachgoers. UK waters are home to many more beautiful and varied sharks than you might initially think. Ranging from the smaller species such as lesser-spotted catsharks and the glow in the dark velvet belly lantern sharks, all the way through to the huge basking sharks and even sometimes greenland sharks, about 40 species can be found around the British Isles. This includes year-round residents such as smoothhounds, or black mouth catsharks, but also seasonal visitors. During the summer months, warming waters bring in fish such as mackerel and sprat as they migrate in from southerly or offshore waters to feed. Migratory blue, mako and thresher sharks often follow this temporary flux of smaller fish, all visiting local waters to feed within these summer festivals of fish. Every year without fail, claims start appearing that a huge great white shark has been seen somewhere near the UK. This poster species is occasionally spotted in Europe, but to date there have been no confirmed sightings or catches in the UK. Considering the huge amount of fishing that occurs off British shores, if the island did have regular visits from white shark, I’m sure we would have seen one by now. Large shark sightings can usually be attributed to a few species. Most tend to be the bus-sized basking shark. This leviathan of a shark is completely harmless though. Being a filter feeder, it can often be seen swimming around Cornwall or the Hebrides with its mouth wide open, hoovering up sudden blooms of tiny animals such as plankton. Close relatives porbeagle and mako sharks are also often misidentified as white sharks. While similar in shape to the untrained eye, these sharks have more of a taste for fast swimming fish and squid. Although mauled marine life does sometimes wash ashore, sparking tabloid fears of monster sharks, these injuries are often the work of boat propellers, seals and scavenging birds or fish.  A huge proportion of Britain’s shark diversity will unfortunately go almost entirely unseen. These are the wonderfully alien deep-sea sharks and the British Isles have an astonishing variety of them. There are about 26 species of deep-sea shark that live in waters from 500 metres down to 2,500 metres and can be found in the deep-water off the west coast of Scotland and Ireland. Despite the incredible number of different shark species in British waters, there has never once been a fatal “attack” on humans. Although, in 1937, a basking shark capsized a boat in Kintyre, Scotland, causing all three crew members to drown. But the rare bites that have been documented are often sustained by recreational fishermen while trying to tackle sharks onto their boats. Humans pose a much greater threat to sharks than they do to us. A recent study in the North Sea found that high levels of fishing, climate changes and habitat destruction have likely caused significant changes in shark numbers over the past century. Additionally, severe declines in other larger species such as the porbeagle and mako sharks have also been blamed on heavy unregulated fishing. Although many fisheries are required to adhere to strict fishing quotas, there are currently no annual limits for certain species of European sharks. About a hundred millions sharks are killed globally every year, often targeted for their fins which are then sold to Asian markets for shark fin soup. In recent years, as other fish stocks have declined, shark meat is increasingly making its way on to the market though. Unless science-based regulations are implemented in the near future, UK shark sightings, while already rare, may disappear altogether. So if you do see a shark in British waters this summer, don’t panic – you just got lucky. "
"One of the world’s largest solar power projects has just been completed in southern India. At 648 megawatts (MW), the Kamuthi solar plant can generate as much electricity as most coal or nuclear power stations. This is great news. But it must be only the start of an unprecedented Indian solar boom. For the country to achieve its Paris climate pledges it will need hundreds more Kamuthis.  India has become one of the big names in renewable energy in recent years. The country championed the International Solar Alliance, an initiative launched a year ago at COP21 in Paris which is expected to be ratified at the follow-up COP22 in Morocco. It aims to mobilise US$1 trillion (£790 billion) to develop 1 terawatt of global solar power by 2030 – that’s four times more than the current worldwide total.  India has made a good start. Among its many ambitious policies include plans for more resilient grids and the deployment of large-scale energy storage to retain intermittent solar and wind power for when it’s needed. The country also aims to become, by 2030, a 100% electric vehicle nation. Impressive renewable energy projects are springing up across India. Kamuthi’s completion means the state of Tamil Nadu now hosts both the world’s second largest solar plant and one of the world’s largest onshore windfarms. Even bigger solar plants are being built further west, in Kanataka state and in Andra Pradesh along the east coast. This is all part of an ambitious plan to deploy 100GW of solar power by 2022 (for reference, the current the global total is around 223GW). The government has pledged tens of billions of dollars to these projects, while a very strong private and foundation grant-based movement is encouraging smaller-scale solar, including micro-grids and off-grid systems. Huge headline-grabbing solar projects don’t tell the whole story, however. India’s energy generation remains among the least sustainable of the world’s large countries. Fossil fuels, mostly imported, account for 75% of primary energy. More than 80% of its electricity comes from coal. India couldn’t replace that overnight – even if it wanted to, there aren’t enough wind turbines and solar panels in the world. The transition to renewable energy could take decades.  Ahead of the Paris conference last year, India pledged that, by 2030, coal would generate only 60% of its electricity. However this is not because coal plants would be phased out, but because more solar and wind farms will meet growing demand. This won’t reduce the country’s emissions – it’ll simply decrease the rate at which they are growing. To further back up the idea that Delhi isn’t about to ditch fossil fuels any time soon, just look at the recent US$13 billion (£10bn) investment by Russia’s state-owned Rosneft in India’s Essar Oil, or early plans to construct a gas pipeline from Siberia to India worth US$25 billion (£20bn). Even the electric car strategy isn’t as good as it first sounds. On the surface, the government’s plan to introduce subsidies and ensure all vehicles on the road are electric by 2030 sounds similar to proposals in Norway and Germany. But there is a missing link in policy coordination somewhere: all those newly-commissioned solar farms won’t be able to power the electric cars by themselves – and existing coal power plants will still be needed. Effectively, India will replace petrol with coal and may even need to expand coal power: thus actually increasing emissions. To appreciate the scale of the challenge, let us compare a few different future scenarios for the country’s energy system.  In the chart below, A and B represent the predictions of the International Energy Agency and the US government respectively. Scenario C is India’s own pledges under the Paris agreement, including its solar plan – this is what the government is hoping to achieve.  My colleagues and I engineered a best-case scenario, where India generates enough energy to keep its economy running, but still does its fair share of global efforts to keep warming below 2°C. This is scenario D in the chart.  Scientists have calculated there is a certain amount of fossil fuel we can  safely extract in future while still staying within the 2°C carbon cap. This is the global carbon budget. In all four scenarios, we assumed that India would be allocated a very generous 50% of the global budget – yes, half of the world’s safely extractable fossil fuels – despite having just 18% of the population. Yet even if India is “allowed” these generous emissions, it will still need around ten times more solar and wind power than under the government’s current trajectory. Just look at the enormous difference in the green and yellow sections of the above charts. Our scenario calls for 1,500GW of Indian photovoltaic generation capacity by 2030. This will be tough but is certainly not impossible. First India must keep on track with its 100GW by 2022 plan and continue to boost its solar panel manufacturing industry to compete with China. Perhaps then, with a little nudge from the private sector and small community cooperatives, we might well witness a true energy revolution."

===========================================
Germany – A Winter Fairy Tale
By Klaus-Eckart Puls and Sebastian Lüning (translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Currently this 2012/13 winter in Germany and over large parts of Europe we’ve been finding lots of cold, snow and ice –  the fifth winter of this type in a row. Who can still recall the prognoses and claims of some alarmists of the established climate science community, like this one [1]?:
‘Winter with strong frosts and lots of snow like 20 years ago will cease to exist at our latitudes,’ said scientist Mojib Latif of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg.”
This quote comes from an interview with SPIEGEL in the year 2000. The headline: “Good-bye winter: No more snow? In Germany bitter cold winters are now a thing of the past.”
However, perhaps Professor Latif meant this as a joke because the article appeared on April 1, 2000! In this regard, one could simply dismiss the comment – had that claim by Latif not been repeated by other climate scientists, e.g. [2]:
“The very mild winters of the last decades can be attributed mainly to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. As a consequence, we are for example seeing a reduction in snowfall. When every 50-year-old was able to go skating as a kid almost every winter, kids today often have to wait many years for larger amounts of snow.”
Well, kids haven’t had to wait at all for the last 5 winters! If that weren’t enough, in 2005 Mojib Latif spoke out once again [3], this time making a 50-year prediction:
In 2050, no more snow in the lowlands; Mainz (dpa). According to climate scientist Mojib Latif of Kiel, winters in Germany will become warmer. Without future climate protection, ‘In 2050 there will no longer be snow in Germany – at least not in the lowlands,’ said the professor of the Institute for Ocean Sciences of the University of Kiel on ZDF television. The observed trend to warmer winters will continue on.”
So are we allowed to ask, where has this trend been for the last 5 winters? In a conference report of the Dow Jones News GmbH [4] the “…renowned climate scientist of Kiel Prof. Mojib Latif…” is quoted:
‘The scenarios discussed by scientists see a further warming of 1.4 to 5.8 °C on average by the end of the century. In Germany there will be no longer frost or snow by then; in hot climate zones there will be ‘desolation’.”
In the meantime, all these statements have since been contradicted: Nature is doing something completely different…the exact opposite! The first climate warmists to scramble to make a major forecasting adjustment already in 2010 were from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) –  and did so through BILD tabloid [5]:
The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research sees the hard winters as being the result of global warming: Icy Arctic winds will be triggered by it and reach all the way to Europe unhindered due to climate change in the Arctic.”
‘Could be,’ may have been the first reaction of a BILD reader. However they likely immediately followed up with the question: Why do scientists always come up with such explanations after the fact? The alarmists used a sleight of hand, and magically and rapidly came up with a rabbit from a hat. [6]:
“A new study shows the relationship between Arctic sea ice cover in the summer and winter weather in Central Europe. […] The probability of cold, snowy winters in Central Europe increases when the Arctic summer has little sea ice.“
Did they ever have such a climate model before the cold winters of the last years? NO! This is precisely the point that WELTWOCHE magazine couldn’t help but notice [7]:
‘…are three cold winters… a coincidence?’… ‘Such winters are inconvenient not only for those who freeze in them, but also for those had announced warmer temperatures because of the CO2 emissions.’ … ‘The reality is, writes American climate scientist JUDAH COHEN, that we are not freezing despite climate change, but because of it.’ … ‘Such an explanation would be convincing only if it had not come afterwards. Indeed just the opposite had been announced for decades. We can recall DAVID VINER of the British Climate Research Unit. In the year 2000 VINER said that snowfall in Great Britain soon would be rare and a sensation. Children will not know what snow is.”
Former television meteorologist Wolfgang Thüne takes apart the entire matter by using factual meteorological aspects [8]:
“The AWI hypothesis published here [AWI press release] now says: 
‘The available model calculations show that the air pressure difference when there is less summertime Arctic sea ice cover is less in the following winter, and thus allow cold Arctic air to plunge to the mid latitudes.’
If that were the case, then we should have had cold winters for the last 20 years because this is about how long we’ve been having relatively minimal sesa ice cover.
If this AWI hypothesis were indeed scientifically conclusive, then the North Atlantic Oscillation Index would have to have been negative for the last 30 years – but the opposite is true as the following graphic depicts: positive 22, negative 7, +/- zero 1! Even in the last 10 years it’s only fifty-fifty.”
 

Figure: North Atlantic Oscillation Index [9]
 
Whether it’s the cold winters in Europe or the global temperature development, climate scientists now find themselves with their models up the creek without a paddle. Global warming has stagnated for 15 years [10]:
….however it has long been known that the climate has developed differently than what was predicted: Warming has stalled for 15 years, the rising trend of the global mean temperature hasn’t continued since. The stagnation leads to the assumption that global warming has stopped.’ NASA concedes.”
This fact has been discussed a long time already in the English speaking media, and has now reached the German public [11]. This is very inconvenient because for a long time we had been hearing [12]:
“The warming is developing as predicted. The models were also tested in climates of the past. There’s no reason not to trust the models.”
That obviously can now be perceived in another way [13]:

//-->




‘The climate models are not consistent with the currently observed climate development’, said Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Hamburg Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology.”
And Marozke [14]:
According to our first calculations, it would have to warm up a lot and abruptly in the coming years. But we do not trust these prognoses along the way. The simulations should have also seen the temperature increase stagnation – and that didn’t happen.” 
Kevin Trenberth [15] wrote on 11 October 2009 [16] of hockey stick inventor Michael Mann:
The fact is that we cannot account for the lack of warming at the moment and it’s a travesty that we can’t.”
What did our colleague in Kiel say?
“…kids today often have to wait many years for large amounts of snow.”
So children, as you can see, also professors make mistakes – sometimes even 5 years in a row. Just look out the window!
Summary:
Neither the winters nor the global temperatures are doing what the climate alarmists and models predicted. This is an embarassment for the established climate science community. However, malice is not warranted because scientific history has always been connected to being on the wrong path. Errors are permitted, but they must be corrected as quickly as possible when they are detected.
Now we have to look ahead and bring the proportion of the man-made and natural climate factors back into balance in the models. One thing is already clear: The sworn climate catastrophe is not taking place.

More deadly cold is forecast for Eastern Europe. Source: wxmaps.org/pix/temp4.html (12/20).
The political velcraft.org site reports:
The spate of cold weather that has lasted for weeks in many parts of Europe has now claimed at least 600 lives. Eastern Europe is the worst affected. […]
In the Ukraine, more than 150 deaths have been registered. Sixty-eight people have reportedly died in Poland from the cold, 64 in Russia and an estimated 70 in Belarus. In Romania, the official death toll has risen to 68. In Lithuania, 23 deaths have been reported, 24 in the Czech Republic and 10 in Latvia. At least 16 people have died so far due to the cold in Bulgaria, 13 in Hungary, and a total of 50 in the successor states of Yugoslavia.
Italy has also been severely affected by the cold, with 40 registered victims.”

­The country has not witnessed such a long cold spell since 1938, meteorologists said, with temperatures 10 to 15 degrees lower than the seasonal norm all over Russia. Across the country, 45 people have died due to the cold, and 266 have been taken to hospitals. In total, 542 people were injured due to the freezing temperatures, RIA Novosti reported.

The Moscow region saw temperatures of -17 to -18 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, and the record cold temperatures are expected to linger for at least three more days. Thermometers in Siberia touched -50 degrees Celsius, which is also abnormal for December.
The Voice of Russia reports:
The temperature in Russia’s Sakha (Yakutia) republic has reached minus 50 degrees Celsius. In some districts of this Far Eastern region the temperature has fallen to minus 54 degrees Celsius.”
and reports here:
Temperatures of up to minus 45 degrees Celsius in the Altai region in southeast Siberia have prompted the authorities to declare a regionwide state of emergency.”
The Moscow Times reports:
Health officials said Wednesday that record-breaking cold weather caused the deaths of 21 people the day before.”
and today the Moscow Times reports that the “Death Toll From Cold Keeps Rising“:
…more than 50 people have died from weather-related illnesses. During the cold snap, which started over a week ago, 722 people have been injured, 371 have been hospitalized and 56 have died, RIA-Novosti reported Thursday…”
Not only Eastern Europe and Russia are being battered, but so is the US and Canada. The USA Today reports that so far a storm has left “at least eight people dead, clogged highways and forced hundreds of flight delays and cancellations at airports. The storm was blamed for deaths in at least five states, with parts of Iowa and Wisconsin hit with more than a foot of snow.”

============================================
Post by Aetheress:
I’ll try to keep this short –
While all of the following scientists believe the globe is warming, the vast majority of them do NOT believe in the theory of “Anthropegenic” GW.
Survey: “Peer-Reviewed Survey Finds Majority Of Scientists Skeptical Of Global Warming Crisis” 02-13-2013
Highlights:
‘We find that virtually all respondents (99.4%) agree that the climate is changing. However, there is considerable disagreement as to cause, consequences, and lines of action (as outlined in Figure 2). On this basis, we find five different frames, each of them summarized in Table 3. Eight percent of respondents did not provide enough information regarding their framing of climate change to be categorized.’
‘The largest group of APEGA respondents (36%) draws on a frame that we label ‘comply with Kyoto’. In their diagnostic framing, they express the strong belief that climate change is happening, that it is not a normal cycle of nature, and humans are the main or central cause.’
‘The second largest group (24%) express a ‘nature is overwhelming’ frame. In their diagnostic framing, they believe that changes to the climate are natural, normal cycles of the Earth. Their focus is on the past: ‘If you think about it, global warming is what brought us out of the Ice Age.’ Humans are too insignificant to have an impact on nature.’
”Fatalists’, a surprisingly large group (17%), diagnose climate change as both human- and naturally caused. ‘Fatalists’ consider climate change to be a smaller public risk with little impact on their personal life. They are sceptical that the scientific debate is settled regarding the IPCC modeling: ‘The number of variables and their interrelationships are almost unlimited – if anyone thinks they have all the answers, they have failed to ask all of the questions.’’
‘Ten percent of respondents draw on an ‘economic responsibility’ frame. They diagnose climate change as being natural or human caused. More than any other group, they underscore that the ‘real’ cause of climate change is unknown as nature is forever changing and uncontrollable.’
‘The last group (5%) expresses a frame we call ‘regulation activists’. This frame has the smallest number of adherents, expresses the most paradoxical framing, and yet is more agentic than ‘comply with Kyoto’. Advocates of this frame diagnose climate change as being both human and naturally caused, posing a moderate public risk, with only slight impact on their personal life.’

99.4% say that the climate is changing. No ‘climate change’ deniers here. NONE.
There IS NO CONSENSUS.
2010 ‘Only one in four American Meteorological Society broadcast meteorologists agrees with United Nations’ claims that humans are primarily responsible for recent global warming, a survey published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society reports. The survey results contradict the oft-repeated assertion that a consensus of scientists believes humans are causing a global warming crisis.’
‘The survey was conducted by the congressionally funded National Environmental Education Foundation and vetted by an advisory board of climate experts from groups such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, and Pew Center for Global Climate Change.’
‘Joe D’Aleo, executive director of the International Climate and Environmental Change Assessment Project and first director of meteorology at the Weather Channel, is not surprised by the survey results.’
‘AMS has tried very hard to brainwash broadcast meteorologists by forcing them to attend conferences and teleconferences with one-sided presentations where global warming evangelism is preached,’ D’Aleo said. ‘Broadcasters send me notifications they get from AMS telling them they must attend these conferences where only the alarmist point of view is preached. This survey shows that broadcast meteorologists are not swayed by these one-sided presentations.’
Now in 2013- ‘In an AMS survey, where all respondents are AMS meteorologists, a majority have Ph.D.s and fully 80% have a Ph.D. or Masters Degree, position statements by organizational bureaucracies carry little scientific weight.’
www.climatechangecommunication.org/report preliminary-findings-february
‘According to American Meteorological Society (AMS) data, 89% of AMS meteorologists believe global warming is happening, but only a minority (30%) is very worried about global warming.’
‘This sharp contrast between the large majority of meteorologists who believe global warming is happening and the modest minority who are nevertheless very worried about it is consistent with other scientist surveys. This contrast exposes global warming alarmists who assert that 97% of the world’s scientists agree humans are causing a global warming crisis simply because these scientists believe global warming is occurring. However, as this and other scientist surveys show, believing that some warming is occurring is not the same as believing humans are causing a worrisome crisis.’
‘Other questions solidified the meteorologists’ skepticism about humans creating a global warming crisis. For example, among those meteorologists who believe global warming is happening, only a modest majority (59%) believe humans are the primary cause. More importantly, only 38% of respondents who believe global warming is occurring say it will be very harmful during the next 100 years.’ ”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf there ever was a confirmation that the UN climate conferences have been a total failure, then this is it.
According to the German Press Agency (dpa), Germany is now looking for partners in order to found a “coalition of the willing” for implementing the transition to renewable energies. Apparently, the creation of green jobs and green prosperity doesn’t work if you do it by yourself, and only works if everyone around you does it too. About 10 countries will be attending an energy conference in Abu Dhabi today to forge a new renewable energy alliance. Greenpeace is angered by the new German path of voluntary participation.
German Minister of Environment Peter Altmaier said about 10 other countries will launch the coalition. The objective of the conference will be to lay down the groundworks for a close cooperation between willing countries for expanding the use of renewable energies. They’re starting again from scratch.
The DPA writes that the objective of expanding renewable energies is to “strengthen global climate protection in times of rapid global warming.” Obviously someone forgot to tell the DPA and Minister Altmaier that the globe stopped warming 15 years ago. That’s what the IPCC’s main data supplier UEA MetOffice announced recently. There’s no warming at all, let alone rapid warming. The DPA even indirectly admits that global warming is no longer a compelling enough reason to switch over the green energies, adding:
Moreover, fossil fuel availability is not unlimited and will get more expensive in the future.”
The DPA quotes Altmaier:
In a world where we will soon have 8 billion inhabitants, there will be no alternative but to decouple economic growth from the consumption of natural resources if we wish not to jeopardise the elementary basis of life on this planet.”
Altmaier is not an economist, and it shows. He’s a lawyer. Altmaier does not know that it is the decoupling of the use of fossil fuels from the global economy that will jeopardise human life on this planet – mainly the most vulnerable among us.

The DPA writes that large developing countries like China are expanding their use of renewable energies. So that means we should follow them? What the DPA does not mention is that these same developing countries are building fossil fuel plants faster than ever today. China, for example, puts one coal-fired power plant on-line every week, and will do so for the next 40 years. Now that’s something we ought to follow!
So why is Germany now embarking on the new path of renewable energy by a coalition of the willing? It’s because the UN process has failed. The DPA writes (my emphasis):
In light of the minimal progress made by the UN climate conferences, Altmaier views this as an important supplement to new alliances for leading countries. […] He emphasized that especially in emerging and developing countries green electricity must be supported even more.”
Green energies for poor developing countries? Renewable energy is not even affordable in rich Europe. Last year 600,000 German households had their power cut off because they were unable to pay their electricity bills. How are poor countries going to afford it? The DPA report says that 1.4 billion people have no power at all. These dirt poor citizens are supposed to start out with electricity from the highest price class? Starving Africans can trade up their wheelbarrows for BMWs that run only 20% of the time.
Greenpeace is angered by the new German initiative: “We certainly do not need another decade of energy transition conferences,” said Sven Teske of Greenpeace International. What’s needed, Teske says, is to “increase the pressure to end the support for more more coal and nuclear power plants once and for all.” In other words, the very power that the poor could afford. Well Mr. Teske, go tell China and India to stop building coal plants. Of course you won’t because you know they’ll just tell you to take a flying leap.
We should applaud Germany’s new approach on this. If countries want to go ahead, voluntarily, on the path to renewable energy, then they should do so. If it’s so wonderful, then they don’t need the rest of the world to go along. If it’s such a great idea, then just do it! What are you waiting for? Nobody is stopping you.

"Whether it’s Bonfire Night, Thanksgiving, or just an everyday celebration, every winter, as soon as the clocks go back, the fireworks begin. And while some aren’t affected in the slightest, around 45% of dogs have a firework phobia, something that is becoming an increasingly serious welfare concern. However, with the right training you can help your dog to become more confident during firework season.   First, a brief word on what we really shouldn’t be administering to our fearful dogs. Sedatives are all too often prescribed to firework phobic dogs. ACP (acepromazine) is one such drug – but it has been demonstrated to actually increase noise sensitivity in dogs while also decreasing their ability to physically respond. In other words, the drug can make your dog more aware of the noise but less able to respond to it. Imagine for a moment that you are really scared of spiders. Now imagine you’re locked in a room full of spiders. And then imagine that you’ve been sedated so you cannot move. An outsider may think, because you’re not reacting, that you are fine. Yet inside, you most certainly are not.  More recently, sedatives such as dexmedetomidine are being advertised to vets and dog owners for fearful dogs, yet these can pose serious health risks even at low doses – for example, by reducing the amount of blood being pumped around the body. Indeed, the Small Animal Formulary (an encyclopedia for medicine) states that oxygen supplementation is advisable when administering these drugs in all animals.  On the flip side, there are medications that safely can reduce anxiety – some also decrease a dog’s ability to remember the event the next day, such as benzodiazepines. However, studies suggest that if owners are using medication during firework season they are less likely to follow a behaviour modification plan so this needs to be considered carefully.  With that in mind, instead let’s focus on what we can do to help our dogs during this potentially stressful period. Prevention is always better than treatment so it’s best to start these protocols in advance of firework season, ideally when your dog is still a puppy.  First, think about your dog’s environment. Dogs need a place where they can feel safe and secure and you can create this in a number of ways. The use of dog appeasing pheromones has been proven to reduce anxiety in dogs and can help create a safe environment.  You can also create a den in your house which is a sheltered, quiet space for your dog that they can access whenever they want. In addition to this, when there are fireworks, ensure your dog is fed and walked before dark; they can begin to associate darkness with fireworks and will become more aware of the noises – just as after watching a scary film, you notice every single noise in your house.  Ensure the television or radio is turned on as a comforting distraction and shut the curtains to limit the noise and lights from the fireworks. If your dog does need to go out after dark, keep them on a lead – reports of lost dogs increase by 40% over firework season. Second, and this is where it is best to start with puppies, introduce them to the sounds of fireworks in a controlled, safe way. You can do this through specific CDs (or indeed YouTube), but carefully control the volume. Initially, put the volume on the lowest setting, ensuring that your dog notices the sound – for example, by moving their ear towards the noise – but is not frightened by it.  At this point, either feed your dog their favourite food or play their favourite game. You want to keep the session short and fun – the idea is to change how your dog feels when they hear fireworks. Over time, you can gradually increase the volume of the CD – but don’t rush this phase, remember you only want them to notice the sound.  Finally, it is worth remembering that you cannot reinforce fear. If your dog is frightened and comes to you for comfort, comfort them. Tell them they are amazing, look after them and remain your cheerful, relaxed self. Trust science when it says you won’t make them feel any more scared. If your dog’s fear of fireworks is particularly bad, please seek the advice of a qualified animal behaviourist who will be able to tailor a programme specifically to help your dog, in conjunction with your vet.  So, remember, when the fireworks start, use science to support your dog."
"Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, powered by a resurgence in solar energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) found that solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years. Its latest report predicts that by 2024 a new dawn for cheap solar power could see the world’s solar capacity grow by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. Overall, renewable electricity is expected to grow by 1,200GW in the next five years, the equivalent of the total electricity capacity of the US. “This is a pivotal time for renewable energy,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. “Technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind are at the heart of transformations taking place across the global energy system. Their increasing deployment is crucial for efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution, and expand energy access.” The Guardian reported earlier this month that a renewable energy revolution could end the world’s rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies. Renewable energy sources make up 26% of the world’s electricity today, but according to the IEA its share is expected to reach 30% by 2024. The resurgence follows a global slowdown last year, due to falling technology costs and rising environmental concerns. However, Birol warned that the role of renewables in the global energy system would need to grow even faster if the world hopes to meet its climate targets. The report said growing climate ambitions in the European Union and the US played the biggest role in driving the IEA’s forecasts higher, but it will be China which leads the way in rolling out wind and solar energy projects. The IEA expects solar energy to play the biggest role in jumpstarting fresh growth in global renewable energy because falling costs are already below retail electricity prices in most countries. The cost of solar power is expected to decline by a further 15% to 35% by 2024, spurring further growth over the second half of the decade. The appetite of energy-hungry businesses and factories is expected to be the biggest driver of the solar power boom as company bosses exploit falling costs to help cut their energy bills. But the number of home solar panels is also expected to more than double to reach around 100m rooftops by 2024, with the strongest per capita growth in Australia, Belgium, California, the Netherlands and Austria. Even after the “spectacular” growth expected for solar over the next five years, panels will cover only 6% of the world’s available rooftops, leaving room for further growth. “Renewables are already the world’s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” Birol said. He warned that although the potential for solar power was “breathtaking” the rapid rollout could disrupt electricity markets unless regulators and utilities adapt."
"The sun is out, as usual, in the town of Surfside. Less than 10 miles north of Miami’s world-famous South Beach, just a square mile in size with a population near 6,000, it’s a typically prosperous American seaside community. Kite surfers zip along the azure waves as locals in flip-flops walk their toy-size dogs – just another south Florida day.  The “snowbirds” from up north will soon fly in for the winter. Surfside’s mayor, Daniel Dietch, arrives at the town hall, kicking up his Sector 9 skateboard. A 50-year-old husband and father of two, his day job is in environmental consultancy. “There are few things better to start the day than a jog on the beach, watch the sunrise and let the ocean breeze envelop you,” he said. But not all is rosy. Surfside’s picture-postcard beach is doing a slow-motion disappearing act – increasingly scoured by huge storms and encroached upon by rising sea levels, accelerated by the climate crisis. Gorgeous sandy beaches are fundamental to Florida’s economy. A record 116.5 million tourists visited Florida in 2017, up 3.6% from 2016, generating commerce valued at $67bn. But holding back the effects of hurricanes and high water is a project on an industrial scale – and one that’s only becoming bigger and more fraught. Some are even talking about “sand wars” in the Sunshine state. Since the 1950s Florida authorities have spent $1.3bn “nourishing” the beaches – periodically buying in supplementary sand. Despite a huge effort, nearly half the state’s 825 miles of beaches are now considered “critically eroded”. And complications abound amid not just a local or US but a worldwide shortage of sand. Dredging and mining sand offshore causes environmental damage to the ocean floor, as does repairing the beach itself. In Florida, turtle nesting season has to be worked around, but smaller creatures just suffocate. “You basically kill a beach when you dump a bunch of sand on top of it,” said Matthew Schwartz, an environmentalist and executive director of the South Florida Wildlands Association. “Microscopic animals that live in between sand, that create a kind of ecosystem there, are killed, and it creates all kinds of turbidity in the water, damaging the coral reefs.” Surfside is currently “re-nourishing” its beach after a struggle for cash and supplies.  Like many other beach towns it was applying for Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) cash to repair hurricane damage when Dietch read news reports earlier this year that the Trump administration aimed to divert some of that money to build the president’s promised wall on the US-Mexico border.   As Dietch raced to pin down his beach money, Surfside even hired a sand lobbyist, Fausto Gomez, to navigate hurdles with the state and federal government. “Communities are all looking for dollars for themselves. You have to fend off other communities [and] make sure you’re listed in the priority rankings [to get the money],” said Gomez.  Surfside successfully obtained $17.9m to buy and place 330,000 cubic yards of sand along its one-mile beach. Northern Florida has more sand to spare than the southern coast but Dietch said there’s “tension” because the northern counties “don’t want their sand being excavated and barged to Miami-Dade county”. Places like the Carolinas also guard their sand jealously. So Surfside and many other Florida resorts turn to a sand mine near Lake Okeechobee north of the Everglades wilderness area. As offshore sand becomes more elusive, south Florida beaches are instead replenished by the truck load from inshore mines. Surfside is currently in the process of having 18,000 truckloads of sand delivered 127 miles from Lake Okeechobee in order to extend its shrinking beach 150ft out into the Atlantic.     The US Army Corps of Engineers awarded the Surfside contract to the private sector to add the sand to the beach. Once Surfside is finished there will be a similar repair project undertaken in South Beach. Meanwhile the corps is working on ways to recapture sand that has been washed away and it also searches for dwindling nearshore dredging sites. But that’s controversial, too. “There’s noise in the background about wealthier counties wanting to mine sand off the coast of counties that are less developed,” said Tom Tomasello, a former general counsel for the state environment agency. He added: “That’s going to be a big political issue as time moves on. There is going to be a sand war one day, I can tell you with certainty.”  The US Army Corps of Engineers’ Laurel Reichold said her worries about the resilience of these communities keeps her up at night. “A lot of these beach projects, they’re sort of the first line of defense and that’s ultimately why we’re doing storm damage reduction, but it’s not going to prevent damages when you have those direct hits from a category 5 hurricane,” she said. And the inherent (and market) value of sand is on the rise everywhere.  Reichold said project costs have increased 30% over the past three years. Some want to dig for supplies overseas. The Florida Republican senator Marco Rubio last month reintroduced a bill that’s failed before, calling for a way around federal laws banning the import of sand, so that his state could go shopping with public funds for gorgeous, cheap sand from the Bahamas less than 100 miles east of Florida’s Atlantic coast. He is arguing there’s an especially acute need because early September’s Hurricane Dorian damaged some Florida beaches. The double irony is that, first, the damage happened even though the storm didn’t make landfall in the state, instead wreaking destruction in parts of the Bahamas, and second, climate experts point out that such storms are being exacerbated by global heating, whereas Rubio only recently began softening slightly on his long-held, hardline denials of a human-caused climate emergency. Palm Beach county alone saw 539,695 cubic yards of sand, enough to fill 165 Olympic-size swimming pools, swilled by Dorian from beaches the county owns and manages a pebble’s throw from Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago private oceanside resort. The county has a dredging program, but wants to keep the sand for local needs. “Some of the counties to the south of us are really running low,” said Andy Studt, who manages Palm Beach county’s beaches program. “I wouldn’t say we’re going to share it. We’re not actively advertising that we have excess sand because we know that we have enough to get us through the next couple decades, but that’s it.” Each year, the cycle continues. Hurricane season brings stronger storms and rising sea levels bring higher tides. Beach repair is the first line of defense, leading to an increasingly costly and desperate scramble for sand. But the bigger picture is just too overwhelming for many Floridians to contemplate. The National Academy of Sciences asserts that global sea levels could rise more than 6ft by 2100, twice as much as previously predicted, making much of Florida uninhabitable. “If it turns out the amount of sea level rise corresponds to what scientists are saying, there’s going to be a retreat [from the area],” said Tomasello, the environmental lawyer. “That’s going to be the only option because you’re going to be living in the water 50-100 years down the road.” Dietch said the town is getting ready to unveil a climate crisis action plan and build a “resilience fund” that’s “a euphemism for planned relocation” for people at risk from rising waters. “We’re seeing more intense storms. It’s not the frequency, it’s the intensity and patterns of the storms. So we try to message this but not in a fearmongering sort of way because people will shut down,” he said. Talk that gets too alarming also attracts what Dietch called “pushback” from real estate agents. “They don’t want people to know that they’re buying in … that it’s a high-risk area,” he said. And with thousands of trucks of fresh sand arriving at top dollar to disguise the environmental reality, there’s plenty to stick one’s head in for those who prefer that approach."

"Nearly one in three Asian elephants live in captivity – about 15,000 in all. The existence of such large captive population of this endangered, intelligent, and long-living animal poses a number of ethical and practical challenges, but also some opportunities. Asian elephants, like most land-based megafauna, are endangered and might not survive in the wild beyond the 21st century. As the largest terrestrial animals, elephants are very important for the health of tropical ecosystems – they are like forest gardeners who plant, fertilise and prune trees. Asian elephants are also remarkable in their cultural significance. They may have been tamed as far back as 6,000 BC, and elephants have since been used for warfare, transport, and as status symbols. They’ve sometimes even been worshipped as deities. Even nowadays, people in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand venerate elephants in a way that is difficult for outsiders to understand. It is because of the cultural significance of Asian elephants that so many of them live in captivity (African elephants can and used to be tamed but, for comparison, only one in 700 currently live in captivity). Unlike dogs, horses, or pigs, elephants are not domestic animals, in the sense that we (humans) do not control their breeding. The large majority of captive elephants were born in the wild and eventually captured and tamed to work for people. The process of elephant taming is an ancestral tradition that generally involves restraining and punishing until, as one UN report puts it, “the animal’s will is broken”. It’s definitely a painful experience. Contrary to most other mammals, elephants in zoos live shorter lives than in the wild, often suffering from obesity and displaying “stereotypic behaviors” like nodding or body swaying. Given all the above, is it ethical to keep elephants in captivity? Well, I’m afraid we have no alternative. All those thousands of tamed elephants in Asia can’t simply be released into the wild. Taming and captivity deeply changes their behaviour. It breaks their social ties and makes them lose their natural fear of people and released tamed elephants often stay near villages, causing severe conflicts with farmers and exposing themselves to easy retaliation. Humans therefore need to take care of those elephants currently in captivity. A different question is whether we need to capture any more wild-born elephants. The answer is absolutely no – we need to avoid further live captures to feed the demand of elephants for tourism and entertainment. With the loss of their traditional “jobs” in forestry and transport, most captive elephants in Asia have joined the ecotourism industry. Watching elephants is a formidable experience that I generally recommend to local and international tourists in Asia. But this creates another dilemma – is it ethical for tourists to visit elephant sanctuaries? The answer depends on the sanctuary and the activities involved. Before visiting, I recommend you spend time investigating the available sanctuaries and visiting only those with a good welfare record (and there are quite a few of these). While visiting the sanctuary, be selective in the activities you engage in – avoid riding elephants, for instance, especially on heavy saddles with several other passengers (elephants are strong but their backs still suffer). You should also avoid noisy shows in which elephants are forced into unnatural behaviour such as silly acrobatics; and most importantly, avoid giving money to people using elephant calves for begging or any other activities that create incentives for further elephant live trade. After visiting the sanctuary, provide (well-mannered and non-patronising) feedback to sanctuary managers, local authorities, and potential future visitors. Good elephant sanctuaries need to be rewarded and bad ones need to feel the pressure to improve. It’s important to emphasise the distinction between elephant welfare and conservation. The latter is a much more difficult challenge. The welfare of captive elephants should not use resources that, otherwise, would be allocated for the conservation of wild populations. But captive elephants do provide some opportunities here. After all, there are no better ambassadors for elephant conservation than the animals themselves. If properly managed, elephants in sanctuaries and zoos provide a unique opportunity for people to connect emotionally with wildlife, for instance, and learn about how to protect these animals.  The captive population also provides a unique stock to reintroduce elephants in many Asian forests where they have recently become extinct. Elephant reintroductions will be complex and often controversial but – given their ecological importance (remember, the forest gardeners) – they’re something we should seriously start to experiment with.  Unfortunately, we do not have such an opportunity for some of Asia’s other endangered megafauna such as the Javan and Sumatran rhinos or the Kouprey, a huge ox from Cambodia which is now probably extinct. Most of the 15,000 Asian elephants in captivity will survive for a few more decades. We need to provide appropriate care for them and make sure we do not remove any additional elephants from the wild to feed the demand for elephant-based tourism. Finally we can use these elephants for conservation, especially for “rewilding” programs in forests that have lost their elephants."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is the 2nd part of the Weltwoche interview. Yesterday in Part 1 we read:
1. Stocker said the theory claiming global warming causes cold European winters is not robust.
2. Stocker was caught fibbing in claiming that the projections of IPCC models were “extremely good”.
3. Stocker had ignored inconvenient science from his own institute.
4. Stocker appeared unaware that global warming had not risen in 15 years.
Part 2 of the Stocker/Weltwoche interview
In part 2, Stocker contradicts Ben Santer and claims that 17 years are not enough to establish a climate trend, insists that warming is taking place and that the model projections have been “extremely good”. Part 2 reveals how the IPCC science is hanging from a thread. Stocker obstinately maintains there is no CO2 lag behind temperature, claiming that they moved “simultaneously” in the past. Stocker erroneously believes CO2 is the only explanation for the 20th century warming.
WELTWOCHE: So you would never say that we are observing 17 years of climate warming stagnation?
STOCKER: No, already the association of ‘seventeen years’ and ‘climate warming’ is false. When we talk about a climate warming we mean the long-term trend, the one we see in the second half of the 20th century.
Lüning: That’s a bit mysterious. In a paper appearing in 2011, Stocker’s former IPCC colleague Ben Santer and 16 other co-authors determined that 17 years are enough to detect a climate trend. Now it has been 17 years since the end of warming began and suddenly many more years are required. What doesn’t fit is made to fit. Real science looks completely different.
WELTWOCHE: We don’t see it with the temperatures.
STOCKER: To the contrary we see signals in all components of the climate system: at the ice sheets, which are losing mass; in the oceans, which are measurably warming down to a depth of 4000 m; in the atmosphere, which is warming at the lower levels and cooling above 15 km, and therefore reveal CO2’s fingerprint. The burden of evidence from 130 years of observations and process comprehension is heavy, and it takes more than just a few years of stagnation to destroy this conclusive body of evidence.
Lüning: Once again Stocker gets tangled up in scientifically dubious argumentation. Is he unaware that the Antarctic has gained ice mass as whole over the last years (see our blog article “Neue ICEsat-Satellitendaten sind da: Antarktischer Eisschild hat an Masse zugelegt“)? Even if the Greenland ice sheet is melting (which it did also during the Medieval Warm Period 1000 years ago), IPCC co-chair Stocker here should not resort to cherry-picking with the purpose of reinforcing his personal climate alarmism. Worse is his claim about the CO2 fingerprint in the stratosphere. New studies in the meantime have completely discredited this idea (see our blog articles: “Keine guten Nachrichten für Mojib Latif: Neue Studie im Journal of Geophysical Research hinterfragt den stratosphärischen CO2-Fingeradruck“ and “CO2-Fingerabdruck löst sich in Luft auf: Neue Studie belegt Ozonwirkung auf Temperatur in der mittleren Atmosphäre“). It is a confession of failure when Stocker keeps bringing up “proof” that isn’t proof at all. Again here he seems to hope readers will lack knowledge. The alleged “conclusive body of evidence“ turns out to be nothing more than ruins on the verge of further collapse.
WELTWOCHE: What would it take before you’d admit climate warming has stopped?
STOCKER: You simply want a number of years?
WELTWOCHE: No, just an order of magnitude. Are we talking about 10 years or fifty years?
STOCKER: Galileo once said: ‘And it [the Earth] is indeed turning.’ We can say: ‘And it is indeed warming.’ All indicators that you have mentioned together point to a conclusive explanation: CO2 is responsible for the warming. One topic that we also address in the new report is climate sensitivity.
WELTWOCHE:  That is how much the temperature rises when atmospheric CO2 concentration doubles.
STOCKER: In the last report of 2007 we came to a value of 2 to 4.5°C. Now the question that arises is: Do the last 15 years tell us that the climate sensitivity is closer to the lower range? This discussion is taking place in the science, also with skeptical colleagues – I can assure you.
Lüning: Indeed there is a discussion where the evidence is growing that so-called climate sensitivity is significantly over-estimated. However, one has to know that the climate models for the forthcoming climate report have long since been calculated and there is no longer the possibility of making modifications without starting over from scratch and losing face. The IPCC therefore will hardly be able to back down from its mean of 3°C per doubling of CO2. This means that Stocker’ IPCC is increasingly unable to maneuver and is detached from reality.
Weltwoche expresses a suspicion that many are secretly thinking:
WELTWOCHE: Aren’t you just simply pushing your forecasts so far out into the future that no one will ever know if they come true or not?

STOCKER: Thanks for the question, that’s a really tough one. I can refer you to the table of contents of our report. We said in 2009 that we would like to have a chapter that looks at the near future, one that brings weather forecasts and climate projections together. It is called: ‘Near-term climate change and predictability’. This branch of climate research is still relatively young. For example we cannot say how warm or how wet the year 2025 will be. For the time frame up to about the year 2035, we have to estimate the various factors: What has an impact on the uncertainties and how big are they?
Lüning: This is indeed a dead-sure strategy of avoiding making positive statements for the mid-term future. Every politician who has gotten himself in a jam and found his citizens demanding results knows the tricks. Stocker tells us how he is pleased to get the question, but then goes on telling us about future projects whose quality cannot be assessed at the moment in any way and will no be able to be assessed any time soon.
WELTWOCHE: Then we’ll have to wait until 2035 to check to see if you’re right?
STOCKER: No. As I’ve said, we have been assessing climate projections at the IPCC since 1990 and they have been measurably right up to today. If you ask me, if I’m still in good health in 2035, I’ll be looking back at a short phase of temperature stagnation that resulted from a combination of various effects – that is if a large volcano doesn’t erupt.
Lüning: Professor Stocker, we’ve already been through all that. Die IPCC temperature prognoses since 1990 have not been “measurably right“, rather they have been poor to outright useless. Is this perhaps the IPCC’s last thread that is keeping it from going under? Is this what modern, robust science looks like? To be more specific, ocean cycles specialist Professor Mojib Latif warned not long ago that a warming cannot be expected over the next decade due to cooling Atlantic and Pacific cycles. This is completely plausible and is in agreement with the empirical findings of the last century. Thus it is only a question of a few years before the real temperatures drift below the lower boundaries of the IPCC simulated temperature range, which once was considered an impossibility. When that happens, the last thread breaks and it all goes down. The 54-year old Stocker will likely experience this inconvenience long before he reaches retirement. It remains open whether or not he will have the courage to openly discuss the errors of the IPCC simulations. But why wait until then? Already today it would be high time to take a hard look at reality and to start taking the natural factors of climate change into account.
WELTWOCHE: The IPCC consensus is that man-made greenhouse gas CO2 leads to a warming of the climate. But this relationship is observed only over the last 150 years.
STOCKER: Take a look at the chart of measurements from the Antarctic ice for the last 800,000 years: If that is not a correlation between temperature and CO2! The CO2 concentration that we measured in the ice was high during warm times, and low during cold periods.
Lüning: Al Gore in his film already stepped into that trap. Here cause and effect get reversed. Does it get warmer when CO2 rises? Or is it the other way around, where a warm ocean releases stored CO2 into the atmosphere? Weltwoche knows the real relationship:
WELTWOCHE: To the contrary, CO2 rises after temperature increases, and so CO2 could not have possibly caused the warming.
STOCKER: We’ve reported on the CO2 lag. However in light of new studies I have to gradually reconsider – but not in the sense you’d like: The studies show that CO2 and temperatures rise simultaneously. The sequence of warm and cold periods is driven over 100,000 years by the cycles described by geophysicist Milankovitch in 1920  It gets down to the position and angle of the earth’s rotational axis and the Earth’s orbit around the sun.
Lüning: The CO2 lag has always been a major irritant for the IPCC. That’s why scientists close to the IPCC produced new studies using questionable methodologies that allow the IPCC to get around the problem (see our blog article”Statistik-Trick befördert CO2 vom Beifahrer zum Chauffeur: Fragwürdiger neuer Shakun-Artikel in Nature“). With the assistance of these tailored studies, Stocker is able to use the old Al Gore trick for readers unfamiliar with the science. This is a sad story.
More important today than the long-term Milankovitch orbital cycles concerning our climate, are the fluctuations in solar activity. Weltwoche brings it up:
WELTWOCHE: Couldn’t we better explain the climate cycles with the sun’s influence?
STOCKER: That’s valid for pre-industrial times when CO2 was more or less 30% below today’s levels. We still need the sun as part of the explanation – here we have no differences. But for the last 50 to 70 years, and especially concerning the extent of the warming, it is not possible to conclusively explain it without the man-made factors. Why did the temperature increase 0.8°C during the 20th century? This cannot be explained without CO2.
Lüning: Precisely. Why did the temperature increase 0.8°C during the 20th century? Is CO2 really needed? If so, then how much? Have we seen such temperature increases in the past? Stocker here remains silent as the scientific facts on this point are inconvenient and clear. Over the last 10,000 there have been such warming phases on multiple occasions occurring in 1000 year cycles. And yet another surprise: The main drive behind these changes was solar activity fluctuation, as is impressively confirmed by numerous studies. As one may suspect, the second half of the 20th century was one of the most solar-active over the last 10,000 years. What a huge coincidence! Unfortunately, the IPCC has elected to ignore this massive body of science. This is yet another huge defect in the IPCC house in addition to the PDO lapse.

"Today, the state of New York will face off with ExxonMobil for oral arguments in the trial alleging that the company misled investors by providing false assurances that the company was adequately costing climate-related risks. But win or lose, that doesn’t mean an end to deliberate misinformation campaigns. Here’s what we should all know about how to resist those efforts by Exxon and other big corporate actors. Scientists have known for decades that the burning of fossil fuels is causing climate change. There is so much evidence that at least 97% of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming. It’s as settled as the link between smoking and cancer.  The fossil fuel industry has known about the role of its products in global warming for 60 years. Exxon’s own scientists warned their managers 40 years ago of “potentially catastrophic events”. Yet rather than alerting the public or taking action, these companies have spent the past few decades pouring millions of dollars into disinformation campaigns designed to delay action. All the while, the science is clear that climate-catalyzed damages have worsened, storms have intensified, and droughts and heatwaves have become more frequent and severe, while forests have been damaged and wildfires have burned through the country. By polluting the information landscape, these companies misrepresented the safety of their product and denied the public their right to be accurately informed. Big oil is not the only industry to do so. Big tobacco is a famous case, but asbestos and lead industries have done it too. These days, campaigns by soda companies to contest sugar science and by the NFL to distort the science on concussions use similar tactics. The campaigns all run a similar playbook: they cite fake experts, place impossible demands on the science, cherry-pick data, impugn the integrity of individual scientists and the scientific process, and appeal to conspiracy theories. They leave the public with the perpetual impression that there are lots of unresolved questions, and that scientists are not to be trusted. Research has confirmed that disinformation works, which is, of course, why special interests fund it. So it is crucial to expose disinformation for what it is, so that the public doesn’t fall prey to the next industrial-scale propaganda effort. In our report America Misled: How the Fossil Fuel Industry Deliberately Misled Americans About Climate Change, we document how the fossil fuel industry has misled the American public (and the world). We expose the most common myths about climate change generated by big oil and the misleading techniques used by Exxon. For example, cold weather is often used to argue that global warming isn’t happening. This favorite talking point of President Trump is an extreme form of cherry picking: ignoring what’s happening to our planet by focusing on local weather conditions. Just because the planet is heating up rapidly doesn’t mean cold weather in North Dakota will cease to exist overnight. But if we look at the overall picture, it’s hot and getting hotter. Our planet is accumulating heat at a rate of over four atomic bombs per second, and the four hottest years on record are the last four years. Exxon also misled us through arguments that appear convincing but contain logical fallacies. One is the argument that climate has changed naturally in the past, so today’s climate change must be natural, also. But just because something happened naturally in the past doesn’t mean it has to be natural now; the conclusion doesn’t follow from the premise. It’s like arguing that people have died naturally from cancer in the past, therefore smoking can’t cause cancer today. And then there’s the classic tactic of citing fake experts to cast doubt on the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. The most prominent example is an internet petition of 31,000 dissenting “experts” who think humans aren’t disrupting the climate. However, over 99% of the signatories have no expertise in climate research – it’s populated with graduates of programs in computer science, veterinary science, and mechanical engineering, as well as dead people and pop stars, but very few with climate expertise. In actual fact, 97% or more of domain experts agree on the fundamental fact that greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet. Exposing and explaining the techniques of denial are crucial steps in neutralizing disinformation, not just from the fossil fuel industry but from any source. Once people know the ways they can be deceived, disinformation no longer has power over them. As Edward Everett once said: “Education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army.” But it’s not enough to offer information – we also have to expose disinformation, so that people understand what we have been up against."

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Jeff Glassman of rocketscientistsjournal.com left a comment about Murry Salby, which regrettably got held up in the spam filter. Because he devoted much time to writing it, I’ve upgraded his comment to a post.
============================================
On 4/18/2013, Ferdinand Engelbeen misunderstands Henry’s Law and its dominance over atmospheric CO2 to the exclusion of human emissions.
1. Neither Salby nor the IPCC refers to the solubility of CO2 in water, or to Henry’s Law. In trying to rehabilitate the Revelle Factor for AR4, an IPCC author showed that it was temperature dependent, and as can be seen, resembling Henry’s coefficient for CO2 in water. Expert reviewer Nicolas Gruber explained that this dependence was a “common misconception”. Thereupon the IPCC editor deleted the figure for the final report “in order not to confuse the reader”, supposedly with uncomfortable solubility effects. Cf. Second Order Draft, Fig. 7.3.10(a)) and AR4, Fig. 7.11.
2. While laboratory values for Henry’s coefficients require approximating thermodynamic equilibrium, Henry’s Law does not predict thermodynamic equilibrium, and its coefficients must therefore be used advisedly. Neither climate, the ocean, the surface layer, nor Earth’s primary heat source, the Sun, is ever in thermodynamic equilibrium. IPCC and Salby refer to equilibrium, which is false if they mean thermodynamic equilibrium, and otherwise they supply no definition for their peculiar meaning of equilibrium.
3. Henry’s Coefficient for CO2, g/100g, varies by a factor of over 5 (0.06 to 3.3) with temperature of the solvent, water. This is a constant of proportionality for the dissolution of CO2 caused by its partial pressure. So the ocean uptakes more CO2 as the partial pressure of CO2 increases or as ocean temperature drops. Applying Henry’s Law with respect to air temperature, without more, is an error.
4. In the Vostok record, however, air temperature and CO2 records vary according to Henry’s Law, and certainly with no human contribution. Vostok air temperature deduced from oxygen and deuterium fractions appears to provide a proxy for sea temperature, too. The Law remains as applicable today for forecasting atmospheric CO2.

5. The peak-to-peak variation of CO2 at Vostok is about 120 ppmv, while the similar variation for air temperature there is about 12K, yielding a sensitivity of about 10 ppmv/K.
6. As Salby rediscovered, paleo CO2 lags temperature with a peak at about one millennium. He does not mention having investigated a cause for the lag. Regardless, comparing CO2 and air or sea temperature with data over the industrial era or over any common period is irrelevant. Measured CO2 is a result of ocean temperature changes from centuries past.
7. The dominant observed lag in CO2 with respect to air temperature and possibly water temperature is about the same as the estimate for the period of the Meridional Overturning Circulation. This current, also known as the Great Conveyor Belt, draws nearly freezing water at the poles, saturated in CO2, down to the ocean bottom, around the globe and up to the surface at the Eastern Equatorial Pacific about a millennium later. There old waters, still saturated in CO2, warm to tropical temperatures to outgas. Now depleted, the old waters circulate poleward across the surface, cooling to recharge with CO2 along the way. This submodel accounting for the lag reinforces the model from the curved correlation between CO2 and temperature at Vostok. The conclusion is that atmospheric CO2 follows from Henry’s Law applied to the ocean.
8. Natural CO2 fluxes today are SWAGs, good to maybe one significant figure. The fluxes are about 91 GtC/yr from the ocean, 120 GtC/yr from land (Salby used an obsolete value half as big), and another 270 GtC/yr from leaf water, a parameter that IPCC estimated but never applied. Man’s emission of CO2 is a tiny number lost in the noise of the other fluxes, worse than Salby suggests. IPCC’s models, the GCMs, are small-signal simulations where the natural world is falsely presumed to have a zero net effect.
9. Selby also re-discovered that ice core data underestimate atmospheric CO2, in particularly that from the Keeling Curve. That curve is a heavily filtered, reconstituted record for MLO, the “master time series”, a reference IPCC experts use to calibrate other stations into a false global agreement. This makes MLO data appear global, makes atmospheric CO2 therefore long-lived, and so causes anthropogenic CO2 to accumulate in the atmosphere for maximum effect. CO2 is fixed in the ice core once the firn closes, and this may require between 600 and 2000 years maximum (estimates vary). Also Vostok samples have an average period of about 1500 years. So the Vostok samples are averages over as much as 600 to 2000 years, and the chances of even sampling an event like the 50 year long Keeling Curve is about one in 30. And even if it happened to be sampled, it would be lost in the noise due to the extended aperture time. By contrast, Keeling samples have a window of at most one minute in the manual mode, and normally much less. The long aperture time causes an indelible loss in information.
10. Like IPCC, Salby relies on data from ice cores that blend smoothly into the instrument record in the same chart. See “Evolution during the 20th Century”, 4/18/2013, time 34:08; and AR4, Summary for Policymakers, Figure SPM.1. In these charts, the underestimation by ice cores has vanished, contradicting both Salby’s model and the actual cause: ice core data is a low pass filter with a time constant of about half a millennium. The graph is but another example of IPCC’s chartjunk.
11. Salby’s conclusion is correct that human emissions are insignificant in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. The observed record is natural.

"Nursing mothers and youths blockaded Google’s London headquarters on Wednesday in protest at the company’s funding of climate deniers, as Extinction Rebellion defied a police order by continuing to stage actions in the capital. A Guardian investigation revealed last week that Google had made “substantial” contributions to some of the most notorious climate deniers in Washington, despite its insistence that it supports action on the climate emergency. Mothers of infants held a “nurse-in” outside the company’s offices in King’s Cross and members of XR Youth climbed on top of the entrance to Google-owned YouTube, on the other side of the same building, holding a banner reading, “YouTube, stop climate denial”. In a letter to YouTube, they said the platform, which has 1.9bn users, had a responsibility to stop hosting “misleading and inherently dangerous” climate denial videos. They pointed out that a recent survey found more than half of teenagers in the US said they got their news from YouTube. As of 8am on Wednesday there had been 1,642 arrests made over XR protests, according to the Metropolitan police. The rate of arrests accelerated on Monday night after the police imposed a section 14 order in effect banning all protest by the group in London. Lawyers for XR filed an application for an urgent judicial review hearing at the high court. Tobias Garnett, a human rights lawyer working with XR’s legal team, said they would argue that the order was an infringement of the right to protest, was disproportionate, and went beyond the powers given to police by the Public Order Act. “There’s a general consensus that this is unlawful overreach and that it risks criminalising anyone who seeks to protest about the climate and ecological emergency,” he said. The application was accepted for a directions hearing at 2pm on Thursday. One of the applicants in the case is Ellie Chowns, a Green MEP who was among those arrested under the new order on Trafalgar Square on Monday night. She said she had not been part of the protests and had been arrested after asking questions of police officers about the legality of their actions. She said: “I do plan to go to Trafalgar Square at lunchtime today to stand in solidarity with the Extinction Rebellion protesters because I believe that the right to protest peacefully in a public place is a fundamental cornerstone of our democracy.” The Met’s deputy assistant commissioner, Laurence Taylor, denied that the force had banned protests and said it had every right to order the demonstrations in Trafalgar Square and elsewhere to end on Monday evening, after nine days. He said “significant disruption” had been caused to London and the Met was under such strain that it had had to draft in 500 officers from across the country. In spite of the order, hundreds of protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square on Wednesday afternoon for a people’s assembly, asking: “How do we respond to the silence of the government on the climate and ecological emergency in the face of the attempt to silence people with a London-wide ban on our peaceful assembly?” Police issued attendees with notice of the section 14 and at one stage confiscated a packed-up tent. Among those who addressed the crowd was George Monbiot, the Guardian environment writer, who went on to block the road at the top of Whitehall along with a number of other activists including Jonathan Bartley, a co-leader of the Green party. Monbiot was later arrested. Shortly after he was carried away by police, Monbiot said: “I feel we’ve got to make as much of a stand as we possibly can to prevent ecocide. Business as usual, politics as usual – that is ecocide. It’s the destruction of conditions that make life possible on this earth. I’m standing up against that and I’m proud to be arrested for that cause.” By 5pm, there were hundreds of people on Whitehall. Watching the action was James Brown, a Paralympic cyclist who had returned to London after being arrested for climbing on top of a passenger plane at City airport last Thursday. He said he had been able to mount the plane because, as a disabled person, he had been given priority access to board before other passengers. Brown said he was held in a cell for 67 hours after his protest. “I’m still recovering from that. It was quite an ordeal – especially when as a blind person they won’t give you any access to any reading materials, so it was quite a long and lonely stint.” Brown said he had become involved with environmental campaigning after his daughter told him of her concerns over biodiversity and the climate emergency. He said he had taken action because the government was not fulfilling its responsibilities to protect people. He added: “We have to take it in our own hands and do something ourselves and the only means of bringing about radical social change that has been proven time and time again in history is non-violent direct action, and that is the reason I’m taking part in this.”"

"The speed and size of the Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests over the past year add weight to the idea that people in this decade were in revolt before they had any clear idea what form a revolution might take. Politically it has long looked like a whole generation was up for grabs. In the beginning of the decade this anger veered leftwards with movements like Occupy, but at the end it has moved greenwards, under XR. The question is how much of the country will go with it. Extinction Rebellion succeeded in putting the climate crisis on the political agenda. This is a welcome pivot to an existential issue for a society that has become gummed up by enervating fights over Brexit. There is an urgent need to decouple economic activity from carbon emissions and ecological destruction. For all the fine words global emissions of carbon dioxide are higher than they have ever been, almost three decades after the first global conference aimed at reducing them. The situation is becoming dangerous for human life. The latest figures show there is little more than a decade to save ourselves and the other creatures with whom we share the planet.  To meet this challenge it is heartening that XR has adopted non-violent resistance, in which unarmed people engage in a coordinated set of strikes, rallies and boycotts to confront the authorities over environmental inaction. When the group shut down major parts of central London with a carnival of protest making business as usual impossible in April, the demonstrators ended up meeting with London’s mayor and cabinet ministers before securing their aim of getting parliament to declare a “climate emergency”. Extinction Rebellion’s policy and language have become mainstream in a remarkably short space of time. By comparison it might appear that this latest set of “uprisings” has seen XR go backwards rather than forward. There were no meetings with high-profile politicians. The targetting of London’s public transport network at rush hour would have lost the group significant goodwill among parts of the population. Yet XR has gone global, with 60 cities experiencing protests. XR has become more inventive as the protests against the National Portrait Gallery’s links with BP attest. In Britain the use of arrest as a tactic to draw more support has been particularly effective, with 1,700 peaceful protesters so far hauled away by the police as a record number of people took part in acts of resistance. The police in London will also have helped build opposition by taking measures which amount to an assault on the right to protest. If the authorities adopt a harder line they will boost the power of non-violence, by attracting people to demonstrations because of heavy-handed tactics. Disobedience is at the heart of non-violent struggle. As Martin Luther King Jr wrote: “We know through painful experience that freedom is never given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” XR’s strategy is influenced by the work of Harvard’s Erica Chenoweth, whose studies revealed that campaigns of non-violent resistance were twice as effective as ones which used violence in achieving their goals, and campaigns that involved more than 3.5% of the population – in the UK that is 2.3m people – invariably succeeded. But numbers alone will not create change; crowds are necessary but not sufficient. There’s also a danger that people show up but nothing changes – that mass action doesn’t work. This is the wrong conclusion to draw. However, people being in the streets isn’t effective without a strategy, and XR needs a clearer one for what could be years of struggle. There is an open question whether tactics that toppled dictators work in a liberal democracy.  This perhaps explains XR’s reluctance to spell out whether it wishes to achieve a revolution to overturn a political order or to create pressure to persuade governments to act. Reform or revolution – XR will have to make this call as it reflects on its own success."
"Even animals from the deepest places on Earth have accumulated pollutants made by humans. That’s the unfortunate finding of a new study by myself with colleagues from the University of Aberdeen and the James Hutton Institute, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution. Up until now I have tended to stick to the nice side of deep sea biology: discovery and exploration. My colleagues and I are quite at ease in ocean trenches as scientists there can usually work without having to wrestle with anthropogenic impacts like litter or noise and chemical pollution. It is Earth at its most pristine.  But in this instance, while investigating the ecology of Pacific trenches, and with such a unique opportunity to collect deep sea specimens, we couldn’t resist having a quick look for man’s mighty footprint. We tested various different species of tiny scavenging crustaceans known as amphipods that we gathered between 7,000 and 10,500 metres in depth in the Mariana and the Kermadec trenches in the western Pacific. We found that regardless of depth, regardless of species, regardless of trench, these animals were loaded with the two types of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) we were looking for.  In creatures that live in shallower waters, exposure to POPs can reduce reproductive success and thus population growth. It’s hard to study deeper animals alive under controlled conditions but can assume the pollutants have a similar effect. There were striking variations between trenches and between the sorts of pollutant, but the salient finding is that humanity’s footprint is thoroughly imprinted on some of the most extreme and remote environments on Earth. In the deep sea these pollutants are particularly concerning as they are inherently hydrophobic, which means they will bind to anything that isn’t water. This includes tiny specs of “marine snow” or larger carcasses that fall through the ocean, which is how the deep sea receives most of its energy. Therefore the primary mechanism of food supply to great depths is also a very efficient way to deliver pollution. But where did it all come from? Take one of the two types of pollutants for example, a category known as polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs. About 1.3m tonnes were produced between the 1930s and 1970s to use in paints, plastics, electronic equipment and more. Of this, 65% is now contained in landfills or still within electrical equipment. But more worryingly, the other 35% was accidentally released into the environment. These pollutants are invulnerable to natural degradation and so persist in the environment for decades, therefore once they find their way into rivers, coast lines and the open ocean there’s plenty of time to sink many kilometres below the waves.  And once a pollutant finds itself in the greatest ocean depth, where else is there to go? The bottom of the Mariana Trench, for example, the deepest point on Earth, was found to host highly-contaminated amphipods. Once these POPs are in the food web there are no mechanisms for dispersal or reversal from such great depths, and hence the bio-accumulation will only continue. The only positive from this story is that, once people realised these chemicals were an awful contribution to the world, POPs were banned by the 2001 Stockholm Convention. At this point one would hope some major lessons were learned. But no, we don’t look have to look far to realise this taught us nothing. Just take a look at the plague of plastic microbeads (and other microplastics) turning up in the ocean following a brief excursion from, say, a cosmetics bottle, across someone’s face or armpit and then sent on the long journey down the plug hole.  It seems that once again, we have a shocking example of our own stupidity, as people gradually realise that plastic microbeads are, funnily enough, made of plastic, and that stuff that goes down the sink doesn’t magically disappear into another dimension. We have all likely heard that “Mount Everest would fit into the Mariana Trench with over a mile to spare” or some other pointless analogy regarding the number of elephants standing on a car illustrating the high pressures in the oceans. These all serve to needlessly distance ourselves from these remote marine frontiers.  Of course, the pressure and depth are immense, which do require incredible physiological adaptations for survival, and equally clever engineering solutions for exploration, but the 11km that so easily swallows Mount Everest is still only 11km. Think of it like this: 11km is only half the length of Manhattan Island, I could legally drive it in less than six minutes, and Mo Farah could run it in less than 30 minutes.  The reality is that the deep sea just isn’t that remote, and the great depth and pressures are only an imaginary defence against the effects of what we do “up here”. The bottom line is that the deep sea – most of planet Earth – is anything but exempt from the consequences of what happens above it, and it’s about time we appreciated that."
"Every year I teach an undergraduate class on climate change. In some depressing respects this should be one of my easiest lectures. For the past few years I would have just needed to change the date on the slide which says the current year is the warmest that humans have ever recorded. But this year was different. This year the class fell on a Thursday, one day after Donald Trump was confirmed as the next US president. I had to begin by explaining how someone who has said that 
global warming is a hoax and who wants to rip up the climate change agreement achieved last year in Paris, was now the leader of the most powerful nation of Earth. A nation that while no longer the largest single emitter of carbon dioxide – that goes to China – is still the most influential on the international stage. I had initially prepared some remarks for the beginning of the lecture to the effect that politics is complex and that not everything President-elect Donald Trump said when he was plain Mr Trump may have been entirely truthful. So when I came to consider how he would actually administer the country, I thought he may well row back on some of that rhetoric.  But then I learned that Trump had tipped Myron Ebell to head up the Environmental Protection Agency transition team. The EPA is the most important federal agency with regards to climate change and other pollutant controls. Ebell has been described as a “top climate sceptic”. “Denier” would be a better description, however, so profoundly at odds are his beliefs and statements with our understanding of how humans are affecting the climate. So while my plan was to address these issues in the light of the latest round of climate change negations at COP22 in Marrakech and then get back to business I spectacularly failed. I largely lost the lesson plan and at times was at risk of losing my composure.   I began by trying to explain to my students the debt that was being accumulated to them – the costs older generations are passing to them as a consequence of their unwillingness to reduce carbon emissions. There are positive indicators that global emissions are levelling off – the fabled decoupling of growth from emissions. But we need large and sustained reductions right now and for the rest of the century if we are going to avoid the dangers that lurk around 2℃ warming above pre-industrial levels.  Trump’s election threatens to extinguish any hope of keeping warming below that level. But I had to tell my students that there is the risk that this lets others off the hook. Very few climate scientists would argue that capping warming at 2℃ was likely under current scenarios. The 1.5℃ aspiration that was a surprise outcome from Paris is even more implausible. In fact, almost all strategies to achieve either involve “negative emissions” technologies – ways in which excess amounts of carbon dioxide will be sucked out of the atmosphere.  While there are promising pilot projects that can capture carbon dioxide from the air and safely store this underground, these operate at nowhere near the required scale. And every year we delay making radical reductions in emissions, means even more reliance on them. This an example of the intergenerational debt that is being handed to my students. Climate change is going to be their problem. If they don’t find solutions to it, it is they who will suffer. Every year of my students’ lives, they have been told that climate change is perhaps the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. And every birthday they have celebrated, the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere was higher than it was the year before. Every birthday another confirmation that all talk about combating climate change is yet more hot air. The election of Trump will be a particularly large candle on their next cake, but it will join many others. It’s becoming increasingly harder to imagine how anyone would be able to blow them all out. It’s no exaggeration to say I spend most of my working day thinking about human’s impact on the Earth and what that could mean for our children, grandchildren and those that will come after. And I also spare a thought for some of the millions of species that we share the Earth’s biosphere with. And I’m usually optimistic despite the sometimes very negative research I read.  But Thursday got the better of me. On Thursday I felt like an utter fraud. Or perhaps an open mouthed spectator of some awful spectacle. A spectacle that if I were to search my wallet, I, along with many of my generation, would find a paid ticket for."
"In Australia, the only thing as certain as drought is the subsequent calls by politicians to build new dams. Right on cue, the prime minister announced a $1bn commitment for new dams on Sunday. But if new dams can solve Australia’s water problems, why didn’t the government build more dams last time? Or the time before that? It may seem obvious, but building new dams doesn’t make it rain. Even if it does rain, we already have plenty of empty dams where the water can go. But with even more empty dams, Australia could hold even more water to last through the next drought, right? Not necessarily. More important than how many dams Australia has is how we allocate water. Even if a new dam had been built for public use and it had water in it last year, most likely it would have been used for irrigation. Towns like Dubbo and Tamworth would be in exactly the same situation that they are in now. In New South Wales, where the current drought is centred, water is allocated to towns, irrigators and other users based on how much water is expected to flow into dams in the coming year. Prior to 2014, NSW allocated water based on calculations around the “worst drought on record” and ensuring that high security water licence holders would still have water during the driest years. The worst drought on record for NSW was the millennium drought from the turn of the millennium to around 2009. Planning for such a long drought and holding sufficient water in the state’s dams was opposed by former NSW water minister, Kevin Humphries, who claimed: [Water allocation calculations] currently require water to be set aside within a dam, to ensure full or near full allocations for high security licences can be maintained through the worst drought on record. This water-sharing rule was developed prior to the recent millennial drought. When the millennium drought is taken into account, implementation would result in significant quantities of water being taken out of production, and held in reserve just in case an equally severe drought occurs again. Read that again if you have to. Keeping water in dams “just in case” of severe drought is not good for business. Water in dams is water that isn’t being used for irrigation. Humphries introduced legislation that removed the millennium drought from water allocation calculations, meaning more water came out of dams for irrigation which would otherwise be available for towns through the drought. Even without the problem of how we allocate water, the case for building new dams runs up against some serious problems in the Murray Darling Basin Plan, which puts a cap on the amount of water extracted. If more water is diverted, for example via a new dam, then an equivalent amount of water needs to be taken out of irrigation somewhere else. If that doesn’t happen, the government is reneging on the basin plan and opening itself to potential legal challenges by affected water users, including the environment. Beyond the intricacies of water accounting, dams are expensive. One of the projects proposed by the prime minister is the upgrade of the Dungowan Dam near Tamworth. The proposal is to increase the capacity of the dam from six to 22 gigalitres. The additional 16 gigalitres is estimated to cost $480m, or $30m per gigalitre. To put that in perspective, the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources budgets $3m per gigalitre for its current water recovery. Politicians lamenting the lack of new dams somehow manage to overlook the 20 to 30 new dams that have been built in the last few years. These dams are several square kilometres in size and many can be seen from the road between Griffith and Hay, NSW. They were even subsidised by the taxpayer. The reason politicians don’t like to talk about these dams is they do nothing for drought-stricken towns and struggling communities. Instead they are on private land for the exclusive use of corporate agribusiness. Dams on private land like these face far lower requirements in terms of public consultation, environmental and economic assessment. By contrast, public dams can be stopped by frogs, snails and people wearing kaftans, according to former water minister Barnaby Joyce. What Joyce means is that governments know new dams face problems with environmental approval and community opposition. In response, The NSW cabinet is considering new legislation that will remove requirements for comprehensive environmental assessment and proper cost-benefit analysis. One billion dollars, watered-down environmental assessment and no cost-benefit analysis. What could possibly go wrong? • Maryanne Slattery is senior water researcher at the Australia Institute"
"Forty years after giant panda numbers reached an all-time low, specialists around the world are still trying to develop a self-sustaining population in captivity that can be released into the wild to secure the animal’s future.  This has been hampered over the years by institutions failing to work together and follow the breeding recommendations of genetic scientists. In China in particular, the home of giant pandas, breeders have prioritised cub numbers over quality. The problem is that the competing ministries responsible for panda populations are paid for each cub they produce.  There have long been concerns that breeding pandas in the wrong way produces cubs in captivity with health and behavioural problems. These problems exacerbate the difficulties of giant panda reproduction and make them less capable of coping in the wild.  We have just published new research into panda milk that adds to the growing evidence of how human interference can be bad for these animals. It relates to the fact that in China it is standard practice in breeding centres to intensively supplement – or even entirely replace – the mother’s milk with an artificial substitute. In Chinese husbandry culture, the belief is that this is the best way of ensuring the cubs have the best chance of survival and grow as quickly as possible.  Practices vary in other countries, often depending on the nature of the panda loan agreement they have with the Chinese authorities. In many cases, they are required to have a Chinese zookeeper overseeing the pandas at all times, in which case they will follow Chinese practice. (One example of a zoo that doesn’t interfere with panda milk is Vienna).  Milk is particularly important for giant pandas because of the extreme immaturity of a newborn panda cub. All bears are born more developmentally immature than any other mammal apart from marsupials, and of the seven bear species, giant pandas are born most immature of all.  Newborn pandas weigh only 100-150g, about 1/1,000th the weight of their mothers. They have no functioning immune system, cannot see or hear, and cannot regulate their own body temperature. They are naked and completely dependent on the mother for every aspect of survival and development.  As readers with children will be well aware, mothers produce a special milk in the first few days after giving birth which is unique in its composition of specific nutrients. Known as colostrum, this first milk contains specific types and concentrations of substances essential for the newborn’s immune system, as well as proteins, lipids and other molecules that are vital for development.  In species that are born fairly mature, such as calves and foals, the colostrum phase of milk lasts only a few hours. In our new paper, which is the third in a series of papers about giant panda milks, we hypothesised that the transition from colostrum to mature milk would be unusually long in bears in order to meet the requirements of a developmentally immature newborn. Sure enough, when we analysed milk samples from six giant pandas, the colostrum phase turned out to last 30 to 40 days.  We also found that the composition of the milk varied greatly over the period, with some ingredients starting off in large proportions and falling away while others started low and rose dramatically. Some of the most noticeable changes related to small molecules that are building blocks for the eye, brain and nervous system.  Other fluctuating ingredients are integral to cubs’ biosynthetic pathways, cell membranes, antibacterial defences and establishing microorganisms in their digestive system. These microorganisms may be particularly important to giant pandas as they progress from a milk-based to a predominately vegetarian diet within the first year of life: giant pandas may depend on a unique gut microbiome to be able to digest the large quantities of bamboo that form the foundation of their diet. We also analysed the artificial milk formulae that breeders commonly use to supplement giant panda cubs. We found that key compounds were at extremely inappropriate levels – some too low, others too high. They also stayed at these levels, not changing like the mother’s colostrum to meet the needs of the developing infant.  For example, we discovered that the artificial milk had a gross excess of lactose, which is abundant in cow and other milks but disappears from panda colostrum after the first day or two. This lactose causes panda cubs severe stomach problems and disrupts the fragile balance of microorganisms in their gut, which can hamper their digestive processes for the rest of their lives.  At the same time, we found major deficiencies in other key compounds in the artificial milk that may be compromising the development of the cubs’ brains, eyes and other organs – a grave risk considering the ultimate intention is to release captive-bred individuals into the wild.  In the wild, panda mothers invest extraordinary time and skill rearing their infants to be sufficiently adaptive and resilient to survive. We still have a great deal to understand about this process, and our research reveals what is probably one of a number of ways in which panda cubs suffer when breeders prevent panda mothers from raising their cubs undisturbed.  It is probably equally unhelpful, for example, that panda families are interfered with hourly and live in barren enclosures where mothers have no privacy or control over their environment. At three to five months of age, cubs bred in captivity are permanently removed from their mothers to maximise the chances of the mothers reproducing every year. This is very different from the wild, where cubs stay with their mothers for at least two and a half years and females reproduce only every four to five years.  If we wish to build a captive panda population of bear cubs that are physically, cognitively and behaviourally healthy, breeders need to leave mothers to their work. Our research emphasises the evolutionary  wisdom that no one else is better suited to that job."
"The Victorians introduced many of the traditions we now associate with the festive season. Along with Christmas cards, crackers, mince pies and Santa Claus himself, they are responsible for the modern day Christmas dinner. While British households would once have had goose or beef at the centre of the table, by the end of the 19th century most were eating turkey.  In the intervening years, many of us have taken this festive feast for granted. Nothing lasts forever, though, and growing populations and changing economic conditions could easily make Christmas Future look less rosy than what has gone before.  We still produce enough food for the time being, but it is not well distributed and much is lost at different points in the supply chain. There have already been some unnerving reminders in recent months about how easily food security can be compromised. So read on with trepidation.  We lose around 25% of the food we produce to pests and diseases, and there have been some salient examples lately. Turkeys have been under threat from bird flu. First there were outbreaks in more than 12 countries in mainland Europe, including France and Germany, such that British farmers were ordered by the authorities to keep their birds indoors as a precaution. This meant some turkeys would technically fail the requirements for free-range status by spending too long in barns.   Then came the news a couple of days ago that bird flu had been detected on a turkey farm in Lincolnshire in the east of England. Up to 5,000 birds were culled to prevent the spread of this highly infectious virus.  The UK’s Food Standards Agency is saying bird flu does not pose a food safety risk and it is not believed this year’s turkey supply is under threat. But bird flu is only one infectious pathogen which can affect farm animals: farmers are fighting a constant battle against diseases, with foot and mouth and BSE only the best known other culprits. Turkey farmers at least have the advantage that they can keep their birds indoors. Crop farmers do not have that luxury, as farmers of Brussels sprouts have been finding to their cost. Their crops have been under attack from diamondback moths arriving earlier and in greater numbers than usual. Farmers in Lincolnshire, who supply two-thirds of what the UK consumes, report a drop in output of up to 60%.  These are age-old problems, of course. But in a world of mounting pressure on food supplies, eradicate pests and diseases and we wouldn’t need to increase production so much to feed the growing population.  In addition, climate change and more intensive farming are causing new and emerging diseases. Take prawn and shrimp production, which since the early 1990s has been under attack from white spot syndrome virus, probably due to more intensive farming. Another example is salmon farming, which routinely struggles with sea lice because fish are bred in confined spaces. Worth considering as you tuck into your smoked salmon or prawn cocktail starter on December 25.  Political uncertainty is another risk to people’s food security. Due to the uncertainties of Brexit, one estimate is that Christmas dinner will cost 14% more than last year – and that’s before the UK actually withdraws from the EU. The row over the price of products including Marmite earlier in the year between Unilever and Tesco was a taste of what is to come.  Inflation is expected to rise steeply in 2017, which is a trend that ought to make politicians nervous. Rapid price increases in other countries have been the cause of civil unrest, and it is certainly not unthinkable that the same could happen in the UK. It was already recently estimated that more than 8m people in the UK are struggling to put food on the table, and inflation will only push more to the brink.  Then there is climate change, which threatens food both from long-term change and increased annual variations. We are seeing more and more extreme weather events and these are set to get worse. Since so many plants depend on weather conditions, expect upheaval.  In 2011 in the UK, for example, there was a shortage of holly due to early frosts but a bumper crop of mistletoe due to a mild autumn. Yet in Texas that year, a drought caused a mistletoe shortage.  Clearly mistletoe and holly are not issues of food security but root vegetables are. In January, there were concerns that parts of the UK were losing lots of carrots and parsnips because flooding was causing them to rot in the ground.  Water also needs a mention here. The southern UK has already had summer hosepipe bans for many years to cope with water shortages. This will be as nothing compared to the global water battles that climate change and population growth make increasingly likely.  Christmas dinner is probably safe for this year, but many of the issues we are encountering suggest more serious things to come. This brings into focus the amount we waste each year.  The UK throws away around 7m tonnes of food and drink each year, more than half of which could have been consumed; and at Christmas the country throws out 5m Christmas puddings, 2m turkeys, 74m mince pies and huge amounts of vegetables, fruit and snacks. When you reflect that food security is a global issue, and that many countries have a much harder time feeding themselves than the UK, waste really needs to move up the agenda.  Beyond this we need to start finding solutions to the major threats to food from climate change and population growth. In a civilised world, it’s vital that everyone can have access to decent food – and a feast at Christmas if they want one."

"How far can journalists and aid agencies stretch a story for a good cause? If you know it will be true soon, can you say it is true now in order to help poor people and countries? Can you help to stave off a slow onset disaster by pretending it is already happening? This is the problem for Bangladesh. Oxfam says “every day, 4,000 Bangladeshis are moving to cities in search of a safer life, away from the challenges of increasingly extreme weather”. Christian Aid and the Guardian both write of climate change refugees going to Dhaka. Even the UK Department for International Development (DfID says Bangladesh is “already experiencing the effects of climate change”. But this is not exactly true. For decades, floods and cyclones have destroyed farms and livelihoods, and people have fled to the cities. What is new is that Bangladesh is now one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change. All the predictions are that climate change will make the floods worse and the cyclones stronger and more devastating. If global warming is not curbed, there will be tens of millions more people moving to the cities, and these will be climate change refugees.  But it is not happening yet, and as we show in a new book, Bangladesh Confronts Climate Change, the country is not a helpless victim. For two decades, it has been campaigning to limit global warming, and has been building defences against climate change. It is a poor country, but three quarters of spending on climate comes from the national budget and not from donors. Climate change is rightly a priority issue. Aid agencies want to raise money by saying they are helping climate change victims. Journalists want to write about the effects of climate change. Bangladesh needs the money. It is tempting to collude and say ordinary environmental refugees are “climate change refugees” – after all, their children will be, in a decade or two. But what is actually happening is different and is linked to Bangladesh’s unique geographic position. Bangladesh is a densely populated country which feeds itself because it is on a rich delta. But its position means it is subject to destructive cyclones coming up the Bay of Bengal as well as huge and dramatic floods caused by monsoon rains and water pouring down from the Himalayas. For decades, there have been environmental refugees, forced to the cities by floods and cyclones. But they are not climate change refugees.  The Bangladesh environment is hugely variable. The worst flood in a century was in 1998 when 68% of the country was flooded, but that flood came only four years after the driest year, 1994, when a mere 0.2% of Bangladesh was flooded. The last maximum category cyclone was in 2007.  Scientists can see temperatures slowly increasing and sea levels rising, but the annual changes are too small to notice. So no Bangladesh disaster can be blamed on climate change – yet. There are no climate change refugees – yet. But greenhouse gases are building up and the global temperature is rising. Himalayan glaciers will start to melt, making floods worse; the temperature of the Bay of Bengal is rising and cyclones will be more powerful and destructive. Christian Aid and the Guardian both cite people who have moved from coastal areas to Dhaka, the capital and the largest city in Bangladesh. But they were pushed out by cyclones and an aid project that went wrong, not by climate change. With early warning systems and shelters, Bangladesh has hugely cut the death and injury rate from cyclones but property damage is still severe, and some people choose to migrate to cities and start again there.  Another group of refugees they cited were displaced by a misguided aid project to build dykes and create Dutch style polders which did not take account of Bangladesh’s massive monsoon rainfall, which flooded and then waterlogged the land in the polders, so it could not be farmed, forcing thousands to move in recent years. These groups could be called “environmental refugees”, so is any harm done in calling them “climate change refugees”? One of the problems in identifying them with the latter is that it ignores the way these stories have another side, one that involves actors rather than victims, who are able to do things to help themselves. Locally-designed cyclone protection and support systems do not just save lives, but also help people remain after a disaster and rebuild their lives. Bangladeshi communities and engineers have developed ways of using the sediment flowing into the delta from the mountains to reverse the waterlogging, and even to raise the land to match sea level rises.  When it comes to climate change, Bangladeshis will also be taking a key role in annual climate change negotiations this year in Marrakech. These are the Bangladeshis on the frontline of climate change, who are fighting now to push us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and who are working in Bangladesh to adapt to what they know is coming.  Perhaps aid agencies and journalists can best help Bangladesh by telling the stories of Bangladeshi climate change heroes trying to prevent people becoming climate change refugees, instead of only telling stories of helpless victims who could be labelled climate change refugees."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the last part of the tough Weltwoche interview with IPCC WG1 Co-Chair Thomas Stocker (see Part 1 here and Part 2 here).
INTERVIEW PART 3
Lüning: Next Weltwoche refers Stocker to the natural cycles, which fit well with the 20th century’s overall pattern. The Little Ice Age also was characterized by low solar activity.
Weltwoche: There’s a very simple explanation: A little ice age prevailed until well into the 19th century. Glaciers peaked at around 1860. This is indeed only normal that it has gotten warmer again.
STOCKER: That’s true for the glaciers. But it doesn’t explain the speed at which the melt occurred over the last 30 or 40 years and for how strong the warming has been since the beginning of the 20th century.
Lüning: Over the last 50 years, the sun was stronger than at almost any time, yet supposedly had nothing to do with the temperature and glacier development? And earlier in the past the sun and its cycles indeed did play a role. Now we are being told that this role was suddenly lost over the last decades? That doesn’t make any sense.
Weltwoche: During the Roman Times when Hannibal crossed the Alps with elephants there were even fewer glaciers.
STOCKER: Yes, but we also have to ask ourselves: What else was different 22oo years ago? The sun did play a role because of the inclination of the Earth’s axis. Back then the summers received more sunlight – about 10W per square meter more. It’s obvious that it was warmer back then.
Lüning: 2200 years ago the Earth was in the midst of the Roman Warm Period, one of the warm phases occurring every millennium whenever the sun was active. But instead of discussing this real factor, Stocker prefers to drift off to the very long-term Milankovitch cycles, which do not play any role in today’s climate development. This is an obvious attempt to distract the reader. With Stocker once again bringing up Milankovitch, he could have brought up the mid-Holocene climate optimum of 7000-5000 years before present when it was 1°C warmer than today. The reason back then was indeed a special Milankovitch Earth orbital geometry, But because this long warm period of the past doesn’t fit with the climate-alarmist concept, Stocker avoids it.
Weltwoche: Don’t you feel a little queasy when astrophysicists say the sun is currently weakening as much as it did during the Little Ice Age of the 17th century?
STOCKER: No, today it is impossible to forecast solar activity because unfortunately we are missing precise data and models. But we cannot exclude that such a phase may have already begun. However, it’ll eventually end – and in the meantime the CO2 concentration continues to rise and this will lead to even greater warming.
Lüning: Oh dear, this is not good, Professor Stocker. Today we can almost say there’s a consensus among astrophysicists that the sun will be very inactive over the coming decades. A Swiss paper on this topic by Steinhilber and Beer (see the last paragraph of our blog article”Wer ist Schuld am Kältewinter? MPI-Studie weist eher auf die schwache Sonne anstatt des arktischen Meereises hin. Die Sonne im März 2013“) appeared recently. Currently there is hardly a single paper out there that contradicts this. It’s no use playing dumb on this point and, as is the case with the pauses in warming, to act like nothing is really known and that everything is just chaos. The reconstructions of solar activity of the past thousands of years are very regular in nature and the pattern cannot be ignored. What’s even worse is that Stocker mixes-up the solar internal cycles with the Milankovitch cycles. The two have nothing to do with each other. The solar internal cycles involve changes in the intensity of the sun’s hydrogen reactors. Stocker’s reference to CO2 changes in sync with the Milankovitch cycles that are 20,000 years and more completely misses the barn. Could it be that Stocker is not familiar with the subject and is thus incapable of keeping the mechanisms apart? Or is it just another attempt to mislead the reader?
The closing part of the interview speaks for itself and requires no commentary.
Weltwoche: Let’s get down to the fundamentals. Sociologist Gerhard Schulze says: “Science is organized skepticism.”
STOCKER: I’ve not heard that.
Weltwoche: In climate science, ‘skepticism’ is a dirty word.
STOCKER: The term “climate skeptic” often gets used. That is so. But skepticism is the driving force of science. We also ask: Is it really so? Did we really understand that correctly? Climate science does not differ from the other sciences.
Weltwoche: Your colleague Hans von Storch, however, writes in his current book “Die Klimafalle” that scientists did not think enough about falsification, that is refuting a hypothesis, which alone moves science forward.
STOCKER: That’s his view. When we started researching the last 50 years of climate development, we indeed applied falsification by testing all possible explanations. We could have arrived at the result that the sun was 90% responsible and CO2 10%. But all calculation showed just the opposite.

Weltwoche: Was your result already decided when the IPCC started in 1989?
STOCKER: No, the task was to openly and comprehensively report on the level of knowledge on anthropogenic warming.
Weltwoche: Indeed: that climate change was man-made was certain from the very beginning.
STOCKER: Not at all. Millions of measurements and the physical understanding form the foundation of this claim.
Weltwoche: Hans von Storch also says: “The debate on the subject that we could be wrong is taboo.” Don’t you ever ask yourself that?
STOCKER: The debate over the period of little warming started about three years ago. At the IPCC it is not a taboo. Rather, a group is looking at and assessing the published scientific studies on the question – and not some blog posts or treaties. How often did such similar phases of stagnation occur in the past? How probable will they be in the future? What are the explanations for them? On this important subject we are creating a box of three or four pages -that’s a complete overview.
Weltwoche: What are the main statements of your report?
STOCKER: Today I can’t tell you any more than the New York Times can.
Weltwoche: To put it in another way: What reactions do you expect in policy-making?
STOCKER: That’s difficult to predict.The climate problem, that’s my personal estimation, at the moment is certainly not at the top of their agenda, but it is closely tied to energy and resource policy. We can only hope that climate policy again explicitly returns to the agenda. Many of the decisions we make, like those on energy infrastructure, will have consequences for decades into the future. Therefore the report should make a contribution that these decisions are made with the knowledge of all the facts.
Weltwoche: Numerous times already in the last decades climate scientists have said that if something isn’t done by a certain date, then it’ll be too late. These deadlines have come and gone, without anything happening.
STOCKER: With such statements you have to be extremely careful. To the contrary in climate change there are indeed developments where at a certain time-point they will be irreversible. For this reason last year I wrote an article, “The Closing Door of Climate Targets”. Missing is the knowledge that certain climate targets, for example keeping the warming under 2°C, will soon be no longer achievable. We are racing ahead in a car towards a concrete wall and pressing the accelerator down even though we know that the braking distance hardly suffices.
Weltwoche: That means: Mankind is committing collective suicide.
STOCKER: No, but adapting to climate change and its effects is going to cost a lot of money, take up lots of resources that we could otherwise apply more sensibly. And it is going to lead to conflicts over these resources.
Weltwoche: You’re not making a depressing impression.
STOCKER: No, if I were depressive, it would adversely effect my abilities to disseminate the findings of science. Should I just clam up and not speak about the problem? I’m not going to do that. The problem is there, it is one of the biggest that humanity faces, and we have the choice on how big it’s going to be. I want to inform about that. 
Lüning: We had to wait until the very end for Stocker to out himself as an activist. “The problem is there, it is one of the biggest that humanity faces,” he says. We should all be concerned when a leading IPCC referee, someone who is supposed to view and summarize the scientific literature objectively, has already personally made up his mind for the climate-alarmism side. With this backdrop, what are the chances the IPCC will revise its overblown temperature projections and modify its models when there is so much powerful evidence showing that natural climate factors are playing a role in the warming? How will Stocker suddenly appear when the anthropogenic global warming effect is far less dramatic than what he vehemently projected in the past and projects currently?
One of the most important tasks for the IPCC in the coming years will be to prevent personal interest conflicts and to assure an appropriate amount of skepticism when handling scientific literature. Until then the IPCC reports unfortunately will not be able make any sensible contribution to understanding the complex climate interrelationships.

"Last week, the Paralympian James Brown tried to glue himself to the top of a plane as part of Extinction Rebellion’s protest at London City airport. Watching the epic performance unfold, I realised I hadn’t seen a single person with a disability who was also a climate protester. Brown is visually impaired, so while he has no direct mobility impairment I don’t imagine straddling an Embraer 190 is an easy manoeuvre. But it was a testament to democracy – and made me think about the place that people with disabilities have within the growing climate movement. As someone with cerebral palsy, I want an accessible revolution. It is everyone’s future, and that needs to be represented in both climate protest and climate policy. Let the plastic straw ban be the first and last anti-disabled, pro-climate legislation Protest presents so many systemic barriers for people with disabilities, no roadblocks necessary. This was evident when the Extinction Rebellion Disabled Rebels group organised a mobile toilet service for last week’s demonstration – and the hoists and changing tables were impounded by the police before the demonstration even started. Accessibility issues in protest don’t just come from police, but sometimes from groups like Extinction Rebellion too: when street protests are held outside a hospital, many people with physical disabilities aren’t able to go about their daily lives; and if they are held across London – where only about a third of tube stations are step-free – they are often unable to participate. I was born of climate activists. Naturally, I should be one too. But, by birth, I also have one of the most common causes of physical disability in the UK. I’m finding any drive for direct action that wells up inside me is drained by the prospect of life-limiting climate policies. As part of the environmental movement, plastic straws, which enable around one in four people with my disability to drink, will soon be banned in all drinking establishments. Yet things we could all do without – plastic packaging, six-pack rings and polystyrene cups – remain unregulated and freely flow into our oceans. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has done work on gender equality, using “gender focal points”, people who assist in gender-related decisions about the climate. But there isn’t a list of representatives with disabilities, though the outcomes of climate change negotiations will disproportionately affect us. The Paris agreement makes clear its obligation to disability and human rights, but will people with disabilities actually be involved in the discussion? If we aren’t represented at the top, the impact could be catastrophic for people like me who need certain reasonable adjustments to live our lives. People often tell me, “I don’t know how you get out of bed in the morning with a disability like yours,” but that doesn’t even begin to account for the science and writing and speaking I do, the students I support, the Paralympic training I participate in, the dates I go on. I’m not able to do these things because I’m superhuman – in actuality, it has a lot to do with my motability vehicle, with its regrettable diesel engine, and my blue badge. Limited mobility does not have to mean a limited life, but new climate change policies must recognise the distinction if we are to maintain any level of disabled liberation. Let the plastic straw ban be the first and last anti-disabled, pro-climate legislation. I was obsessed with a book when I was a kid – Ben Elton’s Gridlock – where oil barons and government agents who want to build more motorways try to murder a climate activist and scientist who invents the perfect electric vehicle. It was published in 1991, before I was born, and when electric vehicles weren’t commonplace like they are now. It just so happened that the hero and climate activist had tetraplegic cerebral palsy. He was a fictional character then, but I believe he’s the climate hero we need today. The oil barons might still want him gone, but it is essential that those responding to the climate emergency do not. • Hannah Dines is a Rio 2016 Paralympian, physiologist and writer"

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday DIE WELT reports that large swaths of Munich saw the power go out this morning starting at 7:01 a.m. local time, leaving thousands in the dark and the affected areas paralyzed for about half an hour.

Just a simple short circuit? (Photo source: Robert Lawton, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic license).
Computer screens went black, trains stopped, electric doors trapped people, elevators stopped, factories ground to a halt, and traffic signals ceased to operate, thus leaving half of Munich in total chaos.
Germany’s electric power infrastructure not long ago was considered to be one of the world’s best engineered and most reliable. Since I’ve moved here 23 years ago, I can recall the power going out maybe once. Power outages here are almost unheard of.
But all that is changing today, thanks to Germany’s hysterically driven energy transition away from steady nuclear and fossil fuel power sources over to “clean” and environmentally friendly wind and solar power. Unfortunately in the wintertime, when there’s little sun and often times little wind, and overall demand is high, bottlenecks in the supply of energy are becoming increasingly common and posing a real and mounting threat to grid stability.
The exact cause of this morning’s blackout is still unknown, and knowing the religious fervor driving the green power movement, the real cause may never be made public. The drugged-up-on-green media are playing down the situation as just an event that could happen to anyone, anywhere.
Munich’s city utility claims to have found the cause. DIE WELT writes:
In the meantime the Munich City Utility has released the cause of the power outage: There was a defect with a 110,000-volt supply line between Munich and Moosburg, which is located to the north.”
The Munich fire brigade reports that the blackout was caused by an explosion at a transformer station. “Three isolators exploded at a 110 kV transformer station.” According to DIE WELT, the city of Moosburg, home to 18,000 residents, still remained without power even at lunchtime. Later at 12:30 DIE WELT reported that service had been restored.

The online Bild daily reports:
‘The power outage hitting large parts of Munich is traced back to a technical failure in the power line system north of the city,’ said the head of the Munich City Utility (SWM), Stephan Schwarz. …’Details are still unclear.’ […] ‘It was probably a power spike that passed through.’”
A power spike? Where would that come from? Bild adds:
Schwarz emphasized that ‘the incident had nothing to do with the energy transition and the entire discussion about a secure power grid.’ A reference to the energy transition is ‘completely wrong’. ‘What happened today could have happened 20 years ago.’”
Strangely, Schwarz has already begun pointing the finger at a possible culprit, saying that “if it turns out that E.ON Bavaria is responsible for the outage, then it has to start thinking about questions of liability.”
You see folks, it’s the big bad power companies again. Let’s all blame them.
Companies and industry may wish to think again about moving operations to Germany. Sure malfunctions at stations can occur. But it is indeed a bit strange that power outages, many lasting just a few tenths of a second, have been on a hockey stick increase lately ever since Germany started force feeding the uneven supply of wind and solar power into its grid and switching off an array of nuclear power plants.
Energy experts have been warning for months that Germany will be dangerously vulnerable to power outages more than ever, especially if this winter turns out to be a hard one. The instability of the green energy supply has led power companies to intervene hundreds of times to keep the grid up. It’s only a question of time before the big blackout hits.
Just be sure to have a good supply of candles on hand.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMajor German dailies today are reporting that Europe is beginning to give up on the big green dream it once so deeply cherished and envisioned a great society powered by clean sunshine and wind. After trying for years to force renewable energies onto consumers, the bill came and eyes popped.
Suddenly we are also seeing studies showing that warming won’t be so bad after all, and that CO2 climate sensitivity is much lower than first thought. The policy-making pressure coming from the threat of climate change is disappearing rapidly.
The German leftist TAZ and center-right Die Welt report today that the EU Commission is preparing to embark on a policy to make energy prices lower, and to push climate protection measures off the stage.
The TAZ writes that the “EU Commission is preparing a fundamental change of course in energy policy. Because of the recession in many countries, state and government leaders are to undertake a paradigm change at their summit in Brussels on Wednesday“.
The overall sentiment is expressed, for example, by statements from EU Commissar Günther Oettinger, who told Die Welt:
Over the last decades Germany has continuously made energy more expensive with taxes, levies, fees, and contributions. That now has to change.”
The high energy prices have taken a toll as companies are finding it more difficult than ever to compete globally. The TAZ writes:

Indeed because of the economic weakness in many EU countries, climate change no longer has any priority for the Commission. The sole target of getting 20% of energy demand from renewable sources has been pushed off further. Commission officials are backed by a paper from the mighty European industrial association: Business Europe. According to the study, energy costs for Europe’s concerns are 1.5 to 3 times higher than the USA.
If 400,000 new jobs in the sector of production are to be created, then the EU ‘has to overhaul its climate protection and energy policy,’ said Europe-Business-President Jürgen Thumann.”
So why is energy so much more expensive in Europe than it is in USA? The TAZ writes that this is primarily due to the fact that USA is “exploiting its shale gas reserves using controversial fracking“. The TAZ adds:
According to the EU Commission, energy prices in the EU have risen 37% since 2005. In the USA that have even dropped slightly.
The EU Commission maintains that the following guideline has to apply: “EU energy policy has to assure uninterrupted supply of households and companies, affordable and competitive prices.”
When it comes to the clash between economics and climate protection, it appears economics is emerging as the most pressing.

"In the run-up to Donald Trump’s inauguration, many climate experts are expressing concern that his views and those of his senior appointees are at odds with mainstream climate science. They’re grimly preparing to re-enter the fray of last-decade’s “climate wars”, which saw scientific knowledge about global warming come under intense and sustained attack. I am as concerned as anyone by politicians’ newfound aversion to evidence – pioneered, embarrassingly, by populists in the UK. Obviously, if politicians say things that are simply false, it is our duty as scientists to point that out.  But we should also point out what they are not saying, which suggests that Trump and his appointees accept much more of the scientific evidence for human-induced climate change than they are prepared to let on – and, crucially, much more than most of their supporters probably think they do: a case of the footsoldiers not realising that their generals have abandoned them. And what those generals accept is already more than enough to justify continuing the relatively modest climate goals of the Obama administration. I appreciate this line is asking a lot of Trump’s opponents: to characterise the president-elect and his appointees as straightforwardly anti-science seems like a political open goal. The problem is, it may also be an own goal.  Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, former ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson, claims “our ability to predict that effect [of greenhouse gas emissions] is very limited”. But he carefully avoids saying whether he means effect on the global energy budget (which is nailed down to within 10% or so), effect on global temperatures (which is predictable, and predicted, within a factor of two), or effect on the weather in Washington DC. So when a helpful journalist adds that 97% of climate scientists disagree with him, all that members of the public hear is that 97% of climate scientists are idiots: of course climate prediction is uncertain. So, what are these facts on which Trump and colleagues are so carefully silent? First, the idea that there is no connection between humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions and rising temperatures seems to have been quietly abandoned. Trump himself acknowledges “some connectivity”. Tillerson has conceded “an effect”, while Scott Pruitt, who Trump is proposing to lead the Environment Protection Agency, has called for a debate about the “degree and extent” of human-induced climate change, not whether it exists at all. This is a long way from Senator James Inhofe and his snowball. Second, no one outside the wilder fringes of the internet is publicly arguing that 3-4℃ of human-induced global warming (far beyond the range of climate fluctuations since the last ice age) is “acceptable”. Perhaps some individuals believe it in private, but Tillerson has certainly been advised not to express this view in public lest Exxon gets landed with the bill for relocating the population of Bangladesh. So there may be more consensus than meets the eye on what constitutes “dangerous interference” in the climate system. Third, everyone also agrees that how the climate responds to global emissions is uncertain, and how policies affect emissions is even more so. So as far as today’s policies are concerned, whether we are aiming to stabilise temperatures at 2.5℃ above pre-industrial levels, or the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of “well below 2℃”, is largely moot: what matters is that we are aiming to stabilise temperatures at some point this century, rather than settling for indefinite warming. And finally, no-one is contesting the other key conclusion of Paris, that stabilising the climate requires net global carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced to zero. This is significant precisely because there are other ways of stabilising global temperatures, such as “solar radiation management” where reflective particles are inserted into the upper atmosphere. I am not aware of anyone in the incoming administration advocating such geo-engineering – unsurprisingly, since to do so would acknowledge that climate change is a present danger requiring a globally coordinated response. Put together, these facts logically imply that net global greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced to zero sometime this century – which is not that far from the UNFCCC position. Temperatures have already risen by about 1℃ since the mid-19th century (and, again, no one seems to be disputing this any more). If we are to stabilise warming below 2℃, every 0.1℃ of additional warming from now on must be matched by emission reductions equal to, on average, 10% of today’s emission rate. At the rate the Earth has been warming since the 1970s, 0.1℃ takes less than a decade, so 10% per 0.1℃ means emission reductions of 1-2% per year: and the longer we put them off, the steeper the required cuts become. Perhaps Pruitt and Tillerson really believe that reductions at the modest end of this uncertainty range are all that’s required. We should all hope they are right (although it would be nice to see the evidence), because that would mean current plans might be just enough to meet the long-term temperature goals agreed in Paris, , rather than woefully inadequate. But it hardly makes a strong case for investing in new coal-fired power plants. The Paris Agreement and the Obama government’s Clean Power Plan were hard-won successes. But, though it may seem disloyal to point this out, both actually had relatively modest goals that are more than justified even by the new administration’s more sanguine attitude to the climate problem. Both scientists and liberal journalists may be reluctant to give the incoming administration credit for being right about anything. Much of what they are saying is indeed demonstrably at odds with scientific evidence. When Tillerson suggested that scientists were equally split on whether it was possible to trace a link between greenhouse gas emissions and some classes of extreme weather event, he was simply out of date. But what they are not prepared to say tells a different story – one that shows how far the debate has moved on even among the most ardent disbelievers. Sometimes, as Sherlock Holmes would say, the most important clue is the dog that doesn’t bark."
"A blue dragon, Aeshna mixta, the migrant hawker, is poised at the wood’s edge. Its two pairs of clear, plasticky wings hold a flash of October sunlight and take a moment’s rest to open like solar panels on a satellite. These wings that brrrrr through the airways of the dragonfly’s hunting territory have carried him far: not just the distance from his natal pond where he spent darkly aquatic years as a larva, but maybe hundreds of miles from continental Europe. Before the second world war, migrant hawkers, as the name implies, travelled here from far away; in more recent years they have bred here and a warming climate has helped expand their range from southern England northwards to Scotland and westwards into Ireland. The population of British-bred migrant hawkers is boosted by actual migrants each year; I don’t know if this dragon is one of those.  The wand of his abdomen is more than 60mm long, with two sky-blue, eye-shaped dots on each dark segment and a yellow triangular mark at the top. His compound, visor-like eyes are also blue and these markings give the dragon the appearance of a creature of alien intelligence from another world. This is true. Dragonflies evolved in the Carboniferous era, 300 million years ago, hunting among giant ferns and cycads aeons before the temperate deciduous forests, and the trees and brambles he perches on, ever existed – a world without autumn. These wings that carry the dragon from deep time, across continents, to hawk the edge of this wood, receive the light on falling ash leaves, the ochre of lime trees, raindrops on scarlet bryony berries, the scents of fungi and rot, the sound of ravens and wrens, skittering squirrels – flash-in-the-pan species compared to dragonflies. It is hard to imagine this place without autumn. However changeable seasonal definitions become, the very existence of deciduousness and the world it characterises is now in question. I wonder about the dragonfly as he navigates this wave of probability through time and space: what does his cryptic blue insignia mean; what can his fabulous eyes see; where can his wings take him?"
"It was Tesla Motors, more than any other company, that triggered the current interest in electric cars. The firm’s namesake, Nikola Tesla, a genius inventor and Thomas Edison’s arch rival, would no doubt be pleased. Yet Tesla would be even more thrilled to realise the next step for electric vehicles involves turning his biggest vision into reality: the wireless transmission of power. Due to their low local emissions, battery-powered electric cars are more in demand than ever, but they still have a reputation for being too expensive and having too short a driving range. So how about recharging them without having to plug in a cable, while parking or even driving on the road?  This isn’t science fiction: we know from our electric tooth brushes that batteries can be recharged without plugging in a wire, and even smart phones can be charged just by being placed on top of a pad. Here’s how it works: an alternating current (AC) flows through a wire coil (the transmitter), which causes a magnetic field to switch between two directions at a high frequency. A second coil (the receiver) exposed to that magnetic fields picks up those oscillations, inducing an AC current in its own circuit, which is then used to power the car (or charges the battery in your toothbrush). Electronic systems able to handle higher frequencies, which allow more power to be transmitted, are becoming more affordable. Energy can now be transferred between coils that are increasingly further apart or aren’t aligned accurately. Thanks to this technology, some electric cars can already be charged by parking them on top of charging pads, which can be as much as 20cm away from the receiving coil at the bottom of the vehicle. The next step is to wire-up the roads themselves with coils so that cars, buses, and even trucks could be charged while they move.  For peace of mind, wireless charging systems are properly shielded so that no animals or humans will be harmed. A coil in the road will only emit power when it is in wireless communication with a receiver coil above it, and the latter will absorb nearly all of it. The bit that is lost is mostly absorbed by the metal body of the car itself. Retrofitting roads with wireless charging coils sounds expensive. But recent studies show that the biggest part of the cost comes from the construction work itself – on a new or renovated road, the extra costs are not that high.  Charging on the move isn’t just a convenient time-saver – it will also bring down the cost of electric vehicles themselves. Batteries that get recharged more frequently during usage will last longer and can be made smaller while retaining the same driving range.  As with all new technologies that rely on not-yet existing infrastructure, wireless vehicle charging will start in a niche market (remember the early and expensive days of mobile phones?). In this case, the niche is electric buses that re-charge at bus stops and on certain segments of their fixed driving route.  The global pioneer is the Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), a bus developed a few years ago by South Korea’s Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Continuous charging means OLEV buses cover their routes using small batteries just a third the size of those found in a regular electric car. More recently, Swedish truck and bus-maker Scania trialled a similar system of recharging stations for buses to demonstrate such technology could still work in harsh Nordic winters.  For passenger cars, wireless charging will first come as a convenience feature. People will be able to park in their driveway or garage without having to plug in a cable, and will still have a recharged battery next time they need the car.  We will have to wait longer for a dense network of highways that can charge vehicles on the move. This would be a major infrastructure investment and would involve a substantial quest for more copper wires and semiconductor components.  Experience with the technology and agreement on international compatibility standards will be prerequisites of such investments. Safety must not be ignored: the transmitter coils emit substantial power, which is only considered safe if it is in proper communication with a receiver coil. Communication between transmitter and receiver must also be secured against accidental or even intentional interference – an aspect that even touches on cyber security. So when and where will we see electrified roads being rolled out on larger scale? Korea will try and maintain its leadership in this technology. Places like Singapore, wealthy and with strong ambitions in clean and efficient transport, may follow soon. Standardised electrified roads could become what the railways were to the 19th century: not only a leap in transport efficiency, but the core of a new industry."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDie kalte Sonne site here has a report on how the WWF claims that climate change will likely lead to more ship accidents on the high seas, caused by stormier weather.
Science Speechless Over Embarrassing WWF Claim: Environmental Activists Postulate More Ship Accidents Due To Climate Change
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
Former East Germany party organ ‘Neues Deutschland‘ (New Germany) brought out a claim from climate activist group WWF on June 10, 2013. In it a surprising relationship had been postulated:
WWF: Climate change increasing the risks of ship accidents. Climate change and the associated extreme weather events increase the dangers of ship accidents on the seas, according to the environmental organization WWF. Increasing frequency of storms heighten the risks, said the WWF Germany on Friday at the World Conference of the Seas on 8 June [2013].’
Neue Deutschland apparently is referring to a press release that had appeared on a WWF website. Unfortunately we are not able to quote from this press release because the hotel in Dublin where this blog post was created unfortunately does not allow access to websites of political activist groups (see screenshot).

Thus it seems that the hotel has correctly rated the affiliation of the WWF. Little wonder, because when you compare the claims made by the WWF to the results from serious science, the overblown construct collpases. According to the WW, climate change will lead to more storms.
First let’s check whether warmer temperatures lead to more storms at middle latitudes in the past. The result: unexpectedly the exact opposite of what the WWF asserted has actually occurred: i.e., the colder it was, the more stormy is was! For example see our blog article: “Storms in the English Channel occurred in sync with the 1500 year cycle: The colder it was, the stormier it was” as well as other papers here).
And what does the situation with hurricanes look like? Over the long-term it appears that hurricane activity has decreased (see “New climate modeling finds long-term reduction in hurricane activityi“). It is indeed baffling how the WWF could be so reckless with the scientific facts. This is especially troubling in light of the fact that the WWF avidly participated in writing the new IPCC climate report. Just a few months ago observers sounded the alarms when a draft of the IPCC report was prematurely released to the public, where in it several papers from the WWF and Greenpeace were quoted.
The link that Lüning and Vahrenholt could not access from the hotel in Dublin is here.

"It should be a momentous occasion for the environment. In early October 2016, 55 countries with 55% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions ratified the Paris climate change agreement. On November 4, it comes into force. The main long-term goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. But what does meeting the Paris aims look like in the short-term, within our lifetimes? The most obvious point is that it requires countries to rapidly reduce their emissions. It’s not clear by precisely how much, or precisely when, this needs to happen – we just don’t know enough about the climate sensitivity for that. But it is clear that to have a fighting chance of meeting the Paris target will require large and sustained emissions reductions, starting very, very soon.  This is not remotely close to the path we are on at present. The 2016 BP energy outlook, published after the Paris agreement was signed, sees emissions from fossil fuels continuing to grow substantially at least until the end of its time horizon in 2035. So the world says warming of 2 degrees is unacceptable. But people aren’t acting like it is. Something big is missing: a massive effort to cut emissions. If countries truly are going to meet the Paris goals, this has to change.  This effort could come in the form of lots of centralised regulations, and subsidies for low-carbon energy sources. But many experts think strong, comprehensive prices on CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions will be considerably cheaper. Given the scale of the effort required, and the problems that typically occur when governments are asked to spend money on social goods, if we don’t do it as cheaply as we can, we probably won’t do it all. The “polluter pays principle” is a basic tenet of environmental policy. It says simply that anyone who causes harm should have to pay for it. This calls for prices on CO2 emissions in the range of US$150 to $250 per tonne, according to an economic model of the harm caused by climate change which I devised to guide policymakers – recent work by scientists at Stanford broadly agrees. The price should be much higher per tonne for methane released into the atmosphere by agriculture and fracking as this is a much more potent greenhouse gas. To get the emission reductions needed, which could be 3% to 5% per year for more than 50 years, we need these prices in the form of strong, comprehensive taxes on greenhouse gases, paid by firms, farms and final consumers. And we need them now. It’s fair to ask what such taxes would do to energy prices. At $150 per tonne of CO2, they would add 25% to petrol prices in the UK, 30% to the price of gas-fired electricity, 50% to gas prices, 75% to the price of coal-fired electricity. They would probably add nearly £100 to the price of a return air ticket from London to southern Europe (and just think what that does to the case for a third runway at Heathrow).  But remember that these measures are still the cheapest way of meeting the Paris target, if that is truly what we intend to do. Strict technical regulations and generous subsidies for solar power or electric cars are likely to cost far more. Climate taxes also have an upside. At $150 per tonne of CO2, they would bring in about £75 billion per year in tax revenue in the UK from year one – that’s about 15% of all UK tax revenue.  If the government chooses, it could use this revenue to reduce VAT by two thirds, once out of the EU, making almost all products at least 10% cheaper at a stroke. Or it could reduce the basic rate of income tax from 20% down to 5%. Or, most likely, it could do some sensible combination, reducing income, sales and payroll taxes, while using a small part of the revenue for information campaigns, basic R&D, and measures to avoid hardship, such as the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. There is some evidence that directing about 10% of the climate tax revenue towards the
poorest two deciles would stop it being regressive. Given the Paris targets will require people to live much cleaner lives anyway, these seem like pretty good side-effects. So how will the Paris agreement change your life? In all the obvious ways, like encouraging more energy efficiency, more windmills, more electric train travel, possibly more nuclear power. But also in the less obvious ones, like the extra pay in your bank account at the end of each month, the lower cost of a meal out at your favourite restaurant, or the new job opportunities created by lower payroll taxes.  The alternative is to say that cutting emissions as far as this is just too much trouble. In which case we need to be prepared for a radically different world with temperatures rising by 4-6°C or more. That would see ice sheets melt, sea levels rise, new deserts form, and many tropical locations become essentially uninhabitable.  The world would have to pay a lot to adapt to this new climate reality, and to become resilient to the ever-worsening impacts of climate change.  I know which world I prefer."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe UN has been holding climate conferences in a bid to curb man-made CO2 emissions for 20 years. However CO2 emissions are incresaing at record reates as China, India and an array of third world countries finally develop and begin to vanquish grinding poverty in earnest. That UN effort has failed completely at curbing the alleged greenhouse gas. Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel here writes that scientists are now calling for an end to the conferences.
Experts in Germany are now demanding the mega-conferences be abolished and that a taboo be broken: The world has to accept that the temperatures are going to rise – and to tackle the consequences.
Bojanowski reminds us that world leaders had their big chance in Copenhagen in 2009. Leaders like Angeal Merkel and Barack Obama even attended. That conference, however, ended in a fiasco. Today many world leaders skip attending the conferences altogether. Bojanowski: “Experts see UN climate policy as failed”. These experts include climate policy expert Oliver Geden, Frank Uekötter of the Rachel Carson Center, Silke Beck of the Helmholtz Center, and Maximilian Mayer of the University of Bonn. In their view, there’s no hope of the process ever working.
However, the chances of abolishing climate conferences altogether are very small. Spiegel writes that too many benefit from them. Political leaders get the chance to showcase their energy visions for the future – without ever having to be held accountable decades later. “Large-scale planning over the long-term also assures large budgets for a number of bureaucracies within the administrative apparatus.” Experts say that climate scientists are among the biggest beneficiaries.  Uekötter is amazed: “No other group allows itself to make such comprehensive planning for the restructuring of society.”
Experts have also given up all hope of meeting the 2-degree target. One problem, according to sociologist Sebastian Wiesnet of the University of Bamberg, is that some “leading scientists insist that avoiding CO2 emissions is the only solution to the climate problem. This one-sidedness of the UN simply resulted in other appropriate measures being pushed to the background”. Adaptation was never viewed as a worthwhile solution.
Indeed those who proposed adaptation measures were often accused of doubting man-made global warming. The issue is in the control of policy radicals who view mitigation as the only path. Bojanowski writes: “In some western countries like Germany ‘a change of course would be political suicide’.”
Climate models “almost completely neglect reality”
Another problem Spiegel looks at is the over-reliance on climate models: Spiegel writes:
The domination of the computer climate simulation is having a devastating consequence, says Werner Krauss of the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht: ‘The almost completely neglect of reality.’ The only ‘world that is going to be saved’ is the one that exists in the computer models,’ the ethnologist believes. What’s important is how people cope with the weather on site”.

"The seaside and cities of Britain are under siege by wild and ferocious predators. Birds are wreaking havoc on innocent members of the public with indiscriminate attacks. Some fearful citizens have even reportedly taken to carrying firearms for protection – from gulls. For the seagulls’ list of victims seems to grow all the time. Tourists daring to eat ice creams in daylight, fans of fish and chip take-aways, festival goers, school children, cyclists, tortoises, Chihuahuas, supermarket customers, are all seen as fair game from the skies. So serious is the airborne threat that the Conservative MP for one south-west England constituency called for a parliamentary debate after a friend lost his fish and chips to gulls. Even the notoriously tough South Africa rugby team was accused of being unnerved as their British coastal training ground was dive-bombed during the 2015 World Cup. National newspapers have featured photos of the birds swallowing rats, pigeons, and in one case reported the violent eating of a starling, as “the poor starling chicks were forced to look on”. In 2015 the then prime minister, David Cameron, called for a “big conversation” about the challenge and pledged a quarter of a million pounds to fight back, egged on by the then Liberal Democrat MP Don Foster. The gull has Britain rattled, and its enemies appear to crumble. Neither the £250,000 nor Foster survived that year’s general election. The creatures supposedly terrorising towns and capturing the public imagination are two particular species, the herring gull, Larus argentatus, and its very close cousin the lesser black backed gull, Larus fuscus. Both are large, feisty, greedy generalists happy to pull a worm from a wet lawn or dive bomb a jittery tourist into dropping their lunch.  Both attract critics and supporters in equal measure. The birds are either seen as viscous free loaders who pose a genuine threat to children, or an entertaining part of the British seaside tradition. After all, what exactly do you expect to find beside the sea? But the gulls’ recent fortunes are complex, with both species widespread in northern Europe. In the 20th century their range of habitat expanded and overall populations rose, perhaps due to a decline in hunting and egg collecting, combined with their adoption of refuse tips as prime foraging sites.  At the same time they have retreated from their traditional coastal breeding haunts and have been making their homes in big cities since the 1940s. But despite appearing to be common, their overall numbers are not on the increase. In the UK in the late 1900s the population of lesser black backed gulls fell by 48% between 2000 and 2013. With most birds breeding in just four super-colonies which have all shown marked declines, the lesser black back is now officially an “amber listed” endangered species. Inevitably, labelling the birds both as a psychotic murderer and an endangered species causes confusion. Both species are protected by a mix of UK and European law, although nuisance lesser black backs could, until recently, be controlled with a general licence under the UK’s Wildlife and Countryside Act. But this option was withdrawn as the gulls’ numbers fell and did not apply to herring gulls in the first place.  So what do we do about the sometimes ruffled relationship between gulls and humans? Research from a study in the Netherlands indicated that culling of urban populations may be largely ineffective, merely resulting in new birds migrating in to exploit new nesting and feeding opportunities. One response may be to “gull-proof” rubbish and waste bins, reducing the food available and so reducing the major incentive for the birds to share our urban living spaces.  The trouble is, you cannot gull-proof a tourist. The traditional British seaside sights of donkey rides, deck chairs and buckets and spades are now joined by the day tripper holding out a chip to lure in a beady-eyed gull next to a “Do not feed the gulls” sign as other tourists run for shelter. The gulls continue to dive bomb, terrify, and target the unwary.  Meanwhile, the pair of lesser black backs that last year bred on the roof outside my city centre office in northern England are back. As I write this, they are swooping, mewling, and fighting for dominance in the gusts and eddies of campus buildings. Both of their chicks apparently survived and are probably looking forward to their first high season of adolescent rampage at the nearby promenade, where the notorious local gulls have learned to use the automatic doors of fast food outlets."
"The 1980 animated feature film Animalympics featured an ice-skating flamingo who competed for gold against a whole range of other sporting animals. In the second edition of BBC nature programme Planet Earth II, this cartoon seemed to have turned into reality. Sort of. The flocks of flamingos filmed high in the Andes Mountains were certainly skating along on their frozen pools, though they didn’t quite provide a medal-winning performance.  For a bird as fragile-looking as the flamingo, this bleak, icy wetland would seem a strange place to call home. Yet many of them do, and Planet Earth features two of my favourite species: the Andean flamingo (Phoenicoparrus andinus) and the James’ flamingo (P. jamesi), also known as the puna flamingo, after the local term for these high plateaus. The Andean is the rarest of the six flamingo species, with fewer than 40,000 remaining in the wild.  Their movements and breeding cycles are hard to predict and tricky to study. So vast is the Andes plateau that the James’ flamingo was considered extinct until 1956 when it was suddenly rediscovered in Bolivia’s remote Laguna Colorada (Red Lake), 4,000 metres above sea level. Flamingos do a good disappearing act; whole flocks will vanish overnight as they travel between mountain lakes searching for the best food supply. Flamingos are often associated with tropical beaches, palm trees and piña coladas. But this is far from the truth. All six species are highly adapted to living in inhospitable and unfriendly environments such as very salty or very alkaline wetlands. More than a million lesser flamingos breed in Tanzania’s Lake Natron, for instance, a lake fed by hot springs with water so alkaline that it can strip away human skin (one pioneering flamingo researcher named Leslie Brown spent months in Nairobi General Hospital after burning his legs wading out to observe where the birds nested). Yet flamingos thrive in conditions like these. And they thrive because, in each location, they have discovered an untapped food source they can collect with little competition from other species. Flamingos have very specialised diets. And their food is responsible for their famous pink colouration. The two species in Planet Earth II eat a lot of floating microscopic algae, which contains carotenoid pigments, the same types of chemical that make carrots orange. These pigments turn their feathers pink, orange and red – without them, flamingos would be white.  The only feathers on the birds that do not get stained pink are their black wing feathers. Flamingos are heavy birds and black primary feathers are more resistant to wear-and-tear. As the wetlands in which they find their carotenoid pigments are few and far between, flamingos really do have to bump along in a crowd. But they have used this restriction on habitat choice to their advantage. Evolution has moulded them into a highly gregarious species, and the organised society that flamingos live in is integral to their whole way of life.  This even extends to reproduction. To feel comfortable enough to breed, as many birds as possible need to be “in the mood” at once. The wonderful footage of the Andean flamingos promenading across your TV screen is part of getting everyone focused on reproduction. It takes a lot of time and effort to rear a flamingo chick, and success is greatest if the whole flock breeds as one. Because environmental conditions are not always perfect, flamingos will delay breeding until they feel it is worth the effort.  And if this is your reproductive strategy then you need to live for quite a while. Flamingos take this to extremes. The world’s oldest bird, a greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) died in Adelaide Zoo in 2014 aged 83, and wild flamingos have been clocked into their fifties.  The Andean flamingos I study at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust in Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, have been around since the 1960s and are still going strong. The birds are all ringed so I am able to tell them apart and identify the real characters in the group. I’m fascinated by the soap opera of their individual social lives and have made this the key focus of my research.  The combination of erratic, collective reproduction and long lifespans has served flamingos well for many years. But the birds cannot always cope with human-caused changes to climate, alterations to wetland systems, and encroachment into their feeding and breeding areas. Some populations are in decline and their unique breeding cycle means recovery will be a long, slow process at best."

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited with permission by P Gosselin)
Summer is now in full swing and the Arctic sea ice that formed over the wintertime is now steadily melting. Typically the minimum in sea ice extent is reached in mid September. Last year (2012) a new melt record was reached for the satellite era, which however only officially started in 1979. How does it look this year?
The Center for Ocean and Ice of the Danish Ocean Meteorological Service provides a new ice graphic on a daily basis and so that the situation can be monitored. The Arctic sea ice extent of 2013 is depicted by the bold dark line on the chart below (Figure 1). This year there is considerably more ice than there was over the three previous years, which perhaps has something to do with the especially hard winter and the late summer start. It remains to be seen how this will develop further. Also in Alaska and the Baltic Sea larger than normal sea ice areas were observed.

Figure 1: Arctic sea ice extent over the years. Source: DMI.
In the meantime it has been officially confirmed that the north polar ice minimum of 2012 was mostly caused by a powerful storm. Three new studies have been able document this (Simmonds & Rudeva 2012, Parkinson & Comiso 2013 and Zhang et al. 2013). The storm ripped apart the ice cover and scattered the ice to the oceans. Also playing a role was the reduced ice thickness. The high temperatures of the current moderm warm period has helped to reduce the sea ice thickness over time, thus allowing the wind to have an easier time than it did earlier.
How did things look before the satellite age?
Here we find some surprises: Thin, shrinking ice was also common in earlier times, but it was not possible to measure it extensively. One phase of especially low sea ice in the Arctic occurred between 1920 and 1950 when submarines were able to surface in ice-free waters directly at the North Pole. A good overview of this period can be found at Judith Curry’s blog.

Now how does that fit with the notion that sea ice would move only in one direction, namely shrink? Strictly speaking the satellite era of sea ice measurement did not begin in 1979, but already a few years earlier. And if these data are accounted for, then an unexplainable disruption occurs in the curve as shown by (Figure 2). The sea ice coverage of 1973-1975 was significantly less than it was at the “official” start of the dataset: 1979. Interestingly this graphic had been included in the first IPCC climate report, but then it was left out in the subsequent reports because it did not fit with the desired catastrophe narrative.

Figure 2: Arctic sea ice extent 1973-1990. From the IPCC AR1.
Slowly scientists are now finding out how fluctuations in Arctic sea ice could be happening. In a paper published in the International Journal of Climatology a team of scientists were able to show that sea ice extent in the western Arctic ocean is 40-79% controlled by natural ocean cycles. Among these is the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Another team of scientists from MIT generated improved Arctic sea ice prognoses where ocean cycles and the associated patterns play a more important role.
When natural ocean cycles are taken into account, then one needs not wonder when the sea ice season in the Beaufort Sea in the Canadian Arctic lasts considerably longer than it did in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. This is shown in the journal of Biogeosciences where the authors reconstructed sea ice cover over the last 150 years. While sea ice covers the the Beaufort sea an average of 9.4 months per year today, earlier it was only 8.3 months. Back then water in this sea was about 3°C warmer than today. According to this new study the Arctic Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) played a great role.
The search for other factors effecting Arctic sea ice coverage continues on. There is evidence that the the sun could have a hand in the game. Also changes in measurement methodology and the evaluation routines have caused jumps in the curves. Does a melting Arctic present only disadvantages? It does not make a contribution to sea level rise because there is almost no net water displacement by floating ice that melts. Judith Curry’s blog names a few economic advantages of a low-ice Arctic Ocean.
Finally everyone wants to know how the Arctic sea ice will develop further. A couple of decades ago scientists were predicting an ice-free Arctic already for today. As this prediction failed to materialize, the date was promptly postponed to 2030. In the journal of Geophysical Research Letters, a team of scientists took a closer look and made more comprehensive calculations. Their result: If one assumes even the most aggressive warming prognoses, an ice-free north polar sea summer could be expected only at the end of the 21st century and a year-round ice-free Arctic Ocean at the end of the 23rd century.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe print edition of Spiegel today has an interview with Prof Hans von Storch, the outspoken leading climate scientist often aims criticism at both sides of the climate debate.
Not that von Storch is sort of a provocateur, rather he only speaks his mind, which at times for some means a message they’d prefer not to hear. He has something for both sides today, but moreso for the alarmists.
What follows are some excerpts that appear at von Storch’s Klimazwiebel site on the Spiegel interview and from the interview itself.
Less climate hysteria today
On the climate aspects of the flooding that has just occurred in Germany, HvStorch:
In my view the climate hysteria has decreased. There are still people who with every natural catastrophe are ritually calling out: ‘You see, it’s climate change’s fault!’ But indeed many more people are talking about the real causes of the flooding, like covering the ground with asphalt and concrete and the disappearance of natural flood plains. That’s good.”
Models facing a serious problem
On the current temperature stagnation while CO2 is rising, Klimazwiebel quotes HvStorch: “We face a puzzling problem. Only 2% of the models foresaw this, and if nothing changes in the next 5 to 6 years, research will be faced with a serious problem as not a single model projected that.”
SPIEGEL asks:  “That’s pretty dismal for your colleagues when they have to go back to the drawing board to adjust the models to fit reality…”

HvStorch: “Why? That’s how the process of science works. In science, also in climate science, there is no last word. We never deliver the truth. Rather we deliver the closest approximation of reality. It’s just that this often gets forgotten in the public perception and communication.”
HvStorch adds, “the mistake is that science often produces the impression that it is the keeper of the truth.”
Expect more surprises
Later in the Spiegel interview, HvStorch also believes that the global temperature will eventually resume its rise and may even exceed 2°C, depending on how emissions develop. He thinks so because that is what his instincts tell him, he says. He elaborates further:
Other climate scientists probably have another instinct. Our models do make lots of assumptions that are highly subjective. You can calmly expect more surprises.”
Ocean acidification makes HvS nervous
When asked about his fears on the consequences of climate change, HvStorch replies:
The possible acidification of the oceans from CO2 in the atmosphere. For me that is a phenomenon that is really scary – maybe because I understand too little about it. If marine life was no longer able to adequately form shells and skeletons, that would disrupt the marine food chain. That indeed makes me nervous.”

"The United Nations forecasts global population to rise to more than 9 billion people by 2050. Climate change may mean that the crops we depend on now may no longer be suited to the areas where they are currently cultivated and may increasingly be threatened by droughts, floods and the spread of plant diseases due to altered weather patterns. So feeding everyone in the coming decades will be a challenge – can genetically modified crops help us achieve this?  Two groups of genetically modified crops are widely grown. The first are altered so that they are not affected by the herbicide glyphosate, which means that farmers can eliminate weeds without harming their crop. Glyphosate-resistant crops can increase farming efficiency but, while helping to get rid of weeds, herbicide resistance has no direct effect on the quantity of food produced, so their contribution to food security is likely to be limited.  The second type produce a natural insecticide inside the parts of the plant that pests eat. This protects the yields of these crops against insect infestation, which is arguably more environmentally friendly than using sprays that could be toxic to other organisms. Crops of this type are likely to be useful, but we should increase the number of insecticide genes that we employ to prevent evolution of resistant pests.  Farmers have always faced crop diseases – think of the Irish potato famine of the 19th century – and some scientists predict that climate change may allow previously contained infections to spread into new areas and become more damaging. It may already have contributed to the devastating appearance of a fungal infection called wheat blast in Bangladesh, a disease that can cause nearly complete loss of this critical crop in infected fields. Genetic modification can certainly be used in the fight to make crops more disease resistant. Many plants are vulnerable to an infection because they cannot detect the invading organism. However, the proteins that identify an infection and activate a plant’s defences can be moved between varieties or even species using genetic modification. This will enable previously vulnerable crops to turn on resistance mechanisms. It is also becoming possible to rewrite the genes for these gatekeeper proteins so that they work for different diseases. A powerful and rapid method for editing genes called CRISPR-Cas9 has recently been developed and it is already being harnessed to produce genetically modified crops. For example, genes that make wheat vulnerable to powdery mildew have been changed to produce a resistant variety. Nor is gene editing limited to improving disease resistance. Tomatoes have been tweaked to be insensitive to changes in the number of hours of sunlight in a day. This causes them to produce fruit more quickly because they aren’t waiting for the right time of year to start flowering. Fundamentally, agriculture uses photosynthesis to convert light energy, water and carbon dioxide into food – so improving this process would increase how much food we produce. An obvious target is the step that captures carbon dioxide as it sometimes mistakes oxygen for carbon dioxide in a wasteful set of reactions called photorespiration.  As it happens, some plants already have a solution to this problem. They possess a system that pumps carbon dioxide into specialised parts of the leaf where most photosynthesis occurs, concentrating it there so that photorespiration doesn’t happen. These species, known as C4 plants, can make more use of sunlight at higher temperatures and need less water because the pores that let carbon dioxide into their leaves don’t have to open so much and therefore less water vapour escapes through them.  It has been estimated that transferring these mechanisms into other crop species such as rice could increase productivity by 50%. Unfortunately, progress towards this goal has been slow, partly because rice doesn’t have the same leaf structure as C4 plants. A version of rice that can carry out a simple version of C4 photosynthesis has recently been produced but it will take at least ten years to optimise it.  Less ambitious approaches may provide benefits more quickly, such as a new type of wheat in which productivity has been increased by 15% to 20% by speeding up recycling of ribulose bisphosphate which is crucial for carbon dioxide capture. Crops are not just being genetically modified to improve their quantity but also their nutritional quality. The most prominent of these is “golden rice”. Vitamin A deficiency causes 250,000 deaths per year and is common in populations whose diet is heavily dependent on rice. Golden rice is golden because it produces large quantities of yellow dietary carotenoids that our bodies can convert into vitamin A.  Other “biofortified” crops in development include potatoes with more protein and cooking bananas with increased carotenoids and iron. Many people – and countries – are still sceptical about GM food. But people and animals have now been consuming GM crops for more than 20 years without apparent harm to their health. On the other hand, there is no question that starvation kills and that food insecurity is a major global threat. There are challenging times ahead. Can we afford to close the door on these powerful ways to protect our food supply? _This article is part of a series by The Conversation on food security. Read other articles here."
"When five members of Extinction Rebellion’s youth faction climbed on top of the entrance to YouTube’s HQ on Wednesday, they were protesting against a problem that has particular relevance for their generation. In a letter to the company, they demanded that YouTube changes what the group claims is its disproportionate platforming of climate denial, on a site which is the most watched platform for 16-24-year-olds.  It is one of many ways XR Youth members are trying to make their voices heard in the climate crisis protest movement, which for them has an urgency they believe others struggle to fully grasp. Talia Woodin, 20, one of the XR Youth members who protested at YouTube, said: “It’s something that older generations will never be able to understand, because they’ve never been told that they will not get the same opportunities in their future that their parents and their grandparents had.” Daze Aghaji, another XR Youth member, said: “As an older person, you’re doing it for your next generation – but we’re actually doing it for ourselves.” The group is tired of hearing about the need to “save the children”; they are the children, and they have their own voice. Since XR’s two-week rebellion in April, and on the back of the school climate strikes spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, young people have been flocking to join up, the group says. There are now at least 80 XR Youth groups internationally, 55 of which are in the UK. All are made up of climate activists born after 1990, with an average member age of 16, although some are as young as 10. XR’s second wave of protests in the past two weeks have led to thousands of arrests and a police crackdown, which has banned them from congregating anywhere in London. XR Youth has organised its own action as part of this, including the YouTube protest and another outside the Department for Education to campaign for better teaching about the climate crisis in schools. Woodin considers the protest so vital she has dropped out of her visual anthropology degree to help coordinate the XR Youth rebellion. Growing up, her parents were engaged in Green party politics and her father, Mike Woodin, was the party’s principal speaker for six years until his death from lung cancer in 2004, when she was five. As he was a non-smoker and lived a healthy lifestyle, Woodin believes he was affected by the high levels of air pollution in Oxford where they lived. She said: “Having that exposed to me at such a young age made me reassess my priorities.” She finds that older people often compare the current climate crisis movement with the protests over nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 60s. But for her, they are not the same: “We are the first generation which has been completely united by such an existential universal threat.” That is why XR Youth is not afraid to stand its ground in the broader XR movement. Back in July, the group democratically voted against any involvement in the Heathrow disruption plans, and members have placed a greater emphasis on climate justice by working closely with the Internationalist Solidarity Network to provide support to indigenous groups and those in the global south who are the frontline of the climate crisis. Hollie Andrews, 21, helped set up XR Youth earlier this year, as part of a group who felt they were not getting the support they needed as young people within the rebellion. “We’re challenging the main XR a lot, we’re seeing what we don’t like and trying to fix that with XR Youth,” she said. “XR isn’t perfect but give us a better alternative. There isn’t one, I don’t think.” Coverage of XR’s rebellion has been dominated by the number of arrests, but the XR Youth team are keen not to glorify this. While some members perceive the threat of arrest as “meaningless” in the face of such an uncertain future, others think the arrest burden should fall on older people. XR Youth coordinator Savannah Lovelock, 20, said: “Adults need to be accountable to the young people, and if that means going on the streets and getting arrested in the thousands so we can have a chance of getting to the government and saying what we think should happen, then I think that should be the strategy.” For them, the fight is not just about the climate crisis but also the system they have grown up in and the impact this has had on their mental health. Daniel Walsh, 17, is part of XR Youth London and has been arrested five times for his part in the protests. He said: “Young people already have to face the problems of social media and body image issues … and now you’ve got the climate crisis to deal with as well. For some people, it has tipped them to breaking point. Certainly for me, XR has kept me alive. I was depressed before I was part of XR.” Reflecting back on their time in XR Youth, the members seem most proud of the communities that have been built and the friendships they’ve forged through the movement. “Rebellion isn’t just going on the street and getting arrested, it’s also rebelling against a system that makes us lonely and have no purpose,” said Lovelock. “It’s about creating those communities where people are held in their grief and their terror of what’s going on.”"

Dr. Peter Heller sees the IPCC in a difficult position as the body confirms global temperature stagnation. Photo source: www.freiewelt.net/
Heller first welcomes the transparency allowed through the early, though unauthorized, release of the report, writing that “transparency in the past had been sorely missed”. Heller then describes the purpose of the report and summarizes that the authors more or less have pretty much stuck to their opinion that man is changing the energy budget of the atmosphere though the emission of greenhouse gases, and adds:
That’s not surprising, as spreading this claim and searching for scientific evidence of this have been the purpose of the IPCC since it was founded 20 years ago.
First of all, such a temperature increase is not remarkable at all. The question is what will the consequence be. In its reports, the IPCC attempts to answer this. Here the results of model computations are used.
The problem, Heller reminds us, is that many physical and socio-economical assumptions here have to be made, and that is far from being an exact science. Heller then summarizes that there are little differences between the 4th and 5th assessment reports:

We expect fewer cold and more warm days and nights in most regions of the world.
Correspondingly, we expect more heat waves and less cold waves in most regions of the world.
Also we expect an increase in heavy rainfalls in more regions, and a reduction in fewer.
Regarding the strength of tropical storms, in AR5 they are less certain if they will increase.
While in AR4 it was assumed that more regions would be impacted by profound droughts, the scientists in AR 5 are markedly more unsure and careful about this.

Despite the similarities, Heller points out that the current version of the AR 5 has one fundamental admission: temperature has stagnated while CO2 has climbed. THE MODELS ARE IN TROUBLE!
Heller summarizes:
Five years have passed since the last assessment report, and the basis (particularly the scenarios and projections) of AR 4 are now older. Now is a good time to go back and check to see just how good the projections of the past match up to the developments of the present. AR 5 here has nicely added some details.

When one compares the real development of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere with the assumptions of the four previous IPCC reports (Figure 2, Page 41 in Chapter 1). The match is good. But it would have been bad if there had been larger deviations, as this would have meant gross false estimates already with the fundamental socio-economic start scenarios.
Next let’s take a look at the temperature development compared to the projections (Figure 3, Page 39 in Chapter 1).
Here no further comment is necessary. The stagnation of the last 15 years is clearly visible, and thus officially confirmed by IPCC, though only indirectly. The model calculations had never showed a stagnation, which us skeptics have long been showing. The trust in the abilities of the models to project the temperature development of the future thus have been shaken to the core.

Or at least it should be. We have to wait and see how politicians and media will go about handling this message. Foremost it will be interesting to see the changes and supplements in the coming report. While in the past it had been possible to remove or edit unwanted content (like the above diagram, for example) before final publication, this is no longer a simple matter. Alec Rawls has put the IPCC under pressure. Also the upcoming steps until the planned publication in September 2013 will have to be done transparently and publicly.
After all, we know that climate alarmism is a matter of faith. And one only believes what one trusts.

==================================================
And as is the case with temperature development, us skeptics also suspect a similar development is also occurring with sea level rise, polar ice melt, storms – to name a few. Real temperatures actually match up precisely with Vahrenholt and Lüning’s projection:

"The consequences of climate change are already being felt all over the globe. But some regions are particularly affected. These so-called “hotspots” are areas where strong physical and ecological effects of climate change come together with large numbers of vulnerable and poor people and communities.  Climate and development policy must pay special attention to these regions. With the Paris Agreement in force, and talks under way in Marrakech to fill in the details, now is the perfect moment. A 2015 study identified three types of climate change hotspots: 1) deltas in Africa and South Asia; 2) semi-arid regions in Africa and parts of South and Central Asia; 3) glacier- and snowpack-dependent river basins, especially in the Himalayas.  People living in these regions largely depend on their immediate environment for food and income, so they’re particularly threatened by any changes to temperatures, rainfall or the seasons.  Under normal circumstances, people can diversify their income and become more resilient through grazing their cattle on communal land or growing their own crops. But climate change threatens this “safety net” and may leave people more vulnerable to external shocks like the recent severe drought across southern and eastern Africa. In Niger and the wider Sahel region, drought is a recurrent environmental crisis with strong negative impacts on food and nutrition security leading to famines, especially among the most vulnerable people.  Droughts are just one of the natural hazards that are becoming more frequent and more severe due to climate change. In semi-arid climate change hotspots, these hazards affect livelihoods and will likely hamper socio-economic development. While they represent just 1% of the Earth’s surface, river deltas are home to half a billion people, a number which is projected to increase. They already include many large cities such as Bangkok or China’s huge Pearl River urban area. And fertile delta soils contain some of the world’s best agricultural land and are thus critical to ensuring no one goes hungry. Yet these delta hotspots are already at increasing risk of sinking, thanks to humans extracting underground oil, gas and water and weakening underlying sediments. When combined with rising sea levels caused by climate change, and more frequent typhoons, hurricanes and storms, river deltas can expect even more pronounced flooding and coastal erosion in future.  In many deltas, soil and water is also becoming increasingly salty, which threatens food production and could see many people forced to migrate. These challenges require urgent attention. The impact of climate change will continue to grow, as will the global population. Without serious strategies to address climate mitigation (by stopping emissions of greenhouse gases) and adaptation (new farming systems, flood barriers and protection of coastal wetlands, for example) people living in climate hotspots will become ever more vulnerable.  In September 2015, the UN’s member states agreed on a set of 17 goals as part of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These Sustainable Development Goals include one specifically aimed at combating climate change and its impacts, and the risk posed by climate change is acknowledged in the goals on poverty and hunger, among others. This is a good starting point. However, in the climate change hotspots, the combination of environmental and socio-economic challenges demand specific responses. As we highlighted in a recent publication together with colleagues from different fields on “Making SDGs Work for Climate Change Hotspots”, these vulnerable regions require extra monitoring in order to avoid development impasse. We urgently need a thorough analysis of possible policy solutions for climate change hotspots. Without a coordinated effort to specifically address these challenges, the goals and targets of the sustainable development agenda are likely to be at risk."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a critical article written by Jens Meyer-Wellmann appearing in German national daily Die Welt that got by me a couple of weeks ago.
The title: “Scientists should not play priest…Climate scientist von Storch accuses his colleagues of spreading panic – and sees no major consequences coming from a dredging of the Elbe River“.
Sebastian Lüning’s and Fritz Vahrenholt’s blogsite www.kaltesonne.de presented an excerpt of the Die Welt article, which I’ve translated in English:

‘Unfortunately in climate science there is a tendency to proclaim absolute truths and to link these immediately to instructions on actions to take,’ von Storch said. ‘The climate pope tells us what has to be done, and for the people it’s: keep your mouths shut. Scientists have been taking over the roles of medicine men and priests. That’s not the job of scientists. Science is supposed to help understand problems, show the possibilities that exist in dealing with them. The best is to show many possibilities. Then the political process has to decide the path to take.’
But some of his colleagues in science like to use ‘stories that point to a catastrophe,’ said the professor of meteorology. One example was the assumption that our region would see ‘murderous violent storms’. But there was no data showing this. ‘It all has a cultural, anthropological background’ . ‘If you sin, then you will be punished. And the punishment always takes on an environmental dimension which also included storms in the past. In former times it was God’s punishment. Today it’s punishment by Nature. Nature is to keep man in check. And for this we see idiotic films like ‘The Day After Tomorrow.’’
With ‘snappy’ and short statements like ‘snow will be a thing of the past’, the loud speakers among the scientists are putting the credibility of science at stake.'”

"For the local Pangnirtung Inuit, the Greenland shark is an animal that does not die easily. Dad used to say to me that sharks’ flesh has a hard time dying. The shark can be rotten, even sticky rotten, and when you touch the skin or the meat it still moves. You know, it is still alive but it is rotten. This might sound rather gruesome, but it turns out that this reputation has an element of truth to it. With an estimated lifespan of 400 years, the Greenland shark has just been reported to be the longest-lived vertebrate on the planet. This is only the latest of a series of recent findings that push the boundaries of animal longevity, and it raises the perennial question of what factors enable some animals to achieve what we might call extreme longevity – lifespans that can be measured in centuries.  The key to becoming a long-lived species is for individuals to regularly die of old age (and not from disease or being eaten) in the first place. Experiencing age-related degeneration allows a species to evolve resistance to it. So an effective defence mechanism against predators, such as a thick external shell, must be in place first. Once this “safe space” has been achieved, living longer becomes a way to produce more offspring in the most efficient way, especially when the food supply is intermittent. Here are five of the longest-living animals ever recorded. As well as being a top predator itself, the Greenland shark has developed a defence against predators in the form of highly poisonous flesh. Not being hunted in its early years allows the shark to pursue a more relaxed reproductive strategy. Females don’t reach reproductive maturity until an estimated age of 150 years. At the high latitudes where the shark lives, the limited amount of light during the winter means fewer plants and algae for other creatures to feed on, which can affect the amount of nutrients right up the food chain. So the ability to withstand the poor years and reproduce during the good years is key to the shark's’ survival, and a long lifetime is a great way to maximise the number of good years. The clam species Arctica islandica holds the record for the longest-lived animal known to science. We can measure its exact age by counting the annual bands in its shell, and this is how we identified a specimen (now popularly known as “Ming”) collected from Iceland that had lived for 507 years. In common with many species of mollusc, A. islandica grows more slowly and lives longer with increasing latitude. North of Iceland, they regularly live more than 300 years, while further south in European and North American waters (where nutrients are less limited) their age limit is about 250 years. As with the Greenland shark, this is a useful reproductive strategy in nutrient-poor waters when there is no threat from predators. A bowhead whale collected during a whaling expedition off Alaska in 2007 was found to have the head of a late 19th-century harpoon embedded in its neck blubber. Its age was estimated by radiocarbon dating to be 211 years, making this the longest-lived mammal so far identified. Unlike other whales, the bowhead lives entirely in cold Arctic and subarctic waters. Once again, this suggests a strategy that uses longevity to compensate for low nutrients in the winter. Analysis of bowhead whale DNA suggests that the lack of natural predators has enabled the whale to evolve natural mechanisms to resist age-related decline. For example, cancer, while occasionally present, is extremely rare.  The only terrestrial animal known to live beyond 200 years, the giant tortoise, is now confined to a few islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. An individual Aldabra giant tortoise died in a Kolkata zoo in 2006 at an estimated age of 255 years. The oldest giant tortoise living now, a Seychelles tortoise called Jonathan is reportedly 184 years old. The giant tortoise employs a “belt and braces” approach to predators, and maintains its thick shell even while living on isolated predator-free islands. Without the fear of predators, the animal can –- like the Greenland shark and A. islandica – slow its metabolic activity right down, helping it to survive periods of drought when food supply is limited. Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 at the age of 122, was the oldest person (and probably the oldest land mammal) ever to have lived whose age has been precisely verified. In fact, Homo sapiens is the only terrestrial mammal known to live for more than 100 years, and it is an interesting question whether this was the case even before the advent of organised agriculture. One indicator of longevity in mammals seems to be brain size. This reflects an increased ability to adapt to a changing environment and, of course, is also an effective defence against predators. It seems that even early humans, if they could survive childhood, commonly lived to 70 or 80 years, significantly longer than the other great apes. The frequency with which modern humans live beyond 100 years may also be related to modern medical practice, or may simply reflect the sheer number of humans."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Reader Chris Frey below comments that it’s only a 43-year record – not 100 years! Either way, it’s lots of snow. 
Today Focus magazine reports that Berlin has set a new record for the amount of snow on the ground in the month of March. The online news magazine writes:
A 16-centimeter blanket of snow covers the capital city on the first day of spring. ‘It’s the highest amount of snow that has been measured here in March in 100 years,“ says meteorologist Dominik Jung of the weather portal wetter.net.”
In Germany it’s getting so that children will soon no longer know what bare ground in the wintertime is.
High-profile German meteorologist turns skeptic
I recall getting a bit agitated a year or so ago because Jung once repeated the usual global warming rubbish we always hear in the media. But now that Germany has recorded its 5th colder than normal winter in a row and Berlin and Hamburg find themselves digging out from record snow, Jung apparently has looked at the science and data for himself and now seems to conclude that the CO2 theory is indeed over-hyped after all.
Hopefully he’ll pick up a copy of Die kalte Sonne to get complete overview of the science, if he hasn’t already.

Jung’s skepticism is now being reported in major media outlets all over Germany. For example Germany’s no. 1 daily by circulation numbers Bild quoted Jung’s wetternet.de website in bold print yesterday:
“Winters clearly have gotten colder,” says meteorologist Dominik Jung of the weather portal wetter.net. Moreover: “In the year 2000 the climate experts prophesied that winters with ice and snow in Germany would no longer exist. That this claim is false is shown by current facts, and in many regions with just a glance out the window!”
German yahoo.de reports here:
March so far in Germany is about 3.4°C colder than the long-term mean over the period 1981 – 2010. Now weather expert Dominik Jung is questioning climate warming: ‘I don’t think that it’s always going to get warmer.’“
Expect Jung to get a harsh lecture from the catastrophe-obsessed PIK on the evils of spreading “climate disinformation”, if he hasn’t already.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAll the talk now is about the Otto et al paper that just has come out, which claims that, well, the warming isn’t going to be like we thought. Oops.

Chart source: www.nature.com/ngeo/journal.pdf
Spiegel provides a first glimpse of the reaction from Germany: New Study On Climate Change: Earth Warming More Slowly Than Feared.
The Spiegel piece starts:
Most extreme scenarios less likely…
An international team of scientists have corrected the prognoses for climate change downwards. In a new study the scientists calculated a smaller global warming for the next 50 to 100 years than previously expected. But they did not turn off the alarm.”

And later writes:

The annual mean temperature would thus be about 0.9°C and 2°C higher than pre-industrial times. Thus they are considerably less than the forecast of the UN climate scientists in the year 2007, who estimated an increase of 1 – 3°C .
Co-author Reto Knutti said the new estimates for the time period are welcome.”
Reasons cited for the slowdown are heat absorption by the oceans, reduced solar activity, and high levels of aerosols in the atmosphere. Spiegel ends the article with:
Lead author Otto says the slowdown is not evidence that climate change is not going to happen. ‘You would need a considerably longer time period to be able to say there is not going to be any warming,’ he told the ‘Guardian’. Such a phase could last up to 40 years.”
You’ve got to be kidding me. Now it’s 40 years?
The recent warming was just 18 years long 1980 – 1998, and that was enough for them to declare a permanent climate state of emergency. And now that it hasn’t warmed in 15 years, they’re telling us that we’ve got to wait another 25 years to say that it’s not man-made. Such BS.
First rats to abandon ship
So what would possibly compel a group of mostly alarmist scientists to produce such results? Answer: It has dawned on them that other factors really are playing a big time role and that it wouldn’t be long before they looked like fools. What we are seeing are the first rats swimming off the sinking ship that is man-made global warming.

"Primates are remarkable. We’re all familiar with chimpanzees, monkeys, and ring-tailed lemurs, but have you heard of tarsiers, with their big eyes? Or Cleese’s woolly lemur, named after John Cleese? Or the fabulous red-shanked douc? What about the scary-looking red-headed bald uakari? Or did you know that primates can be as small as mice? There are 504 species in all, which makes primates one of the largest groups of mammals. Some – those we’re most familiar with – are active during the day, but others come out only at night. Some eat fruit, others eat leaves, still others eat insects, and some hunt for meat. One species mainly eats mushrooms, and some even eat other primates. Primates mostly live in tropical rainforests, and two thirds of all species can be found in Brazil, Madagascar, Indonesia or the Democratic Republic of Congo. But they can also be found in grassland, snowy mountains and deserts, and some even thrive in our cities.  Primates can live in solitude, in huge, complex societies, or anything in between. Some swing through the trees with such grace that they look like they’re flying, others don’t seem to move very much at all. Some sing duets. Many of them are superbly colourful. Some are beautiful; others are ugly. All of them are fascinating. I’ve been studying primates for 20 years, and I’m still surprised and delighted by new discoveries. Like the day I saw female monkeys attack a male three times their size. Or when I learned that some primates bury themselves in the ground to hibernate. And that capuchins crush millipedes and use them as insect repellent.  Primates are also essential to tropical rainforests, pollinating trees and dispersing seeds across these vital carbon stores. They’re our closest biological relatives, and we look to them to understand our own evolution. Over the past couple of years, I’ve been part of a global group of primatologists who have assessed the conservation status of all those 504 species. Our results are now published in the journal Science Advances.  The news is bad – primates are in dire trouble. Around 60% of species are threatened with extinction and 75% are declining in numbers. Without action, these numbers will grow and more species will disappear forever. This dismal situation is our fault. Primates are mainly threatened by losing their habitat when it is logged or converted into farms or ranches. They can also be hunted for meat, or to supply the illegal trade in pets and body parts. Road construction, oil and gas extraction, mining, pollution, disease and climate change all add to the list of threats, often in combination. I have flown over agricultural land that has replaced tropical forests, and stood among the charred remains of what was primate habitat. I have driven along newly constructed roads and seen dead primates for sale, and shopped in markets which sell bushmeat. I have seen newly-caught baby monkeys, destined to die slowly despite the best efforts of their human carers. I have worked with rescued animals and pondered their future. I have travelled on rainforest rivers heavily but invisibly polluted by illegal mining. I have come across hunters’ camps deep in protected areas, and I have walked through silent forests, emptied of animals. People living in these areas don’t set out to exterminate primate species. I have talked with people driven to distraction when their subsistence crops are ravaged by wildlife, including primates; with hunters who hunt to feed their family and to earn money for their children’s schooling and for medical bills; and with fisherpeople who hunt primates to feed their family when there are no fish available. The threat to primates is a result of political uncertainty, socio-economic instability, organised crime, corruption, and policies that favour short-term profit over long-term sustainability. It is hard to be positive when faced with human-driven extinction of our closest relatives. The situation is critical, but we, the 31 authors of the new report, led by Alejandro Estrada of Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and Paul A Garber of the University of Illinois, believe it is still reversible. To prevent primate extinctions, human needs must be addressed in sustainable ways, whether that be locally (finding ways for farmers to coexist with primates who forage on their crops) or globally (halting deforestation). There is no single answer. Conservation policies must be adapted for each country, habitat or species, based on the exact nature of each problem. This is a formidable task. But our hope stems from exceptional projects and extraordinary people around the world, like the Virunga rangers who risk (and lose) their lives to protect gorillas and other primates in DR Congo or Fundacion Pro-Conservation Primates Panamenos, an organisation dedicated to conserving Panama’s monkeys. The solutions lie in global fairness, and taking responsibility for the implications of our actions. We can’t ignore political and human disasters in other countries. We need to accommodate the needs of both primates and people in land-use policies, monitor primate populations, and mitigate illegal trade. Captive populations can be used to rescue species from the brink of extinction, but if their natural habitat has gone, there is no hope.  To reduce the pressure on primates and their habitats we must decrease demand for tropical hardwood, beef, palm oil, soy, rubber, minerals and fossil fuels, and promote sustainable resources. This is not news, but we must make it unacceptable to prioritise excessive and unnecessary consumption over the persistence of other species. Every consumer decision we make has global implications. Moreover, we must understand that wild animals are not suitable pets (the clue is in the word “wild”). Biologically, extinction is a normal phenomenon. Species evolve, and species go extinct. From time-to-time in earth’s history, mass extinctions have wiped out huge numbers of species globally. However, we cannot accept that we, as one primate species, drive others to extinction when are still able to prevent it. Next, read our profile of the most endangered primate of all – the Hainan gibbon."
"It’s hard to keep track of how many people have been arrested in the past year at climate rallies. In the past week alone, more than 200 people have been arrested at Extinction Rebellion rallies in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. If you get arrested at a rally, what do you do? Police powers differ slightly across the states and territories. Policing styles, rally permits, laws of assembly, and the names of charges vary. But broadly, the process of getting arrested across Australia is fairly similar. “At the very basic level, all police need to do is tell you you are under arrest and touch you. They don’t need to do much more,” says Anthony Kelly, spokesperson for Melbourne Activist Legal Support, who has also been arrested 18 times. “They also need to tell you why unless there are extenuating circumstances.” He says police can use “appropriate levels” of force to move a person during a protest. “You aren’t obligated to co-operate with your own arrest,” he says. “People can decide to stand up and go along or people can remain seated and go ‘limp’ or passively resist.” Kelly has been training activists in nonviolent protest since the late 1990s. He says it is crucial people stay calm. “There’s a massive power differential when it comes to getting arrested. It causes a lot of stress,” he says “It’s really easy for people to do something inadvertently, which opens up to other charges.” He cites the example of going “limp” and accidentally flinging an arm, which can lead to police assault charges. Margaret Pestorius, 55, an antiwar activist and devout Catholic, “thinks” she has been arrested 11 or 12 times. She says the challenge for nonviolent protesters is calmly “holding the space” against repression, as she describes it, while trying to cooperate with police. The moment of arrest is dynamic. Sometimes she is “engaged and friendly” with police as she is led to the police wagon. She sings and prays. In 2016, when she was arrested with four friends for trespassing at Pine Gap, the US surveillance station in the Alice Springs desert, she kept playing her viola. The police eventually told her to stop. “I gave the viola to the police inspector and asked him to look after it for me.” But in August, when she lay in front of prime minister Scott Morrison’s car at the Coag meeting in Cairns, the situation was different and she became flustered. She claims the police grabbed her and threw her on the grass. Two of them knelt on her. “I got rattled. I didn’t cooperate with them,” she says. Once arrested, police have the right to search, and can seize your mobile phone and wallet. They can do a pat-down. The police will also try to ask questions but there is no obligation to answer them. Kelly says the only thing people have to say is their name and address. “People are often advised to say ‘no comment’ from here on in. That’s a very important centuries-old right that people have,” he says. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Protestors under arrest are usually driven to a police station in a van. Once there, they must hand over personal possessions, including jewellery, belts and glasses. Anti-Adani protester Matilda Heselev, 21, was arrested in July this year, alongside Emily Starr, after they locked themselves to a concrete barrel at Abbot Point coal terminal in central Queensland. They were taken to Bowen watch house. “I wasn’t allowed to wear my glasses,” she says. “My advice to people who wear glasses is to wear contacts if they are planning on getting arrested.” She and Starr also had to hand over clothes with draw strings – a hoodie and a pair of trousers. It was cold in the cell. For a few years now, Pestorius has disguised ear plugs as nipples in her bra, which police never seem to find when she gets a pat-down. She finds jail very noisy. “Clangy,” she says. “Other people in there can be very upset … It can be quite disturbing. Ear plugs are a great boon for a good sleep.” While you don’t have to say a word to police, Pestorius likes to talk. “You try to connect with the people you come in touch with and explain why you are there.” Waiting for bail can take hours. Pestorius says she has used the time to exercise, sleep, meditate, sing songs and pray. “One of the things I often do is make sure I have some hymns written on my arm on a piece of Band Aid material. You usually have a phone number of the lawyer on your arm too.” Queenslanders do not have the right to a phone call if they are in jail for a simple offence. In Victoria, people are allowed two phone calls. “You’ve got the right to notify someone of your whereabouts and you’ve got a right to legal advice,” says Kelly. If you don’t have legal support, police can find it for you. He says Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people have other rights, which include contacting the Custodial Notification Service, a 24-hour legal advice and RU OK phone line. The police will eventually show you a list of your charges and bail conditions. The charges are usually minor, and may be anything from obstruction to trespass. Pestorius has long refused to agree to the bail conditions, which can include bans on meeting up with fellow protestors or returning to protest sites. “The role of repression is to tighten the political space and shift you out of the political space,” she says. Refusing bail conditions means you must stay in jail and wait to see a magistrate. This can take hours or days. Heselev and Starr refused their conditions and slept in jail overnight. When they saw a magistrate, Legal Aid wasn’t at the hearing. To the pair’s shock, their bail restrictions were tightened – they were banned from Bowen altogether. In the aftermath of her arrest, did Heselev learn anything? “I feel like if you treat the police with some sort of level of decency, they will return the favour. Sometimes it’s hard when you know what they stand for and the systemic issues that they represent,” she says. “It’s not a scary process but it’s obviously different for everyone.”"

"The protests led by Extinction Rebellion remind us that there are more pressing problems than Britain’s withdrawal from the EU (Of course these protests are inconvenient. They are designed to disrupt us, Editorial, 11 October). Exploitative capitalism has sacrificed our wellbeing – and much of the planet’s resources – on the altar of unlimited growth, binding the hands of those yet to be born.   For those in power, the questions are straightforward. Are they prepared to jeopardise their careers – or their profits – for our children’s children? Are they ready to put short-term politicking aside and help deliver a sustainable plan for the future? Are they willing to take difficult decisions on behalf of voters they’ll never meet? These questions have guided my future generations bill. It is a direct response to the challenge posed by those striking for the climate: at a national level, it will ensure that future generations are accounted for at every level of policymaking.

The only way to reduce climate warming will be to reverse the loss of natural habitat and reduce burning of fossil fuels. Technological solutions are being developed to scrub the atmosphere of greenhouse gases and replace fossil fuels; they are unlikely to achieve what is needed in the short time available. Their implementation will prove futile if tropical forests and savannas continue to be destroyed. Protection of tropical habitats and their biodiversity requires international funds leveraged as taxation from the subsidised profits of energy organisations responsible for producing the fossil fuels that create this pollution.  Viable legal mechanisms need to ensure that the funds are exclusively spent in protecting and restoring forests, their biodiversity, and the native people living there. This process will only attain the support of the energy producers and the children marching in the streets if the funds maximise the conservation of forests in ways that minimise government abuse and other forms of corruption. The recent speeches at the UN were drowned out by the more eloquent and vociferous voices of tomorrow protesting on the streets outside.

Today the world faces the dual challenge of meeting its growing energy needs in a reliable and affordable manner while ensuring a sustainable environment for future generations. In the last century, availability of affordable energy mostly in the form of fossil fuels powered productivity growth and development around the world, contributing to an unprecedented improvement in quality of life, and a doubling of life expectancies. In the last 25 years, affordable energy helped lift a billion people out of poverty. We tend to take these achievements for granted. With every light there is a shadow – and for the world energy system that is the unsustainable emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. The challenge for energy producers and consumers alike is to take meaningful actions to minimise these emissions and ultimately achieve carbon neutrality. Saudi Aramco has a long track record in reducing emissions from its operations. Thanks to decades-long investment in sustainable operations, we have achieved the lowest carbon intensity of any major oil producer. We are an industry leader in developing and deploying emissions-reducing technologies, partnering with public and private institutions around the world. In order to achieve a low-carbon future, we believe it is necessary to meet both global energy demand and lower emissions.

The Labour party has a bold green deal in line with most of XR’s demands. The Greens and the SNP also have progressive ideas.

"Scottish ministers have been criticised for accepting £5m from Shell to help fund a tree-planting programme as part of its climate strategy. The oil company said it would give the government agency Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) the money to plant or regenerate 1m trees in Scotland to help offset about 20% of its petrol and diesel sales at UK service stations.  The Scottish Green party said Shell’s pledge raised challenging questions about the Scottish government’s commitments to tackling the climate emergency, after Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, promised the country would cut its carbon emissions to net zero by 2045. “This is not meaningful action to address the climate crisis, it is greenwashing, pure and simple,” said Andy Wightman, the Scottish Greens’ land reform spokesman. He said the Scottish National party had allowed BP and Heathrow airport to sponsor its conference in Aberdeen, which finished on Tuesday with a renewed commitment from Sturgeon to lead the world on tackling the climate emergency. “Governments which are really serious about the climate crisis should have nothing to do with private offset schemes run by oil majors,” he said. The Guardian’s recent investigation into the role of oil companies in the climate crisis found Shell was planning to increase production by 38% over the next 12 years, increasing crude oil production by more than 50% and gas output by a quarter. Experts have warned this will sabotage attempts to cut global CO2 emissions, which scientists say need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 in order to limit the increase in global heating to 1.5C. Sturgeon accepted the 2045 target after the committee on climate change, the government advisory body, said Scotland’s greater capacity for new forestry meant it could reach net zero earlier than the rest of the UK. The UK’s overall net-zero target is 2050. Ministers have yet to fix a revised forestry objective to help meet that commitment, but Scotland has repeatedly failed to hit its current annual targets, set at 10,000 hectares (24,700 acres) a year from 2010 onwards. Official data shows that from 2010 to 2017, the planting rate averaged 6,800 hectares a year. Of that, only 820 hectares was planted annually by Forest Enterprise, the government-funded agency that preceded FLS, and the rest by private companies or charities. The overall target was met for the first time last year, when 11,200 hectares were planted. Shell said it would spend £10m in the UK over the next year by buying carbon credits to offset its customers’ fuel purchases. The £5m offered to FLS would be spread over five years. Wightman said there were significant flaws in this scheme. It would not involve Shell cutting its oil production and there was a danger this offsetting would be counted twice, since Shell would include it in its data and the Scottish government would also include it. Shell’s initiative only affects customers using its new loyalty card, who it said bought about 20% of its fuel, and Shell would fund the donation free of charge. Fuel bought by business account holders would also be automatically included. An SNP spokesman said the government had “smashed” its target for planting trees and was determined to meet its 2025 goal four years early. “Forestry and Land Scotland will use this funding to plant more trees and restore more peatland, helping to meet our climate change targets,” he said. “Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens abstained in voting for the world’s most ambitious climate change legislation and aligned with the Tories to block measures in the forestry bill to allow compulsory purchase of land for creating more woodlands.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAfter a foray in a cult, one of the first steps on the path back to reality is the process of deprogramming. Could it be that this step is now being self-administered by the German mainstream media? It appears so.

Harald Martenstein: “…it seems they are allowed to get away with everything.” Photo credit: Lumu, GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
Now that the global mean temperature curve has drifted out of and below the IPCC’s projected range, panic is breaking out.
The mother of German green weeklies, Die Zeit, appears to be taking measurements at the back of the house in preparation for the installation of a back door! Rahmstorf is back there with them, trying to talk them out of it.
Leading lefty journalist Harald Martenstein of Die Zeit, a weekly that recently portrayed Marc Morano as the Don Corleone of the North American climate denial syndicate, has an amusingly satirical essay on the misfortunes of climate science and modeling: On the surprises of climate change. Hat/tip: klimazwiebel. If you can read German, his essay is a jewel in irony and humor to behold. Effective because few things convey a message better than music or humor.
Martenstein, once a devout believer of the global warming religion, apparently has been struggling to reconcile the glaring differences between climate expectations and hard reality.
Martenstein begins by first claiming he is not a climate skeptic, and tells the story of how he bought a house in the Uckermark in northeastern Germany because renowned scientists had been telling us that “the climate in Germany would be warmer. It would become similar to the Mediterranean.”
He then writes that former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, however, seemed to be unconcerned about the ominous hothouse-Europe climate projections, and went on to purchase a vacation home down south in Turkey. Martenstein seemed baffled by Schröder’s decision, writing, “I was ready to open my home to the Schröders as soon as they would no longer be able to take the 60°C heat in the shade. But instead it got colder and colder. In the Uckermark in the wintertime it was -20°C for weeks.”

Martenstein also noticed that Britain had endured its coldest winter in 30 years, Florida got covered by icicles, and the cold seemed to be spreading everywhere. So he pleaded that people should emit more CO2 – so that he could stay warm.
His plea, however, prompted an invitation from a “scientist at a very nice climate institute“:
He showed me tables and graphs that clearly depicted it was getting warmer. He believed that I was just a victim of my own subjective imagination. Memory can fool you. One thinks that during childhood it was warm from May to September, but in reality its was warm only 3 days, and it is those 3 days that one remembers intensively. The tables from climate scientists, on the other hand, do not lie.”
Martenstein then recounts the past winter and how it seemed to him as being the longest and hardest he could remember, but telling himself that it was probably just his warped subjectivity acting up again. He writes:
But suddenly I read in the paper that a number of climate scientists had changed their minds. Now they were saying it is not going to get warmer, but colder, at least in Europe. Whatever happened to the tables, I ask myself.”
This kind of science would never fly in biology or physics, Martenstein writes. “But with climate science it seems they are allowed to get away with everything.”
Today it has dawned on Martenstein that Schröder had been wise to buy a vacation home in Turkey, where at least the summers are warm. He ends his piece:
The polar bears are not dying off, no. They are moving to Uckermark. I’m not a climate skeptic, I’m just disappointed.”
Thanks for the wonderful humor, Herr Martenstein. Overall, however, the climate story is a sad and embarrassing one for the field of science and humanity.

He sent me the following photo, where I’ve highlighted part of the text which I think would be good advice for certain media outlets here in Germany when reporting on global warming, and anywhere for that matter.

Of course this is advice you’d shun if you were just a propaganda mouthpiece of a particular view and believed journalism is about manipulating public opinion.
I don’t know if the Dallas Morning News lives by these words. Often words and actions are very different.

Share this...FacebookTwitter220,000 plus climate e-mails are about to be unloaded by the mysterious Mr. FOIA. Who could he or she be?
My feeling is that the authorities are going to find the identity of Mr. FOIA in lickety-split time. A manifesto is, after all, what revealed the Unabomber. These forensic language experts are really really effing good and they are going to see stuff in the little manifesto you could never imagine.
The message left behind by Mr FOIA, posted at WUWT, CA, and other places, is a gold mine for forensic language experts: Here are just a couple of my own observations:
1. The person is obviously skilled with information technology.
2. He is from mainland Europe because he writes 220,000 the way many mainland European countries do, i.e. with a point: 220.000.
3. He has the unique habit of double spacing after each sentence (at least that’s how it appears at WUWT). Strangely, there’s only one space after question marks.
4. He must have spent a lot of time in the USA, in academia; his English is impeccable, and he spells words in American English, e.g. organize and not organise. I’m guessing he’s from Holland or Scandinavia.

5. He likely has a full time job, as he writes: “…skimming through all 220.000 emails would have taken several more months of work in an increasingly unfavorable environment.” This could mean he’s got other things to mind to, like work and a family. On the other hand, perhaps with “unfavourable environment” he means that policymakers are getting ready to unleash something, and time is running out. He’s under pressure.
6. Not an insider at the CRU, but obviously someone close.
7. I use “he” because I just have the feeling it’s written by a man. I can’t tell you specifically why. Calling himself “Mr. FOIA” is an obvious clue.
Summary, after 30 minutes of analysis all alone, I’d say he’s northern European guy, in his early-mid 50s, having spent a long time in the US, and having held an important position in climate science, has good IT knowledge.
Should be possible to narrow it down to a group of a few dozen or so.
Hopefully Mr FOIA was clever enough to have built in linguistic features to throw authorities off the trail. Posting that little manifesto of his was courageous, but foolish if he wishes to remain unknown.
Interesting days are ahead. It’s easy to get spooked, if you let yourself. Remember that there are trillions at stake, and people and states kill for magnitudes less.

"Almost everyone enjoys a bank holiday. A three-day weekend means more time to spend with family and friends, to go out and explore the world, and to relax from the pressures of working life. Imagine if, rather than a few times a year, we had a three-day weekend every week. This isn’t just a nice idea. Beyond the possibilities for leisure, three-day weekends might also be one of the easiest steps we could take to radically reduce our environmental impact – and future-proof our economy. A reduction in working hours generally correlates with marked reductions in energy consumption, as economists David Rosnick and Mark Weisbrot have argued. In fact, if Americans simply followed European levels of working hours, for example, they would see an estimated 20% reduction in energy use – and hence in carbon emissions.  With a four-day week, huge amounts of commuting to and from work could be avoided, as well as the energy outputs from running workplaces. At a point when we need to massively cut back our carbon outputs, instituting a three-day weekend could be the simplest and most elegant way to make our economy more environmentally friendly.  It’s happened before. For example, in 2007 the US state of Utah redefined the working week for state employees, with extended hours on Monday to Thursday meaning it could eliminate Fridays entirely. In its first ten months, the move saved the state at least US$1.8m (£1.36m) in energy costs. Fewer working days meant less office lighting, less air conditioning and less time spent running computers and other equipment – all without even reducing the total number of hours worked.  For one day a week, thousands of commuters were able to stay at home. If the reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions from travel were included, the state estimated a saving of more than 12,000 tons of CO2 each year. Utah abandoned the experiment in 2011 after residents complained they were unable to access services on Fridays. It seems this sort of change has to be accompanied by a shift in our expectations so that Friday becomes a “third weekend” rather than simply a weekday without work. What Utah does show is that, replicated across an entire country, a four day week would see substantial progress towards an economy that does less damage to the environment. Yet there would be other benefits too. Working less would improve the elusive “work/life balance”, and help to restore our mental health and physical well-being. It would also give us more time to spend on social activities, to care for children and the elderly, and to engage with our communities. Experiments with reduced working hours at select workplaces in Sweden in 2015 reduced sickness and even increased productivity.  Directing gains in economic efficiency towards increased free time and reduced energy consumption, rather than making more stuff, could create a better and more environmentally safe world. An obvious objection might be: “How could we afford this?” But there are serious economic and technological reasons for why governments, political parties, think tanks and social movements should all start to think about advocating for the implementation of three-day weekends. As anthropologist David Graeber has recently contended, many of us work jobs that, at least partially, seem pointless. Indeed, economists have long been aware of the redundant hours contained in many working days, with employees effectively under-utilised in their workplaces, yet unable to leave due to the persistent issue of “presenteeism” – where workers are valued by managers for hours logged in the office rather than productivity. Rather than work longer hours for little productive benefit, we could embrace a shorter working week and help save our planet and our own well-being. Looking more into the long-term, a new wave of workplace automation featuring advanced robotics and machine learning systems is predicted to replace 47% of current jobs in the US in coming decades, and 54% in Europe. In these circumstances, where there will be significantly less work available, instituting policies such as three-day weekends becomes essential to make life liveable under these changed economic conditions.  As Nick Srnicek and I have argued in our book Inventing the Future, automation will soon offer us the prospect of a very different world of work. More automation would make many production processes more efficient, using less energy and less human labour until, eventually, we are largely freed from work.  The key to capturing the benefits of automation without drastic social dislocation depends in part on developing policies which work to share the gains. This means a reduced working week thanks to an extended weekend, together with a universal basic income. None of this will happen overnight. But, if you’re in the UK and are lucky enough to have Monday off, don’t forget that extra day at home or in the park is not only fun but will help fight climate change."
"Coral coverage around some of the most popular tourist islands on the Great Barrier Reef has dropped by almost half in the last 18 years, according to a new study. Scientists said they were “shocked” after analysing data from monitoring dives between 1999 and 2017 at 100 different locations across the Whitsunday Islands, Magnetic Island, Keppel Islands and Palm Islands.  The study looked at the coverage of hard corals – the rock-like structures that are the foundations for building reefs – and found they were being hit by multiple impacts, including heat stress causing bleaching, cyclones, flood plumes and poor water quality. Daniela Ceccarelli, of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, said: “The loss [of hard corals] was between 40 and 50% at each island group. We were pretty shocked actually.” She said that inshore reefs like the ones studied were more susceptible to impacts from sediments and nutrients running off the land, especially reefs that were less exposed to waves that could wash pollution away more quickly. Published in the Ecological Society of America’s Ecological Applications journal, the study found “persistent shifts from coral to macroalgal dominance” on some reefs in the central and southern parts of the system. The study aimed to tease apart the relative importance of different stressors on inshore island reefs, including the impacts of heat stress, flood plumes and exposure to cyclones. Co-author David Williamson, also from James Cook University, said: “The impacts of individual disturbance events were patchy. Some reefs avoided the worst effects –but the cumulative impacts of multiple, frequent events reduced coral cover and diversity.” On reefs around the Whitsunday Islands, one of the most popular destinations in the Great Barrier Reef marine park, coral cover had been relatively stable until 2016, after coral bleaching and then Cyclone Debbie saw a sharp drop in hard corals. Ceccarelli said that even though the findings were shocking, there were still many stunning areas for tourists and divers to visit around the islands, including the Whitsundays where some individual reefs were in excellent condition. She said some disturbances on reefs were natural and “important for maintaining diversity”, but she added: “We are seeing increased frequency of these disturbance events and we worry [reefs] won’t get enough time to recover between them.” She said that faster-growing corals could recover from major disturbances after about seven to 10 years, but for a whole coral community that included slower-growing corals, recovery times were between 15 and 20 years. Scientists are concerned that major coral bleaching and heat stress events caused by ocean heating will hit the Great Barrier Reef at intervals too short to let corals recover. The reef, the world’s biggest coral reef system, was hit by major bleaching events in 2016 and 2017, with impacts concentrated in the northern parts of the reef. The study also questioned a previous conclusion that corals on inshore reefs were more tolerant of higher temperatures. The study concluded that “although rapidly escalating climate change impacts are the largest threat to coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef” it was also important that localised impacts, including runoff from the land, was proactively managed. “It’s definitely not too late to save the reef,” she said. “It’s not dead, but it might be on intensive care.” In a major five-yearly report published in August, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority downgraded the reef’s long-term outlook to “very poor” for the first time since 2009 when the report was first published."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel here reports on the results of a new recently published survey on how Germans view climate change.
The cooked study (yes, I think the survey is very dubious) was conducted by Engels et al.  The dressed-up as science survey comes from the cabal of usual warmist suspects.
According to Spiegel, based on a telephone survey of 3000 people conducted in 2011, only 7% of Germans are “climate skeptics”. The survey asked to what extent people agreed to the following 4 statements based on a scale of 1 to 5 (1= totally agree; 5= absolutely do not agree). My own ratings are in parentheses:
1. Climate change is now happening. (1)
2. Climate change is caused by man. (2)
3. Climate change is a serious problem. (1)
4. Climate science is unanimous that there is climate change is taking place. (1)
Gee, I’m not a skeptic! That sure is news to me.
But then again, climate change is always occurring; everyone knows that. And it is a serious problem, especially when it cools. Statement No. 2 is just too vague. Sure man causes climate change, e.g. through landuse.
Clearly the statements are loaded to produce a certain misleading perception. Many skeptics would assign a number of 1 or 2 to every statement above. Such surveys never ask if climate science exaggerates 5 = a lot or 1 = not at all. The results of that of course wouldn’t fit the narrative.
Spiegel writes:
Only two percent said they absolutely did not agree to Statement 1, five percent for “generally do not agree”. A similar result was recorded for the third Statement, i.e. on the perception of possible consequences of climate change. […]
In the USA there are considerably more skeptics – and ‘total deniers’, say the scientists at the University of Hamburg.”

It is true that a vast majority of Germans believe that today’s climate change (though temps haven’t risen in 15 years) is mostly due to man. Yet, the results could be interpreted as an indication that skepticism and the climate discussion are in fact massively suppressed by institutions in Germany. The Engels et al survey just happens to follow the recently released brochure by the German Ministry of Environment, which tried to declare the climate science debate over, went on to issue a blanket dismissal of climate skeptics, even going so far to blacklist prominent Germans skeptics. The dubious Engels et al Survey is just the latest in a series of propoganda attempts to bully, portray and marginalize climate skeptics as fringe operators.
If the survey’s portrayal of skeptics were indeed accurate, then why go through all the trouble of devoting so many resources to marginalize this supposedly tiny gaggle of fringe dissenters? To the contrary, skeptics of a man-made climate catastrophe are far more widespread than what the survey would have us believe.
The paper’s abstract states that the authors “looked for systematic linkages between public climate-change skepticism on one hand, and energy preferences and political participation on the other. Germany is an interesting testbed as it is currently involved in a large-scale restructuring of its system of energy supply toward renewable energy sources (the ‘Energiewende’). Our results indicate that climate-change skepticism has not diffused widely in Germany, but that it correlates with less support of renewable energy sources.”
Firstly I’d be very careful about basing any conclusion on such a sloppy survey. Secondly, alternative energies are unpopular among skeptics because of 1) their high price, 2) their supply instability, 3) they aren’t really doing anything for the climate, and 4) the expensive and unreliable renewable energies were legitimized by a highly dubious science that has been manipulated by special interests and powerful lobby groups. Of course they are going to correlate.
The survey comments on the “political participation” by the skeptics:
However, skepticism correlates negatively with political participation, and there is no strong political outlet for public climate-change skepticism in Germany.
This statement is very vague, perhaps purposely so. Skeptics are very much politically active in Germany. However, they have been severely suppressed and denied a voice. They are often denied the microphone or space in the print media. Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning were dragged through the mud for weeks and months, only because they presented a non-catastrophic view. In the USA, on the other hand, a number of politicians and media outlets have been openly sympathetic to skeptic views and a balanced discussion. This is not the case in dogmatic Germany.
As the recent brochure by the German Ministry of Environment shows, skeptics are not welcome and definitely should not be heard. And now the Engels et al survey falsely suggests that we are too small to be taken seriously.
In the end Germany is going to do what it wants. However, it should ask itself if it is wise to continue down the “Great Transformation” path when the rest of the world focusses on shale gas and adopts a serious CO2 climate sensitivity value for policy making. If not, Germany risks pricing itself out of the global market. Right now very few countries are impressed by Germany’s tattered renewable energy revolution, and are less likely than ever to follow its lead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe EU in partnership with the WWF has just released a strategy report dubbed: ADOPTING HEALTHY, SUSTAINABLE DIETS: KEY OPPORTUNITIES AND BARRIERS, which is part of LiveWell for LIFE, “a pioneering project which aims to contribute towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the EU food supply chain, and demonstrate what sustainable diets could look like for different European countries.”
Hat-tip DirkH.
The report’s introduction begins by stating that the European super state now needs to control our food diets:
Food consumption patterns in Europe are currently unsustainable: European food consumption is responsible for a large part of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions. It is accepted that there needs to be a reduction in global greenhouse gas emission which are contributing to climate change. […] LiveWell for LIFE is a pioneering project which aims to contribute towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the EU food supply chain, and demonstrate what sustainable diets could look like for different European countries.”
The report writes that it “is a summary of the efforts of LiveWell for LIFE and the Network of European Food Stakeholders to find the most important social and economic barriers and opportunities for sustainable diets in Spain, France and Sweden and in the EU“.
It’s no secret that environmentalist, left-wing, vegetarian, authoritarian wackos have had their eye on dictating human eating habits for a long time, and have had a hard time stomaching our appetite for meat on our plates and barbecue grills. Read here for example.  Before too long we’ll have to content ourselves with celery and carrot sticks.
The report writes on pages 11-12:
The Italian Barilla Centre for Food and Nutrition has identified the rise of the responsible consumer and what it terms consumActors – sustainability-savvy consumers who want to be involved in the food production process. According to its research, people’s dietary habits will have to radically transform in order to meet the dietary and nutritional needs of a growing population in a world that is more affluent and more urbanised. And they’ll have to take responsibility for their choices too – something that may come as a shock to the average post-modern consumer.”
A growing number of consumers are open to the idea of changing their diets. For example in the UK, government research found that 62% of respondents were ‘very or fairly willing’ to give up red meat, while 36% were ‘very or fairly willing’ to give up dairy products. Dutch research has identified a growing interest in flexitarian eating: a vegetarian diet that occasionally includes meat.”

Here we note that the target food staple is meat and dairy products. Getting people to change their eating habits and abstain from consuming certain staples is no easy task. The report has identified motivation factors. Interestingly, environmental factors rank at the very bottom (p. 13):
Health is a motivator for behaviour change – more than any concern about the environment. UK government research into attitudes and behaviour around sustainable food found that health is the most important factor for consumers (81%). Environmental sustainability was the least important (26%). A study of consumers in the 27 EU member states also showed that health was more important than environmental concerns for consumer food choices. Some 32% of people said they would like to buy meat or meat products less often. The main reason given was for health (54%) compared to 16% for environmental reasons.”
It goes without saying that consumers want healthy food. But at the same time many also want to experience eating pleasure. Each has to decide the balance that is right for him/herself.
It quickly becomes obvious in the report’s language that EU bureaucrats think that consumers are just too stupid to make the right decisions. Throughout the report one finds the terms like “unaware” or “confusion“, or “limited knowledge“, or “lack of understanding” to name a few when discussing the consumer.
The report is just one of the first steps in the EU’s scheme to take over the human diet. The report ends:

Going forward, LiveWell for LIFE will explore these opportunities and barriers as we find ways to adopt sustainable diets in the pilot countries, and the policy changes needed for a move towards sustainable diets across the EU.”

I smell massive meat taxes cooking in the EU regulatory kitchen. The food tyranny is coming! Be prepared to be spoon-fed bland, organic baby-food by the EU super-nanny state.

"Back in the 1930s, English planners came up with a novel idea to prevent urban sprawl: a ring of countryside surrounding the city, protected from development by law. This “green belt” would preserve the unique characters of historic towns, safeguard the countryside from development and encourage the regeneration and reuse of urban land. It was adopted nationally in 1955, and around 13% of England is now zoned as green belt land.  But today, the UK is experiencing a housing crisis. The nation requires 220,000 new homes each year to keep up with demand – not to mention making up for the undersupply from previous years. In the year to September 2016, only 141,000 were built. This deficit has sparked renewed debate over the value of the green belt.  Leading housebuilders and think tanks argue that selectively releasing parts of the green belt would help to meet the government’s ambitious housebuilding targets. Meanwhile, other pressure groups claim that the green belt should be sacrosanct, to safeguard the environmental and health benefits it provides for nearby towns and cities.  In theory, the green belt is protected within the government’s planning framework. Alterations to the green belt boundaries can only be made by local governments in exceptional circumstances, and individual planning applications on green belt sites are only approved under very special circumstances.  In practice, though, it seems the criteria aren’t always quite so strict. Increasingly, greenfield sites (undeveloped land, which can include the green belt) are being favoured by developers because they are cheaper to exploit than brownfield sites (previously developed land, such as disused industrial estates), which have much higher transaction costs.  In fact, national planning policy encourages development on greenfield sites through the use of highly questionable “objective” assessments (or rather, estimates) of housing need, based on past trends and dubious population projections. What’s more, measures of economic viability only take stock of profit, and fail to incorporate environmental or social considerations.  The case for development is also propped up by overly simplified claims that much of the green belt is poor-quality, unproductive land, with no clear requirements for good management. This incremental assaults on the green belt overlook the need for vital infrastructure and services to create strong, resilient communities and sustainable places. In fact, the green belt holds significant market and non-market value for urban economies, which pose a challenge conventional economic arguments in favour of more houses on “unproductive” green belt land.  For one thing, releasing the green belt in the wrong place comes with certain costs, such as longer commutes, worse congestion and more dangerous levels of air pollution, as well as increased risk of surface water flooding. These costs are normally exacted after development, and don’t appear in initial assessments. The green belt when seen as part of critical green infrastructure has the potential to deliver multiple benefits for cities: it provides space for agriculture, protection from flooding and drought, it improves air quality and mitigates the urban heat island effect, as well as enabling recreation and enhancing biodiversity.  The challenge, then, is to identify where these benefits of the greenbelt can be optimised, and the costs of development minimised. At a national level, England lacks a strategic plan to to identify the best sites for housing, jobs and key infrastructure. This is needed to drive sustainable growth and address deep-rooted problems, such as the divide between the wealthy but congested south-east, and the less prosperous north.  On a local level, it means planning to put the right developments in the right place. This isn’t limited to houses: city outskirts can be rejuvenated by community food-growing initiatives, or wetlands created for flood protection and biodiversity. Local authorities should think and plan strategically and form long-term visions about the kind of places they want to create – just like the great planners of England’s historic garden cities.   The recent housing white paper requires local authorities to meet housing demand, but crucially fails to move away from fetish on housing numbers and address the current strategic planning void. It does however, propose a standard method for calculating housing need, which is welcome and will prevent delays to local plans over disputed methodologies.  Strategic, cross-boundary planning can help to make the green belt more productive and deliver more houses. Green belt value can be enhanced through positive management of its natural capital. It’s time to leave behind the polarised and siloed green belt debate, and recognise that housing, industry, transport, community, landscape and environment are vital pieces of the planning jigsaw for cities, towns and countryside."
"Children are seeing through the short-termism of politics and the current generation of politicians, according to former Liberal leader John Hewson. On ABC’s Q&A program on Monday night, Hewson said the modus operandi of leaders such as US president Donald Trump and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison was to target nervousness about alternative policies and instead focus on short-term political gain.  “The system has become sort of inward looking and self-absorbed. The sort of people who get preselected these days are not necessarily those who will make good ministers,” he said. “The skills you need to get through the factional process to be preselected in any of the major parties are not skills that will help you run a multibillion-dollar portfolio. “We’re getting the wrong people.” Hewson singled out, in particular, the “tribalism” of Australian politics leading to inaction on climate change for the past decade, and said the next generation would see through the short-termism. “That’s where I think the Greta Thunbergs and my kids see what’s wrong with us. They see we’ve missed the point,” he said. “I know it’s black and white, you’re either doing it or you’re not doing it, but it [will] make a big difference that the next generation as soon as they vote, you’ll have a very different world in this country and I think globally.” In September Morrison responded to Thunberg’s speech to the UN, saying he wanted Australian children to grow up feeling positive about the future, without any anxiety. Chloë Spackman, director of programs at Australian Futures Project, said the debate needed to be reframed. “I think we need to reframe the conversation as it’s urgent and we need to do something but we want to be doing that from a place of possibility,” she said. Science writer Julian Cribb said people shouldn’t be scaring children, but informing them. “They can then apply their minds to solving them … Greta Thunberg and the rest are already into that and they will change the world whether we like it or not.” Veena Sahajwalla, inventor and director at the Centre for Sustainable Materials Research and Technology, said people can be positive about the possibility of innovation in response to the challenges facing the world. “I think the ability to see that there are positive solutions and to be able to think about how we might be able to convert something that might sound like it’s all doom and gloom but when you unpack it and think about what we can do with new technologies as we’re developing new technologies, I think it’s fantastic,” she said."
"The opening in January 2017 of an “eco-hamlet” for council house tenants in West Wales is great news. I have nothing but praise for a development which builds houses with a low carbon footprint, using locally grown wood, to make homes which are well insulated and powered by solar energy. It was also quick to build, with large sections being made in a factory and then assembled on site. And it was relatively cheap – at around £70,000 to £100,000 per building, it is certainly comparable to the costs of more conventional builds.  These houses are an inspiration to the construction industry and an aspiration for the home owner. After all, who wouldn’t like to live in a house that had yearly utility bills of £200, rather than the national average of £1,500? So the problem is not the six wonderful solar houses at Glanrhyd, Pembrokeshire, or the lucky people who will get to live in them (and enjoy shared use of an electric car). The problem is that we’ve seen all of this before – but nothing changes. What we really need is far, far more of them. I’ve been involved in sustainable construction for nearly 25 years and seen many inspirational developments like Glanrhyd. There’s Julian Marsh’s home in Nottingham, Susan Roaf’s Oxford Ecohouse and the Hockerton Housing Project, to name but a few. The list is long. Yet while many individuals continue to build these innovative and inspirational structures, we have a construction industry which still responds to these buildings with disdain. One executive from a large well-known house building company told me in conversation recently: “This is a new, expensive and untested technology. We just can’t risk building something so new with all the risks to the consumer and at a higher cost.” But the situation is even worse than the disdain from the mainstream construction industry. Rather than being welcomed, the latest versions of these sustainable buildings are challenged at every turn. The initial response to the Welsh eco-hamlet plans were concerns about the materials, the technology and the design. The houses at Glanrhyd then had more than 20 planning conditions placed upon them. The CEO of Western Solar, the company behing the hamlet, freely admits that nearly half of their research budget went on solving problems they encountered along the way.   So it seems this kind of development just isn’t celebrated enough. There is a general atmosphere of mistrust from construction professionals. It is seen as too complex, too expensive, too risky. Yet there are positive reactions, too. Welsh politician Lesley Griffiths had this to say about the new houses in Glanrhyd: This scheme ticks so many boxes. We need more houses, we need more energy efficiency, we want to help people with fuel poverty. It’s been really good to hear how they have sourced local products. It’s great they’re using local people to build the houses.  Surely we need to take the eco-technology we have and start rolling it out on a much larger scale. To do so would be a massive step in meeting the significant housing shortage (an estimated 125,000 new houses are needed every year). It would also address the disrepair of our current housing stock, and help refit the millions of houses in good repair but requiring improved performance in order to achieve the government’s 2050 carbon reduction target.  We must not forget that the 2050 Climate Change target is not some arbitrary political policy, but one based on the environmental challenge facing all of us. We need to play our part in slowing down the speed of climate change and adapting to the changing natural, social and economic environment.  The solar houses in Pembrokeshire are wonderful. But until we start building huge numbers of buildings with similar credentials, we are just celebrating a cottage industry rather than restructuring our urban environment for an uncertain future."

"Too big to fail. That expression could often be heard in 2008. The meltdown in the international banking system was choking off the supply of cash to finance and industry. The US, the UK and other nations rushed through moves to shore up teetering corporations. General Motors was bailed out while the British bank Northern Rock was nationalised and brought under control by the government. To not act would have been to risk large sections of our globalised economy going to the wall.  We can think of these large corporations as “keystone species” in an economic ecosystem. Remove them and the entire system can come crashing down. This may support the view that the affairs of smaller corporations can be safely ignored. Businesses go bust every day. However, there may be vital information about the state of entire economies lurking in data about seemingly inconsequential businesses.  The natural world is subject to the same sort of process. If we are to avoid a collapse in ecosystems then we may be best served by monitoring the presence and absence of species great and small, as they all give important information as to the underlying health or resilience of a system. This is the conclusion of new research we conducted as part of an international team, and published in Ecology. Given humanity’s continual assault on biodiversity, we risk producing rapid changes that can sweep through an entire ecosystem. Such changes are called critical transitions and have been observed in kelp forests, drylands, shallow lakes or even in the total ecosystem collapse of portions of the Great Barrier Reef. Very few ecosystems are not being affected in some way.  If we could get an early warning of critical transitions, then we may be able to put in place changes to avoid future collapse. Searching for these warning signals has become a hot research topic.  The theory underlying much of this work is that ecosystems can take multiple stable states. For example, a freshwater lake can have clear water, and an abundance of plants and fish species. It can also be a cloudy, dark green algal soup with very few plants and fish. Lakes can flip from clear to cloudy water state in a matter of weeks – a classic critical transition, which powerful feedback loops make very hard to reverse. Phosphorus-rich fertiliser used in surrounding fields often drives such critical transitions in lakes by promoting plant growth. Up to a point. Very high phosphorus levels lead to an increase in algae which can suddenly erupt in large blooms that block out light. This initiates a die back of plants which, along with a number of other chemical changes in the water and lake sediment, increases phosphorus even further. New feedback loops keep high concentrations of phosphorus, dense algae colonies and very little else.  This matters because lakes provide a wide range of ecosystem services that support surrounding communities. Lakes such as Erhai in China have witnessed very rapid increases in population around it, agriculture and farming. This produces algae blooms that can decimate fishing and so threaten livelihoods. Tourism can also be affected given that clear waters and a wide range of species bring many people to the region. Early warning signals have been detected in lakes that have experienced critical transitions. As the system is being driven from the clear water to the cloudy water stable state, statistical analysis of variables such as the concentration of phosphorus in the water can show that the system is approaching a tipping point between the two states. A recent study detected early warning signals in lake Erhai. The key challenge of course is to detect the earliest signal, so as to have the best chance of taking action to avoid a collapse, while also minimising the chance of false alarms. We wanted to see if changes in algae and non-biting midges could predict a critical transition. Why these species? Because their remains are well persevered in sediment found on the bed of the lake. Along with traces of pollen and indicators of water chemistry, these remains allow us to read the history of the lake. Using sediment cores from lake Erhai and other Chinese lakes, some of which have undergone critical transitions in the past 50 years, we were able to reconstruct algae and midge communities. From these data we identified three key types: strongly competitive but slowly reproducing “keystone” species; weakly competitive but fast reproducing “weedy” species; and slowly reproducing and weakly competitive “canary” species. Like canaries that coal miners used to check for poisonous gasses deep underground, ecosystem canaries are often the first to disappear.  But we cannot rely on just looking for their removal from the population, because these canary species are continually appearing then disappearing. We need to link their presence or absence to changes in the competitive interactions between the three types of algae and midge communities.  Low phosphorus lakes have a healthy turnover of keystones, weedy and canary species. As phosphorus levels rise, strongly competitive algae keystone species proliferate at the expense of canary species until the keystones eventually collapse themselves. This is followed by a bloom of weedy species in the absence of competition: the critical transition is complete. To wait for reductions in the keystones would be to miss the window of opportunity of avoiding the collapse. Our early warning signal was able to detect an impending critical transition much sooner than other techniques that monitor phosphorus levels in the lake water, because we are looking directly at some of the ecological mechanisms that are involved in the critical transition itself.  As fascinating as these ecological dynamics are, ultimately our study will have worth if it can produce useful early warning techniques that can be used to monitor ecosystems in real time. And that these warnings are heeded."
"“We provide help in disaster areas all around the world,” says the aid agency volunteer serving warm samosas. “Not usually in Yorkshire, though!” That natural disasters can and increasingly will affect not just people in rolling news stories a long way away but anyone, anywhere, is at the heart of Rain, a love story that’s also a flood story. The samosa-bearing aid worker isn’t the only person on unfamiliar ground: with its tight contemporary focus, Rain is something of a departure for Mary and Bryan Talbot too. Two of Britain’s finest graphic novelists, the husband and wife team have previously covered the Paris Commune and imperialism in the South Pacific (The Red Virgin and the Vision of Utopia) and the women’s suffrage movement (Sally Heathcote: Suffragette). Bryan’s Grandville series stars a steampunk badger; and while his magnum opus Alice in Sunderland may start in modern Britain, its twists and turns connect prehistoric beasts, Humpty Dumpty and Sid James. And the pair’s finest hour, the Costa-winning Dotter of Her Father’s Eyes, slips between Mary’s childhood and the troubled life of James Joyce’s daughter Lucia.  Rain, the tale of a budding relationship between two women set against the 2015 floods in the north of England, might seem a straightforward story by comparison. But this passionate, explicitly political book is heavy with significance, a desperate appeal on behalf of our land, our lives and the lives of our “non-human fellow earthlings”. Cath is from London and Mitch from the fictional Thrushcross, a friendly, well-ordered town of stone and slate set below the bare hills of Brontë country. Its backdrop is a beautifully drawn patchwork of rolling fields, dry-stone walls and craggy rocks, with grouse erupting in the pale skies above. And when Cath heads north to visit Mitch, she finds a woman obsessed with the land. Mitch is worried about packaging, weedkillers and the water table, and she wants to head out to a local campaign launch rather than have a romantic evening in. But, as the frustrated Cath soon finds out, Mitch is right. Thousands of lead-laden grouse will soon lie dead in a pit, good for nothing but burning. Illegal traps for hawks, laid by gamekeepers, are waiting in the fields. Heather-burning and chemical sprays are turning a joyously fertile blanket bog into a toxic, denuded wasteland. And around Thrushcross, a landscape that once held water in a fond embrace is poised to release a grim cascade that will flood streets and houses. Rain follows Cath’s political awakening through arguments, cheerful nights down the pub and demonstrations. It’s a portrait of pettiness, humour, warm hugs, seemingly unsolvable rows and moments of joy on the hills, with the pair drunk on beauty and hope. Bryan Talbot’s cleverly framed panels home in on body language then flash back to regrets and reminiscences, and the hills around catch the eye again and again, their muted beauty enlivened by bursts of colour. It is not a subtle book: often the dialogue feels as though it’s in service of the political cause rather than character development. The gamekeepers exist only as nasty archetypes, and scenes are set up so a character can talk about Victorian grouse shoots or the importance of copses. A farmer disagreeing with a conference speech about sustainable agriculture gets the shortest of cameos, his words paraphrased, finger pointing and face twisted with rage. “It’s not just Yorkshire it’s affecting, is it? It’s increasing the UK’s carbon emissions a lot, and that’s bad for everybody,” explains Mitch at one point, her eyes fixed in the reader’s direction. Then again, this is a work not of balance or diplomacy but of love and rage. The powerfully rendered flood that drowns Thrushcross is both a dramatic plot tool and a reminder of a real disaster that shattered communities. To see the streets that we’ve watched Mitch and Cath walk down drowned in brown, surging water, as rubbish flaps past shattered windows, is to feel deep sorrow. Towards the end, the artwork takes a dive into the soil, abandoning naturalism for a portrait of subterranean abundance, a world of roots and worms and beetles that we rarely see but could not live without. The idea of local connections that build into great networks is at Rain’s core, and its account of a couple trying to live well and make a difference is both a small story and a vital part of a very big one that connects sea levels in Vanuatu, plastic waste in India and upland drainage in Yorkshire. This flawed yet inspiring graphic novel is one more compelling voice in a swelling chorus of protest. • Rain is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99).

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago the catastrophe-obsessed scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research claimed that another 1.6°C of warming may be enough to melt all of Greenland’s ice and cause global sea levels to rise catastrophically.
Keep in mind that the PIK is probably the biggest producer of catastrophe stories in the world after Hollywood.
Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning now say this fringe scenario has been handily refuted, citing a new, recently published international study authored by scientists of the Alfred Wegener Institute and others. They write:
Good news coming out of Greenland. A new study involving the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) of Bremerhaven has refuted earlier horror scenarios of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), which claimed that a warming of 1.6°C possibly could lead to a complete meltdown of Greenland’s ice mass.”
The AWI study contains a surprising conclusion, say Vahrenholt and Lüning, who write at their Die kalte Sonne blog:
The surprising conclusion of the study, which appeared in the journal Nature: At air temperatures that were as much as 8°C higher than those of the 21st century, the ice mass melted far less then when compared to what was recently suspected. Back then the Greenland ice sheet played a far smaller role in the global sea level rise during the Eem interglacial than what was previously assumed. Should the current temperature rise in Greenland continue, then the reactions of the ice sheet in the wake of the Eem warm period apply as possible future scenarios for the ice mass on the island.”

Such is the difference between fishy models and reality. Lüning and Vahrenholt therefore now see a considerably diminished danger of an Greenland ice meltdown. Greenland was far from being ice-free during the Eem interglacial of 130,000 to 115,000 years ago. Lüning and Vahrenholt add:
To the contrary: From the peak in the glacial period prior to the Eem, about 400 meters were lost in size, and it was 130 meters lower during the Eem 130.000 to 115.000 years ago than it is today. In the same time period it’s volume shrank a maximum of one quarter.”
Vahrenholt and Lüning conclude:
The good news of the study was that the Greenland ice sheet did not react as sensitively to this temperature rise as previously thought.”

"Pension funds and asset managers will have to disclose their shareholder voting records on issues including the climate crisis, as part of UK guidelines that will come into force in January. The revamped stewardship code means firms will have to publish annual reports showing they have taken environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into account when investing and engaging with companies.  Signatories will have to prove they took appropriate action in the preceding 12 months by publishing their full shareholder voting records. They will also have to explain the rationale behind their voting decisions and outline how they are responding to systemic risks such as the climate emergency. Those who fail to comply risk being shamed by ejection from the public list of signatories to the code. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the accounting watchdog that has been in charge of managing the code since its launch in 2010, has also expanded the scope of the guidelines beyond asset managers to include pension funds, insurers, investment consultants and proxy advisers. The FRC said it would help “align the approach of the whole investment community”. The move will also expand its 289-strong list of signatories – although new firms will have to formally apply to be included from its launch. The FRC chair, Simon Dingemans, said: “It is an ambitious revision that strengthens the UK’s standards of governance, transparency and clear reporting. We are looking for widespread adoption by the investment community, reinforcing the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business and delivering real benefits to the economy, the environment and society more broadly.” The first set of annual reports will cover signatories’ actions in 2020, with the first disclosures due in 2021. It marks the first major overhaul of the stewardship code since 2012 and comes just months after the influential Business Roundtable in the US made waves across the investment community by dropping its long-held shareholder-first policy. Asset managers have recently come under scrutiny for continuing to invest in carbon-heavy industries as climate worries grow. It has led fund management firms including Legal & General Investment Management to start divesting from companies such as oil giant ExxonMobil that have dragged their feet and failed to adapt their business models. The Investment Association, which represents City firms with £7.7tn in assets under management, welcomed the revised code and said it set an “ambitious standard” for UK firms.  Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said the overhaul was a positive step, but that the government should give the new accounting regulator – meant to replace the FRC – full legal powers. “The government needs to play its part too and, at the very least, bring forward the legislation to put the FRC’s replacement on a statutory footing, so that the regulator has the tools it needs to hold auditors, investors and directors to account.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the German Association of Energy and Water (BDEW) here, overall power consumption in Germany dropped a slight 1.4% in 2012, and natural gas consumption for heating increased 1%. Gross electricity production increased 1.3% from a year earlier due to colder weather and because 2012 had an extra day.

Germany’s consumption of coal jumps in 2012. (Photo credit: Edal Anton Lefterov, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license)
The BDEW says the trend for renewable energies is positive. The share of electricity produced by renewable sources rose in 2012 to about 21.9% (2011: 20.3). However, the share of CO2-free nuclear energy fell from 17.7% to 16%. The drop in nuclear energy was partly offset by a rise in coal-fired electricity, meaning increased CO2 emissions. Black coal’s share of electricity jumped from 18.5% to 19.1%. The share of electricity from lignite-coal rose a full percent to 25.6%, thus making it Germany’s largest source of electrical power.
Germany’s use of coal has increased and thus has not gotten more green; it has gotten “dirtier”. That’s what we are getting for the tens of billions of euros in added electricity costs incurred from adding renewable energy capacity.
The share by relatively clean natural gas in electricity generation dropped from 13.6 to 11.3 over 2012 due to the relatively high cost of gas when compared to coal.
Germany’s exports of electricity also increased, but not because of the increased generation of renewable energy, rather because neighbouring countries that use natural gas to fire generators, like Holland, have opted to buy the cheaper coal-fired electricity from Germany.
BDEW director Hildegard Müller says, “2013 is an important year for German energy policy.” and that “it will be very important to improve coordination and management of the energy transition”. Müller says: “We have made a proposal together with the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) in order to ensure that all players will be able to have a say in the energy transition.”

"Ocean acidification is an inevitable consequence of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That’s a matter of fact. We don’t know exactly what will happen to complex marine ecosystems when faced with the additional stress of falling pH, but we do know those changes are happening and that they won’t be good news. The journalist James Delingpole disagrees. In an article for The Spectator in April 2016, he took the sceptical position that all concerns over ocean acidification are unjustified “alarmism” and that the scientific study of this non-problem is a waste of money. He concluded that the only reason that the study of ocean acidification was ever funded at all was because there was insufficient (and decreasing) evidence for global warming and it acted as a “fallback position”. Having had the role of science coordinator for the UK Ocean Acidification research programme and being involved in relevant national and international projects for around ten years previously, I know such claims – which Delingpole presented as facts – to be false. I also spotted a range of other errors and inaccuracies in his piece.  Having first gone to The Spectator with my concerns, in late August I submitted a formal complaint to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO). The key issues were whether or not due care had been taken to avoid publication of inaccurate information, and whether comment and conjecture had been clearly distinguished from fact.  At the end of a long and frustrating process IPSO’s final ruling was published on January 5 and it doesn’t seem we are much further forward. My complaint was rejected on the basis that the article was “clearly a comment piece” and that it was not IPSO’s role to resolve conflicting evidence for contentious issues.  Freedom of speech, and of the press, is, of course, extremely precious. Yet that freedom also brings responsibility. The Editors’ Code of Practice – which IPSO claims to uphold – requires the “highest professional standards”. Let’s remind ourselves of what this means when it comes to accuracy: i) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text. ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and – where appropriate – an apology published. That would seem clear enough. So let’s look at just one of Delingpole’s paragraphs and judge for ourselves whether these standards were met: Ocean acidification theory appears to have been fatally flawed almost from the start. In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels. But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information. Their chart only started in 1988 but, as Wallace knew, there were records dating back to at least 100 years before. So why had they ignored the real-world evidence in favour of computer-modelled projections? When Wallace plotted a chart of his own, incorporating all the available data, covering the period from 1910 to the present, his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last century. That might look like a plausible argument based on fact. But the Feely/Sabine chart which was of concern to Wallace was published in 2006, not 2004; the chart didn’t start in 1988, but covered the period 1850-2100; and no data had been omitted, since it showed an idealised, theory-based relationship between atmospheric CO2 and ocean pH. Meanwhile the “real-world evidence” was from extremely unreliable early measurements, uncorrected for natural variability, that when combined gave physically impossible year-on-year changes in global pH. And Wallace’s analyses have not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Delingpole did not contact any of the individuals mentioned to obtain first-hand accounts of the issues of concern. To be fair, several of Delingpole’s inaccuracies, such as NERC (the Natural Environment Research Council) rather than Defra being the main funder of the UK Ocean Acidification research programme, were acknowledged by IPSO – but the regulator ruled that they were not “significantly” misleading, neither cumulatively nor individually. It didn’t seem to matter to IPSO that calling science’s approach to acidification “alarmism” – and implying that researchers have said that everything in the sea will die – is rather different from the well-established scientific knowledge that ocean acidification really does affect sensitive species, such as corals, and will therefore disrupt ecosystems.  The Editor’s Code of Practice has this to say about opinion and comment: The press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. So read this statement from Delingpole: Ocean acidification – the evidence increasingly suggests – is a trivial, misleadingly named, and not remotely worrying phenomenon which has been hyped up beyond all measure for political, ideological and financial reasons. Is this just an honest opinion, a statement of fact, or wilfully misleading and clever rhetoric? That depends on what is meant by “evidence”. If it means quality research carried out by scientists with expertise in the field, the statement is factually incorrect. But if evidence includes anything said by non-experts, such as Delingpole, then that’s an increase, right? All these issues may seem technical or unimportant to anyone but scientists or most of the public. But IPSO’s overall message is that ocean acidification is just a matter of opinion – not a hard-won, testable understanding of the likely effects of human-driven changes on the marine environment. This view of science is pernicious and has serious policy consequences. Why support any research if 250 peer-reviewed papers produced by the UK Ocean Acidification research programme can all be summarily dismissed as worthless?   From a back of the envelope analysis of IPSO’s published statistics on its adjudications on complaints it appears that about 18% of those investigated are upheld. I can’t pretend to be an expert on the nature of complaints about the press and don’t know what proportion is vexatious or can be dismissed out of hand, but it’s important to note that the overwhelming majority of complaints received by IPSO – at least 95% by my calculation – are not investigated or taken further, since they come under the heading complaints IPSO could not deal with. This might be good news for publishers, but seems a very depressing statistic for those who feel wronged by the press. Does this really mean that anything goes if it is presented, however tenuously, as “comment” or “opinion”? Doesn’t “care taken” involve basic fact-checking and making a proper effort to contact quoted or maligned individuals before publication? Are political blogs, disputed newspaper coverage and think-tank reports reliable information sources, while properly peer-reviewed scientific literature can be disregarded? There’s a passionate debate going on in journalism at the moment about regulation – and most journalists believe, probably correctly – that the industry should be its own watchdog. But these sorts of decisions make you wonder whether they are up to the task. All this is in my opinion, of course."

Is the world warming, cooling, or is the global temperature standing still? What does the future hold? Do past trends mean anything for the future? What period are we examining?
For the purposes of this article, several short and long periods will be examined, 15, 150 and over 1000 years into the past, and predictions for 40 to 70 years into the future. 15 years is actually a very short period in light of the fact that the AMO and PDO tend to vary in 60+ year cycles. We are currently near or just past the peak of both of these ocean cycles. The 1970’s cool period was 40 years ago. The 1980’s and 90’s were a period of warming. The peak was reached with a crescendo in the 1998 super-El Niño year. Here is a chart beginning January 1998.

Figure 1 is temperatures from HADCRUT4, sea surface (SST), and UHA, plotted with a combination of AMO and PDO indexes. All data downloaded from WoodForTrees. Linear trend lines added.
The linear trends for all the temperature series for the last 15 years are nearly flat. Some are rising slightly; some are falling slightly. All are, statistically speaking, flat.
Why?
We are at a peak of a 60-year temperature cycle. Many others have described this: here, here, and here, among others. Temperatures are flat because the only way from here is down, up has ended. If you look at history, this is easy to see. Here is the history of AMO and PDO, the two controlling ocean cycles.

Figure 2: The Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO).
If these are combined, Figure 3 results.

Figure 3, AMO and PDO combined. Data from the last 15 years was used in Figure 1.
The thing to remember about the AMO and PDO indexes are that they are de-trended. Any long-term warming or cooling beyond their 60-year cycles are not reflected in these indexes. But we can see in Figure 3 the cooling period around 1910, the rapid warming in the 1920’s and 30’s, the cooling in the 1970’s, and the warming again in 1980’s and 90’s. We can also see that the warming has reached a peak and is set to switch to cooling. If the cycle repeats as it was twice before, the bottom of the next cooling will occur in the 2030’s.
The long term trend is set by the longer solar cycles. Here is the solar activity, calculated from the Beryllium 10 isotope created by cosmic rays at the top of the atmosphere in response to solar magnetic activity. There are 3 different calculations shown, along with the Be10 anomaly on which they are based.

Figure 4 has three plots of TSI and one of the Be10 anomaly on which they are based. The Be10 data has been inverted to match the TSI data. (Less Be10 = higher TSI) Source NOAA here.
The minimums seen in the TSI and Be10 data all correspond to well-known historical warm and cold periods. These are:
– Oort minimum (see Medieval Warm Period) 1040 to 1080
– Medieval Maximum (see Medieval Warm Period) 1100 to 1250
– Wolf Minimum                1280 to 1350
– Spörer Minimum             1450 to 1550
– Maunder Minimum          1645 to 1715
– Dalton Minimum              1790 to 1820
Table 1 is a list of the minimums seen in Figure 4 from left to right. Links are to the Wikipedia articles.

Figure 5 is the Hadley sea surface temperature (SST) dating from 1850.
In Figure 5, we can see the cooling in 1910 and 1950-70, as well as the 20’s and 30’s warming and the 80’s and 90’s warming. The current halt to the warming is also seen.
The TSI data resolution was 6 or 7 years, one data point for each half-solar-cycle. I reduced the SST data to the same resolution by averaging the data for 6 years prior to each data point, and then plotted SST and TSI together. The TSI data based on the Beryllium10 anomaly ends at 1982.
TSI sets the long-term trend for temperature. For temperature, I have used the Hadley HADSST2 data going back to 1850. Here is that chart:

Figure 6 above is TSI and SST plotted to the same resolution.

Figure 7 is a scatter diagram of the Sea Surface Temperature versus TSI plotted in Figure 6.
Notice the long delay on SST cooling in the late 1800’s in Figure 6. The delay seems to be one whole solar cycle of 11 to 12 years. There seems to be little or no delay on warming in the early 1900’s. The TSI data is a bit more than one solar Wolf-Gleißburg cycle in length, the peaks coming in 1865 and 1982. From here, the solar cycle is down. The statistics are clear: The slope in Figure 7 is 0.2875°C per W/m2 of TSI. The R2 value is 0.712, R = 0.844, and the p value is 0.00001. If there were no lag in cooling after a drop in TSI, the R2 value would be even higher. It is clear to me that long term, the sun is driving temperature.
We are now moving into a quiet-sun situation. Projections are for sunspots to completely disappear late in this decade. If TSI drops as low as it did in the Maunder or Spörer Minimums, global temperature will drop by 1 to 1.3°C in 20 to 30 years, into another Little Ice Age that might last for 20 to 40 years. Luckily, the drop should be slow enough that perhaps all the CAGW advocates will be gone or converted in time for us to prepare and adapt.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate science/renewable energy critic Rainer Hoffmann has researched the literature on mean global surface temperature.
Stunningly, he shows that something is not right with the figures coming from the world’s leading climate experts. The figures tell us the mean global surface temperature has dropped 1°C over the last 25 years. At that rate, we’ll be in an ice age by the year 2100!
Page 1 of Hoffmann’s two-page pdf file shows literature that says the mean global temperature in 1990 was 15.5°C. Page 2 shows the literature that says it is now only 14.5°C.
Here’s a chronology of the global mean surface temperature figures from the leading experts over the last 25 years:
1988: 15.4°C
Der Spiegel, based on (untampered) data from NASA (see chart right).
1990: 15.5°C
According to James Hansen and 5 other leading scientists; they too claimed the global mean surface temperature was 15.5°C. Also Prof. Christian Schönwiese claimed the same in his book “Klima im Wandel“, pages 73, 74 and 136. 15.5°C is also the figure given by a 1992 German government report, based on satellite data.
2004: 14.5°C
14 years later, the temperature mysteriously drops to 14.5°C, according to professors Hans Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf in their book: “Der Klimawandel”, 1st edition, 2006, p 37, based on surface station data from the Hadley Center.
2007: 14.5°C
And also according to the Holy Climate Bible, the IPCC WG1 AR4 (page 6 of bmbf.de/pub/IPCC2007.pdf).
2010: 14.5°C
Reconfirmed by Professors Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf in their book: Der Klimawandel, 7th edition, 2012, page 37, (see chart right) based on surface station data.
2012: 14.5°C
Also given by Prof Mojib Latif, March 20, 2012, 1:55 mark.

I wrote about this issue once before awhile back. But now Hoffmann has summed it nicely in just two pages, see link at the top of the page. The consensus today for mean global surface temperature seems to be 14.5°C, while in 1990 it was a balmy 15.5°C.
Of course we know that the mean global surface temperature has not fallen 1°C since 1990, so it is obvious that the experts are all confused about what the real mean temperature really is.
It is highly disturbing that mean global surface temperature numbers may simply have been plucked out of the blue. At least there’s agreement that the temperature has stagnated over the last 10 years or so…at 14.5°C.
Often we see temperature trends depicted as anomalies. But anomalies from what?
The whole business of transforming society based on a figure that we now see is completely in dispute and in a state of utter confusion needs to be stopped until the issue gets cleared up. If it was 15.5°C in 1990 and today it is indeed only 14.5°C, then shouldn’t we be preparing for something totally different? Which figure is right?
The scientists need to explain this situation. Talking about trends and anomalies when there’s no agreement on the benchmark temperature makes no sense.
Rainer Hoffmann’s dissident website, www.solarkritik.de, was shut down on 30 November, 2012. The message left at the site says Hoffmann left Germany and is now being sought by the authorities.
UPDATE:
Hoffmann writes he fled the country in order to avoid involuntary, forced admission to a psychiatric center, as ordered by a seemingly irate justice system.
The legal issues of Mr. Hoffmann are not the main issue here. The real issue here is that the climate institutes don’t have their numbers straight.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany has spent money on renewable energy, like wind and solar power, like few others in the world. So far the country has invested hundreds of billions. How’s the return on investment? Pretty lousy, especially this November.
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) today has a story on how wind parks and solar panels are performing: Germany’s renewable energy in November! Only 7 % of the installed feed-in capacity was fed in.
When Germany exports some energy to France, the media hypes it up everywhere in the evening news…proof that Germany’s energy transition to renewable energy is paying off!
But that, it turns out, is a rare event. Ralf Schuster, for example, took the October data from the EEX in Leipzig and plotted the following chart, which depicts wind and solar feed-in, import from France, and export to France. I’m not going to get to much in the details here. The chart below shows that the exports (green shaded area) are rare and import from France (red shaded area) is the normal situation.

Schuster then took a look at how much solar and wind power was fed in last week from 9 November to 15 November, 2012. He found that of the 64,000 MW of installed wind + solar capacity in Germany, less than 5000 MW was fed in. That comes out to just over a whopping whole 7%!
Now imagine paying 100 employees and seeing only 7 of them working, and that for an entire week. It wouldn’t be long before you went bankrupt.
This kind of performance should be considered before any country, state or community allow itself to be duped into investing in green energy sources.
It’s not for nothing old societies back in history abandoned windmills. They weren’t effective back then, and they certainly are not efficient today.

"We recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.” The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.  Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.” Travel can have a magical transformation on individuals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels; to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes; to meet people with different ideas and perspectives; to try out alternative lifestyles; to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes; to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world.  But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying. The majority of locations we feature in the Guardian’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries. Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink. On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice. One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car. We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project. Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now diving instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.” The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about. John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.” Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.” Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.” That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany and Eastern Europe have been gripped by freezing temperatures and snow for a week, and now Germany’s no.1 daily Bild has an online report warning that “things are going to get a lot worse over the coming week”.


Temperature forecast for next week. Chart source: National Centers for Environmental Protection: http://wxmaps.org/pix/temp4.html 
A blast of frigid air is once again getting ready to make an already cold situation even colder – much colder! Bild writes: “NOW COMES THE SHOCK COOLING!”
Beginning in the middle of next week, night-time temperatures down to -20°C are expected. In the daytime the mercury will climb to only -10°C. Everywhere in Germany!”
For those waiting for warmer winters with little snow and balmy temperatures, as the warmists used to promise us, you’ll just have to forget about it this winter too. If the current cold keeps up, then this will be the 4th colder-than-normal winter in Central Europe in the last 5 years.
And what do the weather models show for Week No. 5 (the week after next week) for Central Europe? Right now they show things staying pretty cold. Here’s the forecast for next Thursday, 24 Jan.:

A bit warmer…Source: National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), http://www.wetter24.de/profikarten/gfs-ncep.html
And here’s the projection for 15 days from now:

Source: National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), http://www.wetter24.de/profikarten/gfs-ncep.html
Clearly temperatures for Central Europe will remain far below normal, and with no relief in sight.
It’ll be interesting to see if the German power grid holds up. If neighboring Eastern Europe, and France to the west, are hard hit by bitter cold, then they may not have any surplus power to spare for Germany, which shut down 8 nuclear power plants a year and half ago. Germany thinks that it can fill that gap with wind and solar energy.
Of course that will only work if the sun shines, and there’s no snow covering the solar panels, and if the wind blows steadily, and if people don’t run too many dryers. Don’t be surprised if the government orders large power consumers and factories to shut down.
As for myself, I’m going to start looking for a Honda generator to power our gas-furnace. Even though we’re living in times of “global warming”, I’m not keen on freezing to death in it.
How much is this cold going to cost?
A lot. Bitter cold always claims more lives. Donnerwetter.de here tells us that warm winters are far more agreeable for humans, as they entail fewer car accidents, lower heating costs, and better economic activity. Moreover, cold claims far more lives. Donnerwetter.de writes:

The colder it is, the more people die! Already starting at a temperature of 18°C, the death rate climbs 0.6% for every degree Celsius it gets cooler! Especially old and sick people are hard hit. At a temperature of 0°C, about 9% more people die than at a relatively mild temperature of 15°C.

Now just imagine how bad it’s going to get when the mercury plummets to -20°C! It works out to 21% more deaths! And the idiots want us to fight warming?

"There is huge potential for using electric vehicles to tackle climate change, give us cleaner air and grow the green economy. The question is, when it will make sense for most of us to ditch diesel and petrol, and go electric? Given the pace of innovation in the sector, it might be sooner than you think. New research from the University of Leeds has investigated innovations in electric mobility that could take the electric car from a niche to the mass market. From new big data applications to smart infrastructure solutions, there are a host of developments that could make 2017 the year of the electric car. It is already much cheaper per mile to drive electric than diesel or petrol – it costs about 12p per mile for liquid fuel versus 2p-4p per mile for electric. Most people will also do the majority of their charging at night, when the price of electricity is much lower than during the day.  As more and more of us get smart electricity meters in our homes, our energy providers will be able to charge us more accurately for when we use electricity as well as how much we use. This means we will be able to access electricity tariffs which offer very low prices during the night. So long as consumers set the car to charge after 9pm, they could hit prices under 2p per mile. Watch out for electricity suppliers offering special deals to electric vehicle customers. Low-price electricity is often the greenest electricity. As we build more wind and solar power into our electricity systems, the cost of electricity on the wholesale market falls. This is because when it’s windy or sunny those technologies have to sell into the market, so the more of them there are having to sell, the more it becomes a buyer’s market.  Some electric cars can already be switched on and off charge remotely  – and there is no reason they cannot be programmed to charge when electricity is cheapest or greenest. Look out for new apps and programs to link car charging with renewable energy by remote scheduling charge cycles. For 97% of the time, we are not behind the wheel of our cars. This has led to a host of non-ownership models where people take short-term rental of cars, buying “mobility as a service”. This research shows that innovative ideas around mobility as a service could be linked with the energy system to offer low-carbon vehicle access to everyone – whether they want to actually own a car or not. Anyone who already uses car clubs, or thinks they might ditch fuel in the near future, might find themselves riding electric sooner than they thought. Until now, having a driveway or garage was the only realistic option for everyday charging. Public charge provision has been patchy – drivers are often forced to use slow chargers in inconvenient locations to top up. This leaves anyone with no off-street parking with no reliable everyday option for charging their vehicles. But throughout 2017, UK cities from Bristol to Nottingham have been investigating new rapid charger provision that can fully charge a normal electric vehicle in the time it takes to drink a coffee and check emails.  These rapid charger points are available in motorway service stations, but they are set to appear in cities, too – so not having a driveway won’t stop you buying an electric vehicle if you live anywhere close to one of these “filling stations of the future”. Look out for them at a forecourt near you. Linking up your brand new electric car with your home sounds great, but in the past would have set you back at least £35,000 for the price of a car, some solar panels and some smart conversion kit. But now as the first generation of electric cars are arriving on the secondhand market, anyone can get a bargain. AutoTrader has led the way by allowing users to search exclusively for fully electric-powered cars.  Anyone who takes a look will see a good quality used example can cost about the same as a conventionally powered car in the same class. Expect to see a growing market for used electric cars and extended warranties on batteries and charging kit. Overall, this research showed us that new partnerships between car makers, energy utilities and cities will offer many more options for us to take our first ride in a purely electric car. We need smart ways of charging so we don’t overload our existing electricity grids – and we might need to get used to seeing a lot more electric vehicle-only parking – but 2017 is looking like a critical year for electric mobility.  It makes a lot of sense to link all these innovations so that new electric cars can get the cheapest, greenest power possible – and we can finally feel less guilty about driving when we could have walked."
"The sight of an oiled seabird is mercifully rare these days. I cannot imagine a more appalling way to die. The guillemot, a small penguin-like (but flighted) seabird, is especially vulnerable to oil and, over the past century, hundreds of thousands – possibly millions – have perished as a result of ships flushing out their bilges, tankers breaking up, or ships sinking. In a new study, I have shown that oil pollution caused a 95% reduction in the guillemot population of Skomer Island in Wales – and probably much of the rest of southern and western Britain. Skomer, a tiny speck of land just off the rugged Pembrokeshire coast, is surrounded by high cliffs which keep foxes and rats away and have turned the island into a world-renowned seabird paradise. I have studied the island’s guillemots each year since 1972, and over that time have built up a good understanding of how their population works (how long they live, the age at which they first start to breed, their reproductive output and so on). Colleagues and I collect this data partly for academic research but also because annual documentation of such population measures is an essential part of monitoring – that is, keeping an careful eye on how the population is doing. High quality monitoring is our only ammunition against those forces that are driving much of our wildlife towards extinction. My study began as a PhD. Guillemot (and other seabird) numbers were in decline, in part because of the 1967 Torrey Canyon oil tanker disaster, followed two years later by a mysterious mass die-off of guillemots thought to have been due to toxic chemicals. When I started in 1972 there were just 3,500 individual guillemots on Skomer. The aim of my PhD was to try to understand their population dynamics. A three-year PhD was too short however, for a bird that can live up to 40 years, so I continued – and have done so ever since. By the mid 1980s, to my surprise and delight, the population started to increase – and it has continued to do so at a rate of about 5% per annum ever since, and numbers on Skomer now stand at 25,000 birds. One would imagine that this increase would have been viewed very positively, but in 2014 the Welsh government used it as an excuse to terminate the modest (but adequate) funding that it had indirectly provided for the previous 25 years. The argument was that if the population was increasing there was nothing to worry about – that is, they saw no value in long-term high quality monitoring. So far I have managed to keep the study going by crowd funding, but that will run out in two years. In any case, even at 25,000 birds, the Skomer guillemot population is still just a fraction of what it had been a few decades earlier. I knew of a set of photographs taken on Skomer in 1934 that allowed me – using 40 years of guillemot expertise – to estimate the guillemot population as it was then: at that time there were at least 100,000 birds on Skomer. The person who so presciently took those pictures was local seabird expert Ronald Lockley. He also provided some written records, stating that when he returned to Skomer after the end of World War II he noticed a massive drop in guillemot numbers. He couldn’t be any more precise, because prior to my PhD, no one knew how to count these birds. Lockley also commented on the abundance of oil and oiled guillemots on the shores of Skomer and the adjacent mainland. In an attempt to test the idea that oil pollution was responsible for the decline in Skomer’s guillemots I plotted the numbers of ships sunk – that would result in the release of oil – in the years before, during and after the war. I did this with some care, restricting my search to those areas that we know (from geolocator tracking) where Skomer guillemots spend the winter.  The pattern was clear: very few ships sunk prior to 1939, follow by a two-hundred fold increase in the first two years of World War II, and very few thereafter. As with all attempts to reconstruct the past, the evidence is circumstantial, but it all fits: a 95% reduction in Skomer’s guillemot between the start and end of the war; a huge number of sunk ships releasing oil during the conflict – and abundant observations of oil-covered birds. Until this study, there had been speculation that the current increase might be a consequence of climate change or a change in fishing activity, but it is equally possible that it could simply be a recovery from that wartime crash. With our knowledge of the guillemot’s population biology we know that if nothing else intervenes, it will take another 30 years to get back to those 1930s levels."

"Gaza zoo has finally evacuated its last few remaining animals, while residents at Venezuela’s main zoo have not been so lucky. More than 50 animals are reported to have died of starvation at Caricuao zoo in Caracas in the past few months as food shortages hit humans and animals alike. There’s no easy solution for zoos faced with these situations, but they can take steps to minimise the impact of economic difficulties on the animals in their care.    Since the diet of a zoo animal is so crucial for its health, being without the special dietary provisions in adequate amounts can be extremely detrimental. In fact, many years of research have been dedicated to ensuring that the majority of species in zoos can have the appropriate calculated diet. Zoo nutrition groups have been established and computer programs have been specially developed to plan diets for different species. So here are the three main options available to a zoo short on food … Rationing food items between the animals and across a time period means that more animals will be able to eat some food for longer. But strict rations are unlikely to cover the whole variety of food needed, and this isn’t an adequate long term solution.  Zoo diets are often calculated precisely. Cotton topped tamarins, for example, have their apples weighed to the nearest gram. Not being able to provide the delicate balance of nutrients can have disastrous effects on an animal’s health and welfare. For example, feeding an incorrect diet of fruit and vegetables to pure carnivores such as lions, tigers and wolves can cause more health issues such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently. Incorrect diets also do not provide the vitamins and minerals needed for the animal to survive and thrive in the long term. For countries with more protracted difficulties, relocation would be the ideal option. The costs, however, are surprisingly large and may prove an impossible amount for a zoo which doesn’t have the money even to meet the animals’ most basic needs.  Capture, administering anaesthesia for larger and more dangerous animals, veterinary care and transporting them to another zoo does not come cheap. In 2010, members of the public raised more than £150,000 to contribute to relocating 13 lions from a Romanian zoo to Yorkshire Wildlife Park. And that was just the lions. The costs involved in relocating an entire zoo full of animals would be much higher. It’s also not easy to find a new zoo which can take the animals and ensure they are provided with the food and care they need. And although zoos such as Yorkshire Wildlife Park have facilitated the relocation of animals, resources are always finite.  As an animal welfare scientist, I always consider the animal’s health and welfare first in these situations. Animal welfare is difficult to define but links to considering the needs of the animal in terms of its mind, body and nature. We know that animals kept in poor conditions suffer as a result and any suffering due to human constraints is unacceptable. Zoo animals are similar to pets and farm animals in that they are all under our management and control, with the added consideration that many zoo animals are critically endangered.  Those animals which are unable to behave or function naturally will suffer. In these extreme cases I believe euthanasia is, as a last resort, the best option. This way the animals are no longer forced to suffer.  Euthanasia in zoos has become a polemical issue after the case of Marius the giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo. However, in circumstances where welfare is being impeded, it can be the most responsible course of action – even with animals as rare as some of those in a zoo.    Accredited zoos around the world contribute towards conservation, education, research and entertainment, with animal welfare being exceptionally high on the agenda. But when a country faces difficulties, animal welfare can often be the first aspect to suffer. It is up to the zoos to come up with the best possible solution."
"The environment was notably absent from Theresa May’s recent speech laying out her Brexit negotiating priorities. It was also rarely mentioned during the referendum campaign. But worries that the UK could turn itself into a post-Brexit pollution haven have now been thrust front and centre by another often overlooked political actor: the European Parliament. The parliament is often derided as a symbol of the Brussels’ gravy train, or more recently a boxing ring for UKIP’s MEPs. Yet it is an increasingly significant force in EU affairs, and has a long-held reputation for trying to enhance its own powers and for promoting greener policies.  Over the years, the parliament’s environment committee – a cross-party group of 68 MEPs  – has led efforts to tighten car emissions, ban leaded fuel and the use of sealskins and, more recently, to secure strong climate change legislation. It has also provided an entry point to the EU legislative process for less powerful actors like environmental campaigners, who struggle to have their voices heard by national policymakers or the European Commission.  But how and why will this institution make a difference to Brexit? The European Parliament’s consent is needed for any deal negotiated between the UK and the EU. So not only does Theresa May’s government need to secure the support of 27 EU states for its final Article 50 deal, but also a simple majority of the 751 MEPs. The parliament has now decided to flex its legislative muscles by outlining the areas it views as priorities in the upcoming negotiations. Maintaining environmental standards is apparently a red (or green) line for members of the chamber’s influential environment committee. Crucially, air quality has been identified as a central issue for MEPs and is an area that the UK government continues to struggle with. Yet again, this year EU mandated air quality limits have already been breached in London and other urban centres. But why would “Brussels” care what kind of environmental rules the UK chooses to adopt post Brexit? There are two main reasons why UK environmental policy is of interest to its European partners. First, environmental pollution is transboundary: the UK gained its reputation as the dirty man of Europe in the 1970s and 1980s because its emissions from coal fired power stations led to acid rain in Scandinavia. Its unpleasant habit of pumping raw effluent into the North Sea was also unwelcome. It is unlikely that our EU neighbours will want to see the UK return to its old habits of using prevailing winds and currents to dispose of unwanted waste in cost-efficient ways.  Second, environmental rules have major trade implications. EU policy was developed to even out differences across states, to prevent those with weaker environmental policies being able to secure competitive advantages. There are consequently good trade reasons for the EU to ensure that the UK maintains the same environmental standards. No European country wants its farmers or carmakers, bound by restrictions on pesticides or emissions, to have to compete with a UK that relaxes such regulations or scraps them entirely. The European Parliament can play a useful role in reminding EU negotiators of the importance of environmental regulations for the effective functioning of the single European market. The parliament’s intervention adds another important voice to the Article 50 debates that may be useful to the Greener UK campaign that seeks to see UK standards maintained post Brexit."

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier this week I featured a shocking video of a workcrew taking down the active nest of a pair of bald eagles in Ontario – to make way for wind turbines.

Video made by: http://ontario-wind-resistance.org/ 
Ever since, there’s been harsh media coverage about that event, for example here: No room for eagles in green energy act:
MNR officials say no eagles were harmed, and suggest that by removing the nest this early in the year, the eagle pair will have a chance to “safely relocate” to another site. Wow. Can you imagine a farmer or other rural landowner trying to use that excuse? It just wouldn’t wash.”
And what happens to a normal rural landowner who destroys an eagle’s nest? I don’t know what Ontario’s law says about that, but look at what happened to a farmer who cut trees AROUND an eagle’s nest. $10,000 fine!
Imagine if he had cut down the tree with the nest. He certainly would have done some hard time.
Yet, those responsible for permitting, and destroying the eagles’ nest, don’t agree they’ve destroyed it – they actually think they’ve preserved it.

They did the world a favor by “relocating and preserving the nest” and taking it out of harm’s way. The spokesman in the above video says they are going to take the now ruined clump of branches that was once an active nest, and put it on a platform somewhere else. Voila!
Finally Peter Epp in the above-linked article writes:
Here’s what the McGuinty Liberals say on a government website about the Fisherville energy project: ‘Expanding clean and renewable sources of energy is key to the government’s plan to phase out coal-fired generation, mitigate climate change, create green jobs and support technological innovation in renewable energy.’
Blah, blah, blah… that’s just a lot of high-sounding nonsense.”
Now the next step is to convince citizens that this is the case with CO2 and climate science as well.

"Most of the world’s primate species are threatened with extinction, according to a disturbing new study. But the threat is more urgent and critical for some species than others. Of all 504 primate species, the rarest and most vulnerable is found only on one tropical island at the southern tip of China. The majestic and enigmatic Hainan gibbon is confined to a single small patch of forest. Only around 25 remain. Gibbons are small apes found throughout Southeast Asia. They live in forests, and are able to swing from tree to tree at incredible speeds. With all but one of the 19 recognised species officially listed as endangered or critically endangered their future is far from certain. Not only is the Hainan gibbon (or Nomascus hainanus) the world’s rarest ape and rarest primate, it’s one of the rarest mammals of all. The entire species now consists of a single population of around 25 individuals, which separates into smaller social groups. The animals are restricted to just two square kilometres of remnant rainforest in Bawangling National Nature Reserve on Hainan Island in the South China Sea. Sadly, numbers have plummeted over the past 50 years. As with so many other species, this precipitous decline is the result of decades of deforestation and an expanding human population which hunts the gibbons for food or poaches them for traditional medicines and the illegal pet trade.  Southeast Asian animals are particularly vulnerable to these so-called anthropogenic pressures. The deforestation rate is the highest among the world’s tropical regions and alarmingly it is predicted that up to 85% of the biodiversity is likely to disappear by 2100. To protect a very rare species on the brink of extinction, you first have to understand its genetic health. Has the inbreeding that inevitably occurs in a very small population caused any unwanted traits, such as weakness to a disease, to become more common? My former student Jessica Bryant recently led an assessment of the genetic health of the Hainan gibbon. She gathered genetic samples of the current population from faeces and compared them to historical samples found in museums. Her work showed the Hainan gibbon has seen a major drop in genetic health, which can in turn lead to ill-health or fertility problems. The study shows that genetic diversity has declined since the 19th century and even further within the last 30 years, representing declines of around 30% diversity from historical levels.  There is also evidence for a recent population bottleneck and an earlier bottleneck in the late 19th century when numbers were already pretty low. Such bottlenecks can occur when there is a dramatic reduction in the size of a population which leads to a reduction in the variation in the gene pool of that population, which in turn can affect the offspring of that population.  Those 25 gibbons are now closely related. Individuals will find even other social groups are filled with their half or full siblings, and inbreeding is likely to increase in the future – there simply aren’t enough of these gibbons for them to mate with anyone but a close relative. This genetic study and other recent research by an international team from UCL, the Zoological Society of London, Bawangling National Nature Reserve and Kadoorie Conservation China, suggest that the long-term recovery of the Hainan gibbon will require intensive management and new strategies may have to be developed to ensure their survival.  One option is to relocate some individuals to new areas of Hainan Island. But this is risky: without buy-in from local people and the authorities, a new gibbon population would be threatened by hunting or deforestation – the same forces that caused their demise in the first place. These fascinating apes are clearly capable of grabbing the public’s imagination. When an entirely new species, the Skywalker gibbon, was discovered recently, the announcement enjoyed international attention. While the Hainan gibbon’s future may seem bleak, scientists across the world are working together to better understand the needs of extremely rare species. In the case of the Hainan gibbon, we just have to hope that this is enough to save them from being the first ape to go extinct."
"The federal environment department says it is not aware of any countries other than Australia planning to use controversial “carryover credits” to meet international climate commitments. The comment, at a Senate estimates hearing on Monday, comes as the Morrison government rebuffs calls from international leaders, analysts and activists for it to abandon the use the credits to meet its 2030 Paris emissions goal.  The government says it has earned the right to use the credits, which represent the amount of carbon dioxide by which Australia has “beaten” the targets set under the previous international climate agreement, the Kyoto protocol. Critics say the credits do not represent the emissions reductions needed to help meet the Paris goal of limiting global heating to as close to 1.5C as possible. Instead, they say, the credits are a fudge that cuts what Australia needs to do to meet its 2030 emissions target roughly in half and that Australia can claim access to them only because it set itself unchallenging targets under the Kyoto deal. At the hearing, the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young asked if the department knew of any other country planning to use carryover credits to help them meet their Paris climate targets. Kushla Munro, a first assistant secretary with the Department of the Environment and Energy, said: “At this stage, we are not aware of other countries intending to use carryover.” “So just Australia?” Hanson-Young asked. “At this stage, yes,” Munro said. Officials confirmed that to meet its 2030 Paris target, a 26% to 28% cut compared with 2005 levels, Australia would need to cut emissions by 695m tonnes cumulatively across next decade. They said 367m tonnes would come from the credits carried over from the previous Kyoto agreement. Kyoto credits are not included in the Paris deal, but it is possible Australia could claim them unless they were ruled out through a consensus agreement by all countries involved in UN climate negotiations. In its evidence at Senate estimates, the department suggested the government might not need to use the credits to meet its 2030 target if emissions from electricity generation continued to fall. Jo Evans, a department deputy secretary, said there had been improvements in emissions from the electricity sector year-on-year. “There is some probability that the baseline level of projected emissions will be coming down and it’s quite possible that not all – if any – of that carryover will be needed in the end,” Evans said. This assessment is at odds with several analyses, including one from the government, that found Australia is not on track to meet its Paris target. While emissions from electricity have fallen in recent years, total national emissions have been rising since 2015, largely due to increases from natural gas production for export and transport. Australia bettered its first Kyoto target, which allowed an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2010, and is on target to meet its second Kyoto target, a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020. Neither target was consistent with what scientists said the country should be doing to play its part in addressing the problem. The government’s Climate Change Authority recommended Australia should also be doing more by 2030 than it has promised, recommending a minimum 45% cut below 2005 levels if it is to play its part in a deal to limit global warming to less than 2C. Department officials confirmed in Senate estimates that 92m tonnes of the emissions reduction needed to meet Australia’s target was projected to come from “technological improvements” not linked to policy changes but expected through unspecified innovations across the economy."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe International Energy Agency (IEA) has issued a press release on global coal consumption. Many claim that last decade’s rapidly rising coal consumption is causing global warming. I beg your pardon:
 While coal consumption has “risen rapidly” over the last decade, the linear global temperature trend has dropped at a rate of 0.7°C/century! Source: woodfortrees.org. 
The IEA press release (emphasis added):
Coal’s share of the global energy mix continues to rise, and by 2017 coal will come close to surpassing oil as the world’s top energy source, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said today as it released its annual Medium-Term Coal Market Report (MCMR).
The IEA expects that coal demand will increase in every region of the world except in the United States, where coal is being pushed out by natural gas.
“Thanks to abundant supplies and insatiable demand for power from emerging markets, coal met nearly half of the rise in global energy demand during the first decade of the 21st Century,” said IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven. “This report sees that trend continuing.
In fact, the world will burn around 1.2 billion more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared to today – equivalent to the current coal consumption of Russia and the United States combined. Coal’s share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year, and if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade.”

China and India lead the growth in coal consumption over the next five years. The report says China will surpass the rest of the world in coal demand during the outlook period, while India will become the largest seaborne coal importer and second-largest consumer, surpassing the United States.
The report notes that in the absence of a high carbon price, only fierce competition from low-priced gas can effectively reduce coal demand. “The US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market, marked by flexible pricing and fueled by indigenous unconventional resources that are produced sustainably, can reduce coal use, CO2 emissions and consumers’ electricity bills, without harming energy security,” said Ms. van der Hoeven. “Europe, China and other regions should take note.”
She noted that the report’s forecasts are based on a troubling assumption, namely, that carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) will not be available during the outlook period. “CCS technologies are not taking off as once expected, which means CO2 emissions will keep growing substantially. Without progress in CCS, and if other countries cannot replicate the US experience and reduce coal demand, coal faces the risk of a potential climate policy backlash,” she said.
As US coal demand declines, more US coal is going to Europe, where low CO2 prices and high gas prices are increasing the competitiveness of coal in the power generation system. This trend, however, is close to peaking, and coal demand by 2017 in Europe is projected to drop to levels slightly above those in 2011, due to increasing renewable generation and decommissioning of old coal plants.
Amid concern about the impact of Chinese uncertainty on coal markets, the report offers a Chinese Slowdown Case. This scenario shows that even if Chinese GDP growth were to slow to a 4.6% average over the period, coal demand would still increase both globally and in China – indicating that coal demand is not likely to stop growing even with more bearish economic perspectives.
 Who knows, maybe burning coal is actually causing global cooling.

"The story of Liberia’s former research chimpanzees is both well-known and contentious. A non-profit blood bank, the New York Blood Centre (NYBC), set up a virus-testing laboratory in the country in 1974, and wild chimpanzees were trapped from their forests and housed within the “Vilab II” facility. They were subjected to medical experiments and were intentionally infected with hepatitis and other pathogens to help develop a range of vaccines.  By 2005, the director of Vilab II, Alfred M Prince, announced that all research had been terminated and that the NYBC had started to make “lifetime care” arrangements for the chimpanzees through an endowment. Over the next ten years, the chimps were “retired” to a series of small islands in a river estuary, receiving food, water and necessary captive care (at a cost of around US$20,000 a month).  Then, in March 2015, the NYBC withdrew its help and financial support and disowned Prince’s commitments. The move left about 85 chimps to fend for themselves. Escape is impossible, as chimpanzees are incapable of swimming well, and many are suspected to have likely died from a lack of food and water. Although the Liberian government owns the chimps as a legal technicality, the day-to-day management of the chimps and the experiments were carried out by NYBC and it in no way absolves it from ultimate responsibility. But it has used this to distance itself from calls for it to continue funding care. In a statement last year it said it had had “unproductive discussions” with the Liberian government and that it “never had any obligation for care for the chimps, contractual or otherwise”. It has also said that it can “no longer sustain diverting millions of dollars away from our lifesaving mission”.  Understandably, animal rights groups are vocally opposing the blood bank’s actions. This is not a discussion about the ethical nature of animal testing for medical use. Regardless of how they got there, nobody could argue that these sentient apes do not deserve access to food and water. As a primatologist, I am interested in how a group of semi-wild former lab chimps are now cared for, where they harbour both diseases that could pose a threat to other animals and zoonotic diseases, which may be transmitted to humans. After receiving a call from the Humane Society of the United States, animal welfare and great ape specialist Jenny Desmond and her wildlife veterinarian husband Jim moved to Liberia in November 2015 to coordinate the work there. They lead a small but dedicated local team that is now offering these abandoned apes a brighter future. I spoke to the Desmonds recently. Of the chimps currently on the islands, they told me, 11 were born after 2006 due to lack of proper birth control. Jenny estimates that “30 of the adult chimpanzees ‘retired’ in 2005 have died”. Without the contraceptive implants often used in sanctuaries, the population became unmanageable.  Reintroducing these animals to the wild is not a possibility. Release programmes are controversial and these chimps could infect wild chimpanzees with the diseases they were once inoculated with. “We don’t even know exactly which chimps were inoculated with what diseases,” Jenny said. With a life expectancy of 60 years or so, it is now vitally important to provide the best care to these animals. There are currently 63 chimpanzees spread across six islands in groups of between nine and 13. Fortunately, when the Desmonds arrived, they found a dedicated and well-trained staff already close at hand, as many of the former local NYBC employees who had worked with the chimpanzees for decades are still in the area. Yet a lack of infrastructure on the islands and mainland has made targeted monitoring and treatment almost impossible. The chimpanzees range freely on the islands and there are no holding facilities, meaning individuals cannot be separated and health checks routinely be given.  But despite a string of complications and hurdles, Jim Desmond is optimistic about the progress made so far:  Our two primary goals when we arrived were to improve the diet of the chimpanzees and implement a birth control programme. We revised their existing diet, adding variety and flexibility, making it more nutritious and allowing for more effective food procurement. We also switched from NYBC’s former every-other-day feeding schedule to daily feedings and hope to eventually move to a twice-a-day system. The chimps’ overall health has already improved dramatically and the birth rate is now coming under control, thanks to daily progesterone pills. Their future is by no means secured, however. Crowd-funding is being used to help with the high monthly care costs and long-term funding is not assured. The NYBC chimpanzees of Liberia were used for decades in order to develop treatments intended to save many human lives. However, after the research finished and a decision was made (rightly or wrongly) to keep the chimpanzees alive, those animals were then at the mercy of others, and this should rightly be the medical research community.  Ethologist and renowned chimpanzee conservationist Jane Goodall believes that the NYBC is responsible for the well-being of the chimpanzees for the rest of their lives. “They knew full well that chimpanzees are long-lived,” she told me in a recent interview. “Whether or not the chimpanzee experiments were actually useful to science is irrelevant in this instance. The callous abandonment to their fate is unforgivable. We of course recognise the important role of blood banking organisations, but the NYBC has seriously fallen down here and must make it right.”  NYBC was unavailable for comment. However, this situation is an important case when it comes to the treatment of former laboratory animals, from both a moral and scientific perspective. Captive management of any sentient species is often complex. But when the animals were used for experiments, there is surely an implicit obligation for the research community to care for them when they are no longer of any scientific value."
"Around 600 pilot whales recently became stranded on a New Zealand beach, around 400 of which died before volunteers could refloat them back into the sea. Sadly, this kind of mass whale stranding has occurred since human records began, and happens somewhere in the world on a regular basis.  At the end of 2015, 337 sei whales died in a fjord in Chile after the largest ever beaching of whales of this species. Mass strandings can also occur in northern Europe. In February 2016, 29 sperm whales were found stranded on the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands, eastern England, and northern France, a record for this species in the North Sea. Why do these creatures, which are masters of living in a totally aquatic environment, enter an inhospitable land environment where inevitably some, if not all, will die? Mass strandings almost invariably involve oceanic species of whales. Long-finned and short-finned pilot whales tend to be the most frequent casualties. Other species typically are false killer whales, melon-headed whales, Cuvier’s beaked whales and sperm whales. All of these normally live in waters over 1,000 metres deep and are very social, forming cohesive groups that in some cases may number hundreds of animals.  Although it’s tempting to automatically blame whale strandings on human activity, the fact that deep-dwelling species of whales most often get stranded, and in the same locations, indicates that in many cases natural causes are more likely to be to blame. Mass strandings of these oceanic species tend to be in very shallow areas with gently sloping, often sandy, seabeds. In those situations, it is no surprise that these animals, which are used to swimming in deep waters, can get into difficulties and even if re-floated will often re-strand. The echolocation they use to aid navigation also does not work well in such environments. So it is quite possible that the majority of such strandings are simply due to navigational error, for example when whales have followed a valuable prey resource into unfamiliar and dangerous territory. This may have been the cause of the mass stranding of sperm whales in the North Sea, some of which had recently digested oceanic squid in their stomachs. The ratio of strandings to sightings for sperm whales in the North Sea is significantly higher south of the Dogger Bank where shallow, often sandy, environments prevail. And the same goes for Farewell Spit, Golden Bay in the South Island of New Zealand, where the recent pilot whale stranding took place and where similar incidents have occurred several times in the last few years.  Both areas have seen a number of mass strandings of those particular species in the past. In the southern North Sea, there are records of mass strandings of sperm whales dating back at least to 1577. However, mass strandings aren’t only caused by whales getting lost or misjudging the depth of the water. One or more individuals may be diseased and, as they become weaker, they seek shallower waters so they can more easily come to the surface to breathe. Once their bodies come to rest on a hard surface for any extended period, there is a greatly increased chance that their chest walls will be compressed and their internal organs damaged. Occasionally, live strandings may derive from human activities, particularly military activity that involves the use of sonar. This connection was first suggested in 1996 after a NATO military exercise off the coast of Greece coincided with the stranding of 12 Cuvier’s beaked whales. Unfortunately, there was no opportunity for veterinary examination.  But in May 2000, another beaked whale mass stranding took place in the Bahamas alongside naval activity using similar loud mid-frequency sonar. A number of the whales were examined, and haemorrhaging, particularly around the inner ear, was discovered, indicating acoustic trauma. After a similar incident in the Canary Islands in September 2002, veterinary pathologists analysing the whales also identified symptoms of decompression sickness. This suggests that the animals do not always die from stranding but may be injured or die at sea first. Many researchers now believe that naval sonar might produce behaviour in whales that interferes with their ability to manage the gases inside their bodies, affecting their ability to dive and rise to the surface safely. Loud noise in the ocean has become a major conservation concern as humans introduce sounds of varying intensities and frequencies into the marine environment from different technologies and even explosions. Seaquakes are another source of intense underwater sound and those might also lead to physical damage or behaviour resulting in strandings, although no one has yet produced a statistical link between the two.  The kind of strandings seen in New Zealand, where very large numbers of whales become beached but a significant proportion can be rescued, also raises the question of whether some healthy animals simply follow others into dangerously shallow waters. Many years ago, I went to the aid of two short-beaked common dolphins that  stranded alive in the Teifi Estuary, west Wales. One of the individuals died quite quickly and a subsequent post-mortem revealed it had a heavy lung parasite infection, which was thought to have affected breathing. The other individual remained close to its dying companion and appeared to be in great distress, whistling frequently. We managed to successfully refloat this other dolphin in the end and it swam away, but the incident highlighted to me the strong social bonds that can exist between individuals. When we see large numbers of whales or dolphins undertaking what appears to be mass suicide, the chances are that they are vocally responding to one another, reflecting their strong sociality. Recent research suggests that whales in mass strandings aren’t necessarily even related to one another. So perhaps mass strandings are a reflection of just how strong the social bonds between whales really are."
"Without farming, Britain’s countryside would be drastically different. Imagine walking through landscapes un-tilled, un-sown, un-fertilised and un-treated, nor grazed by cattle or sheep. Following the Brexit vote, the government has to decide what to do about the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the EU’s subsidy scheme for owners of farmed land. Some of these subsidies support food production while others support environmental protection on land suitable to be farmed. In 2015, British farmers received roughly £3.2 billion from the EU. Agricultural land covers 70% of the UK. If all subsidies stopped, the National Farmers Union reports many farmers would go out of business and large swathes of land would come out of production.  This may be unlikely (and it’s certainly not what I’d recommend) but it’s still worth exploring an even more dramatic scenario: what would happen if Britain’s farmers sold all their livestock and equipment and abandoned their land? There would be cultural, social and economic shock for sure. With less food grown and reared locally, prices would undoubtedly rise as supermarkets scrambled to secure foreign supply lines. But what would happen to the land itself? Without farming, what would happen to Britain’s nature? With the hungry mouths of livestock gone, along with the farmer’s ploughs, the great wheels of ecological succession would be freed to turn. Ecological “succession” is the process of change from one set of species to another. In this case, it would begin with dormant seeds, native or otherwise, that would start to emerge. Plants best adapted to fertilised soil such as nettles will thrive.  In time, shrubs and trees will venture into abandoned fields from woodland and hedgerows. Then would come fast growing, light-demanding trees like birch and oak, turning scrubland into early phase woodland. In the shade of the new canopy, lime and elm, both tolerant of low light conditions, will slowly establish themselves until they outlive or outgrow the trees that came before them. It is a textbook story of succession. The varying climates and soils across Britain mean different species will prosper in different places, and plants will grow at different paces, but in time, in most places, the result will be largely the same. More trees. Herbivores could halt this process in places, and roe, sika and red deer populations would be likely to thrive post-farming. But Britain is missing the heavy-duty herbivores like aurochs (the ancestor of domestic cows) and wild horses that can help halt succession. Storms and fire would open up the canopy in other places, but it is likely that woodland would come to dominate eventually. So how would this affect Britain’s wildlife more broadly? We can look to the past for insight. Agriculture arrived in Britain around 5,000 years ago. Early farmers cleared woodland to allow them to graze cattle and grow crops. The result of this transition was that plants and animals that favoured open areas thrived. Woodland associated species suffered. In fact, most of the known recent extinctions in Britain are of woodland species, such as the red-backed shrike or scarce dagger moth. Farmland abandonment would reverse this trend. Species associated with open habitats, such as grey partridge, skylark, lapwing, as well as many bees and butterflies, would find fewer places that meet their needs. But scrub and woodland species, such as bullfinch, nightingale, and capercaillie birds, as well as other groups like moths, beetles, fungi and mammals would thrive once more.  What would happen if instead of just abandoning the land, populations of large herbivores such as bison, wild horse, European elk (aka moose) or wild boar were established, along with their predators lynx, wolf and bear? This scenario is known as “trophic rewilding”. The starting processes would be similar, and succession would still swing into action. But the shrubs and trees trying to establish in fields will be grazed and browsed. Areas of intense grazing would stay open.  But even large herbivores can be less inclined to browse where spiky bushes of bramble, hawthorn and gorse have established. Predators too will mean some areas are relatively free from large plant eaters, who would soon learn to avoid places where they feel at greater risk of being eaten. These plant havens would allow trees to grow, eventually poking out from the protective cocoon of spikes, to emerge above the browsing height of herbivores. This combination of vegetation-driven processes rising from the bottom of the food-web and predator and herbivore driven processes cascading down from the top can create rich mosaics of habitats. Some of these habitats would be open grasslands full of wildflowers, others mighty woodlands, and some caught in transition. These different habitats would provide for the full range of Britain’s plants and animals. But, as far as I know, Britain’s farmers have no plans of quitting. Plus, Britain’s nature is well worth investing in to secure our food supply, safeguard biodiversity and restore resilient ecosystems that support society. But this juncture gives us a chance to think about our future and perhaps, in some places, the return of wild nature should be welcomed."
"As humans, the concept of parenting and care giving is often ingrained so far into our lives that it is easy to take it for granted. On a recent visit to the zoo, my two-year-old recently asked, “but where’s the tortoise’s mummy?” She made the quite reasonable assumption that all animals come in nuclear families, and are just as committed parents as are most of us humans. Perhaps we take parental care for granted because we are mammals, and every mammal species cares for offspring – at least to some extent. But aside from us mammals, most species – including almost all tortoises – actually abandon their offspring as soon as they can, making species that actually parent a tiny minority. Especially species like us, where dads are typically involved as well as mums.  Another group where most parents usually abandon their eggs immediately is the arthropods – a large group including insects, spiders, crustaceans and many others. But of the arthropod species that do care for their offspring, some are among nature’s most devoted parents. And our new study shows that this parental care often evolves because of the risk of predators. Parental arthropods have long fascinated generations of scientists, and as early as 1764, the Swedish naturalist Adolph Modeer patiently watched a tiny – but very brave –  “parent bug” stand over its offspring and challenge attackers instead of fleeing. Others take parenting behaviour to extremes – such as some female spiders, who allow their babies to eat them. These mothers only ever have one brood of offspring, so technically they have nothing to lose – why let your nutritious corpse go to waste? And research has shown that by eating mum, spider babies actually grow to be bigger adults. This gives them a kickstart that boosts their chances of reproduction compared to those babies that are lumbered with more stingy, non-suicidal parents.  Compared to suicidal spider mothers though, most arthropods that provide childcare are slightly less gung-ho about it. But they can still help to boost their babies’ survival prospects. Bromeliad crabs, for instance, lay eggs in rainwater pools formed in the spiral or “rosette” of rain-forest plants. The mother crab patiently drops snail shells into the water, which elevates calcium levels just enough for the baby crabs to form their tiny shells. An obvious question then is why only some – and not all – arthropods care for their offspring. And one longstanding idea is that care evolves in places where undefended offspring are more vulnerable to predators. The great biologist E.O. Wilson suggested that we could test this idea by looking at where the parent and offspring happen to be living. This is because insect predators are cold blooded – and their level of activity depends on temperature. So the hotter it is, the more active they are – and so the more intense the risk from predation tends to be.  Based on this idea, it would stand to reason that leaving offspring unattended in the tropics would be more risky – because unattended offspring would encounter more predators in the tropics than offspring in cooler, drier environments. This idea is simple and intuitive, but it has gone untested for over 40 years. Over the years, many insect studies have involved removing the parent to observe what happens to the offspring. This allows scientists to see the difference in survival between experimental groups without a parent, and control groups with a parent. This difference can be interpreted as the benefit of parental care. In some species, broods are entirely destroyed by predators when parents are removed. Others incur more minor losses. In at least one case, offspring actually survive better without their parents. Despite their best efforts at defence, females of one particular species of stink bug actually attract “parasitoid wasps” – rogue insect robbers that hijack and consume eggs and larvae. The mother bugs act as signposts for wasps who might otherwise have passed over the eggs without noticing. In our study, we analysed data from many of those removal experiments conducted over the years, to find out whether – as Wilson suggested – the benefits of care are greater in the tropics.   The results showed that almost all the control groups – the ones that hadn’t had the parents removed – survived better than the removal groups who were left to fend for themselves. Critically, the culprits were almost always predatory insects, mostly ants. This shows that parental care is generally an effective defence against predators. And, as we predicted, the effect of removing parents tended to be greater in tropical locations than in cooler, drier climates – finally confirming Wilson’s hypothesis.  But this was only the case in species whose eggs are completely undefended without their parents. For species who also have a back-up defence – such as nests, burrows, or eggs covered in mucus – eggs in the tropics fared no worse than eggs in cooler locations, once parents were removed.  This shows that there are other strategies open to arthropod mothers for keeping offspring safe as well as physically guarding them. And in the tropics, where parental care may not always be enough, mothers may well need several lines of defence against predators."
"The Paris climate agreement has now officially come into force. Although Donald Trump and other climate change deniers have vowed to abandon it, most have hailed the agreement as a huge success and a significant milestone in our quest to limit the effects of global climate change. But here’s the problem: many climate experts warn that the commitments made at Paris still fall far short of what is required to halt global warming at the 2°C mark, never mind reversing the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The simple truth is that the Paris agreement is blind to the fundamental, structural problems that prevent us from decarbonising our economies to the radical extent needed. Take renewable energy. Among the most progressive leaders in business, government and NGOs there is a shared belief that, if only we could switch off the fossil fuel tap and quickly transition towards renewable energy sources, we still have a chance to save the world from runaway climate change. All that’s needed is massive investment in wind, solar, geothermal and other renewables. International agreements such as those reached in Paris are what makes those investments possible, providing business confidence and policy commitment. While I feel part of this group of progressives, there are some hard facts that cannot be ignored. First, the renewable schemes to date have largely been at the expense of unpopular nuclear installations, while the global share of fossil fuel-generated energy consumption remains at about 80-85%: just where it’s been since the early 1970s. Yes, massive solar and wind parks are being built around the world, but they haven’t yet changed the business models of Shell, BP and other fossil fuel giants. On the contrary, they feel more secure than ever to invest in fossil fuel sources, particularly gas, which they see as a “transition fuel” – here to stay until at least 2050 they say. Second, the massive amounts of land required for installing gigawatts of solar and wind power will destroy natural habitats and take away valuable farmland. This is already evident in the way existing biomass production schemes – forests in the US for instance, sugar cane in Brazil or palm oil in Malaysia – have had serious environmental and social side-effects to the extent that they have been labelled as “greenwash. There simply isn’t enough accessible land for all the solar or wind farms that would be needed to transition to a renewable future. Wherever renewables have been developed at the ""mega” level, they end up bulldozing, quite literally, people and wildlife. And generally it’s the poorest, usually rural, communities who are disproportionately affected, given that their land values are lowest and existing users have little power or formal land rights. For example, large-scale hydroelectric dam projects, currently the greatest source of renewable energy, have destroyed many human communities and flooded irreplaceable natural habitats. Yes, offshore wind can fill some of the gaps, but it is more expensive to build and maintain than onshore, and the generated energy has to be transmitted over long distances. Third, as French scientist Olivier Vidal and his colleagues recently pointed out, the shift to renewable energy will “replace one non-renewable resource (fossil-fuels) with another (metals and minerals).” Vidal estimates that 3,200 million tonnes of steel, 310 million tonnes of aluminium and 40 million tonnes of copper would be needed to build the latest generations of wind and solar facilities. Together with demand from electric vehicle manufacturers, a worldwide renewables boom would rely on a 5% to 18% annual increase in global production of minerals for the next 40 years. Similarly startling projections are made for other materials oiling the wheels of green capitalism, including silver, lithium, copper, silicon, gallium and the rare earths. In many cases, supplies of these raw materials are already dwindling. The Toyota Prius, for example, one of the greenest cars on the market, relies on a range of very dirty rare earth minerals, the excavation and processing of which has devastated large areas of Inner Mongolia in China. Lastly, the climate challenge is so urgent and huge that we actually need to remove carbon from the atmosphere, rather than just switching to renewables. That’s the view of prominent climate scientist James Hansen, the former head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who has shown that, even if we switched to zero-carbon energy sources today, we would still be facing a serious climate challenge for centuries to come. What this all means is that the Paris agreement doesn’t go far enough. In fact, it might give us the impression of moving in the right direction, but actually the pledged actions are so far off what is needed, it spreads false hope. So, what is needed then? A realisation that simply switching to renewables alone will not solve the climate change problem. We need to start removing carbon from the atmosphere. We need to tackle the demand side. We cannot simply assume that relentless economic growth is compatible with a green future. These points raise uncomfortable questions that only those who can think and act against the grain dare to ask. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t transition to renewable energy. Not at all. But that alone will not save the climate. The world’s climate experts and leaders in business, government and NGOs, who are about to gather in Marrakesh for yet another UN conference, would do well in starting to engage with this uncomfortable truth."
"Among its many other claims to fame, the Amazon rainforest contains more than 1,500 bird species. Around a quarter of them are found nowhere else on Earth. Many of these birds have evolved to fill a specific role – whether that means eating particular types of insects, or scattering a certain size of seed, they all play a part in one of the world’s most complex ecological networks, keeping the forest healthy and resilient. More than 90% of tropical trees and shrubs depend on animals to disperse their seeds, for example. These “biodiversity services” are crucial. In a new paper which has been accepted for publication in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, my colleagues and I explored the link between deforestation in the Amazon and local bird diversity. Our bird data was collected in 330 different sites in the Brazilian state of Pará, including arable and pastoral farmland and both primary and secondary forests. Primary forests are the original native vegetation, now increasingly degraded by logging and wild fires. Secondary forests are those which grow back in areas, often farmland, which have been abandoned by people.  Previous work on this database of bird records showed that as land is used more intensively for agriculture fewer bird species can survive. However, the wider impacts of this loss of diversity on the ecosystem had not been explored. In this new study we focused on seed dispersal and insect predation, two ecosystem processes where birds play important roles. Fruit-eating (or frugivorous) birds spread the seeds of forest trees. Insect-eating (insectivorous) birds ensure that any germinating saplings have a fighting chance at survival.  The initial data collection involved nine months of gruelling fieldwork surveying the region’s birds. We subsequently measured thousands of different bird species’ beaks, wings and legs in museum collections. Finally, new analytical procedures were used to show how the types of birds present, and with them their how their body designs changed as the landscape evolved. We found that, compared to undisturbed primary forests, things changed relatively little in forests degraded by logging and fire. Based on the body styles of birds present in these areas such as those with wide beaks and long wings most seeds would continue to be spread and most insects eaten. However, switching to farmland dramatically reduced the “services” birds were able to provide. This may seem fairly intuitive so far, given that there is a world of difference between a forest and cattle pasture. However, more significantly we found that the traits were only partially restored in regenerating secondary forests. These areas have been branded as the “forests of the future” but we found them coming up short. They cannot conserve all the biological interactions realised in primary forests, undisturbed or otherwise, which are essential for biodiversity conservation. Once large seed-dispersing birds such as guans or cotingas are lost in an area, trees species with large seeds find it harder to recover. Regeneration becomes unlikely or impossible. Research from Brazil’s coastal Atlantic Forest has shown that the loss of such key species is driving the evolution of palm trees with smaller seeds. Some of these links may have been lost before we even knew them. The disappearance of certain kinds of birds may let plant-eating insects run wild. These insects can be serious agricultural pests. We found that the loss of specialist forest birds isn’t offset by the colonisation of species from open habitats. The sorts of generalist insect-eaters that come to dominate farmland aren’t generally able to capture the well-disguised insects found in adjacent patches of forest. As roads and farms reach further into the Amazon, the forest is fragmenting into ever-smaller patches. Competition can be fierce within these patches, as species which fill similar “ecological niches” (a method for catching certain insects, say) are forced to battle over the same resources. Some species are inevitably lost, and with them the sometimes specific ecological links that they maintain. We had previously found that competition forces the loss of some species in small patches of Amazonian rainforest. These same forces of competition and habitat change mean fewer bird species in degraded forests and farmland too. Maintaining the incredible diversity of birds is key to the success or failure of ambitious plans for sustainable tropical landscapes."

"In 2011, a marine heatwave hit the west coast of Australia leading to ten days of above average sea temperatures. The area was already known as an ocean warming “hotspot”, but this particular period was a tipping point, causing dramatic changes to the marine ecosystem. Underwater kelp forests along the coast reduced in density by 43%, with some disappearing entirely.  The loss of kelp resulted in an ecological shift, which led to the growth of different kinds of algae as temperate water species were replaced by subtropical and tropical species. Five years later, kelp forest recovery has still not been observed. A few days of extreme heat resulted in apparently irreversible change. The frequency and intensity of extreme events, like marine heatwaves, are only expected to increase, and their consequences are hard to predict. But while some of these extreme events could be devastating, it isn’t all doom and gloom. Even though human-induced climate change is happening, local steps can be taken to help alleviate the impacts on our marine environments. And by focusing on a localised approach, we could make a positive difference on a global scale. For example, in Australia, the government of Queensland spent AUS$7m on a 560 square kilometre cattle station in a bid to protect the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Site. This cattle station had been producing as much as 40% of the sediment running into the Normanby River system and ultimately the Great Barrier Reef.  The very existence of the Great Barrier Reef and its extraordinary biodiversity ultimately depends on the health of the corals. When they are covered by sediment, their ability to photosynthesise is dramatically reduced, resulting in less healthy coral. Unhealthy reefs are less able to deal with predators and other damaging events. In buying the cattle station the government is able to stem the sediment runoff away from the Great Barrier Reef and provide a healthier environment in which the coral can thrive. This is just one example of scientists using local knowledge successfully to inform ministers to make decisions on the local scale that alleviate the problems faced by marine ecosystems of climate change, over fishing and pollution. To apply such processes in more places in the world, organising climate information and action must move from a global to a regional scale. Overfishing and pollution can be much more effectively dealt with by focusing on local responses.  The Pacific Islands for example, rely heavily on the tuna fish industry. But they have faced major problems of over fishing and reducing stocks – from both small vessels and industrialised ships from other countries. Only a united front would enable control over stocks and a future for the industry.  So in 1982, a collective of islands focused on the conservation and management of tuna in the pacific set up the Naura agreement. Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Naura, the federated states of Micronesia and Palau, and more recently Tokelau, all signed up to the Vessel Day Scheme for Pacific tuna, which limits the amount of days available for fishing to maintain tuna populations. In the last five years the collective has received global recognition for its sustainable management methods – and an increase in revenue from US$60m to US$360m. Over in the Caribbean, meanwhile, Antigua has some of the most degraded coral reefs in the region. Overfishing is thought to be a main reason for this as it has reduced the amount of herbivorous fish, resulting in the proliferation of seaweed – a main competitor of the corals.  To improve the health of the reef, marine protected areas – and specifically a “no take zone” – were created in 2014 in conjunction with the local fishermen. Within a year, this change in local management led to significant increases in the biomass of target fish species. This allowed herbivore fishes to actively graze on the seaweed biomass, enabling respite and providing recovery time for the corals.   In Fiji, mangrove trees are being planted to combat coastal erosion caused by rising sea levels and increasing storm surges. While a direct benefit to Fiji’s inhabitants against potential harm from the ocean, this action also creates a habitat and a site of refuge for many juvenile marine species that will also be affected by future climate change. Lessons can be learned from all of these local strategies which could be replicated in similar environments facing similar problems. But developing these initiatives will depend on our understanding of key organisms and their interactions with each other. These are some of the areas suggested by professors Daniela Schmidt and Philip Boyd, in a commentary on what ocean scientists should consider when informing policymakers.  Small island nations will feel the impact of global changes on the ocean first, so they are leading the way in adaption and mitigation techniques in retaliation to changing climates. With the additional threat of America no longer being a part of the international agreements on global warming, tackling climate change on a local and regional scale may be our only hope."
"The multibillion-pound expansion of Heathrow violates the rights of children and future generations, who will face the greatest impact of the climate crisis, lawyers will argue at the court of appeal in London. Fresh legal challenges on Thursday by environmental NGOs, councils and the mayor of London against the construction of a third runway will be presented during a five-day hearing.  The high court ruled in spring that the government’s decision to allow a third runway was lawful. Since then, it has signed into law a commitment for the country to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory adviser, previously warned aviation was likely to be the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK by then. Lawyers will argue for the first time that the rights of children were not taken into account by the government when it approved the third runway. The court has allowed the World Wide Fund for Nature to submit documents arguing the planned expansion violates the rights of future generations under the UN convention on the rights of the child. The intervention by WWF comes after young people spearheaded the biggest climate change protest in history last month, and follows Greta Thunberg’s challenge to world leaders that their inaction was letting down a generation. Debbie Tripley, WWF’s director of environmental policy, said: “Children have a right to have a voice in this … particularly where there is very clearly a disproportionate burden that will fall on them in relation to future climate impacts.” The shadow chancellor said campaigners against the new runway were on the verge of victory. Speaking after a rally outside the court, John McDonnell said: “Last time we were in court the government had not just legislated in the Paris agreement, and parliament had not just agreed we were in a climate emergency. “So I think legislatively things have moved and politically, with the current campaigning by Extinction Rebellion, the pressure is on all politicians to recognise this is a project that cannot stand.” Friends of the Earth, which is leading the challenge on climate grounds, said since the previous court hearing in March, many things had changed. “The government has legislated for net-zero carbon emissions under the Climate Change Act, which our client believes would have almost no chance of being met if the expansion of Heathrow was to go ahead,” said Rowan Smith, a lawyer at Leigh Day representing Friends of the Earth. “It gives further weight to our client’s arguments that the expansion goes against the government’s own climate change goals.” Will Rundle, the head of legal affairs at Friends of the Earth, said: “The government has admitted that it did not consider the Paris agreement when agreeing to Heathrow expansion. We hope the court of appeal now agrees with us that this is not sustainable development and ignores the needs of future generations.” An additional runway would put a further 700 planes in the air each day – a 50% rise on the current traffic in and out of the airport. A coalition of local authorities – Wandsworth, Richmond upon Thames, Hillingdon, Hammersmith and Fulham – joined by the mayor and Greenpeace, will argue the government’s decision to approve the expansion was flawed because ministers failed to properly consider the full impact on noise levels, health and the environment. A decision is expected in December. Ravi Govindia, the leader of Wandsworth council, said: “The third runway will have devastating consequences for the health of Londoners. It is also becoming clearer by the day that expansion will play havoc with the government’s zero carbon targets.” In documents published as part of the consultation process, Heathrow said it should “not come at any cost”. The airport outlined plans for low-emissions zones and congestion charges to stem local air pollution. The proposals involve a phased expansion up to 2050, with terminal buildings added after the runway as passenger numbers reach 140 million a year. The M25, Britain’s busiest motorway, will be moved up to 150 metres west and run through a tunnel under the new runway and taxiways. A temporary bridge across the motorway will be built for construction vehicles. Heathrow has said the expansion will cost £14bn but critics suggest the true figure will be close to £30bn. Boris Johnson, who threatened to lie in front of the bulldozers, has said he will watch the legal challenges with a lively interest."
"The UK government’s European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill is short, extremely short, at just 137 words, but will nevertheless have huge ramifications. Tucked away in the “Commentary on provisions of Bill” is the long-awaited clarification that Brexit will also mean Brexatom, with the UK leaving the Euratom Treaty. The existence of such a treaty may come as surprise to many people. Euratom was in fact one of the three founding treaties of what is now the European Union, and in 1957 established the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) to support the development of nuclear energy. Since then it has remained largely unreformed, and exists as a legal entity separate from the EU. There was therefore some legal ambiguity as to whether the UK could remain with the Euratom after it left the European Union. This has now been clarified: the UK is leaving anyway. The Euratom Treaty covers nuclear non-proliferation as well as safety standards for workers, the public and the environment. The Euratom executive has its own research and development programme and is a global leader in nuclear fusion. It also set up a nuclear-specific loan facility and created a supply agency to ensure adequate access to nuclear materials (such as uraniam fuels).  The UK government must now start to unpick these institutional relationships and start building up its domestic capabilities in nuclear safety, research and so on. By choosing to exit Euratom, it has also left European institutions and the remaining member states with some problems.  In the short term, the most direct additional government expense will be in research and development. It might still be possible to remain in the EU’s research programme, as demonstrated by Switzerland, which makes a financial contribution to take part. The Euratom research budget is €1.6 billion over five years. The UK currently pays around 12% of the whole EU budget which means that its contribution to Euratom’s research budget is about £32m a year. This in turn results in, at least, a similar level of investment in UK-based projects. While it is less than the government’s domestic nuclear research budget of £66m, it would be a considerable additional amount to fund.  The largest share of Euratom research budget goes towards nuclear fusion. Fusion is the politically controversial process of combining atoms, rather than splitting them (nuclear fission). To some, it offers the opportunity for clean and limitless energy, while others see it as a technology that is always 40 years from commercialisation.  In France, Euratom is building the International Thermonuclear Experiment Reactor (ITER) which, when complete, will be the world’s largest fusion experiment.  Euratom already funds the Joint European Torus (JET), a precursor to the ITER based in Oxfordshire. Brexit will be particularly problematic for the £2.5 billion JET facility as its current funding expires in 2018. The EU provides €60m a year for its operation so the UK will need to provide significant post-Brexit finance if it is to keep operating. However, the nuclear industry is also concerned that Brexit will impact upon its costs. For the reactor builders, being outside the nuclear common market (another key chapter of the Euratom Treaty) as well as the single market and having no freedom of movement may lead to higher prices if tariffs and customs checks are introduced or if restrictions are imposed on foreign nuclear scientists and engineers. There will also be technical and institutional challenges to replace the functions carried out by Euratom safeguards inspectors. Chapter VII of the Euratom Treaty establishes a nuclear material control system, giving the European Commission responsibility for “satisfying itself” through physical inspections at nuclear facilities that material is not being diverted for military purposes.  In 1976 a trilateral agreement was signed between Euratom, the International Atomic Agency (IAEA) – the international nuclear watchdog – and the UK, sharing responsibility on the non-proliferation of nuclear material. Since 2010 the IAEA has reduced its presence during regular inspections in Europe as it relies more on the “complementary results” of Euratom inspections. A quarter of all time spent on nuclear inspections throughout the EU is carried out in Britain, due to the scale of nuclear fuel fabrication and waste management facilities, such as Sellafield. Without Euratom involvement, the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulations will need to undertake many more inspections to meet IAEA requirements. The government should be able to find the extra cash, but it will be difficult to quickly hire and train the necessary new staff to implement rigorous safeguards. Leaving the Euratom Treaty will also have political implications for the UK and the EU. Outside the EU, the UK is going to have to develop new or adjust existing bilateral nuclear trade agreements so it can still import uranium or crucial reactor parts. While some argue that outside the EU the UK will be free from the political shackles of the Brussels bureaucracy and “anti-nuclear” member states like Austria, the UK diplomatic service will have to work hard to replace the conferred influence of being part of the EU. The political impact in the EU remains equally unclear. Britain has been one of Europe’s most active supporters of nuclear power, and the industry’s trade association worries that Brexit could tip the balance of member states towards an anti-nuclear majority. The complications around Brexatom also puts a spotlight onto the Euratom Treaty itself, whose legal status and many of its functions are out of step with the modern EU and may once again lead to calls for it to be abolished."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) has been looking at the temperature trends for Germany. The German media, politicians and institutes have been insisting that warming and climate change are happening faster than ever. However, this claim is completely foreign to reality.
=========================================
Climate change in Germany is cooling. No increasing temperatures in 15 years 
Using the data from the German Weather Service (DWD), the climate in Germany has been cooling over the last 15 years.

Germany’s temperatures have been falling since 1998 while global CO2 concentrations have risen. (Chart source: Josef Kowatsch, EIKE; Data source is the DWD German Weather Service)
At the end of 2012 the DWD published the mean annual temperature for Germany. This year the figure was 9.1° C. Although there were no warnings of an imminent heat catastrophe in the media, there was also no depiction of the real situation. Everything was explained using terms that lead easily impressionable readers to believe that the warming, which had started in 1975, was continuing on as usual.
The DWD mentioned not a word about how the temperature trend has been falling since 1998. That means it’s getting colder in Germany, and not warmer.

Including the mean temperature for 2012, Germany’s temperature curve over the last 15 years appears above.
For 20 years now Germany has been issuing grave warnings and spreading fear of the growing threat of climate change. Year after year, self-anointed “climate experts” and highly paid climate scientists have been outbidding each other in coming up with the biggest catastrophe scenarios. Cities and communities have been asked to begin the battle against the already started and supposedly unstoppable global warming, or else face the threat of a a climate collapse soon. “Fight climate change” was the rallying cry to mobilize citizens to battle against the enemy: man-made CO2.
The reality, however, is totally different. In nature, and particularly with the temperature trend, we do not see any sign of the claimed strongly rising temperatures from a greenhouse effect caused by man-made CO2. The climate does what it wants, just as it always has.
The real temperature chart, absent of any warming cosmetics, plainly shows one thing: Temperatures in Germany over the last 14 years have fallen, and more than what is shown if you consider the urban heat island effect.
It is indeed high time to put environmental and nature protection back into the focus and not the business model of climate protection.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman online news weekly FOCUS here has a report on the impacts of climate change on European winters, particularly those in Germany.

Dubious science: German scientists claim warming Arctic leads to a colder and warmer Northern hemisphere. Photo source: NASA, public domain.
A few years back we all heard scientists saying that snow and cold winters were a thing of the past in Europe. But now that we’ve had several successive snowy and cold winters in a row, they’ve backpedalled and are now claiming global warming leads to more (and not less) cold and snowy winters instead. And not just in Europe, but also over the Northern Hemisphere as a whole.
According to FOCUS, Germany’s leading climate institutes are now saying we will be getting both warmer and colder at the same time. How that can physically happen they have yet to figure out. Just believe their models, I guess.
FOCUS reports that “in Central Europe, cold icy winters will probably prevail instead of Mediterranean-like climate, and that in the future snow will fall from the skies more often.”
Ralf Jaiser of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research says:
The possibility exists even if more or less certain prognoses are impossible.”
The scientists are blaming global warming and the melting Arctic for the projected colder European winters.

FOCUS also quotes the Max Planck Institute: “Model simulations and observation data both show that the retreat in sea ice also changes the weather system,” says Dirk Notz of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg. He says this will cause “cold polar air to stream down into Europe”. That means two of Germany’s renowned climate institutes are now claiming global warming means colder European winters.
But Rahmstorf says we will get warmer winters with more frequent cold.
FOCUS also quotes Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who says the recent Greenland high that forced hurricane Sandy into America’s east coast and a cold snap to grip Europe at the same time “could be a consequence of the ice melt in the Arctic”. “Both the models simulations and measured data indicate a relationship between sea ice retreat and more frequent highs over Greenland.“
He’s so full of it.
Dirk Notz also says a warming Arctic also means a smaller temperature differences with respect to southern regions and that the jet stream is thus weakening, which in turn leads to easier mixing of air masses. So far this year there have been two studies showing Arctic sea ice melt may lead to heavier snowfalls in the northern hemisphere. Notz says that there is a greater probability of cold winters ahead.
But Rahmstorf disputes that. Focus quotes Rahmstorf:
Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact research assumes to the contrary that the average winter temperatures will continue to rise. ‘Merely temporary cold snaps like during last February which led to record cold in all of Europe may increase.'”
They want their cake and to eat it, too. What’s strange in all this is that if polar air streams down southwards, then something has to move up to replace it. That would would mean southern air streaming up into the Arctic. Thus we would have to say that the Arctic melt is caused by changing wind patterns and not by warming. It seems the German alarmists are trying to get everything their way, but it’s physically impossible.
They’re weaving a very confused web.

"The seas around Hawaii are set to become the world’s largest marine protected area, US president Barack Obama has announced. The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument will be expanded to more than 1.5m square kilometres – that’s as big as France, Spain and Germany combined. If this story sounds familiar that’s because it is. Last year, the UK created the previous world’s largest continuous marine reserve around the Pitcairn Islands, and it set up another huge protected area around Ascension Island in January 2016. Chile, France and New Zealand have all made similar moves in the past few years, turning the waters surrounding their most remote island territories (such as Easter Island) into huge nature reserves. Supporters say these marine protected areas, known as MPAs, have a key role to play in marine conservation as they protect from fishing, mining, drilling or other human activities, and allow habitats and species to be restored. Yet these protections might be undermining the very aims of global marine conservation targets. As we argue in a viewpoint published in the journal Marine Policy, it’s not enough to simply cover the remotest parts of our oceans in notional “protection” – we need to focus on seas closer to shore, where most of the fishing and drilling actually happens. Under the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity, signed by almost every country in the world, one of the agreed targets is to designate 10% of the area of the world’s oceans as MPA by 2020. We are a long way from this, however, with less than 4% of the global marine area currently protected.  Even this is largely thanks to vast remote MPAs in distant seas that are subject to few human pressures. While there are more than 6,000 MPAs in total, the majority (62%) of the global coverage is down to just 24 huge areas.  Recent proposals to increase the MPA target to 30% of the world’s seas, to be discussed at the World Conservation Congress beginning on September 1, can arguably only be met through an increasing focus on the designation of vast remote MPAs. From the perspective of national governments, Hawaii, Ascension and similar protected areas are an easy win. Leaders gain some green credentials while making progress towards their country’s individual MPA target, and all for minimal political cost. After all, these vast protected areas tend to be in overseas territories without much commercial use. Given this easy option is available, why go through the politically and economically expensive process of creating smaller protected areas closer to the mainland?  However, as we discuss in our paper, there are concerns that marine conservation aims could be undermined by this focus on a few big areas. The marine biodiversity target is about much more than the proportion of the seas that are covered. It also states, for instance, that the networks of MPAs must be effective, meaning restrictions on fishing, mining and so on are actually enforced. But how do you properly police a patch of ocean almost as big as the state of Alaska? The very vastness and isolation of these protected zones around Pacific or Atlantic islands means they are extremely expensive to patrol.  True, emerging satellite technology can provide remote surveillance of fishing vessels. But gaining sufficient evidence for prosecutions and stiff penalties remains a challenge, despite a recent agreement between governments to detain illegal fishing vessels and block their access to markets. The biodiversity target also specifies that the MPA networks must be representative, in that they should protect typical examples of habitats and species in each of the world’s 232 ecoregions, and well connected, in that ecological processes such as fish migrations and larval dispersal should be able to bridge the gaps between protected areas.  These elements of the targets can arguably only be met through a more even spread of protected areas, including smaller designations in more intensively used “metropolitan seas” closer to towns and cities. Often, this will include zones where some fishing and extraction is allowed. In the Isla Natividad MPA in Baja California, sustainable levels of abalone (sea snail) fishing is allowed while certain “no-take zones” restore the marine ecosystem. Similarly, the Tubbataha MPA in the Philippines provides for both the restoration of coral reefs and sustainable dive tourism.  In both these MPAs, fishermen can benefit when fish and their larvae swim or drift out from these restored areas into fished areas. Marine reserves in busier waters are more challenging, but recent studies indicate their effectiveness is feasible.   Last, but certainly not least, MPA networks must be equitably managed, and it’s not clear whether these huge areas fit the bill. Closing the entirety of the seas around remote islands could unfairly impact the few local people who rely on the sea for food and income. An over-reliance on vast remote protected areas could undermine other elements of the 10% MPA target such as their requirements to be effective, representative, connected and equitable. We’ll need lots of different types of marine protection in order to actually achieve these conservation aims. The race towards vast remote MPAs should not divert attention, resources and political will away from the need for smaller protected areas closer to home."
"The Palaszczuk government has blocked the release of basic information about climate protests – including dates and locations of photographs used to justify controversial proposed laws – by claiming the details are subject to cabinet confidentiality. At an inquiry hearing last week, the Queensland police tabled photographs of “locking devices” that are proposed to be banned by the new legislation. When asked on notice to clarify details about the images, the police responded a week later to say: “the time, date and place of each of the events depicted in the tendered photographs are subject to cabinet in confidence”. The government has attempted to sell its crackdown on climate protesters by making arguments that activists are “extremists” and using “sinister tactics”, including lacing locking devices with booby traps. No evidence has ever been released to back those claims. In parliament, the premier, Annastacia Palaszuczk, claimed activists had put butane canisters in locking devices. Police told the inquiry last week the only similar incident occurred more than 14 years ago. After heightened Extinction Rebellion protests this month, the government is now rushing to get its laws through committee scrutiny and before parliament. But civil libertarians and human rights advocates have considerable concern the proposals, which they say will restrict basic liberties and have been justified by claims which the government cannot back up. Last week the state’s human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, questioned the justification for the laws and said there had not been an opportunity to “publicly scrutinise evidence ... to assess the necessity”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It would appear that the proposed laws targeting devices that are not inherently dangerous are actually directed at avoiding the disruption caused by peaceful acts of civil disobedience rather than addressing public safety,” McDougall said. Guardian Australia has confirmed that photographs posted on social media by Palaszczuk when announcing the laws were from a protest that occurred more than 18 months ago in north Queensland, although her public commentary has made it clear the laws have been prompted by disruptive Extinction Rebellion protests in Brisbane. Images tabled by police – whose dates cabinet wants to keep secret – were from the same incident in January, 2018. The Greens MP Michael Berkman said use of cabinet confidentiality was “pure cynicism”. “These laws were always designed as a distraction from Labor’s support for new thermal coalmines and failure to commit to 100% clean energy. Now it’s clear how little evidence they actually have,” Berkman said. “It’s pure cynicism to use an image as a political tool, then claim that its date and location are state secrets. This wouldn’t fly in a grade-10 science project, and it’s not good enough for the Queensland parliament. “Under scrutiny the premier’s favourite talking point about aerosol canisters turned out to be an unsubstantiated rumour from 2005, so I’m not surprised Labor refuse to release the details.” The laws will go before the state parliament next week."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor awhile it appeared the German mainstream media were going to ignore the reality that the globe hasn’t warmed since the issue has been around (15 years).
But last Friday, Spiegel here was the first major German media outlet to break the ice and asked where the warming’s gone?” Read about it here.

 Saturdays’s major daily of Hanover, Germany carries the front-page headline: Global Warming Is Keeping Us Waiting
Saturday, yet another major media outlet, the Hannoversche Allgemeiene Zeitung (HAZ…Hanover’s major daily) had a front page headline! on its print edition (marked yellow above) titled: Global Warming Keeps Us Waiting!
Hat-tip: Klaus Oellerer
Germans more than ever, now having endured 4 brutal winters in 5 years and now fighting through another wave of brutal cold and heavy snowfall, are asking: Where’s the bloody warming!
Today’s UK Telegraph even comments: It’s snowing and it really feels like the start of a mini ice-age.”
The sub-headline of the HAZ reads:

Is carbon dioxide being over-estimated? British scientists announce: the temperature increase stopped already 15 years ago.”
In the piece, Margrit Kautenburger asks, “What is it going to be? Is it going to be warmer, or not? The contradictory reports of global warming are falling all over each other.”
Over the years Germany has been bombarded by the media with dire warnings, spurred on by the catastrophe-obesessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), that the warming was galloping ahead like never before. Now, suddenly, observations and measurement data show there’s been no warming at all – even though CO2 emissions have steadily risen. The public is wondering what’s going on.
Kautenburger writes that the “authorities have corrected their climate projections significantly downwards” and quotes veteran German meteorologist Klaus E. Puls:

Nature is behaving differently than what the models predicted. However, that fact is being ignored. […] Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, but its impact is being completely exaggerated. Puls says that the correction by the Met Office is a sign that there’s a change in thinking taking place. Climate science is too politicised. We need an open and fair discussion.“

Like Spiegel, the HAZ also writes that “climate scientists are puzzled” and adds.

The uncertainty shows, if anything, one thing: The climate is still mostly misunderstood. Foremost short-term trends are uncertain, concedes climate scientist Mojib Latif of the Geomar Center for Ocean Science in Kiel.”

Latif really ought to know. Back in 2000 he infamously predicted there would be little snow at our latitudes.  That prediction is now turning out to be preposterous. 4 of the last 5 winters have been harsh, and right now much of Germany is being paralyzed by yet another hefty blanket of snow.
Have you looked out the window today, Mojib?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe U of A Science News website has an interesting report on precipitation reconstructions using tree rings. The reconstruction goes back some 470 years in the Southwest, covering most of Arizona, western New Mexico and parts of northern Mexico.

Today when drought strikes, we are told by the media and catastrophe-obsessed scientists that it’s unusual and so it gets blamed on man-made climate change.
Lead author and doctoral candidate in the U of A School of Geography and Development Daniel Griffin says, “This is the first time researchers have used tree rings to take a closer look at the monsoon in a large and important area of the American Southwest.”
Moreover, he adds (my emphasis):
Monsoon droughts of the past were more severe and persistent than any of the last 100 years.“
Other excerpts:
“…the late-16th-century megadrought caused landscape-scale vegetation changes, a 17th-century drought has been implicated in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 and the 1882-1905 drought killed more than 50 percent of Arizona’s cattle.”

Well imagine that! All this when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were at the “desirable 280 ppm” and climate and weather back then were more or less stable.
Griffin did not cherry-pick tree-rings to get politically correct results, it seems. No bum steer here. The U of A News writes that “the researchers used samples from 50 to 100 trees at each of 53 different sites throughout southwestern North America […] which covers most of Arizona, western New Mexico and northern parts of the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua.”
“It was a massive undertaking…to measure almost 1 million tree rings.”
So you see, the U of A can produce quality tree-ring results after all, so long Michael Mann doesn’t get his littler fingers into them. Thanks to Daniel Griffin and his team for this effort and these very interesting findings. I’d like to see how the precipitation patterns match up with solar activity.

"Although the results of climate research have been consistent for decades, climate scientists have struggled to convey the gravity of the situation to laypeople outside their field. If anything, the wider public only recently seems to have awakened to the threat of the climate crisis. Why? In our new book, Discerning Experts: The Practices of Scientific Assessment for Environmental Policy, we attempted to illuminate how scientists make the judgments they do. In particular, we wanted to know how scientists respond to the pressures, sometimes subtle, sometimes overt, that arise when they know that their conclusions will be disseminated beyond the research community – in short, how scientists are affected when they know the world is watching.  We explored these questions with respect to assessments of acid rain, ozone depletion and sea level rise predictions from the west Antarctic ice sheet. While climate skeptics and deniers often accuse scientists of exaggerating the threats associated with the climate crisis, the available evidence suggests the opposite. By and large, scientists have either been right in their assessments, or have been unduly conservative. We noticed a clear pattern of underestimation of certain key climate indicators, and therefore underestimation of the threat of climate disruption. When new observations of the climate system have provided more or better data, or permitted us to re-evaluate earlier conclusions, the findings for ice extent, sea level rise and ocean temperature have generally been worse than previously thought. One of the factors that appears to contribute to this trend of underestimation is the perceived need for consensus, or what we call “univocality”: the felt need to speak in a single voice. Many scientists worry that if they publicly air their disagreement, government officials will conflate their differences of opinion with ignorance and use this as justification for inaction. Others worry that even if policy-makers want to act, they will find it difficult to do so if scientists fail to send an unambiguous message. Therefore, scientists actively seek to find their common ground, and to focus on those areas of agreement. In some cases, where there are irreconciliable differences of opinion, scientists may say nothing, giving the erroneous impression that nothing is known. How does the pressure for univocality lead to underestimation? Consider a case in which most scientists think that the correct answer to a question is in the range one to 10, but some believe that it could be as high as 100. In this case, everyone will agree that it is at least one to 10, but not everyone will agree that it could be as high as 100. Therefore, the area of agreement is one to 10, and this will be reported as the consensus view. Wherever there is a range of possible outcomes that includes a long, high-end tail of probability, the area of overlap will lie at or near the low end. We are not suggesting that every example of under-estimation is caused by the factors we observed in our work, nor that the demand for consensus always leads to underestimation. But we found that this pattern occurred in all of the cases that we studied. We also found that the institutional aspects of assessment, including who the authors are and how they are chosen, how the substance is divided into chapters, and guidance emphasizing consensus, also generally tilt in favor of scientific conservatism. Knowing this, what do we do? To scientists, we suggest that you should not view consensus as a goal. Consensus is an emergent property, something that may come forth as the result of scientific work, discussion and debate. When that occurs, it is important to articulate the consensus as clearly and specifically as possible. But where there are substantive differences of opinion, they should be acknowledged and the reasons for them explained. Scientific communities should also be open to experimenting with alternative models for making and expressing group judgments, and to learning more about how policy makers actually interpret the findings that result. Such approaches may contribute to assessments being more useful tools as we face the reality of adapting to the climate crisis and the disruptions that will occur. For political leaders and business people, we think it is important for you to know that it is extremely unlikely that scientists are exaggerating the threat of the climate crisis. It is far more likely that things are worse than scientists have said. We have already seen that the impacts of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are unfolding more rapidly than scientists predicted. There is a high likelihood that they will continue to do so, and that the IPCC estimates – that emissions must be rapidly reduced, if not entirely eliminated, by 2050 – may well be optimistic. The fact that this conclusion is hard to swallow does not make it untrue. And for ordinary citizens, it is important to recognize that scientists have done their job. It is now up to us to force our leaders to act upon what we know, before it is too late. Dale Jamieson, Michael Oppenheimer and Naomi Oreskes are authors of Discerning Experts: The Practices of Scientific Assessment for Environmental Policy. This piece is largely excerpted from that book"
"As any reporter knows, there are at least two sides to every story. Covering politics, war, or diplomacy can involve grappling with numerous viewpoints in an attempt to get a version of the truth for your audience. Where journalism crashes into propaganda the truth is often hard to find in the wreckage. Then, perception is everything – and interpretation usually depends on the onlooker’s viewpoint.   Reports in October that Nat West would be closing the UK bank accounts of RT – as the Kremlin-funded international TV channel launched as “Russia Today” now likes to be known – were later clarified, or denied. In this case, the truth was of secondary importance. The Russian authorities – in the shape of their London embassy – swiftly dismissed the incident as an “openly political decision”. The response from the Foreign Ministry in Moscow was menacingly sarcastic: “I wish the BBC Russian service luck. They will need it now, because digging stuff up can be a diverting and unpredictable business,” warned a ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova. Whatever those consequences might be, this looks at first glance like nothing more than the latest ill-tempered episode in relations between Russia and the West. This time the news media – in this case the BBC Russian Service – is being lined up as a future target (I should declare here that I edited its website for a year from 2004-5).  There is more to it than that. In fact, this episode represents a curious kind of victory for RT. Whatever the reason for, or the extent of, the restrictions which have been placed upon RT’s banking facilities, the network has been noticed. For the past decade and a half, Vladimir Putin has striven to restore to Russia some of the international standing it lost with the collapse of the USSR. Media coverage has been an integral part of that effort.    It has been a lengthy process. Russia Today was launched in December 2005. Having lived and worked in Russia for long periods in the 1990s, I returned there in April 2006 as a correspondent for the BBC. Russia Today was taking the first unsteady steps which are a frequent feature of media launches. But even then it was taken seriously in Russia – if not abroad. In informal meetings with Russian officials, they would ask what we, as Westerners, thought of it. Those of us who lived in Russia, and worked in the media, took a professional interest – but Russia Today was not the subject of much curiosity in the wider world. I learnt from a visiting western TV executive, who had been to the channel, that one of Russia Today’s main – albeit modest – audiences then was to be found in Australia, after 11pm. The time slot suggested that people were watching it after coming home from a night out. RT now claims much greater, more engaged, audiences including 70m daily viewers globally and 36m weekly viewers in Europe alone.  When, as with Russia and the West, different nations’ populations have little knowledge of what makes each other tick, journalists become an important link in understanding. That in turn makes them pieces on the chessboard of international relations and confrontations. While the technologies may be new, the idea is not. During World War I, British correspondents in the then capital city, Petrograd (now St Petersburg) signed up to work in “an official British propaganda office” as RH Bruce Lockhart recalled in his 1932 Memoirs of a British Agent. What was different in those days was that their efforts were not designed to undermine Russia but to strengthen the resolve of a troubled ally against the Kaiser.  Later, in the Communist era, the bulwarks of Soviet propaganda – among them TASS and Radio Moscow – spread the word of Marxism-Leninism both internally and externally. Inside the Soviet Union, populations starved of other sources of information inevitably had their views shaped by these tightly controlled state organs. But in the post-Soviet era Western-style media flowed over the ruins of the Iron Curtain along with much else.    In the 2000s, Russia even hired western PR agencies, but their best efforts could not stop the country’s image suffering when it was seen by many as the aggressor in the 2008 war with Georgia. Russia Today’s different message had little impact on what the world thought.   Military shortcomings from that conflict were addressed for future campaigns – and, meanwhile, Russia was also learning media lessons. Budgets for the Kremlin’s international news outlets subsequently rocketed, Russia Today became “RT” – its national affiliation no longer emphasised. “Question more”, the network’s motto, played to audiences wanting something different. The channel, which had been conceived along exactly the same lines as BBC World News or CNN, now challenged those organisations’ version of events. Russia has also proved proficient at harnessing western social media platforms to challenge and confuse western narratives.    Is this a media conflict in the context of a “new Cold War”? Not really. In the Cold War, the USSR was selling a message of international socialism. Now Moscow is offering a mixture of Russian nationalism, and anti-Americanism. It may not be much in comparison, but – as the RT bank story shows – it has got them what they wanted. It has got them noticed."
"The impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff, coup or not, represents a fundamental realigning of modern Brazil. For some in the country, the crisis is an opportunity. These politicians and businessmen are now exploiting the upheaval to roll-back environmental laws and get their hands on the vast natural resources found in protected regions of the Amazon. The new government led by Michel Temer faces a budget deficit of 10%, an unemployment rate of 10.9% and strong calls for austerity. It looks set to terminate a number of successful social policies, and proposes to weaken worker rights by redefining slavery to exclude “degrading conditions” and “exhausting shifts”. Nonetheless, Temer will want to maintain Brazil’s international brand of a nation committed to the environment. After all, climate change was put centre stage at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics and a clear message was beamed into billions of homes across the planet: Brazil is green.  Yet these environmental credentials are questionable. Under president Dilma Rousseff and her predecessor, Lula, deforestation returned, large-scale mining and agriculture was expanded, and more dams were built. Temer has appointed a number of environmentalist politicians to prominent positions such as the Green Party’s José Sarney Filho, now environment minister, and José Serra, the foreign minister. But economic rejuvenation at all costs will inevitably overshadow policies aimed at conservation. Earlier this year, Temer published a document titled “A bridge to the future”, which outlined his plans for the future of Brazil and its economy. The environment, the Amazon and climate change were not mentioned.  In particular, campaigners fear the new, pro-business government will fast-track dams, mines and other damaging schemes by weakening environmental impact assessments. A proposed bill, if passed, would allow for infrastructure projects to continue regardless of potential impacts on the environment and indigenous lands. This opens the door for accelerated environmental damage in the name of economic recovery and growth.  Though activists cheered the recent cancellation of a $10 billion hydroelectric dam on environmental grounds, it seems such celebrations may prove to be premature. A key figure behind this bill is senator Blairo Maggi, Brazil’s soybean king and a former recipient of Greenpeace’s Golden Chainsaw awarded to the “person who most contributed to Amazon destruction”. Temer has recently appointed him Minister of Agriculture.  Maggi is a prominent member of the Agricultural Parliamentary Front (or ruralistas) that have long argued for land reform so that protected forests can be chopped down for crops, cattle and mining, with the products sold abroad. As of 2014, 28.4% of protected areas in the Amazon were of interest to mining companies. These lands – protected by concerns for both the environment and indigenous communities – will likely witness further encroachment under Temer’s government. In recent months, this increasingly strong lobby has submitted a list of demands to President Temer, including land reform and increased subsidies for agriculture. Over lunch with the ruralistas, Temer seemingly committed to exploring these demands. In one of her last acts as president, the Guardian reports, Rousseff supported indigenous land claims and acknowledged a number of quilombolos (lands occupied by the descendants of runaway slaves). Under Temer, policies like these are now under review.  The ruralistas also want to transfer responsibility for land demarcation from the executive to the legislature, where they dominate. The bill proposing this change was first drawn up in 2000 and is now back on the agenda after years in the doldrums. If passed, it would likely sound a death knell for future territory protection. These “land reform” schemes largely focus on the Amazon rainforest, where deforestation will likely continue thanks to lucrative opportunities in agriculture and mining. Tighter government budgets will also mean less money for those charged with keeping illegal loggers and miners out of protected areas. In a nation where 50 environmental defenders were murdered in 2015 – the most in the world – resistance will likely result in violence. A silver lining can be found in Brazil taking steps towards ratifying the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Yet, with the Brazilian economy in its worst slump for decades, a bitter medicine remains likely.  Senator Roberto Requião, who voted against impeachment proceedings, urged the new government to “Get yourselves into the trenches … conflict will be inevitable.” The danger, as it so often is in times of recession, is that the environment will be the new Brazil’s battlefield, and its forgotten first victim."
"“The river is so hungry,” says Peramin Ishak, as he gestures to a missing arc of land from the muddy embankment. “It just keeps eating the land.” From his village of Datina Khali, which rests on the edge of the Bangladeshi Sundarbans, Ishak has watched the river swallow up a three hectare (seven acre) chunk of land in the past decade. Stretching across south-western Bangladesh and into neighbouring India, the Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, a honeycomb of islands and tributaries that eventually fan out into the Bay of Bengal. It may be one of the most beautiful places on earth, but the families eking out a living in its waters are buffeted by one problem after another. Here, on the frontline of the climate crisis, rising sea levels claim more and more land each year. Salt infiltrates the drinking water, and imbues the vegetables with a sharp tang. Increasing salinity almost wiped out the local shrimp industry back in the mid-90s, and these days many local fishermen have switched from collecting shrimp to hunting the more climatically resilient mud crab. But even as they adapt, locals remain extremely vulnerable. Mud crabs are becoming increasingly scarce, and as farmers venture into the mangrove forest to collect them, they are falling prey to gangs of pirates who kidnap them for ransom, forcing their families into debt. Loan sharks have spotted the opportunity and are now preying on the villagers too. Somehow they are surviving, but many are looking for a way out. Around Datina Khali, the aquaculture industry dominates the landscape, with sleepy villages surrounded by an earthen patchwork of shrimp ponds and soft-shell crab farms. In the stifling early morning heat, Shuvendro Nath Mistry is surveying his two hectare shrimp farm, as a group of women knee-deep in water pull weeds from his ponds. “The shrimp haven’t grown well this year. In this hot weather it is harder for them to grow,” admits Mistry, his arms crossed over his bare chest. “If the salinity increases the shrimp will not die, but production will decrease. But if the heat increases, the shrimp will die.” Today the crippling temperatures are one of the shrimp farmers’ biggest concerns. Mistry is all too aware of the precarious situation of his trade, and watchful for the next problem that could bring the industry to its knees – as happened 20 years ago, when white spot disease spread through the farms, brought on by the increased levels of salt. During the crisis, farmers noticed that mud crabs were naturally invading the decimated shrimp ponds, and seized the opportunity for some marginal returns. As a result, some deserted their old stocks and switched to crab cultivation instead. Although still nascent and smaller than the now recovered shrimp industry, Bangladesh’s crab production has proved a success story. With rising international demand from countries such as China, Singapore and Malaysia, the export of mud crab from the south Asian nation reached $24m (£19m) in 2015–16. Now the area’s aquaculture is divided between shrimp and soft-shell crab farming, and collecting wild mud crabs from the Sundarbans for export, or to be fattened up in local farms. Yet the irony is that amid a shift to a more climatically resilient industry, those on its frontline, the fishermen who venture into the mangrove forest, find themselves more and more at risk. For years, small pirate gangs have roamed the watery capillaries of the Sundarbans, hiding out in the dense forest as they stake out fishermen to kidnap and hold for ransom. There are a few horror stories – of fishermen being severely beaten, or having their Achilles tendons sliced – but for the most part the piratical target is financial. As soon as they capture a victim, the pirates head for areas within the forest known for the best cell reception, sometimes climbing trees for a clear line, so they can call a terrified victim’s family to demand a ransom via electronic transfer. So organised are some they even have their own business cards. “It’s so stressful when the men get kidnapped,” exclaims Shefali Bibi, a pickle maker and fisherman’s wife from Datina Khali, dressed in a bright yellow and purple sari. “Those are the worst days. I can’t eat, or sleep or bathe.” In the past decade, pirates have twice kidnapped her husband and held him for ransom, each time causing immense financial strain. Of about 1,600 fishermen and crab collectors in Datina Khali, almost all have been kidnapped once – others up to four or five times. To address the rampant banditry, the government has in recent years launched a huge crackdown, offering pirates lucrative sums to surrender. Roughly 29 pirate groups brandishing more than 400 firearms have given themselves up since 2015, with the last batch reportedly surrendering in November 2018, when the Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, declared the Unesco-listed Sundarbans “pirate free”. But while the situation is significantly better, local fishermen say there are at least three pirate gangs still operating, with kidnappings occurring up to once a week. “There are fewer pirate groups now, but the situation is unchanged. If they find us we still have to pay them,” says 32-year-old Moniral Islam Gazi, a crab collector who was captured this April. “I am not really scared of being caught because I have faced it a lot, but I am scared about where to find the money.” If pirates capture them as they eke out a meagre existence collecting mud crabs and wild honey, they are quickly plunged into vicious cycles of debt. Back in the village, when a family member receives a ransom call they are thrust into a state of panic. Most have little, if any, savings. With payments ranging anywhere from 20,000 to 250,000 Bangladeshi taka (£182 – £2,270), many are forced to take loans. Of almost half a dozen crab collectors interviewed, all but one had a loan. Many had multiple loans, from local businessmen, village loan sharks and microcredit agencies. “Sometimes they need a loan just to pay for their forest permit and supplies,” explains Srikander Ali, a local crab broker at the nearby Katakhali fish market, who reckons the kidnappings still occur between eight and 10 times a month. “I also give them loans for the ransoms. If they get caught it affects my business too,” he says, glancing at baskets of wriggling mud crab stacked against the wall, soon to be trucked to Dhaka for live export. “I estimate that about 80% are in a pretty bad financial position.” Sitting opposite her husband in their canoe, as he gently scoops up his line from the khaki waters, Henna Bibi is pragmatic about her choices. “There are a lot of fear factors in the forest,” she says. “But if we get scared we won’t be able to raise our children.” For safety, they set out into the forest in numbers. But these days there is also the problem of supply – once bountiful, wild mud crabs are becoming increasingly hard to find. “The number of crabs has dropped noticeably in the last six years,” says Muhammad Didar Boxfaksis, 65. “On a good day, we can get 5–7kg, but 15 years ago it was double that.” “We used to throw the smaller crabs back,” agrees his neighbour, Sobed Ali. “Now, we take everything we can find.” Mojibar Rahman, who is researching a PhD on crab cultivation at the Bangladesh Agricultural University, says the shortage is likely to result from over-collection. To make the industry more sustainable, the government needs to invest in mud-crab hatcheries, he suggests, instead of being almost entirely reliant on wild stocks. “The crab industry is still underdeveloped because of a lack of culture technology and a lack of seeds [baby crabs],” he explains, adding that some farmers have also shied away from crab cultivation because, in the Muslim-majority nation, crabs are viewed as haram (forbidden). With the myriad challenges before them, some local fishermen are looking for a way out. Many of the younger men have already left, seeking work in urban brick factories. The older fishermen claim that if it weren’t for the pirates they would make more than enough, but Sobed Ali is tired of waiting, and luckily has a small amount of money to invest in adapting his business. “The money I make, I don’t end up using it myself, it ends up as pirate bail,” says the exasperated father of three. “It makes my life miserable.” With their savings from harvesting crab and selling pickles, and a loan from a Japanese trading company, Ali and his wife have converted a piece of land they own in the village into a small soft-shell crab farm. “I have to secure my children’s future, so that’s why I am starting the soft-shell crab farming,” says Ali, as he hammers together an adjacent shelter in the fading light. “I don’t want my sons to go into the forest like me. It’s too risky. Hopefully, if this goes well, I can stop going in too.”"

And before you knew it, scientists were claiming that cold temperatures actually proved global warming.

No warming in sight for Alaska. Temperature anomaly forecast for May 15 – 22. Source: wxmaps.org.
If we look at Alaska over the last few days, then global warming must be galloping out of control. Before you know it, the globe will be covered in ice as it overheats. Hey, that’s global warming science…and there are plenty of dupes and chumps out there to lap it all up.

The online News Miner of Alaska reports on a number of records being set. What follow are some new May 14 records, with the old ones in parentheses:
– Eielson Air Force Base: 22°F (26°F in 1954).
– College Observatory, University of Alaska Fairbanks: 21°F (24°F in 1964).
– Bettles: 11°F (22°F in 1986).
– Galena: 13°F (16°F in 1965).
The News Miner also reports that record low daytime highs were recorded:
Fairbanks also set a new record for the coldest high temperature at the airport Monday with a high temperature of 37 degrees. That broke the record of 40 set in 1937.
Other record low maximum temperature records were reported at Galena (31), Tanana (34) and Eielson Air Force Base (38).
Fairbanks avoided another record cold high temperature Tuesday when the high temperature at the airport hit 40 degrees, surpassing the record of 39 degrees in 1937″
That means sea ice melt will be delayed, thus the sunlight will get reflected back out, and then the albedo catastrophe that the warmists keep bringing up when ice melts will occur in reverse. Oh, I forgot. In climate science these processes are only true in one direction, i.e. warming.

"Today we take for granted an awareness of environmental matters, but this was not always the case. It could be said that in Britain there was a moment when that environmental consciousness arrived. When in 1963 some farm animals in the parish of Smarden in Kent became sick and died, suspicions fell on a nearby pesticide factory run by a division of Rentokil Laboratories. The events that followed amounted to one of the first environmental scandals in contemporary British history – one that would galvanise the environmental movement. It became clear that the factory, a large shed in the middle of farmland, was manufacturing toxic chemicals and that a leak of one of these, fluoroacetamide, led to Britain’s first documented livestock mass poisoning. The incident might have passed by as only a historical footnote, but instead the Smarden leak quickly became a national concern with international implications, and has cast a long shadow across the approach to intensive agriculture in the UK in the years since. Part of why this incident had such major repercussions is due to timing, coming as it did at the same time as American writer Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring was first published in the UK. Seen as the first polemic of the environmental movement, Carson’s book was a significant catalyst to the emergence of modern environmentalism on both sides of the Atlantic. Local veterinarian Douglas Good had unique knowledge of fluoride poisoning having worked with a leading expert in South Africa and on cases of animals affected by industrial fluoride poisoning in England. Taking his cue from Carson, Good disseminated what he called a “short story” about the incident to the press, putting across the Smarden incident as not simply a local industrial waste spill, but as deadly evidence of the pervasiveness of toxic pesticides in the environment. Acknowledging his inspiration, Good concluded his narrative by declaring that the “subject of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring had become a reality here in the heart of the Garden of England”. The media placed the Smarden incident within a Carson-inspired ecological critique of the dangers of an intensive, industrial approach to agriculture. Good, like Carson, was a trained scientist. Like her, he raised concerns about technocracy – governmental administration underpinned by scientific and technological expertise. As the Smarden incident unfolded, it highlighted the risks and hazards which accompanied the government’s commitment to industrial development. Tensions arose between veterinarians, government scientists, local government, media, and business interests. While the use of inorganic poisons as pesticides stretches back to antiquity, large-scale use of organic pesticides is a 20th-century phenomenon. Fluoroacetamide is a toxic organic pesticide with nefarious origins.  The two world wars fostered a massive growth of the chemical industry, and fluoroacetamide was a pesticide that arose from the search for lethal chemical weapons. After the war it was approved for use as a poison for use against rodents and insects – it was not uncommon for the science, technology, institutions, and language of chemical warfare to be redirected to the problem of agricultural pest control during peacetime. But by the time of the Smarden incident in the early 1960s, the origin of these chemicals was seen as damning evidence of the perniciousness of the military-industrial complex and its impact on the environment. Another case of fluoroacetamide poisonings, in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, came to light in September 1963, in which contaminated pet food resulted in the death of 75 to 100 dogs and cats – effectively shifting fears from remote farmers’ fields into people’s homes. When the cows, dogs and guinea pigs used as subjects to test the extent of the environmental damage died, those fears grew. The government was consistently reluctant to inform the public about the strong circumstantial evidence of fluoroactemide poisoning. Declaring it a one-off industrial accident, the government avoided discussion of the actual widespread use of these chemicals as pesticides. But the death of further animals and a suspected case of human poisoning forced the government’s hand: on February 7, 1964, fluoroacetamide was banned as an insecticide. The government announced that 1,800 tonnes of polluted soil from the factory site would be removed and dumped at sea. Even so, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food did not permit farmers to use land around the site of the spill until March 1965, when government scientists found no traces of fluoroacetamide. Much like persistent pesticides, the Smarden incident lingered in people’s memories as a cautionary tale about science, government, and the industrialisation of agriculture. These memories resurfaced when in 1985 farmers at Smarden discovered the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Kent and a number of further cases followed. Twelve years later, a perceived cluster of cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in the Smarden area led to speculation that this human form of BSE was caused by excessive exposure to pesticides. Reports in the press suggested that the residents of Smarden suspected the incident had been some sort of government-controlled experiment and subsequent cover-up which had produced BSE. While vCJD was subsequently tied to the practice of feeding cows meal containing infected cows’ meat, bone and brain matter, these environmental controversies ultimately made disputes among experts publicly visible, and this caused a significant change in the public’s perceptions of science. Smarden and its legacy drove the emergence of modern environmentalism in Britain, through a confluence of a concern for public health and animal welfare, the desire to conserve the countryside, and an emergent ecological approach – such as advanced by the Soil Association, founded in 1946. It also revealed the tension caused by conflicts between what we would now call environmentalism and scientific expertise in a modern world that now routinely deploys potentially life and planet-threatening technology. New activist movements have helped make contested expertise publicly visible, and this has contributed to an erosion of trust in traditional professions and in public authorities."

"The London plane tree, a divisive staple of many Australian city streetscapes, will be gradually removed from Melbourne’s central business district and replaced with species resistant to climate change such as Moreton Bay figs, jacarandas and sweet gums. London plane trees make up 70% of the tree population in Melbourne’s inner city. While admired by some for their hardiness and environmental benefits such as providing extensive cooling and shade, the trees are also unpopular for shedding leaf and shoot hairs, known as trichomes, during the same period that grass pollen levels are at their highest.  It means the trees are also blamed for causing hay fever and allergic reactions, even though the most common cause of hay fever is grass pollen and there is limited evidence that plane trees cause allergies. However, the fine hairs are renowned for making people cough and for irritating skin. A University of Melbourne botanist, Ed Newbigin, who heads the Melbourne pollen count, said “lots of people hate plane trees”. “They certainly do. But they’re not going to cause anaphylaxis,” he said. “You’d have to bury yourself in them for that. They’re more of an irritation to the eyes and skin, and they’re also a bit messy. You’ll be sitting outside of a cafe on a sidewalk and suddenly you’ll have bits of plane tree blow into your coffee.” To Newbigin, however, “they’re a beautiful tree”. “They have an open canopy, they take surgery well so you can get them to grow around power lines, so they do a lot of things that are good for cities and they do make cities cooler on a hot day.” The acting lord mayor, Arron Wood, said the main reason the trees were being replaced was that many were planted in the 1980s and 1990s when they replaced poorly performing ash trees and some elms and paperbarks. But the trees were now in poor health and needed to be removed, he said. “The plane trees in Swanston Street form a consistent and relatively healthy avenue, but where plane trees in other parts of the city need to be removed we are taking opportunities to replace them with different tree species,” he said. Along the Russell Street median strip the trees are being replaced with spotted gums, while along Exhibition Street they have been replaced with camphor laurels. Port Jackson figs have replaced them along Lonsdale Street, while liquidamber, lemon-scented gums and red ironbarks are being planted along Southbank Boulevard. This was also being done to increase tree diversity, the council said in a statement. The director of respiratory medicine, allergy and clinical immunology research at Monash University, Prof Robyn O’Hehir, said the fine particles from plane trees could cause throat irritation and laryngospasm – a spasm of the vocal cords – even in people who are not prone to allergies. “I warn patients to wear wraparound sunglasses and avoid prominent plane tree areas such as street cafes in Carlton in August and September when they are most problematic,” she said. “People often need water or a mouthful of bread to clear the fine particles from their throats.”"

Renewable energy website Recharge here writes that the “Highland Council planners shot down three high-profile projects totalling nearly 80 turbines in a two-day rout for developers”. It’s good to see there is still some environmental sanity left on the planet.
According to the press release at the Mountaineering Council of Scotland website (Feb 12):
The MCofS welcomed the news today that The Highland Council North Planning Committee decided to reject 2 massive onshore wind farm planning proposals.
The section 36 proposals which were determined today are:
· Glemorie Wind Farm: to the north of Dingwall with a proposed 34 turbines and 35 kilometres of access track. The MCofS originally objected to the proposal because it contravenes The Highland Council’s own policy on onshore wind farm locations.
· Dalnessie Wind Farm: 13 km North East of Lairg comprising 27 wind turbines and associated infrastructure, including 20 km of new access track. Each turbine would be up to 121 metres high to blade tip. The MCofS originally objected to the development because it would not be in accordance with the Highland Council’s Development Plan
David Gibson, MCofS Chief Officer stated:

‘We objected to these industrial-scale proposals on the grounds that they were inappropriate developments which contravened Highland Council planning policy; they would have a significant visual impact on the mountains and other wild land, and adversely affect a broad swathe of Scotland’s finest landscapes.’
‘We believe that members of the Planning Committee have acted in the best interests of their constituents, and in the broader public interest, as custodians of some unique and very special landscapes. However, we still fail to understand why Highland Council planning officials originally recommended that the Council should ‘raise no objection’ to Glenmorie and Dalnessie given their own policy and the obvious and intrusive impact on recognised and designated landscape areas.’
‘The MCofS is not opposed to onshore wind farms and we have objected to only 6% of the onshore developments tracked by Scottish Natural Heritage.’
‘We seek protection for the mountains through changes to Scottish Government planning policy. We have called repeatedly for the introduction of a national spatial planning policy for onshore wind farm developments which would give protection to precious mountain landscapes and at the same time offer developers guidance on where wind farms could be located.’
‘The present planning free-for-all, which encourages inappropriate and speculative developments, and in which the Scottish Government is placing unreasonable pressure on local authorities to process and approve developments, is not a recipe for success. The Scottish Government, despite their repeated and empty assurances that such protection exists, must act to provide protection for our superb landscapes. Given this is the Year of Natural Scotland, we believe that is the minimum they should do.’”
This is a refreshing development that hopefully will spread to other regions of the planet. Blasting mountain ridge lines and gouging miles of access roads though forests and landscape in order to soothe environmental paranoia and alleviate irrational fears of a climate catastrophe is environmental lunacy of an unprecedented scale. Unfortunately, places like Vermont have become psychological basket cases in that respect.
Germany has hardly been immune to the insanity. It’s 130 billion in renewable energy investment will theoretically postpone global warming a whole 23 hours, read here. At that rate it would cost the world $4,745,000,000,000,000.00 (4.745 quadrillion) to delay global warming 100 years, provided the dubious theory were true. That’s a million dollars for every family on the planet (if I didn’t lose or gain any zeros in that big number calculation).
It’s truly mind-boggling how easily some people can get carried away by madness. When a few dumb cows start running, the whole herd often follows.
Hats off to Scotland. Maybe I’ll break open that bottle of Doublewood Balvenie I got for Christmas and give a toast.

"A Democratic lawmaker has called on Google CEO Sundar Pichai to stop investing in organizations that deny the existence of the climate crisis, saying it was hard to overstate how detrimental the impact of such groups had been on the US climate debate. Kathy Castor’s letter to Pichai followed a report in the Guardian last week that revealed Google had made “substantial” contributions to some of the most notorious climate deniers in Washington, despite the internet giant’s insistence it supports political action to combat the crisis.  The groups included the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which has actively sought to roll back Obama-era environmental protections and helped convince Donald Trump, the US president, to abandon the Paris Agreement. Google has said it supported the climate accord, but continued to offer financial backing to CEI and similarly-minded groups. “It is hard to overstate the detrimental impact groups like CEI have had on the climate debate in the United States since the early days of the Kyoto Protocol,” Castor, a Democratic representative from Florida, said. “Because of their public and behind-the-scenes efforts to obfuscate and obstruct, we have lost critical time to cut greenhouse gas pollution and now face a shrinking window of opportunity to avert the worst impacts of climate change.” Google has said that its support for CEI and other groups, including the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, reflected support for the groups’ “strong technology policies”, and not their stance on the climate crisis. “We’ve been extremely clear that Google’s sponsorship doesn’t mean that we endorse that organization’s entire agenda – we may disagree strongly on some issues,” a Google spokesperson told the Guardian about its donations. But in her letter to Pichai, Castor, who is chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, said there was no way to distinguish their support from other issues. “It is impossible to separate your support for one sliver of CEI from the whole. Your financial contributions support the organization’s infrastructure, augment its political influence, and, in turn, legitimize all of its activities – not just the ones you like,” she wrote. Google declined to offer new comment on the letter, and referred to previous statements on the issue. Castor closed her letter by pointing to Google’s own website, and its declaration that the company was striving to “build sustainability into everything we do”. “I urge you to apply this mantra when you make decisions about which thinktanks and organizations to support in the future,” she said. It was not the only public response to the Guardian’s report last week, which was part of a broader investigation into the fossil fuel industry, the structures behind it, and the climate emergency. Activists with Extinction Rebellion staged a protest in front of Google’s London headquarters on Wednesday, with more than 100 mothers – and babies – staging a “nurse-in” to protest the company’s funding of climate deniers."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s version of David Viner is Prof. Mojib Latif (photo left) of the IFM-GEOMAR, Kiel, and the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences.
Back in the year 2000, after Viner had gotten widespread publicity for his comments, Latif got in on the media act and told Spiegel just days later: “Winters with hard frost and lots of snow like those we saw 20 years ago will no longer be seen at our latitudes.”
Now, 13 years later, we see just the opposite is happening. Germany has now had 5 relatively harsh winters in a row (2012-13 incl.). And if that trend continues, things could get a lot worse. The trend of colder winters is also confirmed by a new study of the Swiss Alps, which I reported on 2 days ago.

Germany DJF winter temperature in a nosedive over the last 13 years. Chart based on data from the German Weather Service (DWD). Chart by Josef Kowatsch.
The polynomial curve in the chart above peaked at about the year 1999. Since Latif opened his mouth, temperatures have plummeted, falling more than 1°C.  Of course critics will point out that 13 years are not enough to establish a long-term trend. That’s true – to some extent. Strangely, that criticism would be absent had the trend gone the other way. In fact just a single snowstorm is now claimed as global warming evidence nowadays.
Let’s look at Germany’s winter linear temperature trend (DJF) for the last 25 years:

Germany’s winter temperatures over the last 25 years are dropping at a rate of 6°C per century! Chart source: Josef Kowatsch, based on DWD data.

Like the Swiss Alps, and the rest of the planet, a clear cooling trend is plain to see. Latif needs to modify his prediction of 13 years ago to: “Winters with hard frost and lots of snow like those we saw 20 years ago will happen more often at our latitudes.”
Next is a chart showing Germany’s temperature since 1890. In this chart Kowatsch has added in the UHI effect.

Germany’s 100-year winter temperature trends with and without UHI. Chart source: Josef Kowatsch.
The above chart shows the DWD annual temperature with trend line, which clearly shows a warming trend of about 1°C per century. But when the UHI effect is taken into account, we see there has not been any warming at all over the last 120 years. The polynomial curve oscillates about the 8°C line. Indeed German temperatures today are at the same level as 1980, and even slightly lower than 100 years ago.
True Germany is just a spot on the globe, and conclusions on global trends cannot be made from its data. But the trend in Germany agrees with the recent measured global trends and those in Central Europe.
One final note: Latif made his 2000 prediction on April 1st. How many millions of fools fell for it?

"The mountain chicken frog managed the dubious honour of being at one time both the national dish and a top predator on the Caribbean island of Dominica. Down the centuries overhunting, volcanic eruptions and introduced predators have taken their toll on this, one of the world’s largest frogs. But in recent years the species has been brought to the brink of extinction by a newer, more serious threat described as “the worst infectious disease ever recorded among vertebrates”, chytridiomycosis (chytrid). In susceptible species, the chytrid fungus causes thickening of the skin on which many amphibians rely for gas, salt and water absorption. This eventually leads to heart attack and death. While this sounds particularly unpleasant, the most alarming thing about the disease is the speed with which it can drive entire species into decline. You might assume that we have years to prevent the decline of endangered animals as they slowly drift towards extinction. But our research into the mountain chicken frog’s tragic story should serve as a warning about the need to act fast. Mountain chickens were first observed dying of chytrid on Dominica in 2002. Within 18 months, the disease had driven a population decline of 85%. Despite a number of local campaigns, no wild mountain chickens were seen on the island between 2006 and 2010.  Fearing for the future of the species, conservationists’ attention then moved to the only other remaining population of mountain chickens in the world, on 
the nearby Caribbean island of Montserrat. Tree frogs that carry the chytrid fungus are known to stow away in regular fruit shipments from Dominica to Montserrat, so it was only a matter of time before the disease arrived in the Montserrat population. Sure enough, seven years after it was first observed on Dominica, chytrid was observed in Montserrat’s mountain chickens and the population was driven to near extinction within only 18 months. This marks the mountain chicken decline as one of the fastest observed collapses of any species ever recorded. From the thousands that lived on both islands before the arrival of the disease, there are now thought to be only two mountain chickens on Montserrat and about 100 on Dominica. This desperate situation required action. Thankfully for the mountain chicken, a group of British and European conservation scientists joined forces with the governments of Dominica and Montserrat to form the Mountain Chicken Recovery Programme (MCRP). An eleventh-hour evacuation of 50 mountain chickens from Montserrat by the MCRP was successful in establishing a captive population in European Zoos. Frogs in these zoos have since successfully bred, ensuring that the species will not go extinct. At least for now. The MCRP aims to save the mountain chicken from extinction, restoring the species to its historic range and increasing its resilience to future threats. But this is no easy task. The chytrid fungus persists in other amphibian species that appear unaffected and share the forests with the mountain chicken. In order to manage the risk posed by chytrid and conserve the mountain chicken, the MCRP is trialling multiple novel conservation tools. It hopes these measures can not only save the mountain chicken, but also contribute to the conservation of the hundreds of other species impacted by this disease. These measures include the world’s first reported use of an anti-fungal drug in the field, following its successful use in captivity. Several years after the decline, the MCRP also began reintroductions of the mountain chicken to Montserrat, using individuals bred in the European Zoos. Four reintroductions have been carried out so far and analysis is ongoing to measure how successful they have been and how they can be modified to improve their chances of survival. While these actions are important in preventing species already affected by the disease from going extinct, the most effective protection for other animals would be to stop chytrid spreading in the first place. But even when we are able to predict the arrival of the disease, as on Montserrat, we often have insufficient resources and capacity to stop it. Without action, amphibian-rich countries such as Sri Lanka – where chytrid is yet to arrive – could suffer a similar fate with catastrophic levels of species loss. If we are to successfully prevent the extinction of further species, we must find ways of developing conservation capacity in those places where amphibians are most at risk."

The UN has asked people around the world for their top priorities. With 625,000 votes, climate is at the very bottom.
Not surprisingly, education, health care and corruption-free governments rank at the top, along with jobs, water and food. (People who would focus on food and water first are probably not on-line.)
Immediate environmental concerns for rivers and forests rank in the middle, whereas climate comes in at the last position.
This seems not only to follow quite closely the rankings in the Copenhagen Consensus, but also to make simple sense. If your kids are dying from easily curable diseases, have no food, or no jobs, your main concern is not a 2.6℃ temperature rise by the end of the century. If you have enough resources to worry about the environment at all, you worry about immediate concerns like air and water pollution.
It is only in rich countries (with high HDI) where climate comes in much higher, and yet still only at number 8 of 16.
I’m right now in Sweden, where my demographic group have put climate at the very top as #1. That only makes sense, when you have ample food and health care, a well-functioning government and a clean environment.
Go ahead and tell the UN which priorities *you* think the world should focus on:

"Police have banned Extinction Rebellion protests from continuing anywhere in London, as they moved in almost without warning to clear protesters who remained at the movement’s camp in Trafalgar Square. The Metropolitan police issued a revised section 14 order on Monday night that said “any assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion ‘Autumn Uprising’ ... must now cease their protests within London (MPS and City of London Police Areas)” by 9pm. Almost immediately, officers moved into Trafalgar Square and demanded that protesters remove their tents. Most XR activists staying at the site had already decamped to Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, south of the river, and only a few dozen tents, along with gazebos and other infrastructure, remained on the square. More than 1,400 people have been arrested during eight days of XR action, with the threat that anyone defying police orders would be detained. Until Monday night, Trafalgar Square had been specified by the Met as the only legitimate protest site and officers had been telling protesters to go to the square if they wanted to continue protesting. Howard Rees, an XR spokesman who was at the scene, told the Guardian that police started clearing Trafalgar Square before even issuing the revised order to protesters. “They gave us the notification: ‘We have started clearing the square’,” Rees said. “It’s all peaceful. People for the most part are being given the opportunity to move their possessions. But obviously there are a lot of people who have had stuff here who are not actually on site, hence the marquees are full of people’s gear and other people are trying to get it to safety. The police are for the most part watching over that operation.” On Twitter, the London branch of XR wrote: “Police are clearing peaceful protest in Trafalgar & Vauxhall. They are back-tracking on promises made &, MEPs say, in contravention of UK law, in the national square. This is an emergency, and an outrage. The police must respect the law. This is a democracy.” Kevin Blowe, the coordinator of the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol), said the order effectively amounted to a ban on XR without going through the due process that would usually be required. “A ban has to be made by the home secretary,” he said. “Our reading of it is that the section 14 powers are supposed to be used with caution because people still have a right to protest and potentially this is unlawful, and there is no other way to put it. Take a look at what section 14 says: it’s about restricting a number of people for a particular duration of time. My feeling is that this has to be open to some form of potential legal challenge.” Scotland Yard said activists were told to cease their protests by 9pm on Monday or face arrest. Deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said: “These conditions have been imposed due to the continued breaches of the section 14 condition previously implemented and ongoing serious disruption to the community. “We have made significant progress in managing Extinction Rebellion’s activity at sites across central London over this past week. Officers have begun the process of clearing Trafalgar Square and getting things back to normal.” A few XR activists locked themselves in place to slow the police operation, Rees said. Specialist police teams were working to cut them free and arrest them. It was unlikely that protesters at Trafalgar Square and their equipment would be taken to the alternative camp in Vauxhall, because that site was considered to be full and its security was uncertain as it remained subject to the section 14, Rees said. He added: “The concern would now be that essentially the police have gone back on their word about us being allowed to stay here, so will Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens be next?” It came after a day in which scores of protesters were arrested for blocking traffic outside the Bank of England, including a 77-year-old rabbi who was dragged away by officers after refusing to comply with a police order to leave the area. Hundreds of demonstrators walked into the road outside the Bank of England in the City and sat down early on Monday morning. The group said: “Extinction Rebellion this morning are disrupting the system bankrolling the environmental crisis. The day of disruption, which will target financial institutions, seeks to highlight the far greater disruption faced by those living in the environments systematically being destroyed by UK-backed companies. “The ecological damage is global and it is hitting the global south now.” Protesters said they were switching their focus to the financial institutions “funding environmental destruction”."
"Towns and villages along the east coast of England were put on red alert on Friday 13 January. A combination of strong winds and high tides led to fears a “storm surge” would wash over flood defences, and residents of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk and Jaywick, in Essex, were among those ordered to evacuate.  In the end, the worst was avoided. The winds, tides and waves didn’t quite combine to cause serious flooding, and people have returned home. But this was not the first time the region had been threatened with inundation, and the flood defences that held firm in 2017 were largely built in response to a previous, more deadly, storm surge. The worst natural disaster in modern British history occurred on the night of January 31, 1953. A tidal surge caused the North Sea to rise up to five metres above its average level, which led to widespread flooding along the east coast of Britain, particularly south of Yorkshire. Some 30,000 people were evacuated, 1,000 square kilometres of land was inundated, and 307 people in England and 19 people in Scotland died. The death toll was particularly bad on Canvey Island in the Thames Estuary.  In the low-lying Netherlands the consequences were much greater – more than 1,800 deaths. Soon after, the Dutch began to construct their huge and very costly system of flood defences. The response in Britain was less decisive. Former chancellor and home secretary Viscount Waverley oversaw an inquiry, publishing a very effective report later that year. Waverley sought expert opinion on how best to renew flood defences and his recommendations included the creation of a new early warning system, quickly established, and the construction of a retractable barrier to protect London. The long political machinations that eventually led to the passage of the 1972 Thames Barrier Act are fascinating in themselves, but what is more immediately arresting is the explanation Waverley offered for the tidal surge itself. For the first time, Waverley’s report made climate change a concern of government. Waverley explained that the flooding was caused by a combination of factors. Strong northerly winds coming in off the Atlantic coincided with a relatively high tide, thereby forcing an unusually large quantity of water down the narrowing north-south axis of the North Sea to the bottleneck at the Straits of Dover. The rotation of the earth ensured that the water was deflected to the west of the tidal currents, thereby hitting the east coast of Britain. A significant quantity of excess water was forced up the Thames Estuary, threatening to spill over London’s flood defences.  Waverley was at pains to point out that the high tide and the surge were distinct phenomena. Had the surge occurred at low tide, its effect would have been little noticed. Also, inland rainfall had been below average. Had east coast rivers been at their strongest, the destruction caused by the tidal surge would have been much greater, causing significant loss of life and damage to the capital’s infrastructure. Indeed, the risk to the London Underground conditioned much of the debate that followed. The data presented to Waverley suggested that floods like January 1953 were becoming more frequent and that the combination of factors that produced them were likely to happen more often. There were three reasons for this. First, water levels were rising. By the 1950s scientists had known for a generation or so that the climate had been warming for a century, and that this was causing glaciers to melt. Second, the phenomenon of tilt: the north-west and north of England was gradually rising and the south-east was gradually sinking – or downwarping – a notion that had some popular traction, especially in East Anglia. Downwarping compounded the effect of higher water levels and was also caused by climate change. At the end of the last ice age, glaciation had reached as far south as the line from the Bristol Channel to the Wash. With the weight of ice no longer acting on northern Britain, a gradual correction was taking place – and continues to.  Third, was the idea that changing weather patterns made tidal surges more likely. Sou’westerlies dominated the weather patterns of the region, but strong northerlies were becoming more prevalent, possibly as part of a 200-year cycle. For all these reasons the east coast, and London particularly, faced an increasing threat from the North Sea. Thanks to Waverley, this thinking held sway in Whitehall in the decades that followed, shaping the tortuous process that led to the construction of the Thames Barrier. But if climate change was understood to be a factor in the growing threat to the east coast, there was little suggestion that any of it was caused by human activities. Instead, scientists pointed to the shift in and out of ice ages that occurs naturally over many thousands of years. Climate change, considered a force of nature, had yet to be politicised, even as it became a factor in policy making. The threat climate change poses a given population depends as much on the capacity of the state to build adequate defences as it does on geographical good fortune. The debate of the 1950s and 60s also throws into sharp relief how politically significant anthropogenic notions of climate change have become.  Then, it was a question of defending vulnerable people and infrastructure against apparently natural phenomena, now the question of causation has hugely complicated and politicised possible government responses. This raises profound questions about environmental justice at both a national and global level. As the terrible flood of 1953 and recent events throughout the world have shown, it is poor, marginal people who drown in floods, whether in Britain or elsewhere."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSebastian Lüning’s and Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne presents an interesting view on permafrost from Russia. I’ve added some extra quotes from the video for non-German readers.

After widespread sea ice melt in the Arctic in the 1930s and 40s, the ice re-established itself. In the 1970s the temperature dropped and sea ice increased. In the 1970s and 90s at the Hudson Bay and Beaufort Sea, seals suffered under the extensive ice and the population fell dramatically.
In Siberia today the permafrost is supposed to be gradually melting, so we are told. But if you ask local Russian scientists, this cannot be confirmed (see video above).
Russian permafrost expert slaps down AGW
In the video a German journalist travels to Siberia and speaks with Russian permafrost expert Michali Grigoryev on the state of the permafrost (2007). Grigoryev shows the journalist a rare baby mammoth uncovered from the ice, and adds that such finds are becoming more and more frequent today. “Because of climate change”, the journalist asks at the 0:48 mark? Grigoryev answers:
No, you are wrong. The permafrost is not melting. There is no man-made climate change.”
The journalist then quotes the Russian scientist:

Indeed above at the surface it has gotten warmer, but that’s just part of a normal cycle. The permafrost is rock hard, And that is how it is going to stay. There’s no talk of thawing.”
At the 1:24 mark, the scientist says:
The cyclic warming is coming to an end. It is going to get colder soon. The climate depends on the sun and the oceans. Three factors have coincided and have warmed the climate, but in 8 to 15 years, it’s going to be colder again.”
As the clip was made in 2007, that means we have just 3 to 10 years left before the cooling sets in in earnest. We note that there’s been no warming in 15 years and that the signs for cooling are mounting.
In another another study from Siberia, multiple super warm periods were found over the last 2.8 million years. Those were certainly caused by purely natural processes, and not anthropogenic influences.
But let’s look at the more recent 10,000 years, i.e. the current interglacial. A German-Norwegian team led by Juliane Müller of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bermerhaven, Germany, recently discovered that the sea ice cover west of Greenland gradually increased from 8500 to 1000 years before present. Off Eastern Greenland sea ice pretty much remained constant during this period. The study appeared in July 2012 in the Quaternary Science Reviews.
In yet another study by a team led by Funder shows that the Arctic sea ice 8000 years ago was less than half of the minimum we saw in 2007. In the meantime most of the climate models are able to reproduce this lack of ice during the middle of the interglacial (Berger et al 2012, Climate of the Past Discussions). The cause of this warming and the ice melt in this case was the Milankovitch cycles.
Finally, we have the Medieval Warm Period back. Canadian scientists have just discovered that the Northwest Passage had been completely ice-free during the summer, which today is still not the case.

"If we didn’t realise that 2016 was the year of upheaval before November 8, we certainly do now. Brexit, which seemed hard enough to digest, was merely the amuse bouche prior to the red meat of Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election.  Dessert came on December 4, with the constitutional referendum in Italy, which saw off the country’s moderate prime minister, Matteo Renzi. Expect 2017 to bring strong electoral rewards for Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Marine Le Pen in France and the AfD in Germany. There seems to be a global trend – but of what? Wherever we look, the sans-culottes are storming the trendy neighbourhoods of the biens-pensants, but is there a wider pattern?  Broadly speaking, there are two separate attacks on an apparently settled order – one from within, one from without. Neither has a clear agenda, and each is more oppositional than constructive. It is therefore all the more important to understand what they oppose. They are both reactions against a liberal ideal that has been in the ascendant, enabled by technology, which champions society characterised by high connectivity. It’s a vision of a society in which everyone has lots of weak – usually transactional – ties with lots of people across different networks that are easy to pick up and put down. This liberal order rests on a global view that freedom – social and economic –  generates prosperity and tolerance. Who could oppose that? Well, it turns out that plenty of people can. One is a broadly radical group which buys into the liberal vision while resisting details of its implementation. Many of its affiliates in the UK have lined up behind Jeremy Corbyn, who increased his mandate as leader of the Labour Party in 2016. They may also be associated with the Green Party, or the Occupy movement, or Podemos or Syriza, or Bernie Sanders in the US. Their understanding of politics diverges from the 20th-century notion of political action framed by relatively firm ideology and specific institutions (such as political parties and trade unions) working within a well-understood parliamentary or representative framework. Enamoured with neither the framework nor their representatives within it, the radicals see politics as a type of self-expression, while social media orients them towards other individuals and away from institutions. The internet is a key tool: it renders them visible to each other and makes political action at scale simpler to undertake. These are people who tend towards internationalism and want to expel corruption from the liberal order, not to overturn the liberal order itself. Some are driven by the failure to deliver prosperity following the financial crash, some by a perception that certain groups are disadvantaged within liberalism – women, for example – which makes identity politics seem attractive. Others are driven by environmental concerns, or by a deep hatred of capitalism. The politics of this group is not particularly stable – and has been characterised by Helen Margetts and colleagues as “chaotic pluralism”. The second “movement” is very different: neither technologically enabled nor self-consciously organised – and rooted in a feeling of being invisible to urban sophisticates and opinion-formers. These are the Brexit voters, people willing to have a punt on Trump, Le Pen, AfD or UKIP. They feel vulnerable in open economies – and polling shows their opposition to globalisation, free markets, big business, inequality, technology and the internet, immigration, multiculturalism, social liberalism, welfare, political correctness, greenery and feminism. This group is united by a rejection of the connected liberal ideal, preferring a more traditional arrangement of people with fewer, stronger ties to a smaller number of others – ties that are not necessarily chosen and which are not necessarily easily removable. It is a local view,. It is focused less on prosperity than on identity, belonging and making the world familiar, navigable and comprehensible for citizens. They reject the liberal consensus, the networked individual, the gig economy and the constant need to reinvent oneself in a dynamic global market. Despite some shared goals, these two groups will find it hard to work together. One set of borderline racists, variously known as the alt-right or Génération Identitaire, attempts to straddle this divide. They align themselves with outsider populists, such as Trump and Le Pen, while borrowing the methods and technologies of the radicals.  But despite their supposed love of homeland and racial purity, they still look more like a load of internationalist millennials talking among themselves. They attempt to defend the basis of the liberal ideal against a supposed threat from other cultures (they are united by Islamophobia, for example). At the same time, they indulge in the joys of that quintessentially 21st-century techno-pastime: “trolling”. They are part of the chaotic pluralism – and surely cannot speak for redundant steelmen in Pittsburgh or rural Catholics in Poland. So the liberal order is under threat from two directions. Failure to adapt will be catastrophic, as nobody has much of an idea what to replace it with – if Donald Trump governs like the populist he seems, we can expect him to eschew tough decisions while presiding over a ballooning government deficit. Accommodation with one group will exacerbate conflict with the other – if you accommodate UKIP, you alienate the Hampstead liberals, and vice versa. The defence of the liberal order has for many years relied on the assertion that there is no alternative. True or not, this is not enough to sustain it – Project Fear, which painted scary pictures of the world under Brexit, Trump, et al, was a flop. A stronger defence is needed with cultural traction, not based merely on the prospect of buying off the discontented or scaring them back into the fold.  Turning inward is no easy option, as evidenced by Theresa May’s car-crash visit to India in November, where the business-friendly Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi – no mean player of the race card himself – turned out to be far less interested in trade than, guess what, the free movement of people. The best had better stop lacking all conviction – as Yeats might have put it. They need to drum up some of that passionate intensity if mere anarchy is not to be loosed upon the world in 2017."
"Britain is due to receive its first delivery of shale gas imported from the US, which will arrive at Grangemouth petrochemical plant in Scotland next month. That the UK is importing a tanker-full of shale gas from the US despite sitting on substantial resources of its own reveals just how far advanced the US shale gas industry is over that in the UK. While the US was once predicted to be the world’s largest importer of natural gas, instead by 2015 it had delivered record gas exports due to its booming shale gas industry. The use of gas for generating electricity also recently reached record levels. On the other hand, there is no commercial shale gas production in the UK and only a handful of wells have been drilled. In May, the first application approval in five years was given to Third Energy, to begin exploration in the village of Kirby Misperton in North Yorkshire. In Scotland, despite interest from a number of companies, development was halted by a 2015 moratorium.  According to surveys undertaken by the Department for Energy and Climate Change in April, public support for fracking stood at only 19%, while 31% were explicitly opposed. In an effort to win over the public and speed up the development process, the government launched a consultation on its proposals to distribute payments from the production of shale gas to the communities affected by the drilling and under which the gas lies. This would be dealt with through a Shale Wealth Fund, which would distribute 10% of all shale gas tax revenues to local communities. Initially there would be a maximum payout of £10m to each community associated with a shale drilling site over the period of 25 years – payments the government believes could add up to £1 billion over the fund’s lifetime. Crucially, the government proposed that payments could be made to households directly, rather than as benefits to communities through payments made to local authorities, for example.  This latest proposal builds on a community benefit charter that was drawn up by industry trade body UK Oil and Gas in 2013. This committed companies to community payments of £100,000 per drilling site during exploration, and 1% of revenues during production. But, unlike the government’s proposals, this would entail payments to communities as a whole, not to individual households.  Part of what lies behind the US shale gas boom is that landowners there own the rights to minerals or oil below their land, so providing a financial incentive for them to allow oil and gas companies to get to work. In the UK, mineral rights belong to the Crown: the Shale Wealth Fund is essentially an attempt to create a financial incentive for those affected to look more positively towards drilling near their homes or land, and to provide a more tangible benefit than just greater employment, economic activity and tax revenues. But would paying off householders actually give the industry the boost it needs? Some have reacted angrily to the proposals. Keith Taylor, Green Party MEP for the south-east, described them as “immoral and tantamount to bribery” – a view echoed by other Green MEPs. A subsequent poll commissioned by Friends of the Earth found that 33% of people would support fracking if households were paid, while 43% would still oppose fracking regardless of payments – fewer than in the April survey, but still substantial opposition. Certainly, direct payments are a more progressive and ambitious step than the industry’s 2013 charter. But the government’s consultation document noted that in reality such payments would be “relatively small per-household”.  In fact, regardless of the estimates the government provides, the ultimate value of the fund and therefore the payments it would distribute is wholly dependent on the tax regime in place when production begins, and the revenue a company derives from a shale gas site once costs are taken into account. Until actual gas production begins, it’s impossible to estimate how much tax the operating company will pay – or even if the shale industry would be a success in the UK at all.  As the price of oil and gas has plummeted in the last two years, the economic case for developing potentially expensive shale gas deposits has weakened. More exploration drilling is needed to determine how much gas can be produced and at what cost. But more than this, public support remains the largest hurdle to the shale sector, and in the absence of a social licence to operate – essentially, public support to do so – the promise of payments to communities will do little to get it up and running."
"Audience members at the Royal Court theatre will be banned from taking in single-use plastic bottles as part of a mission to become a net-zero carbon arts venue in 2020. The London theatre announced it was scrapping its plan to have a month of performance on the climate emergency. Instead, it said, it would spend the time taking stock to find ways to make the organisation net zero by the end of next year.  That will include examining all aspects of its operations, from lighting and set design to its bar and restaurant and whether someone can take in a single-use plastic bottle of drink. “It would be banned and I think it’s really important that it is banned,” said the theatre’s artistic director, Vicky Featherstone. “We are not nannying people: when they leave our building they can behave how they want but, actually, I think it is really important that people have to think about how they come in to the space and what it means. “My feeling about it is we are all in such a dystopian, existential crisis about this real thing that is in front of us, that to be able to go somewhere and to be told … about how to model your behaviours within that building will be a really calming thing for people.” The theatre announced this year that it would give March 2020 over to work on the climate emergency. But things have changed quickly and the issue is already embedded in the work and thoughts of Royal Court writers, Featherstone said. “It felt a bit simplistic to be saying we were going to be programming work specifically just for a month around the climate emergency when all the writers are writing about it all the time. “Instead of filling March with possibly very brilliant monologues about the climate emergency, we are going to stop and take stock and learn how we can, from March onwards, commit to the building becoming net-zero.” The plan is to make changes in its rehearsal and experimental performance space, Site, which will then be applied to the main building as it transitions to a net-zero arts venue. A lot of work has been done by arts organisations around the UK to reduce, offset and neutralise climate impact. The Royal Court initiative arguably takes this to the next level and its executive producer, Lucy Davies, said the theatre would share all of its experiences, “including all the experiments that fail”. Featherstone said anyone entering the building from March would be contributing to the commitment. “The Royal Court has always been radical and must always be radical and fearless in its approach to the way that the work is made, who makes it and who it is for,” she said. “It feels like we don’t have a decision here; we just have to do it. It has to be now.” The theatre said more information about public events during Open Court: Climate Emergency (2-20 March) would follow in early 2020."

"Extinction Rebellion activists have defied a London-wide ban on protests to demonstrate for a second week as they continue to call for action on climate change. The environmental pressure group, which described the ban as a “disproportionate and unprecedented attempt to curtail peaceful protest”, said its lawyers had sent the Metropolitan police a letter threatening legal action. On Tuesday, the group protested at the Department for Transport, had a spontaneous gathering in Trafalgar Square, and demonstrated at Millbank Tower. Five protesters have told the Guardian why they have defied the ban and continued demonstrating.  I have superglued myself to the bottom of the caravan because I am deeply concerned at governments’ complete lack of appropriate action on the very obvious climate emergency that all life on Earth is currently facing. I am here to highlight the real threat of food insecurity. I can’t tell you how many other places I’d rather be, but I don’t feel I have any choice. I am ecstatically happy to live in a time and place where I’m still able to take action. I am so privileged to be able to do this here today when so many people can’t. I am doing this for all the people on the ever increasing frontline of climate change. I’ve come out to protest for all the other people suffering from droughts and food shortages because of the lack of action from those in power. I want to be at home teaching my four children but I no longer have that option because this affects everyone. The UK group of Extinction Rebellion has three core demands: 1) Tell the truthThe government must tell the truth about the scale of the ecological crisis by declaring a climate emergency, “working with other groups and institutions to communicate the urgent need for change”. 2) Net zero emissions by 2025The UK must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions, hitting net zero by 2025. 3) Citizens’ assemblyThe government must create a citizens’ assembly to hear evidence and devise policy to tackle the climate crisis. Citizens’ assemblies bring together ordinary people to investigate, discuss and make recommendations on how to respond, in this case, to the ecological emergency. In the US activists have added a further demand: “A just transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice.” Matthew Taylor I have been protesting with Extinction Rebellion since last August. I came out as a response to what’s happening, but as well as climate justice, this is about civil liberties. The state is going in the direction of over-policing and taking away our liberties. That is why I’m out here, because banning people in London from protesting and searching people with XR badges is a bad direction for us to be heading in. I’m not scared of being arrested. I got arrested on Monday and was held on remand for 16 hours. It was OK. There were lots of singing and meditation. Today is not just about the danger we face. There’s also the story of restoration. It’s about transforming society so we have set conditions in our system to enable a plurality of voices to emerge. We need to rethink the tools of our democratic system. In the current context, if the balance of power that has existed for centuries no longer works, we need to rethink, to have that balance to enable ecological restoration and human restoration. As the environmental system breaks down, food and the supply of food is going to become an issue. Something needed to be done 20 years ago, but that’s why we are here. We’re starting to understand the interconnectedness of the planet and the laws of physics and numbers which we are playing with. We can’t live on credit. We’ll meet a crunch. It won’t just be the people in the global south or marginalised people. We can see it’s not an isolated event. It is a global phenomenon. For us to think Britain is immune to it so we can buy out of it is folly. It will affect all of us. There is no hiding from this, so it is time for us to speak up. I’m here for my kids and for everyone else’s kids and the kids who haven’t been born yet. It’s a relief to be able to do something. Brexit is such a black hole and really painful, but this is a chance to come together to do something constructive and align ourselves with reality. The ban just makes me more keen to come out and get more involved. There are over 1,000 arrested. Let’s get that up to 2,000. It is fantastic the police are taking us seriously. They’re doing their job and we respect that and their calmness. My plan A is not to be arrested, but this isn’t about staying in control. If I’m arrested I’ll deal with it. I have faith in what we’re doing. I’ve not been involved in protests before. I have more of a background in the social sector. I feel like this is something I’ve been waiting for a long time. We have a hope of turning this around. Individual activism is not going to be enough. We need to act as a collective. I’ve been thinking about climate change for a long time and the severity of it didn’t hit. There was the feeling of the powerlessness and no one doing anything about it. Protesting doesn’t make me feel more hopeful as such, but it makes me feel like I couldn’t be anywhere else. There is a duty to make some agency and do it. To do nothing is criminal. I turned down a master’s place this month because I couldn’t sit in a classroom. The ban seems like a draconian impact on our right to protest. It’s pretty shocking that suddenly wherever you are, if you’re protesting you’re a lot more of a target. It has created a sense of unease and fear. When crossing Lambeth Bridge on foot, there were walls of police and stop and search was occurring. It was a bizarre state to witness and not something you expect to see in the UK."

Share this...FacebookTwitterEver wonder why IPCC scientists are losing credibility?
Rudolf Kipp in a reader comment here points out an interesting claim being made by the IPCC 5 AR Summary for Policymakers (SPM) on page 10. It states:
The greenhouse gas contribution to the warming from 1951–2010 is in the range between 0.6 and 1.4°C. This is very likely greater than the total observed warming of approximately 0.6°C over the same period. {10.3.1}
What they are saying here is that the warming due to CO2 may have been as much as 1.4°C, but some external factor may have cooled the globe and offset much of that warming. According to the IPCC it is actually 0 to 0.8°C cooler than it should be. Chapter 10 (Page 15) mentions aerosols as the likely cooling factor:
Over the 1951–2010 period, greenhouse-gas-attributable warming at 0.6–1.4 K is significantly larger than the observed warming of approximately 0.6 K, and is compensated by an aerosol-induced cooling of between 0 and –0.8 K (Figure 10.4b) (Jones et al., 2012).”
That means that the man-made global warming is actually more than what the temperature rise shows. This is because man-made aerosol cooling offsets a part of the warming. Kipp surmises:

If it doesn’t get warmer over the next years, then it likely will be blamed on the increased share of anthropogenic cooling.”
Obviously the IPCC is giving itself a back door for an escape should temperatures continue to stay flat or fall. No matter what happens, the IPCC will blame man-made climate change.
Kipp writes:
Is it any wonder that the credibility of climate scientists within the public has fallen to levels we usually associate with used car dealers or politicians?
With this latest wishy-washy claim, the IPCC  is thus admitting their models have huge uncertainty. This is hardly the kind of science that policy should be based upon.

"In Britain, people typically switch their central heating on in October and use it daily until March or April. This coincides with the clocks going back, the drop in temperature and Winter Fuel Payments – to anyone who receives the state pension. Heating homes accounts for over 70% of household energy consumption. So reducing this figure – while keeping homes warm enough – not only cuts energy bills, but helps meet the carbon reduction commitments that the UK government is legally required to deliver.  The most recent figures show that 2.38m households in the UK are in fuel poverty – which basically means that almost 11% of British homes cannot afford to keep warm. But while the scale of this problem is significant, not all the solutions need to be complex and costly. So here are 10 simple tips for keeping your home warm for little or no extra cost – just in time for that severe weather warning. Heat from the sun is free so make the most of it. Open your curtains and let the sunlight in during the day to make use of this free heat. When it gets dark, shut your curtains, which act as another layer of insulation and keep warmth in your rooms. You should also make sure you don’t have any leaks or gaps so that the warm air can stay in and the cold air stays out – this also helps to reduce condensation. The Centre for Sustainable Energy advises that programming your boiler to turn the heating on a little earlier – such as 30 minutes before you get up in the morning – but at a lower temperature is cheaper than turning it on just as you need it at a higher temperature. This is because a boiler heats up at a constant speed whether you set your thermostat to 20°C or 30°C. But don’t make the mistake of leaving your heating on low all day – because then you’re just paying for heat when you don’t need it. It might feel great to have your favourite seat in front of the radiator, but it’s absorbing heat that could be warming your home. By moving it away from the radiator, hot air can circulate freely. The same goes for your curtains or drying clothes – keep them away from the radiator so that you can get the most out of your heat source. When it comes to heat, around 25% is lost through the roof. This can be easily reduced by installing 25cm of insulation throughout your loft. It’s also worth seeing what’s going on in your walls, as around a third of the heat in an uninsulated home is lost this way. Although it’s not as cheap to install as loft insulation, cavity wall insulation could save up to £160 a year in heating bills. It’s also worth checking with your energy supplier to see if they have any insulation schemes running – which can sometimes mean cheap or free installation. If you have a hot water tank, make sure it is properly lagged – or insulated. This will keep the water warmer for longer, and reduce heating costs. The Energy Community reckons that insulating an uninsulated water tank could save up to £150 a year – but even just upgrading your tank’s “old jacket” will help to save money. This may seem a little counter-intuitive, but bear with me. The World Health Organisation previously recommended a minimum temperature of 21°C in the living room, but Public Health England revised this to 18°C in 2014. And research shows that turning your thermostat down by 1°C could cut your heating bill by up to 10%. So keep the dial at 18°C, save money and avoid the negative impacts of a cold home . Even a simple solution such as a making your own sausage dog draught excluder will help keep the warmth in your home. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that DIY draught-proofing your doors, windows and cracks in the floor could save £25 per year. You can do this yourself for very little cost. Self-adhesive rubber seals around doors and windows and door draught excluders are relatively cheap and easy to install. So it’s worth getting those doors and windows sealed before winter properly kicks in. Research at the University of Salford has shown that installing heating controls and theromostatic radiator valves results in energy savings of 40% compared to a house with no controls. These work by allowing you to programme your heating to come on at predefined times – so you only use energy when you need it. New smart thermostats can also be controlled remotely via your mobile so you can turn on your heating on the way home, ensuring it’s nice and toasty when you arrive. If your boiler is more than 10 years old, it may be time to replace it with a new, more efficient model. Depending on your old boiler type and house, you could save up to £350 with a new A-rated condensing boiler – which uses less energy to produce the same amount of heat. Plus, if it’s new, you’re less likely to have any issues going into the winter season. Radiator panels are relatively cheap, easy to install, and ensure that heat from your radiators warms up your room and not your walls. They work by reflecting the heat back into the room."
"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is on a collision course with the government over proposals to water down his green plan for the capital, which involves stopping the expansion of Heathrow and protecting the green belt. Planning inspectors want Khan to withdraw his objections to Heathrow’s expansion, permit fracking in London, and loosen his commitment to the green belt by allowing building in “very special circumstances”.  Khan is expected to write formally to the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, Robert Jenrick, to reject these proposed changes to the “London Plan” policy. Ministers will then have six weeks to choose whether to force through the changes by legal means. The brewing row highlights the tensions between local governments, which in some areas are taking a tough stance on climate change and environmental issues such as air pollution, and central government, which is accused of lagging behind on concrete actions to fulfil the UK’s national goals on the climate emergency and environmental protections. Jules Pipe, deputy mayor for planning, regeneration and skills, said: “Tackling London’s filthy air and the climate emergency are among the mayor’s top priorities. London has declared a climate emergency and it’s critical we move towards renewable energy to improve the capital’s toxic air quality, protect the health of Londoners, and keep the city on course to being a net zero-carbon city by 2050.” Khan’s plan would ban fracking in London, prevent the massive expansion of Heathrow backed by the government, and enshrine stronger protections for the green belt and metropolitan open land. A report by the Planning Inspectorate, a quasi-independent government agency, suggested changes to the London Plan that would allow for fracking in London, and for development in the green belt “in very special circumstances”, with alterations to the boundary of the green belt in “exceptional circumstances”. The inspectors want the changes in order to bring the London Plan into line with national policies, set by central government, and the great majority of the measures in the London Plan received their approval. Their recommendations are non-binding – however, to ignore them, the mayor must write to the secretary of state explaining why he is doing so. A spokesperson for the Planning Inspectorate said: “The London Plan has been examined by an independent panel of three inspectors. The panel’s role in the examination is now complete. The report sets out any recommended changes, as well as the reasoning behind those changes, following the examination in public. It is for the Greater London Authority to consider the changes and publish the report at a timing of their choice.” The effects of the changes proposed by the inspectors are likely to be minor in practice. For instance, there are no current plans to frack in London, and none are likely to be brought forward. Fracking has in effect stalled across the UK. Allowing for building on the green belt in “very special circumstances” would be open to challenge and require explanations of what made circumstances so special that the presumption against building should be breached. The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts On Heathrow, the London Plan will in effect be subordinate to the decisions of the courts, where attempts to stop the airport expansion by legal means are already well under way. Last week, a new legal front opened up in the ongoing battle, when WWF was granted permission to make arguments against expansion based on the rights of children. Khan’s objections to Heathrow expansion are nuanced, moreover, by his backing for increased capacity at Gatwick. The row over the London Plan is significant as it highlights the gap between local and national government on green issues. Local mayors and council leaders wishing to implement environmental improvements, whether on air pollution or measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sometimes lack the powers to do so. Even where they are given power, for instance in setting up clean air zones, they may be frustrated in raising funding for their plans, when local authorities are facing cuts, large deficits or even bankruptcy. Khan will write to the secretary of state before the end of the year, and the government will have six weeks in which to respond. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “It is for the mayor of London to take forward the planning inspector’s comments on the London Plan. The secretary of state will respond to any letter from the mayor of London in due course.”"
"There have been rumblings in Iceland recently. But given its position in the North Atlantic, this is perhaps no surprise. The location makes the country a notorious volcanic hot spot, regularly hit by seismic activity. Two recent earthquakes in August 2016 have now led to international reports of imminent eruption risk of Katla volcano. They both occurred within the 9km by 14km central crater – or “caldera” – of the volcano in southern Iceland, and were the two largest earthquakes at the volcano since 1977. So how worried should we be? Will there be a repeat of the chaos in the skies after an ash cloud drifted over Europe in 2010 caused by an eruption at Eyjafjallajökull, Katla’s close neighbour?  In historic terms, we’ve certainly been waiting for an explosive eruption of Katla, one of Iceland´s most active volcanoes, for quite some time. Lying beneath an icecap up to 700 metres thick, over the last 1,100 years explosive eruptions large enough to melt through the ice have occurred on average every 50 years. The last such eruption was in 1918, and the current pause of 98 years is the longest on record.  In the past earthquakes were felt two to 10 hours before Katla erupted through the ice. Since June, earthquake activity in the caldera has been elevated. The large earthquakes on August 29 marked the peak of this seismicity, followed by a series of more than 100 smaller events, finishing early on August 30. Meanwhile, the rivers that drain from the ice-capped volcano have been smelling of rotten eggs. This smell comes from hydrogen sulphide (H2S), a volcanic gas found in fluids within the caldera beneath the ice. Unusually high H2S levels near Múlakvísl river have prompted official advice to avoid the immediate area. Changes in levels of volcanic gases around volcanoes and enhanced seismic activity can be signs of increased movement of magma and a future volcanic eruption. So does all of this physical evidence point to an imminent eruption? Well, probably not. This activity is not actually unusual. Since the 1950s, periods of enhanced seismicity and increased gas pollution have not been followed by explosive eruptions, and there is no sign of swelling of the volcano or harmonic tremor (continuous rhythmic earthquakes) suggesting magma movement. Earthquake activity at Katla also regularly increases in summer and autumn. As the summer progresses, more glacial ice melts, and small floods can occur. These larger volumes of melt water also increase pore pressure in the crustal rocks and can trigger earthquakes. Changes to water flow can also alter how much geothermal fluid is in the rivers, hence the smell. In winter the melting reduces and water exists only in small pockets at the base of the ice, which reduces pore pressure in the crust and reduces seismic activity.  However, volcanoes can change rapidly and in unexpected ways. We can’t say for sure that Katla will not erupt in the near future. A 98-year repose period is long, and twice before eruptions of Katla have followed Eyjafjallajökull in the 1820s and in 1612. So what would happen if Katla did erupt? Eruptions from this volcano over the last 120,000 years have been varied, but the most likely eruption would be from the central caldera. A very small eruption wouldn’t melt through the ice, but a larger one could melt through explosively. Explosive Katla eruptions typically involve ash clouds and large floods (jökulhlaups) of meltwater, ice and sediment that flow across the surrounding lowlands. Lava is not usually seen since most eruptions are subglacial. A small explosive eruption from Katla is the most common eruption type and would last from days to a couple of weeks, produce a plume up to 14km high, ash fall in Iceland and a large flood, but would be unlikely to affect anywhere outside of Iceland. A larger-scale event could last weeks or even months. In this case the plume would be up to 25km in height and could impact air quality and air travel in the UK and Europe within two days if the wind blows ash in that direction. Iceland could expect heavy ashfall, with implications for travel, agriculture and air quality, and a large flood. Such floods can have peak discharges (water flow rates) greater than the Amazon, and cause major landscape change and local tsunamis. If there is an eruption, both Iceland and the UK should be well prepared. Evacuation plans exist for local communities and information is available in several languages. The UK Meteorological Office monitors ash in the atmosphere and is able to predict what areas could be affected. When I began studying Katla in 1999 I was told she could erupt any time. This remains true today and with every day that passes, we get closer to an eruption. But I wouldn’t bet on it happening right now. Icelandic and international scientists work hard to investigate Katla´s past and carry out 24-hour monitoring with sophisticated equipment to understand its present and future. We study volcanic ash, rocks, jökulhlaup deposits, river levels and gas emissions on the ground. Earthquakes and GPS records are analysed remotely and we use satellites and overflights to examine the ground and ice surfaces from the air. An eruption may not be imminent – but it is exciting that we can detect and interpret these clues to assess Katla’s next move."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGrowing Antarctic ice is actually shrinking. That’s what a study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is claiming in a new paper published by Nature.

This is precisely in line with the global warming logic that a warmer globe leads to colder, snowier winters. The peer reviewers at Nature simply have no qualms about such creative, yet contradictory logic. Addition is now subtraction. 2+2 now equals 3!
The PIK here writes that as the globe warms, more precipitation will result over Antarctica, which in turn will lead to thickening ice. Logically, that should act to slow down sea level rise. Not so the PIK now claims: “Stronger snowfall increases future ice discharge from Antarctica” and “that a lot of the ice gain due to increased snowfall is countered by an acceleration of ice-flow to the ocean. Thus Antarctica’s contribution to global sea-level rise is probably greater than hitherto estimated”.
A greater rate of ice flow from Antarctica into the ocean is plausible. But an accelerated sea level rise is only possible if the exit ice mass flowrate into the ocean is greater than the mass flowrate from precipitation onto the Antarctic ice. A positive ice gain on Antarctica means a subtraction from sea level.
So how much of the quantity of ice added from precipitation flows out into the oceans? To add to sea level rise, that figure would have to be greater than 100%. The PIK writes:
‘Between 30 and 65 percent of the ice gain due to enhanced snowfall in Antarctica is countervailed by enhanced ice loss along the coastline,’ says lead-author Ricarda Winkelmann.”
That means that net ice gain on the continent is 35 – 70% of what comes down as precipitation. So how do they come up with more ice leaving the continent than what is piling up on it? Here, the creative assumptions of a child are necessary. The PIK claims: The effects of surface warming and basal ice-shelf melting more than offset the gains from precipitation and thus lead to a net ice loss from Antarctica.
For the first time, an ensemble of ice-physics simulations shows that future ice discharge is increased up to three times because of additional precipitation in Antarctica under global warming.”

In summary, when reality shows that Anatarctica is not contributing to sea level rise, then just fudge the models until there’s a net positive sea level rise contribution. With the right assumptions, you can show anything! In this case they simply assume that changes in the ice-flow dynamics (yes, precisely!) more than offset the ice growth from precipitation.
But the PIK then admits that is doesn’t know how fast the ice is flowing into the oceans:
…the big question is: How much more mass within the ice sheet will slowly but inexorably flow off Antarctica and contribute to sea-level rise, which is one of the major impacts of climate change.”
This is where the PIK comes in with the dubious assumption: ice flow dynamics will certainly more than offset precipitation. That is after all the answer they want.
The Nature abstract claims:
This results in a dynamic ice loss of up to 1.25 metres in the year 2500 for the strongest warming scenario. The reported effect thus strongly counters a potential negative contribution to global sea level by the Antarctic Ice Sheet.”
Of course, this is only if their preposterous assumption is correct.
Clearly the science has gone off the rails.

"Whether you think autumn officially starts at the beginning or end of September, you only have to look at the trees to see the season is changing. Leaves on deciduous trees always change colour from green to vibrant hues of yellow, orange, and red. But some years the colourful show is more spectacular than others. One of the most outstanding recent years in the UK was 2008. And the Forestry Commission is expecting 2016 to be another one of the best.  So what produces an autumn to remember? Variation from one year to the next in nature can be seen in a number of phenomena, such as the amount and duration of spring blossom or the quantity of fruit and berries on bushes and trees. Oenophiles (wine lovers) will know that the quality of grapes from which wine is made varies from one year to another. The underlying explanation for all these phenomena is basically the same: the weather. The distinctive autumnal woodland colours in leaves are formed by the combination of four classes of chemicals: chlorophyll, carotenoids, xanthophylls, and anthocyanins. Chlorophyll, the main chemical involved in photosynthesis, reflects green light, which explains the green colour of most deciduous trees in spring and summer.  As the days shorten in temperate latitudes, trees prepare for their winter dormant period by withdrawing nutrients from their leaves. Chlorophyll is rich in nitrogen. While some chlorophyll breaks down throughout the year, the process accelerates during autumn. As less green light is reflected, the colours of other chemicals in the leaves become visible. Carotenoids, another chemical involved in photosynthesis, tend to be orange. The yellow xanthophylls are oxygenated carotenoids. The many anthocyanin compounds produce a palette of reds, ranging from the brightest scarlet to maroons and purple. Put these colours together and you have a vibrant patchwork of colour clothing the countryside, urban parks and gardens. Data from the Met Office show that August 2016 was warmer (by 0.6℃) and sunnier (110%) compared to the long-term average. Combined with a wet spring (rainfall 30% above average in the east and south), this will have led to higher than average levels of sugars in plant tissues – and it is these sugars that are the real key to the richness of the autumnal colours. Anthocyanins are large, complex molecules containing a sugar, usually glucose. So more sunshine means more glucose, more anthocyanins and more vibrant autumnal colours in 2016. Anthocynanins are produced by some species of tree but not by others and they are also important in the production of the intense colours of many fruits and berries, including the colour of red grapes. In leaves, as the level of chlorophyll decreases, anthocyanins are produced. It is still not absolutely clear what function is performed by anthocyanins. It costs the plant energy to make them and only some tree species produce anthocyanins. Around 15% to 30% of tree leaf colour is caused by carotenoids and xanthophylls alone. There is some suggestion that anthocyanins are antioxidants and perform a protective role by preventing free radicals (reactive atoms or molecules) from destroying plant tissue and DNA. But this explanation is not universally accepted.  Other explanations are that anthocyanins effectively mask the leaves visually from some predators that can see the green leaves but do not possess the photoreceptors required to detect red leaves or insects that find red less attractive than green. As the chlorophyll breaks down and leaves naturally turn yellow and orange, so that the carotenoids and xanthophylls are no longer masked by the green, they attract sap-sucking aphids. So some species of tree produce a bright red pigment in the leaves to confuse insects. Although the summer weather means we can expect an impressive autumn, there are still some questions. Will 2016 be a long autumnal season, stretching from mid-September into November – or will it be cut short? In 2008, there were a few early frosts. Frost promotes abscission, the process by which the leaf detaches from the twig. In 2008, leaves fell from the trees over a relatively short period of time. That, of course, brings with it the joys of kicking through piles of fallen leaves, but an early frost will shorten the duration of the autumnal show, as might the high winds associated with autumnal storms. In the absence of early frosts and storms, however, we can look forward to a magnificent display. But for how many more years will this continue? Climate change has seen the onset date of leaf colour change being pushed back. That narrows the window during which the colours can be seen and enjoyed. If we are lucky this year, we will see a peak of colour in mid to late October with leaves still on the trees in November – but watch the weather forecast for the latest."
"Donald Trump’s US election victory follows hard on the back of the UK’s Brexit vote in June. The results – an expression of collective public preference from the electorate – have shaken political and cultural establishments on both sides of the Atlantic. And they have unsettled me also. However, I’m interested in how the results of these different “referenda” in two of the world’s oldest democracies open a different window into understanding the cultural politics of climate change. At one level, a political analysis would conclude that both results are a setback for national climate policies and international climate change agreements. A UK withdrawing from the EU, and its embedded environmental legislation is a UK that would seem more climate-sceptical than many climate progressives would wish for. And in the US, Trump has made fairly clear his own personal beliefs about human-induced climate change. With a Republican senate and house, it is not impossible to think of the US’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. But I’m interested in a deeper cultural reading of what these two popular votes signify in the context of climate change. In their light it is perhaps ironic that it was largely US and UK science which, from the 1970s through the 1990s, really drove the scientific, public and political construction of the idea of anthropogenic global warming. Margaret Thatcher famously backed the reality of the enhanced greenhouse effect in 1990, as too did George Bush Sr in 1989. So why now, in 2016, have clear electoral majorities in these two nations voted for political movements and parties which are predominantly sceptical of climate change? It is more than just a result of nefarious fossil-fuel corporations or well-funded libertarian think-tanks. Climate commentators and analysts need to look beyond these narrow explanations of resistance. The connecting factor, I suggest, is a popular antipathy towards the shadowy ideology of globalism, the unexamined belief that the world will inevitably be a better place through transnational coordination of governance, finance and science, through the free flow of goods and people, and through a commitment to multiculturalism. This is the ideology which British and American citizens in their millions have voted against; yet in the minds of many, this is the ideology that lies behind the science, discourse and policies of climate change. The rise of an anti-globalist populism in recent years, and its clear expression this year in these two electoral moments, should help us to read the phenomenon of climate change differently. We cannot understand it simply in terms of science and the environment or even in terms of economics and politics. How climate change is believed in or denied, how it is acted upon or resisted, can only be understood at the level of much deeper beliefs people hold about themselves and about how the world is and should be. We can see this played out through the different types of climate agreements that have been sought-for over three decades. The idea of human-induced global climate change first emerged in public in a very particular era: in the 1980s and early 1990s when globalism and the new international world order was ascendant. It therefore was as much a cultural idea as it was a scientific discovery, as both sociologist Andrew Ross and Indian scholars Anil Agarwal and Sunita Narain observed astutely, in different ways, back in 1991. Since then we have seen the idea of climate change and how it should be dealt with continue to evolve, from the centralised targets and timetables of Kyoto in 1997; to the failure to extend this form of climate governance at Copenhagen in 2009; to the optimistic volunteerism of Paris in 2015; and now into a new era where we will see the gap between international political rhetoric and national climate policy continue to get wider and wider in the years ahead. With the rise in populism and nationalism some new and nifty policy entrepreneurialism is needed, and it will have to tackle the risks of climate change obliquely. This is the strategy a group of colleagues and I called for in the Hartwell Paper back in 2010 as a response to the financial crisis.  Energy security will become a more powerful driver of policy which, if played the right way, can make some low-carbon energy sources appeal to populist political instincts; as too can the argument for cleaner and smarter cities driven by new generation transport technologies which reduce congestion and improve air quality. If Trump were serious about reinvigorating the US motor industry then this would be one way to go, and sell to the world. A turn away from globalism also gives greater legitimacy to arguments for investing in carbon-light/climate-resilient infrastructure. Trump’s plan to renew America’s ailing public infrastructure is an opportunity to do so in a way that is both energy-efficient and resilient to weather hazards. The trick is just don’t call it climate policy. “Solving climate change” is likely to become a motivating narrative of ever diminishing political and public value in these new populist times."
"In 1993, nine 300kW turbines were installed on the eastern pier at Blyth Harbour, near Newcastle on England’s east coast. One can question whether this really counted as an offshore wind farm, but it was the UK’s first tentative step towards building wind turbines at sea. Ten years later, the country’s first truly offshore wind farm was built at North Hoyle in Liverpool Bay, 6km from the coast of North Wales. Thirty 2MW turbines were installed which could provide the electricity needs of around 40,000 homes.  Fast forward to 2016 and the UK is the world’s leading developer of offshore wind power with a total installed capacity of more than 5,000MW. The London Array, built in the outer reaches of the Thames Estuary, presently stands as the world’s largest offshore wind farm which, with a capacity of 630MW, can rival a medium-sized gas-fired power station.  The proposed Hornsea Project Two offshore site, which the UK government has just approved, will be larger still.  More than 100km from the east coast, the project will, together with neighbouring Hornsea One, provide up to 3,000MW. It will dwarf any of the more than 60 offshore windfarms already built. These projects are getting bigger – and heading further and further offshore. Where will it end? The drive to develop offshore wind power, despite its higher cost compared to onshore wind farms, has come from a politically driven perception that onshore wind power is too intrusive in a country which is relatively densely populated and values its landscape, as well as a recognition that winds offshore are stronger and more constant. A metric known as the “load factor” is used as a measure of how much a power plant produces on average (taking into account it is not at full output all the time) as a fraction of its maximum possible output. For onshore wind power this was 29.4% in 2015 and for offshore it was 33.3%. During a particularly windy December 2015, the London Array’s load factor was 78.9% which is a level closer to that expected from a nuclear power station. These figures are testament to the higher and less variable winds that are seen offshore. As projects are built further from the coast, average wind speeds increase, along with the load factor.  The UK is also largely surrounded by shallow waters, which also works in its favour. For instance, Dogger Bank, site of another huge proposed windfarm, is more than 100km from the coast, yet the sea is less than 30m deep in much of the area (indeed “Doggerland” was above the waterline during the last ice age, and was home to thousands of humans). This leaves much of Britain’s offshore potential well within the reach of established and relatively cheap foundation designs such as piles driven into the sea bed.  How much offshore wind power could feasibly be installed in UK waters? The answer will be primarily driven by economics and constraints, which in turn depend on a number of physical and logistical factors.   As we move to deeper water sites, those cheaper foundations are no longer feasible. Indeed, beyond depths of 80m, floating foundations are required. This technology, though common in the oil and gas industry, is still at a prototype stage for offshore wind and will inevitably increase costs.  Greater distances from shore make both construction and maintenance more expensive, as boats have further to travel from the relatively few large ports available to service huge offshore wind farms. In addition, the relatively small number of specialist vessels required for these tasks limits the rate and scale of construction.  The UK has some of the busiest seas in the world both at the surface, criss-crossed by shipping lanes, and on the sea bed in the form of cables, pipelines, shipwrecks and unexploded ordnance. These factors to some extent restrict where offshore wind farms can be built. Beyond 80km or so from the coast, special high-voltage direct current (HVDC) grid connections are required to export the gigawatts of power that will be generated. Though this technology is relatively well established, it is currently more expensive than the more common alternating current (AC) cabling – and connecting multiple offshore wind farms to a common connection point offshore is challenging. Environmental factors have to be considered too. A site may be off limits if it may have an impact on a particular bird species. For example, one of the reasons that the proposed site at Shell Flats, off the coast of Blackpool, was abandoned was because of its potential impact on the common scoter sea duck.  The number of turbines that can be installed in a given area is also limited by aerodynamics: if turbines are too close, those downstream have to work with reduced wind speeds and increased turbulence. The former reduces the power available and the latter increases fatigue and reduces turbine lifetime.  Taking all of these factors into account, a recent study of the UK’s offshore wind energy potential has suggested that the total amount of economically feasible installed capacity offshore might be up to 675GW. This could provide more than six times the UK’s present national electricity demand. Capacity is currently just 5GW so, in other words, the UK has still exploited less than 1% of its offshore wind potential. In the unlikely event that this amount of offshore wind power was built, it would make the UK a major exporter of renewable energy to continental Europe. Where next for UK offshore wind power? The study which reached the 675GW figure assumed a levelised cost of energy (LCOE), which factors in construction and maintenance costs, of up to £120/MWh. By 2020, the government wants to get costs down to £100/MWh. A number of the developers in British waters are bullish about such reductions and by 2025, they expect costs of £70/MWh, well below the strike price of £92.50/MWh agreed for the Hinckley Point C nuclear power station which is not expected to come on stream until at least 2023. However, there are challenges ahead. Even if operational improvements and more efficient designs do manage to keep costs down, there remains the question of how to integrate a variable form of power generation into the UK grid. This will be achieved by more advanced controlled strategies for offshore wind farms, greater network interconnectivity with European neighbours, smart and flexible demand-side management technology and ultimately cost-effective energy storage."

Redistribution from bottom to top.

That’s why we at NTZ decided to install solar panels on our home. We prefer being on top, and not always the ones getting screwed. My decision had nothing to do with “rescuing the climate”.
Here are some excerpts of the press release by the Cologne Institute:
Poor households are especially burdened

The redistribution effect of the Renewable Energy Act (EEG) is producing a socially precarious situation, a study by the Cologne Institute For German Economics (IW) has determined. Low income earners are burdened by the extra costs stemming from green electricity just as much as rich households.
This is mainly due to the fact that energy consumption changes very little as income rises. That means the financially strained households are significantly more burdened. The planned power price increases will exacerbate this effect even more: The poorest 10% by income have to pay about 1.3% of their income in order to finance the feed-in of renewable energy. With the top 10% by income, they only need to pay 0.2%.
The redistribution effect is further enhanced by the installation of private photovoltaic systems. There are very few solar households among low-wage earners. Among the rich, however, 20% of the households operate a solar power system. In total the approximately 1 million solar households (about 2.5 percent of the more than 40.4 million private households in Germany) received in 2011 a surplus of about 1 billion euros. More than half of this amount flowed to the top three income deciles.”
Summary: When it comes to generating electricity with wind, solar and biogas, it’s the rich, high-income property owners who benefit. The people who end up picking up the tab are the very poor.
It’s no wonder 600,000 households had their power shut off last year because they were unable to pay their electric bills. Welcome to Europe’s compassionate green socialism.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPreliminary figures show that Germany’s CO2 emissions for 2012 increased 1.5% – due to a cold winter and higher consumption of coal for producing electricity, writes Germany’s FOCUS magazine here.

Environment Minister Peter Altmaier says Germany’s CO2 emissions are rising, and his country’s renewable energy transition will cost 1 trillion euros by 2039. Photo credit: Peter Altmaier, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
The final figures are still not in, and FOCUS writes that they may be as high as 2% more CO2. German Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier commented, “We must not be indifferent about this because it puts the fulfilment of our climate targets at risk.“ Germany has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 27% since 1990. But it is rarely mentioned that most of those reductions resulted from the shutdown of dilapidated, filthy, communist East German industry after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The jump of 2012 will surely make reaching the 40% reduction target by 2020 more difficult, if not all but impossible. Currently the EU is seriously contemplating an intervention in the CO2 permit trading to increase the price and thus produce an incentive for companies to save energy (or to move offshore).
Worst, Peter Altmaier is quoted in the flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung here saying that Germany’s transition to renewable energy may end up costing a stunningly spectacular one trillion euros by 2039. The FAZ writes:

For the first time Environment Minister Peter Altmaier speaks publicly about the total costs of the transition to renewable energy: 1000 billion euros. That’s reason enough for the CDU party politician to pull the ‘electric power brake’.”
But as Altmaier admits, “pulling the brakes” is only going to reduce the bill by a fraction. Altmaier tells the FAZ:
That would mean that we would save 200 billion in feed-in subsidies over 20 years.”
Altmaier expects an additional 100 billion euros in savings from reduced energy back-up systems. So instead of costing 1000 billion euros, Germans are going to end up paying 700 billion euros. For what? Answer: Read here! (That is, of course, if the AGW theory is correct. So far the climate has been cooling, meaning Germany’s foray into green energy will be it’s latest super folly to follow WWI and WWII).
As was the case in last century’s kook-driven movements, there are powerful kook-forces behind Germany’s current green revolution, and Altmaier’s attempts to rein it all in faces fierce opposition. Once again it looks as if another historical, violent cardiac arrest is in the works for the heart of Europe.

"For many people, leprosy brings to mind Biblical stories of diseased people cast out from society. It’s a condition that today is largely found in developing countries, whereas in other, mostly Western nations it’s a pestilence of the past that was eradicated decades ago. But recent research has shown the disease not only persists in Britain but, perhaps more alarmingly, is also being carried by one of our best loved and most endangered native mammals, the red squirrel. The study by researchers at the University of Edinburgh and EPFL in Switzerland found red squirrels from England, Scotland and Ireland were infected with leprosy. In particular, a group from Brownsea Island on the south coast of England had a strain of the disease virtually identical to one that infected humans in the middle ages. So could it be that leprosy was never entirely eradicated from Britain but instead has lingered on in wildlife reservoir hosts in isolated areas? Possibly, but the whole picture is more complex, not least because of the history of the red squirrel in the British Isles. Understanding what’s going on could help us in our efforts to protect and regrow the red squirrel population. Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that can persist in the body for years without causing symptoms but can eventually lead to skin lesions, eyesight problems and nerve decay. This can cause sufferers to lose the ability to feel pain and so repeatedly damage parts of their body (leading to the myth that leprosy causes limbs to drop off). The disease seems to cause similar symptoms in red squirrels, with individuals commonly exhibiting alopecia, swollen eyes, ears and digits. How serious a problem the leprosy is for British red squirrels has still to be fully investigated, although high numbers of animals sampled in this study tested positive for the disease. Given the plight of the species, which have gone from a population of millions to just 120,000 in a few centuries, it cannot be good. The new research, published in the journal Science, compared genetic sequence data from diseased squirrels with those taken from contemporary human cases from Mexico and the skeletons of leprosy victims from medieval Europe. The results show that the leprosy in the squirrels was caused not only by the classic bacteria Mycobacterium leprae (long thought to be the sole causative agent of leprosy), but also by the more recently discovered Mycobacterium lepromatosis. The M leprae strain found on Brownsea Island seems to be almost identical to that of medieval victims from England and Europe. This suggests the disease has persisted in British wildlife long after its eradication from the human population. Using genetic analysis, the researchers also showed the British and Irish strains of M lepromatosis had a common ancestor just 200 years ago. By comparison, they separated from the strain found in Mexico 27,000 years ago. This suggests the disease may have actually been imported to Ireland when conservationists first tried to reintroduce red squirrels to the country from Britain in the 19th century. The reason leprosy has continued in red squirrels while being effectively eradicated from the human population could be the result of the changing nature of our interactions with the animals since the middle ages. Red squirrels are no longer hunted for food or fur but their numbers have declined dramatically thanks to habitat destruction, other diseases such as squirrelpox and the spread of grey squirrels. Red squirrels are now largely extinct from their former ranges in England and Wales, with core populations located in Scotland. This decline means red squirrels are now protected by law in both the UK and Ireland. Legal protection, if implemented properly, limits the amount of contact we have with a species and so can reduce our negative impact on it. But this reduced contact also means we know less about the diseases of that species and so could help explain why the rediscovery of leprosy is such a surprise. Humans are a selfish species at heart and so the focus of our fight against disease is generally limited to those pathogens that threaten our own health or our economy. This means we tend to be oblivious to the risks from diseases among species we have limited interaction with. This is even more likely if we associate the disease with a specific species, especially through its name or our understanding of its history. Over the past 30 years, we have been caught unawares by bovine tuberculosis in African lions, canine distemper virus in Siberian seals and tigers, and leprosy in North American armadillos. What this latest study shows is that we should be more prepared to expect the unexpected when it comes to disease surveillance. We owe it to ourselves, and the animals we manage, to broaden our horizons and our understanding of disease dynamics in all species. Comprehensive disease screening would help us reduce the chances of accidentally introducing pathogens into a new species or area when moving animals around for conservation reasons. Better understanding of the disease threats our squirrels face could also help us develop bespoke conservation strategies. For example, we could tailor captive breeding programmes to the levels of genetic diversity needed to bolster natural resistance to disease. Hopefully studies like this will help us secure the long-term future of this charismatic little mammal."
"Wealthy households may be becoming biodiversity hotspots thanks to an ecological phenomenon known as the “luxury effect”, which boosts species diversity in richer areas. A recent US study showed a striking correlation between the number of different invertebrates found inside urban houses and the affluence of the surrounding area and household income.  Filthy rich you might ask? Not at all, this increased diversity isn’t thanks to pests such as cockroaches that are traditionally associated with poverty but instead to outdoor species that seem to have taken a liking to the leafier suburbs and then moved indoors. The research focused on the town of Raleigh in North Carolina. The team of ecologists collected all the types of invertebrates they could find from 50 homes using “active searching and hand collecting”. (The ethics clearance necessary to rummage under residents’ beds and in their underwear drawers must be worth reading). In addition to the handfuls of bugs, the researchers captured environmental and economic data to explore the relationships between the richness of insects and household budgets. The best predictions of indoor bug diversity came from statistical models that not only included local plant diversity or overall house size but also neighbourhood income: the richer the area, the more critters, especially where gardens lacked plants.  The increasing numbers of invertebrates they found were made up of typical outdoor suburban inhabitants such as beetles, spiders and ants, rather than just the familiars of poverty such as fleas or cockroaches. Evidently, economic and social exclusion works just as well for insects as for us. The ecologists identified at least 579 species in total with anywhere between 32 and 211 different species per household. There was one particular caveat, however: participation in the study was voluntary and biased towards higher income houses. A nasty infestation by a poverty indicator like cockroaches might not be something you want your neighbours to know about.  There has always been a powerful association between pest-free cleanliness and respectability. That you could eat your dinner off of someone’s floor was always one of my grandmother’s deepest compliments and it sounds like this is still perfectly possible in Raleigh. It’s not clear how residents felt about their mini-beast lodgers but I suspect some social climbing could be done at the drop of a rare or exotic arthropod Latin name. A home from home for a few Anthocoridae (“minute pirate bugs”, according to the taxa list) sounds quite exotic, but I’d avoid mentioning you have a touch of the Rhinatermatidae, unless you want local house prices to fall. There were some real rarities too, notably Berothidae larvae, or beaded lacewings as these flying insects are charmingly known. Sadly they are associated with termites, who they kill with airborne chemicals, so maybe best not mentioned after all. There could even be a market for a Rentokil-in-reverse, as species associated with affluence are released to gentrify the neighbourhood. The luxury effect was first characterised for urban plants, essentially suggesting that bigger gardens and disposable income resulted in more diverse species of plants. The variation of Raleigh’s indoor invertebrates is credited primarily to a cascade effect in which increased greenery means more outdoor diversity, some of which finds its way indoors.  The same effect also works for birds, bats and lizards, and there are echoes here of the classic ecological phenomenon of island biogeography theory: the bigger the area, the more species you find.  In this case the greater the area of green planting the more species end up inside. The diversity of planting even fits one of the explanations for increasing species richness with area, namely that larger areas have more habitats and can therefore provide a home for more species. Neighbourhood incomes barely reached US$200,000 in Raleigh, so evidently data need extending into richer habitats. A spot of active searching and hand collecting in the mansions of the super-elite sounds essential."
"Much of the global south – broadly comprising the continents of Asia, Africa, and Latin America – was shaped by colonialism. The so-called “great game” and the scrambles between Britain, Portugal, Belgium, France and other European states were for power, profit and – most visibly – for land.  Today, new scrambles are afoot from Brazil and Nigeria, to Ethiopia and Indonesia. Once again, land is the prize. In the past decade, almost 50m hectares of land have been leased or bought from individuals, communities and governments in the global south for the large-scale production of biofuels, food, forest resources, industrial goods, infrastructure, tourism and livestock. A complex network of multinational companies, financial institutions and governments in the north are the key beneficiaries.  Take, for example, Feronia Inc – a company based in Canada and owned by the development finance institutions of various European governments, including the UK, France and Spain. Feronia controls 120,000 hectares of palm oil plantations in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some of the countries that were once colonised are now the colonisers: China and India have huge investments in Cambodia, Indonesia, Guyana, Ethiopia and Brazil among other countries. According to the Land Matrix database, China controls 258,728 hectares in Cambodia. China’s Union Development Group (UDG) has a land concession of 45,100 hectares within Botum Sakor National Park for the development of a tourist resort. With the blessings of the central politburo of the Communist Party of China, UDG has also invested US$3.8 billion in a new deepwater port in the country, with access to 90km of coastline, on a 99-year lease. Similar investments have been made in maritime infrastructure in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. As we know, China is keen to increase its strategic and commercial influence over the South China Sea and Asian waters in general. Land deals are implemented – and often initiated – by sub-national states which are in competition with each other to win major investments. For example, since economic liberalisation in 1991, Indian states have competed with each other – and with states in neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and China – to bag business opportunities. I interviewed several senior civil servants in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. On the understanding that certain details of our interviews were kept off the record, one told me:   Companies are like bridegrooms. If they are bringing an iconic brand into the  state, they come with a huge list of demands, the primary one being land. In the case of [an automobile multinational], we had large, vacant plots, which we could transfer to them in a short period. In addition, they wanted road, rail and port access. They wanted to be near a metropolis. They wanted all sorts of social infrastructure, like land for an international school and sporting facilities for families of executives … Overall, there were 80-90 parameters related to land, tax concessions and clearances for water, electricity. His colleague added: [Companies] have played off states against each other. Take for example [a multinational]. We were trying to get them to [our state]. [They were to invest] US$2 billion … [But] the company wanted US$100m from us. [The Company’s] alternate sites were in Vietnam and Guangzhou in China. Finally Vietnam got [that] project. The latter official hinted that governments in India and competitor countries are willing to entice companies with hard cash, tax concessions and other subsidies in order to bag their investment.  These agreements tend to take place outside boardrooms. Deals are struck in the breakout spaces, green rooms, bars and clubs and people’s homes – in other words, in the institutional shadows. In Zimbabwe, war veterans can act as intermediaries who facilitate or block land deals at the local level, while in Cambodia and Vietnam, land investors may operate through middlemen – including moonlighting officials – in order to circumvent official rules. In India, an elaborate network of brokers, aggregators and consultants mediate between firms and governments in land acquisitions. During fieldwork in India, I found local government land offices with six or seven workers teaming up with an army of 50-plus middlemen who sat right outside and had easy access to the officials within. These middle men look into title deeds and ownership histories for a fee and work with bureaucrats to illegally fudge and clean up land records. Middle men also peddle information about who is facing hard times and will sell land easily and who will not. They may work with land aggregators employed by big companies to put together large, commercially viable parcels of land. In a densely populated country with great pressure on natural resources this has serious social implications. National and sub-national states are falling over each other to facilitate land deals in the name of attracting capital. The elites that control these states are also ensuring their longevity through the facilitation of prestigious land deals for private investors. Being pro-business is generally seen as a badge of honour and is projected as a plus point for politicians in election campaigns. Among the more humble collaborators in the global land grab, middle men – and the shadowy institutions through which they operate – must be understood in the context of high unemployment, which make land work attractive. And, understandably, like anyone these are people with aspirations for consumption and social mobility. The flashy cell phone, the proximity to rich and powerful people, the ability to get things done, all these indications of rising status are more likely to flow on from having been involved in a successful land transaction than by sitting outside a job centre. As we know from the history of European colonialism, the land grab would not have been possible without collaborators on the ground – local princelings and administrators were the linchpins of the colonial project. In enabling the transfer of power, they were able to enhance their own influence. Colonial-era princelings and administators have now given way to accommodating politicians, bureaucrats, middlemen and mediators of various types. As such, today’s story of globally traded land plays out along similar lines to colonial times."
"The climate crisis will not be formally discussed at the G7 summit in June next year, Donald Trump’s acting White House chief of staff said on Thursday. “Climate change will not be on the agenda,” Mick Mulvaney told reporters, without elaborating.  Mulvaney announced that the 2020 summit of seven of the world’s most powerful industrialised countries will take place at the National Doral Miami, one of the president’s golf resorts in Florida, despite widespread ethics concerns and an ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump’s conduct. From weakening regulation on vehicle emissions to blocking warnings about how coastal parks could flood and withdrawing funding for conservation programs, the Trump administration is accused of consistently ignoring, burying and undermining climate science. The White House’s stance is likely to be widely criticized, possibly even by members of the president’s own party. Florida is on the frontline of the climate crisis, facing ever stronger hurricanes and rising sea levels. While the state’s elected leaders had long denied climate science, they have recently started to change their tune. In August, the Republican senator Marco Rubio wrote that “climate change is a real problem”. The state’s recently elected Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has hired the ex-hostage negotiator Dr Julia Nesheiwat as the state’s first chief resilience officer in charge of preparing Florida “for the environmental, physical and economic impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise”. Gabriel Filippelli, a climate scientist who advised the state department under the Obama administration, criticized the administration for ignoring the crisis. “It means that irony is definitely NOT on the agenda!” Filippelli said on Twitter, referring to the decision to ignore the source of rising temperatures and sea-level rise at an international meeting outside of one of the country’s most climate-vulnerable cities. Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser to Bill Clinton, said Trump won’t be able to prevent other countries from discussing the crisis anyway. “The other nations will no doubt bring up climate change in both an economic and security context,” Bledsoe said. “The issue is going to come up frequently because it is increasingly a matter of public safety, national security and the economic costs of impacts.” But even if climate were on the agenda, Bledsoe said: “It’s not like under Trump there were going to be any big breakthroughs anyway.” “It’s deeply ironic that the US state most vulnerable immediately to climate change impacts will host a meeting at which global leaders will be forced by the US to largely ignore the topic,” Bledsoe added."
"Labour will unveil plans to create a carbon-neutral energy system by the 2030s including insulation upgrades for every home in the UK and enough new solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches. The party will set out its fast-track climate strategy on Thursday after adopting plans to work towards a net-zero carbon economy two decades ahead of the government’s legally binding 2050 target. The plan includes 30 recommendations to tackle emissions from the energy system, including home energy efficiency upgrades such as insulation and double glazing that will focus first on damp homes and areas suffering fuel poverty. The party also plans to install 8m electric heat pumps to help wean Britain off its use of gas heating, and build another 7,000 offshore and 2,000 onshore wind turbines to help clean up the UK’s electricity supply. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said the report would kickstart Labour’s Green Industrial Revolution – but the next five years will be crucial. “The Labour party has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world and is the only party turning their targets into detailed, credible plans to tackle the climate and environmental crisis,” she said. “The recommendations in this report could put the UK on track for a zero-carbon energy system during the 2030s, but only if rapid progress is made early on. The next five years are therefore crucial.” The plan emerged after the party revealed a wide-ranging set of climate measures at its party conference in Brighton last month. They included a £250bn transformation fund to help drive its plans for a “green industrial revolution”, including a £3.4bn national network of electric vehicle charging points and a vow to ban sales of new fossil fuel cars by 2030. The party’s report estimates that the investment in clean electricity and home efficiency projects could create 850,000 new skilled jobs in the green industry and increase household incomes by 2% by boosting employment, capital investment and labour productivity. The economic predictions were prepared by a team of economists at the Sustainability Research Institute, backed by the University of Leeds, who were tasked with analysing the impact of the plans over the decade from 2020 to 2030. Labour’s plan also has the backing of a panel of energy experts and academics who have signed up to a statement in support of the plan. The statement confirms that Labour’s energy plan is “feasible” and does not rely on “clearly implausible or inappropriate” measures to increase the UK’s low-carbon energy by 2030.  Long-Bailey said the party was working with trade unions to “ensure that the changes to our energy system will be planned democratically, with the interests of workers and local communities at the heart of the transition”. Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said “the bold report” showed the scale of investment that will be required to deal with the climate emergency. “The report is right to say that we can’t hit net zero if we don’t immediately get on with delivering lots more renewable power, insulating homes and buildings and trialling at scale the potential solutions to heat decarbonisation. This all costs money, but investing more now will bring enormous benefits,” she said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago NTZ wrote about a recently published brochure released by the Umweltbundesamt (UBA), which is Germany’s version of the EPA.

UBA Director Jochen Flasbarth lost control of the agency to radical zealots, now under massive fire. Photo: UBA.
The notorious brochure not only included an alarmist summary of climate science today, but also contained a sort of “black list” of US and German skeptics, portraying them as “spreaders of half-truths and misinformation”.
In that article I expressed doubts about this brochure holding up legally, and said we likely have not heard the last of this story. Boy was I right! Hat-tip Bernd Felsche.
Henryk Broder sees parallels with dark regimes
For starters, yesterday, flagship national daily Die Welt, one of the targets of the UBA brochure, published a commentary written by veteran, renowned journalist Henryk Broder. The title: A government agency declares the climate debate ended.
What follows are some of Broder’s comments on the notorious witch-hunting UBA brochure:
The UBA Environmental Agency claims to have the power of authority when it comes to climate change and has put some journalists on the pillory in the debate. Such an approach reminds us of the Reichskulturkammer and the East German regime.”
Broder writes that one has to be careful before making Nazi comparisons, but says “sometimes there are stunning similarities or parallels that bear witness to an amazing continuity of thought and action.” He writes:
There was a Reich Chamber of Films that controlled German film-making. Only members of the Reich Chamber of Films were allowed to work in film production. Every one else was forbidden to work in that occupation. The same rule applied for the Reich Chamber of Theatre, Reich Chamber of the Press, Reich Chamber of Broadcasting, Reich Chamber of Music, and the Reich Chamber of Arts. All these chambers operated under the umbrella of the Reichskulturkammer (RKK) [Reich Chamber of Culture], which was created by the Reich Minister for Education and Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels.
At the end of the Third Reich, the RKK and its departments disappeared into the rubble of German history. And up to today no one has ever proposed a new founding or re-establishment of such an institution. However: There is now a ‘Federal Chamber of Climate’ that is under the name of the Umweltbundesamt UBA.”

I’d like to remind readers that Broder is by no means exaggerating here. The brochure really is that nasty. Rahmstorf is all over it. The UBA brochure takes aim at American and German journalists and scientists only because they have a different opinion about how the world’s weather works over the long-term.
Broder writes that the UBA’s latest step “is an unprecedented case of government authoritarian intervention in a public discussion we’ve seen since World War II“, adding that the UBA has gone too far:
It draws the lines in the climate debate. That means it has ordered an end to the debate. And it determines who has the right to say something, and who is to remain silent.”
If there was ever proof that the warmists have lost the debate, the UBA has delivered it on a silver platter.

Broder concedes that perhaps the comparison to the third Reich is overdoing it, and so ends his commentary:
Therefore the question is not: ‘Is there climate change?’, but rather it is: ‘Are we on the way to a second East German Regime where the government is responsible for today’s weather forecast and the climate for the day after tomorrow?’ “
UBA brochure “a scandal”
Broder is just the latest to speak out on the UBA’s anti-democratic direction. Die Welt Editor in Chief Jan-Eric Peters wrote at his Facebook site:
One should use the term ‘scandal’ sparingly. However, when a government agency such as the German Environment Agency publishes a sort of black list on unliked journalists in a brochure funded by taxpayers, and requests them to stop spreading untruths, then this is indeed a scandal!”
At his klimazwiebel blog Hans von Storch writes in a reader comment writes:
I suspect that there is going to be public, critical interest aimed at this UBA Sleeping Beauty Castle.”
Even devout green protagonaists of man-made global warming are horrified by the UBA’s authoritarian brochure, like ZDF television. Very few media outlets are greener and more one-sided than Germany’s ZDF public television. ZDF journalist Reinhard Schlieker comments, writing that the “UBA goes after journalists and scientists who claim that man-made global warming has not been proven” and that the brochure comes across as an “official defamation for a ‘good cause'”. Suddenly, we see that the ZDF recognizes that the UBA has gone way over the line, and that there is no consensus in climate science after all.
The ZDF article continues, describing the “chamber” mentality of the brochure:
In Part B of the brochure that the science is settled and that cluelessness rules in the public debate which is influenced by somehow misled journalists. This part is based mainly on findings from Prof. Stefan Rahmstorf, who works at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and vehemently advocates that only qualified scientists should have the right to express views on climate science – everyone else should not be given the authority to do so.”
The ZDF continues:
The publication of the UBA could produce the impression with readers who are unfamiliar with the topic that, with these journalists and authors, we are dealing with intentional fraudsters who are controlled by outside forces and paid by lobbyists.”
Knowing what I know about some of those targeted by the UBA, you can be sure they are not going to take this “defamation” laying down. Expect much more to develop on this in the days and weeks ahead.
Oh, the ZDF ends with:
According to information from heute.de [ZDF] Those involved are are considering a lawsuit. Heute.de has sent a list of questions and requested an explanation.”

"Elephant populations in Africa have declined by 30% in just seven years, mainly thanks to poaching. If the trend continues, half the continent’s remaining elephants are predicted to disappear within the next decade.  The slaughter of so many huge animals, risking extinction, is rightly considered an ecological problem. But poaching and the illegal wildlife trade are also crimes and, as such, we can turn to criminology for possible solutions.  The so-called war on drugs means there is decades of experience in dealing with crimes related to trafficking. The major driver behind poaching is the illegal trade in body parts such as elephant tusks or rhino horns (although the demand for bush meat and exotic pets also plays a role, particularly for smaller animals). This illegal wildlife trade is a market – much like the global drug market. And although 50 years of the war on drugs has arguably achieved little success (illegal drugs are still widely used and readily available) we can still learn important lessons from the failures of drug policy.  There are many similarities between poaching and the cultivation of drug plants like the coca bush (from which cocaine is produced) and the opium poppy (the source of heroin). Both tend to happen in geographically remote and economically undeveloped areas beyond the effective reach of governments and their police forces.  Both poaching and drug cultivation are driven by consumer demand, with prices inflated by the fact that the products are illegal. Both tend to involve a combination of poor locals, who do the actual killing or growing, and professional criminals and organised crime groups, who mastermind the trafficking.  Global attempts at drug crop eradication, although often unsuccessful, have taught us many things. Just focusing on policing tends not to be effective: drug growers move deeper into the wilderness to avoid detection, or plant more crops in the first place to allow for some losses from eradication efforts. Militarisation of policing is matched by more militarised traffickers – just look at the Colombian or Mexican drug cartels, or the findings of the 2015 Small Arms Survey findings on armed poachers in Africa. Harsh sentencing and loss of income alienates local populations dependant on drug money for economic survival.  What we’ve learned from the war on drugs is that, alongside policing, there must be a focus on reducing demand for elephant ivory, rhino horn and other animal products. Authorities also need to provide alternative economic activities, and understand local political and cultural situations that find trafficking acceptable. This can be easily translated to poaching. The development of ecotourism places economic value on protecting wildlife, while education and political empowerment on a local level helps shift attitudes.  There are solid criminological theories behind these policy suggestions. For instance, one idea known as situational crime prevention focuses on reducing the opportunities for a criminal to commit a crime. This can mean making the crime harder to commit, making the target less attractive to the offender, or increasing the chance of the criminal being caught in the act.  Installing fences to keep poachers out of certain areas would be one obvious application of this idea. Another would be to increase the numbers of game wardens and boost other surveillance methods, such as aerial drones. A successful example here is the Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary in Uganda. Rhinos were once hunted to extinction in Uganda, but have been reintroduced in the 70km2 reserve. The sanctuary is surrounded by an electric fence and the rhinos living there are accompanied by armed wardens 24 hours a day. None of the rhinos have been lost to poachers, and the population is growing with 11 births since June 2009.  But we can’t build fences everywhere or employ enough wardens to offer all rhinos this level of protection. This is where other ideas come in, such as routine activity theory, which is related to situational prevention but focuses on the routines of offenders and potential offenders. Understanding how poachers operate – and, in particular, how they choose places to hunt – allows us to more successfully develop interventions. Some academics are developing computer models that map the decision making processes of poachers so we can understand where they’re likely to strike next, and deploy wardens accordingly. The poaching that is behind the declining elephant population (and so many other species), as well as other environmental problems like deforestation and pollution, are seen as ecological problems. And it is undoubtedly the case that the ecological sciences are best placed to help us understand the nature and intensity of particular environmental harms.  But this should also be seen as a criminological problem – particularly when we talk of the illegal wildlife trade, illegal logging or illegal waste. Criminological theories and tools have largely been developed in the context of urban crimes in the more developed “Western” nations, but they are applicable also to the environmental crimes of rural and wilderness areas around the globe. Ecologists, conservationists and criminologists should work together to tackle these contemporary challenges. Call it green criminology."
"Australia’s climate “debate” has been bogged in a culture war for decades. What should be a straightforward discussion of scientific fact and possible responses has instead become a mire of misinformation and denial that has paralysed policy, clogged investment, increased power prices and delayed change. National greenhouse gas emissions have risen every year since soon after the abolition of the carbon price in 2014, yet the prime minister stands on the international stage and insists Australia is “doing our bit on climate change and we reject any suggestion to the contrary”.  The climate crisis becomes more apparent by the day, with more summer days of extreme heat, more frequent and severe extreme weather events, bushfire seasons starting earlier, lasting longer and burning different types of forest, the Great Barrier Reef hit by successive years of bleaching and sea levels rising. What were once predictions by climate scientists are steadily becoming our lived reality and yet senior Australian ministers are still trying to make up their minds about whether humans have anything to do with global heating at all. Business has pleaded for years for clear and predictable policy to inform investment decisions, the Reserve Bank says climate change poses a systemic risk which could become a risk to financial stability and the corporate regulator has warned that climate is a foreseeable risk for many listed companies but our national policy remains sparse, ineffective and contradictory. The government’s own energy policy adviser says parts of it are “ill-advised”. A government fund pays millions to some farmers to preserve trees on their properties at the same time as tree-clearing laws are relaxed to allow massive new clearing by their neighbours. The “safeguard” mechanism, intended to stop industry increasing emissions to effectively wipe out the emission reductions purchased elsewhere, allows most factories and mines to increase their greenhouse pollution if they just ask. Scott Morrison was not invited to address the UN climate “action” summit because he was unwilling to speak about how Australia would decarbonise in the long term – which was the whole point of the meeting. So he gave a speech to the general assembly instead, attacking the UN climate agreement as an example of “negative globalism” – despite it being the only mechanism to tackle a global problem, despite Australia having benefited from a series of special deals through the international talks and despite its most recent commitment having been made by his own Coalition. Now, as students and citizens take to the streets in utter despair, many of the same politicians responsible for these wickedly wasted decades, and some of the same columnists who have cheered them on, have the temerity to attack the protesters for not coming up with considered policy responses. From its launch six years ago, Guardian Australia has provided clear and factual reporting about the climate crisis, the science, the impacts and the many attempted policy responses, and unflinching analysis of Australia’s action, and inaction. Our in-depth series including Our Wide Brown Land, Great Barrier Reef In Crisis, the New Normal: How Climate Change is Making Droughts Worse, Murray Darling: When the River Runs Dry, the carbon clock, our fact-checks, political analysis and commentary have all been informed by a determination to neither sensationalise nor recoil from the facts. Our readers tell us through their attention, their responses and their support that this is reporting they value. We now have three dedicated environment reporters in Australia, who work with colleagues around the globe. But we do not see environment reporting as separate. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our lifetimes, and informs all our journalism, across business, science, politics, lifestyle and culture. We have considered the language we use and decided to call this an emergency and a crisis, because that is what the science tells us it is. We are also auditing the environmental impact of our own operations. As Prof Ross Garnaut has set out, Australia has the potential to be a superpower of the post-carbon world economy if we could just set aside the self-defeating culture war and look to the future with imagination. But the solutions require complicated change, and understanding change requires careful, fact-based reporting, to inform and to counter the misinformation and well-funded PR campaigns designed to prolong the dangerous and unsustainable status quo. Guardian Australia will provide that reporting, because only a properly informed debate can help us avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis and steer us out of this cul-de sac and towards a low-carbon future. Your ongoing support is vital for us to deliver the best environmental reporting in Australia. Thank you to our supporters for helping to make this possible. If you would like to support the Guardian you can do so by making a single or recurring contribution or subscribing. "
"Bees provide us with an invaluable service by pollinating plants, an indispensable part of natural and agricultural ecosystems. This is why declining bee populations are such a big concern. Of course, bees don’t do this as a favour to us – pollination is a side effect of bees collecting nectar and pollen for their nests. But in order to understand bees better, we need to understand more about how they go about finding flowers and deciding how to make the most of them. And this is why I have spent my summers tracking female bumblebees. Alongside colleagues at Queen Mary University of London and at Rothamsted Research, we published our results in PLOS One, following for the first time every flight of forager bees over the course of their lives. This has given us remarkable insight into the very different strategies taken by different bees in their approach to carrying out their tasks.   From the first time they saw the light of day, emerging from their cells in the comb and knowing nothing of the world around them, we followed four bees as they learned and became seasoned foragers, until their deaths. Because bees are so tiny, GPS trackers or radio collars are far too large and heavy for them. Instead we used harmonic radar to track the bees, which is excellent at tracking moving objects through cluttered environments full of flowers, hedges, trees, buildings, and other bees. This involves attaching a small, very light electronic transponder to the bee’s back which transforms and reflects the signal in such a way that we can identify the bee. The radar scans the landscape once every three seconds, each time reporting the bee’s position. We used large earth bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) which were bred in captivity, so we knew they were ignorant of the world at the beginning of the experiment. And then we watched their lives unfold over several weeks until, one by one, each left the nest and never returned home.  Observing how the flight of each bee changed throughout her life offers an insight into how bees find food, and how they balance the desire to explore and find new sources of nectar with the need to provide food for the nest.  All our bees began their lives making long, convoluted flights, looping unpredictably around the landscape. They thoroughly surveyed their local area, stopping frequently to sample the flowers available.  However, after only a few such flights most abruptly changed their behaviour, replacing the long exploratory loops with direct, efficient flights to a single flower source they had learned. Most of the rest of their lives was spent diligently exploiting flowers from the locations they had learned. From recording the bees’ movements we can tell that nearly all discovered their favourite flower patches within their first few flights. One bee abruptly switched her flight path, heading directly toward a place she had discovered on her first ever flight nine days earlier. Until then, she’d never returned, which suggests she was able to remember it all that time. So it seems that bees change their behaviour, from exploration to exploitation, over the course of their lives. Which is not to say that all bees are identical little automata, though. What really struck us about our bees was how different they were from each other.  While our most diligent bee (A) shuttled back and forth to a single foraging patch, another was a lifetime vagabond (B), who spent most of her time roaming the landscape unpredictably, visiting and feeding in patches she’d never seen before. Our bees differed strikingly in other ways: the number of flights they undertook, the amount of time they spent in and outside the nest, and the favourite areas they chose to feed. These factors must lead to huge differences in the amount and quality of food being contributed to the colony by different bees, so we’re really interested to try to discover how common these different strategies are, and whether the colony gains an advantage from having some bees with a roaming lifestyle, or whether they’re simply freeloaders, supported by their more dedicated sisters. Ultimately, each of our four bees met their fate between six and 15 days after birth. Two bees disappeared during what looked like typical foraging trips, which led us to suspect that they fell foul of predators such as crab spiders that lurk in flowers waiting to ambush insects. The other two flew off in unfamiliar directions, perhaps flying far enough from what they knew that they were unable to find their way home.  Though watching the flight of the bumblebee is fascinating, practically speaking these insights will help us understand how plant genes flow around the landscape. Insect-pollinated plants reproduce by persuading bees to carry their pollen from one plant to another. When inexperienced bees and vagabonds explore widely, sampling many flowers, they spread plant genes widely compared to when they change to more dedicated pollen and nectar collection. What we learn about why bees make these choices will help us manage our landscapes to make the most of what bees offer us – and how to help our friends the bees get the maximum benefit from the plants we provide for them."
"Kathleen Jamie recently spent “valuable minutes” of her life totting up all the books and authors who have been shortlisted for the prestigious Wainwright prize for British nature and travel writing. The tally is 26 books by men and 14 by women. For winners, the ratio is five men to one woman. Jamie – a poet whose genre-stretching first book of essays, 2005’s Findings, was a much-praised widening of the growing field of nature writing – is aghast at the preponderance of male nature writers. “Only 15 years ago,” she says when I meet her in her home city of Edinburgh, “nature writing was barely there. It seems very strange that this thing that barely existed can suddenly ignite. I hate to say it, but it has been colonised – by middle-class white men. I’m interested in how that’s happened. And if you understand how that’s happened, you understand the whole godforsaken political state of this country.” The cafe table is being softly thumped.   Jamie, whose new collection of essays, Surfacing, has just been published, is not a sore loser. She has never been nominated for the Wainwright because the prize wasn’t set up when her previous book, Sightlines, was published in 2012. And she’s won a bundle of awards over the course of her career, which began before university when she deposited a sheaf of poems on a publisher’s doorstep and saw them published in 1982. But she’s keenly observant not just of the male character of much nature writing but also of its middle and upper-class provenance. “Poetry has got much greater diversity, by a long shot … So why is that? Is it related to land and ownership? Abso-bloody-lutely.” Despite not hailing from a literary family, Jamie found her voice early. Her father was an accountant and her mother, a solicitor’s clerk, usually had a thriller on the go but Jamie was more inspired by her local library – and punk. “I was 15 in 1977 so you couldn’t avoid it. There was an energy to it that was very attractive.” Did that sensibility stay with you? “Definitely.” She began writing poetry at school (“Aye,” she says dismissively, “like most poets”) after she read one poet and thought she could do better. It is typical of Jamie that she still won’t name this poet.  John Berger called Jamie “a sorceress of the essay form” and, like her previous works, Surfacing is rich in connections and observations that grant the reader new ways of seeing – from the archeological bones that look “like broken biscuits” in their museum tin, to the Orkney bull “lost in his bull’s dream”.  “I did a long apprenticeship as a poet before I turned to non-fiction. People always say, ‘Oh, it’s astonishing.’ No, it’s not – just read poetry. It’s all in there. Mine and everybody else’s.” But, I can’t help wondering, where does her simile-making come from? “I don’t know. I love it. I’m not always aware of it. If I’m writing something and it just comes out of the tip of the pen, I go, ‘Yes!’” Jamie’s poetry offers a vivid take on familiar nature. There are mating frogs interrupted by a passing car that crushes them “into one – belly / to belly, tongue thrust utterly into soft brain”. And the swaying seaweed and jellyfish like “lost internal organs” that are visible from a glass-bottomed boat.  To such immaculate small portraits, Surfacing adds the same big themes of global heating and deep time that were tackled this year by the other leading voice in contemporary nature writing, Robert Macfarlane. Once criticised for being escapist, apolitical literature of consolation, nature writing is now grappling with the epic challenges of the Anthropocene, in Jamie’s case via visits to archeological digs in Alaska and Orkney, where ancient settlements have been revealed by climate-induced erosion. Like her previous books, Surfacing is a collection of what at first appear to be disparate essays. Jamie excavates long-forgotten memories in some, and then writes of two very different digs in northern lands that are as stark and beautiful as any nature writing but also witty and well-peopled – qualities less typical of the genre.  The Alaskan people are experiencing the climate crisis more dramatically than most of us. “They are moving the entire village I visited because the land is being swallowed up so fast. The tundra is catching fire, which they’ve never seen before. People who for many thousands of years were living with snow and ice have no snow and ice.” The climate crisis, says Jamie, “inevitably sends you back into the further reaches of time. I’m not knowledgeable about proper deep, geological time. My work is only concerned with 8,000 years, which is nothing.” As she writes in Surfacing, today’s global heating is a mere “warm bank holiday weekend”. Jamie is not a polemicist but hopes that her writing raises questions. She does not like the “nature writing” label. “Publishers and bookshops want a wee ticket to put on it. That’s not serving us well.” But she believes such writing can provide an alternative to mega-consumption. “I would like to think of nature writing as a nice little retreat. I don’t want it to be on the frontline. I want routes not to the barricades but to a more thoughtful way, a kinder way – more compassionate to ourselves and other creatures. “I’m not an activist. Maybe I ought to be but it’s really not where my talent lies. An activist knows what they want and they work out how to get it. More ‘creative’ people like me have no idea what we want until it’s done.” Writing her essay collections is like this, says Jamie: she does not plan particular “topics” – she almost spits out the word – but lets themes emerge instead. “There’s a point working on something when things start to cohere. It’s a bit like scrambled egg. It starts off as liquid in a pan and then it begins to clump. At some holistic moment, which is very rare and very lovely, you think, ‘Oh yes, that’s come together.’ And all you have to do is write it. That doesn’t happen very often.” Findings touched on her life as a busy mother of young children. In Surfacing, those children have left home – and old memories resurface. Women cannot divorce themselves from their life stages, she thinks: “It’s a bit silly to pretend that the complete chaos of family life is not determining what you can do. What I would like to think I’m doing is insisting on the validity of women’s experience through different phases – young motherhood, older middle age, hopefully old age – so you have a sense of a woman’s life and what you might call deep time.” Which returns us to women in nature writing. Many more women have been published recently, with big sellers by Helen Macdonald, Amy Liptrot and Isabella Tree. But Jamie still bemoans the lack of young, poor and non-white nature writers. She believes that they don’t often visit the countryside, but there is still nature in cities. “People are just too put upon, downtrodden, frightened, worried [to write],” she says. “So if you eliminate a whole class, you’re going to eliminate what goes with them – working-class music, acting, literature – a citizen’s wage would enable a cultural flourishing, a human flourishing, which is being squeezed out, especially with the younger ones.” Jamie sees hope in both Scotland’s political awakening – independence will be inevitable with Brexit, she thinks – and down an alleyway opposite where we chat. “Inside that doorway is Canongate Books and they’ve got a new award, the Nan Shepherd, for nature writing by people who don’t see themselves represented. I’ll be really interested to see what comes out of that – if there is an untapped voice.” That said, she’s still ambivalent about the “horrible business” of being shortlisted for awards. “Who is being served by this? It’s not the writer,” she says. Although one prize win enabled her to buy a new boiler, she felt she let her family down when she failed to win another. Her husband was gratifyingly angry too. “‘If they want a fucking drama, hire actors,’ he said,” remembers Jamie. “We’re poets, it’s not our job to provide drama.” • Surfacing by Kathleen Jamie is published by Sort of Books."

"Iceland is about to tap into water as hot as lava. Several kilometres below ground, a drilling rig named Thor will soon penetrate the area around a magma chamber, where molten rock from the inner Earth heats up water that has seeped through the seafloor. This water – up to 1,000°C and saturated with corrosive chemicals – will eventually be piped up to the surface and its heat turned into usable energy. It is a huge engineering challenge, and one which may usher in a new age of geothermal power production. Existing geothermal projects around the world need waters heated to less than 300°C, so why go to this extra effort and expense? The answer is simple: water at the most extreme temperatures exists in a state described as “supercritical”, where it behaves as neither a true liquid, nor a true gas, and is capable of retaining a phenomenal amount of energy. Supercritical water can generate up to ten times more power than conventional geothermal sources. Iceland is a nation built on about 130 volcanoes resting above a divergent plate boundary which brings a continuous supply of hot, fresh magma up from the mantle just a few kilometres below. Icelanders have capitalised on this, and now generate more than a quarter of their electricity through geothermal, accessing boiling temperature water within 2km of the surface. The Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) was set up to find out what happens at depths below 4km in the Icelandic crust. In 2009, during their first drilling leg, they accidentally hit a magma pocket, and eventually stabilised the system to create the hottest steam ever produced in geothermal exploration: 450°C.  The second borehole now being drilled aims to tap the deep circulating water which penetrates the rock around a magma chamber below the Reykjanes peninsula near Reykjavik. The embarrassment of geothermal riches on offer in Iceland is unusual, but by no means unique. Indeed, while the country has one of the highest geothermal electricity productions in terms of total energy share, it is neither the highest, nor is it in the top five countries for total geothermal capacity. In fact, the countries in the top five may come as a surprise. The absolute biggest geothermal electricity producer in the world is the US, with around 3,450 MW of capacity in 2015, largely centred in California (a typical nuclear power station produces around 1,000 MW). Next up are the Philippines and Indonesia, at 1,870 and 1,340 MW respectively. Mexico and New Zealand trail at a little over 1,000 MW each, and Iceland (665 MW) comes in seventh behind Italy (916 MW).  Volcanoes are the common factor in the geothermal resources of all these countries. The US has also utilised the enormous San Andreas fault zone and its ability to conduct heat and fluids through the crust. For geothermal energy to succeed there must be heat, it must be accessible, and you must be able to move water around it. These three simple requirements can be difficult to find together.  Across most of the planet the hot material is simply too deep down to be economically within reach. The temperature of the Earth’s crust generally increases by 25°C for every 1km depth; for geothermal to be economical that value must be nearer 50 or even 150°C/km. That means you need to be near something geologically unusual: either thinned crust (so you’re closer to the hot mantle), or features such as plate boundaries or volcanoes which can direct heat or magma toward the surface. If that condition is met you must still be able to move water around. Rocks are not all alike, as some can allow water to easily flow through the pores and boundaries between grains, while others are more like a barrier. If water cannot flow to the borehole then it cannot be brought to the surface.  If the hot area doesn’t have any natural water then engineers can pump some down. However, if the rocks prevent it flowing and dispersing then the water will simply cool the area immediately around the borehole, making it pointless in geothermal terms. As with gold, rare-earth elements or good farmland, the geology of an area controls access to this valuable resource. Anywhere with active volcanoes could potentially benefit from the high temperature geothermal exploration being pioneered by the IDDP. That includes every country around the Pacific Ring of Fire – an opportunity perhaps to extract some benefit from the volcanoes which dot their landscapes."
"At the end of last year, China announced a complete ban on its ivory trade and processing activities by the end of 2017. The news, a late Christmas gift to many conservationists, was greeted as a “game changer” by groups including the World Wildlife Fund, which says around 20,000 African elephants are being killed every year for their ivory. As the world’s largest consumer of ivory products, Chinese demand has seen poaching increase and ivory prices rise. The country has had a seemingly insatiable appetite for so-called “white gold”.  At a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) last September, a resolution was tabled which recommended that its 183 member states “close their domestic markets for commercial trade in raw and worked ivory as a matter of urgency”. China’s support of the resolution surprised many and led to it being adopted by consensus. The country had taken a big step in re-evaluating its relationship with ivory and its effect on the world’s elephants. The subsequent announcement on December 30 2016 saw China commit to closing up to 15 of its 34 ivory processing firms and 50 to 60 of its 130 licensed ivory retail shops by March 31 2017. The second stage will see China phase out the country’s remaining registered legal processors and traders by the end of the year.  China has a popular ivory carving industry with a history which stretches back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. To assist those who carry out this work, there will be schemes to assist ivory carvers with the transition into working with other mediums. “Master carvers” will be encouraged to work in museums and in the repair and maintenance of artistic and culturally significant ivory artefacts.  The Chinese move effectively brings to an end the future of the country’s domestic ivory market. But there are millions of pieces of (currently) legally owned ivory artefacts all over China which will have to be dealt with through a strict new management system. Ivory products will only be displayed in museums and art galleries for non-commercial purposes or exhibition and the giving and inheriting of ivory will still be allowed.  More worryingly, the Chinese ban on trade specifically excludes items described as “genuine antiques”. This exemption raises concerns that elephants will continue to be poached to supply an increased trade in “ghost ivory” (illegal ivory sold as antique legal ivory) as the legitimate market closes.   Another problem is that a large portion of China’s ivory trade will simply shift to Hong Kong, which is not subject to the Chinese ban. Hong Kong is the world’s biggest legal retail market for elephant ivory and a major transit hub for illegal imports. Hong Kong has itself pledged to phase out its domestic ivory market by 2021 and it is hoped that the Chinese announcement will encourage Hong Kong to speed up the timescale. But there is no guarantee this will happen. Concerns over the sale of “ghost ivory” alongside legitimate legal ivory pieces are even greater in Hong Kong. “Hong Kong ivory” has even come to be a derogatory term to describe new ivory masquerading as old.  This point was recently highlighted by British auctioneer James Lewis, who said of his experiences in Hong Kong: You see old ivory on the same shelf as new ivory. I realised then there’s a major market in the Far East that looks at ivory as a commodity as well as an art form, and that the old ivory market is fuelling modern ivory demand. But these concerns should not distract us from the positive aspects of China’s plans. In terms of addressing the decline in wild elephant populations and Asia’s attitudes to ivory, the Chinese ban can only be a good thing. Provided Beijing is able to police and manage the changes effectively it could even be the “game changer” conservationists hope for.  Just as importantly, the fact that China has gone so far and with such a strict time scale after years of negotiation could be the catalyst for other states such as Hong Kong, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam to follow suit. Demand for “white gold” has taken the elephant to the brink of extinction. Chinese remorse could be the species’ salvation."

By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
On May 10, 2013, at the online Austrian ORF, there was a rare interview with the CLOUD Experiment director of the European European Organization for Nuclear Research, Jasper Kirkby. Within the scope of the CLOUD project, it is being investigated to what extent solar activity has on cloud formation via the mechanism of cosmic radiation and the impact this could have on the Earth’s climate (see Chapter 6 of our book “Die kalte Sonne“). Here’s an excerpt of the worthwhile interview:
ORF: What is the relationship between solar activity and cosmic radiation?
Kirkby: Cosmic radiation consists of high energy, charged particles. When they reach our solar system, they are deflected away by the magnetic field of the sun. Foremost by the magnetic field of the solar plasma. When the sun is active, less cosmic radiation reaches the Earth. The relationship to the solar cycle: When there are many sunspots, the Earth receives 10 – 30% less cosmic radiation.
Is this relationship sure?
Yes, it is solidly confirmed. We also know that cosmic radiation ionizes every cubic centimeter of the Earth’s atmosphere. Unsure so far is whether or not this also could have a climatic impact. Clouds are extremely important for the Earth’s climate. If I could magically eliminate all clouds from the atmosphere, then 30 watts of additional heat energy would reach every square meter of the Earth.
To put this number into context: The warming of the atmosphere through the impacts of man is currently pegged at 1.5 watts per square meter. Small variations in cloud cover could have large impacts.
What do your experiments show?
At this point in time we cannot say if cosmic radiation impacts the climate. So far up to now we have investigated the production of condensation nuclei for cloud droplets – particularly those that are formed from gas, i.e. gas-to-particle-conversion”. They represent about half of the condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. The remaining nuclei come from soot and dust.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




What gases are involved in this process?
We have looked at sulfuric acid and ammonia. The results of the first trials: Cosmic radiation enhances the formation of condensation nuclei from gases by a factor of 10. But that alone is too little to have a significant impact on cloud formation. According to our latest experiments, there has to be another gas or vapor involved that enhances this process. We suspect organic substances.
Which ones?
The results are currently being reviewed by a journal. Unfortunately I can’t tell you more. Only this much: The results are very interesting. Over the course of the year there are going to be some publications on the subject.
Let’s assume that you are able to show that cosmic radiation indeed does contribute a lot to cloud formation. What would that mean?
I think that the experiments are important in two ways. Firstly, they would show that there is a natural source to climate change. And the other point is that it would change our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. We know quite a bit about greenhouse gases. What we know little about are aerosols. These are particles that come from industry floating in the atmosphere. They surely have a cooling effect. However, we have no idea just how great this effect is. It may be small, but it may be very big. Maybe it is even big enough to offset the additional CO2 in the atmosphere.. We don’t know.

"In the 18 months I’ve lived in America, as editor of the Guardian’s US edition, this country has been hit by a string of natural disasters.  Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, killing 3,057 people. The Camp fire, the most destructive wildfire in California’s history, leveled 18,000 buildings, displaced 50,000 people and left 86 dead. Since March, record floods in the midwest have swamped a million acres of farmland, threatening the nation’s grain supply. In the White House there is a president who denies climate science even though Americans can see the climate is changing. In Iowa, in the heart of the midwest, farmers who have tended the land for centuries now openly talk about the impact of the climate crisis. They have no choice – it is threatening their livelihoods. In California, drought in recent years has been so severe that groundwater depletion means the land has sunk under their feet. Florida is planning to spend $4bn to counteract the effects of sea-level rise. And yet the public debate about the climate crisis is much less evident here than in Europe. One of the most surprising observations of my first year in America is the gulf in coverage between the US and Europe. And not just climate, but a host of other environmental threats, from the scourge of ocean plastic to toxic chemicals in the US food supply. When the UN released a landmark report last October warning we have just 12 years left to radically slash global carbon emissions and stave off disaster, only 22 of the 50 biggest newspapers in America covered it. The US media has, in some cases, a lot of ground to make up. As Mark Hertsgaard and Kyle Pope have noted, US news organizations fell for the fossil industry’s PR playbook in the 80s, 90s and into the 00s when they successfully repositioned “global warming as theory, not fact”. In his recent book Falter, Bill McKibben calls this “the most consequential cover-up in human history”. Big money and Washington lobbying have negatively influenced policy debates in the US – and the way in which climate has been reported is one of the most egregious examples of that influence. We need loud voices raised against falsehoods, special interests and the corrosive impact of big money. At the Guardian, we have, for years, recognised that the escalating climate and environmental crisis is the defining issue of our lifetime. Today, we’re making a pledge to ourselves and our readers – journalistically and institutionally – on how to address the climate crisis we are facing. This pledge is particularly crucial in the US, where the so-called science presented by the fossil-fuel industry helped drive a totally false debate on the nature of the crisis.  In the coming months, we will strengthen our climate coverage in significant ways, from being the lead partner in Covering Climate Now (an initiative to improve media coverage of climate to placing the climate crisis at the heart of our 2020 coverage). And next week, we launch “Our Unequal Earth” – a year-long project on environmental justice, exploring how poor and vulnerable communities are hardest hit by the climate crisis. This expanded commitment to covering climate change is made possible with the continued support of our readers. This support has helped us to significantly strengthen our US environment team. A few weeks ago I spoke at an event in Los Angeles about the role of journalism in pursuing social and environmental justice. It is absolutely central to what we do. I told the audience that without that purpose guiding our journalism there is little reason to come to work. Fighting for social and environmental justice – whether for overlooked, marginalised communities, or an ailing Earth – is at the core of what we have to do. But we can only do that with your support. That’s what gives us the financial wherewithal and the motor energy to keep on fighting. After the event in LA I intended to slip away and get back to my hotel. But as it finished and we left the stage, I had a long line of people come to me and talk about why they value the Guardian. Perhaps none of those people realised how much I valued hearing them. These issues matter to me, but only because they matter to you. Just as I was, finally, about to leave, an older woman approached me and said: “I’ve been waiting to speak to you, but I’m sure you had lots of important conversations to have before you met me. Well, I just wanted to say that I don’t know what I would do without the Guardian. You are needed so much more right now. Please keep doing what you are doing.” That was the most important conversation I had that evening."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week hard-hitting Swiss weekly Weltwoche published a revealing interview with IPCC WG-1 Co-Chair Thomas Stocker. The interview was conducted by Markus Schär.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning was given permission to republish the interview at the Die kalte Sonne site here, adding his rebuttals and corrections. Lüning writes: “Thomas Stocker showed a number of memory lapses in the Weltwoche-Interview.”
What follows is the interview along with Lüning’s rebuttals in English. Because of the interview’s length, it will appear in 3 or 4 parts over the next few days. Some parts have been slightly shortened and edited.
The Stocker interview not only exposes misleading science, but also provides good hints as to how the IPCC intends to approach its 5th report.
INTERVIEW

WELTWOCHE: How do you explain the cold winters of the last years?
STOCKER: There’s been no long series of cold winters in Switzerland, every one was different. Basically I tell people, “You can’t look at the temperatures of one winter and at one station. Instead many years of very precise observations have to considered if you want to see a long-term trend.” And especially this winter there are ideas for explanations in the science. 
Lüning: Every winter was different? To the contrary the last five years indeed do have something in common. Meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net reported in February 2013: “With the current winter we now have five consecutive colder-than-normal winters.” This is visibly very awkward for Stocker, and so he just doesn’t mention it and hopes no one will notice.
WELTWOCHE: Some colleagues are aggressively pursuing the hypothesis that the cold winters are due to melting ice in the Arctic.
STOCKER: Yes, there are indications from a couple of studies – though I wouldn’t call it anything robust at this point – that the low sea ice cover is having an impact on the statistics of the frequency of high pressure regions. This is having a strong impact on the weather events at our latitudes, as we are currently experiencing now.
WELTWOCHE: The German colleagues who developed this hypothesis presented it to the media as truth.
STOCKER: I don’t pay so much attention to what these colleagues are saying, and it is not for me to comment on. The following is clear: We have to rationally approach the problem of communicating on the big problem of climate warming, that is to stick to the facts – this is valid for all sides. That’s a big challenge today when everything has to fit in the 140 characters of a tweet. With such a complex issue, it just doesn’t work: On one hand we have to communicate the facts, and on other hand also the uncertainties.
WELTWOCHE: The colleagues are tweeting these findings like they are sure: “The cold winters stem from the climate warming.”
STOCKER: That’s the statement from one ot two publications, but it’s no scientific consensus; forming a consensus is a tough job. At the IPCC we just can’t take every single paper from all institutes worldwide. It’s possible that in the coming report there will be a statement on that, on how ice cover in the Arctic influences the statistics of high pressure regions. But for now we are working on it.
Lüning: That’s a major blow to his colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), who quickly thought up the Arctic ice theory after the first cold winters showed up. Totally convinced, the dubious patchwork was presented to the media as the solution to the cold winter paradox. But now it’s official: the IPCC Co-Chair does not see any robust science in the Potsdam theory and no scientific consensus.
Here it would have been nice if Stocker had brought up another study on this, like the one from Mike Lockwood et al from 2010. This paper found a really convincing mechanism where weak solar phases could lead to cold European winters. Moreover, from Stocker’s very own institute, the Oeschger Centre for Climate Science in Bern, came a study in January 2013 written by Ulf Büntgen confirming that Eastern European cold phases over the last 1000 years occurred during weak periods of solar activity (see our blog article”Osteuropäische Kälteperioden während solarer Schwächephasen“). It’s hard to believe that Stocker suddenly cannot remember the latest research results coming from his very own institute.
WELTWOCHE: Us lay-people would much prefer to have experts who can tell us what’s ahead, and not experts who later explain why something didn’t happen like it was supposed to.
STOCKER: That’s right. That’s why at the IPCC we look back regularly: What did we say in the first report in 1990, the second in 1995, the third in 2001 and the fourth in 2007? We can show that the projections of the global mean temperature were extremely good already back in 1990. At the time we already had the most important blocks of the science in place in order to – of course within the uncertainties – reliably estimate the temperature development. But we never claimed, and we aren’t claiming now, that we can project the temperature 10 years down the road. Such a short-term forecast is not possible, and will never be possible. There’s the trend, and it will be overlaid with short term fluctuations. We’ve always communicated that.

Lüning: At this point Stocker is digging himself into a hole. Stocker claims outright that the IPCC projections were “extremely good“. This is untrue – and Stocker knows it. The real observed, measured temperature development is now departing from the IPCC projection range, and Stocker is keeping completely quiet about this fact, insisting the false projections are “extremely good”. Here he is intentionally misleading the unfamiliar readers. But luckily Weltwoche did not fall for his deception. Later in the interview Weltwoche comes back and presses Stocker on the point. But first Weltwoche repeats a question that Stocker had attempted to dodge.
WELTWOCHE: We would tend to believe the cold winter theory had it not come from the very same people who just ten years ago told us children would not know what snow is.
STOCKER: That’s why the IPCC avoids making such statements.
Here Stocker throws his climate-alarmist colleague Mojib Latif under the bus and distances himself from the failed predictions and media gaffe. A clever move on his part. Stocker is then asked once more about the failed IPCC projections.
WELTWOCHE: You emphasized that you had correctly predicted the temperature development. But that’s hotly disputed. In the draft of your report in the fall of 2012, you depicted a chart that showed the temperatures of the last years being below all the projections of the IPCC. 
STOCKER: At the moment we find ourselves at the lower limit when you look at the last 10 years, but still within the communicated uncertainties.
Lüning: At this point Stocker was forced to admit after all that the IPCC’s projections were not “extremely good”, like he had claimed earlier. But hey, it was worth the try. Most other newspapers would not have noticed his error and Stocker’s version would have gotten through. Weltwoche turns up the heat:
WELTWOCHE: The very uncertain uncertainties 
STOCKER: This is precisely why we specify uncertainties. But we also have to look back: Were there earlier periods where the global mean temperature stagnated over 10 or 15 years? Indeed we find several such windows in the last 100 years. So it’s nothing really unusual. 
Lüning: Of course there have been cold phases in the past. And we noticed that the cold was always in sync with the cold Pacific and Atlantic Ocean cycles. The IPCC just doesn’t want to acknowledge this relationship and stubbornly claims the cold would never follow any system and would just disappear. This is the only way that the IPCC could so grandly fail with the temperature development of the last one and a half decades. At about 2000 the PDO began its downward phase. So it was clear from the start that we should expect cooling for the coming decades. If the IPCC had accepted this empirical forecasting tool earlier, it would have one less problem to deal with today. However, there’s a good reason why the IPCC refused to acknowledge the PDO’s obvious impact on the global temperature development: During the main warming phase of 1977-2000 the PDO climbed and remained at a warm plateau, taking the global temperature up a few tenths of a degree with it. These were a few tenths of a degree that the IPCC had already chalked up to CO2.
Weltwoche then brought up a topic over which some members of the IPCC have had sleepless nights:
WELTWOCHE: IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri recently admitted that there has not been any global warming for 17 years.
STOCKER: I can’t tell other colleagues what to say.
Lüning: What is he saying? Isn’t Stocker aware of the real measured temperature curve? The stop in warming is a fact. Even Pachauri admits it. Does Stocker seriously believe Pachauri made a mistake here? Weltwoche:
WELTWOCHE: He’s your boss.
STOCKER: My function together with the international team of authors is to summarize the science; that’s what we are doing right now. From the studies we are addressing the following: a) is such a stagnation usual, b) are we going to see such phases also in the future, and c) this is the most important point, there are in the meantime over 100 simulations of climate development using the latest models. The question is: Do we see simulations that show no warming between 1998 and 2012? We do find such simulations, not many, but one or two. We are simply living in a realisation of a climate system with its chaos of natural variability – in the single one observed of many possible physical ones.
Lüning: Here Stocker is spreading the full superbness of the IPCC. Using lots of impressive words, he’s trying to come up with reasons for the warming stop, but is sadly unable to come up with anything convincing. As expected, Stocker pulls out the old chaos models from his hat. He’s hoping that of the hundreds of simulations carried out, a few will be able to show a warming stop over the last 15 years. This would then be the proof that the models are “extremely good”.  Is Stocker really so naive to think that this would actually serve as proof? This would be like someone picking all 49 numbers of a lottery and then later claiming he picked the 6 correct numbers!

"Imagine that years of drought have forced you to graze your cattle on sparse grass in an open desert landscape, far from permanent settlements. The nearest small shop is 25 miles away, a journey normally made by donkey. Now imagine your one donkey is being mauled to death by a pride of lions, only yards from the flimsy tent that is your shelter. This was the scene I encountered in November 2015, while travelling through Purros Conservancy in north-west Namibia’s Kunene region with two elderly Khoe-speaking people – Michael Ganaseb and Christophine Tauros – in the course of oral history research in the area. Both had grown up in this desert landscape. Our small party stopped at a remote Herero cattle-post close to Tauros’ grandfather’s grave. Khoe and Herero-speaking peoples both have long histories of dwelling in north-west Namibia, with sometimes different perspectives on living with indigenous fauna in the area. At this time, drought was causing Herero-speaking herders to disperse with their livestock to wherever they could find a few remnant tufts of perennial grasses.  Sheltered only by a made-in-China tent, the lone herdsman we met here was angry. The previous night a group of lions had killed his donkey. He had poisoned the donkey’s flesh in retaliation for the attack.  We related this incident to the dedicated founder of the Desert Lion Conservation Project, Philip Stander, who tracks the movement of Namibia’s special desert-adapted lions. He suggested that a group of five brothers named the “Musketeers” – stars of the 2015 National Geographic film Vanishing Kings: Lions of the Namib – may have been responsible.  A few days later I encountered the Musketeers, close to Namibia’s spectacular Skeleton Coast, while recording memories of places previously inhabited by Ganaseb’s brother Noag, and their cousin Franz ||Höeb (the two lines signify a “click consonant” in Khoe-languages). They claimed that in the past people did not have problems with “wild animals” – they would simply ask them nicely to move, so that the people could be on their way. Some elderly Khoe-speaking people continue to practice these rituals, asking both known ancestors and anonymous spirits of the dead to protect them from lions. Whimsical perhaps, but these narratives illustrate variety in local experiences of lions. Less than a year later, on August 9 2016, three of the Musketeers were killed in Purros Conservancy by poison set by cattle farmers. These lions had been troubling people for some time. The radio collars that tracked their movements were burnt. Tragically, only days earlier Namibia’s Ministry of Environment and Tourism had approved the transport of these three lions and their remaining brother to a national park where they would be kept apart from farmers and their livestock. But as the three lions returned from unreachable mountainous areas they encountered a cattle-post, where they slaughtered a donkey and whose poisoned flesh later killed them. The ministry is seeking criminal charges. Although one of the worst cases, this is only the latest in a series of recent conflicts between humans and lions in the area. In June 2016, a lioness was shot dead after a bull was killed by a pride of lions near the settlement of Otjindakui. Earlier that month, the first Musketeer to be killed died from a bullet wound near a temporary cattle-post in the region. These incidents reflect recent expansion in lion distribution in Namibia’s Kunene region. A result is economic damage, borne disproportionately by unlucky farmers. Compensation, when received, may not cover the cost of a lost cow or bull. As such, increasing lion numbers cause tour guides to celebrate while locals are dismayed. Clashes between humans and lions in a region celebrated by tourists and conservationists have encouraged significant investment in addressing human-wildlife conflict. Community game guards were established in the early 1980s, beginning a widely praised model of “community-based natural resources management” financed by donors including the WWF and the US and UK international aid departments.  Since 1996 indigenous Namibians have been able to legally derive incomes from wildlife in recognised territories managed as “conservancies”. The vision is that this income will increase the value of indigenous fauna and flora as economically-productive resources, countering the costs to other livelihood activities of sharing land with wildlife whilst offering routes towards rural development. The success of these conservancies, combined until recently with favourable wetter climatic conditions since the mid-1990s, has led to increasing lion populations. Efforts to smooth over resulting tensions with local people include a compensation scheme for herders paid for by safari operators; a community “lion task force” and “lion rangers” who monitor lion movements and advise herders when to move away; lion proof kraals (cattle pens); and bright lights, ultra-sound and fireworks to discourage lions from approaching settlements. These initiatives do much to mitigate the conflict. But current drought is causing herders to overlap with lion, the former seeking dispersed grazing, the latter dispersed prey animals. Expanding tourism has encouraged lions to become more confident around humans. And prey animals like zebra and antelope already affected by drought may be reduced further by shoot-to-sell policies, whereby conservancies sell rights to outside contractors to shoot animals to supply butcheries elsewhere. Human-lion conflicts can also act as a flash-point for other frustrations. Livestock herders in communal areas are experiencing punitive measures for trying to protect their animals in a context of historical land appropriation that squeezed indigenous Namibians into less productive landscapes. Namibia’s commercial (and still largely white-owned) farming areas sometimes experience lion attacks but benefited historically from significant clearance of major predators. One celebrated former warden of Etosha National Park killed 75 lions to help farmers protect their cattle, before being employed in conservation in 1958.  Today, wealthy visitors from afar hunt “game” animals as trophies, including the occasional lion. Many conservancies are financed significantly by trophy-hunting and tourism, and some local people succeed as hunting and tourism professionals. But these benefits aren’t evenly distributed, and can cause distrust over new inequalities linked with conservancy management and private sector investments. All these factors contribute to the intractable nature of the human-lion conflict. This problem is not about to disappear. At the same time, local people with different histories have different ideas about how to live with lions. Learning more about positive stories of how people lived with predators in the past may yet help people and lions to live alongside each other into the future."
"In 1974, the World Food Conference declared that: “Every man, woman and child has the inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition in order to develop their physical and mental faculties.” The conference set as its goal the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition within a decade.  Two decades later, in 1996, the World Food Summit was assembled in an explicit admission that this goal had not been met. More than 10,000 participants from 195 countries gathered in Rome and, over five days of intense discussion, set a target of reducing by half the number of undernourished people by no later than 2015. Food security was defined in the following declaration: Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. The summit set out a seven-point plan of action, including managing population growth and migration, reducing poverty and promoting peace and stability. Ambitious goals which, so far, have failed with most future predictions showing things are going to get worse.  Four years ago, I started to work directly in the world of food security research and if there is one thing that I have learned in the intervening period it is that it is complicated. Here are some of the factors that have made it so difficult to fulfil those ambitious goals.   Population growth The current global population is 7.4 billion and it is growing rapidly. We are expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. At the same time income levels are expected to increase. In order to feed this larger and richer population food demand is therefore expected to increase by 70% by 2050. However, neither the growth nor the increase in wealth is expected to be evenly distributed. India, China and Africa are predicted to make up an increasing share of the world population and India and China expected to make up 50% of the global middle class consumption by 2050. This means that the demands for food will obviously be greater in those areas with larger populations, but in countries where there is also an increase in wealth there is likely to be an increase in demand for less healthy and less environmentally friendly Western-style diets. Climate change: Our ability to provide food for this growing population will be seriously affected by the changing climate. Current predictions for global warming are for an increase in temperature ranging from 0.6℃ to 4℃ use sy by 2099. The Paris climate agreement sets out a global action plan to limit global warming this century to 2℃. This will be a difficult target to achieve both in the light of Donald Trump’s (at least pre-election) declaration that he would cancel the agreement, but also given the expected increase in food demand with agri-food accounting for about 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions. However, the impact of these predicted changes will not be evenly distributed. The Met office has produced a tool which allows us to investigate the impact of climate change on food insecurity and which shows that under all scenarios Africa is the most vulnerable to food insecurities. But even within Africa some countries are more vulnerable than others, with Niger, Somalia and Mauritania the most vulnerable and South Africa and Algeria the least. Using the same tool, we can see that in Asia there are currently medium levels of vulnerability to food insecurity with Mongolia and the Philippines the most vulnerable. Under many climate change scenarios this vulnerability increases across Asia but countries such as Burma and Papua New Guinea show the largest increases. These results mean that the spatial scale at which we consider food security is very important and mitigation plans which might be put into place to deal with these vulnerabilities need to take these geographical differences into account. Malnutrition: Today the world faces a double burden of malnutrition that includes both under-nutrition and obesity. In 2015, more than 1.9 billion adults worldwide were overweight while 462m were underweight. This divide is not simply between the developed and developing world, low and middle-income countries are now seeing a rise in childhood obesity and this is increasing at a faster rate than in richer nations. This is related to the increase in wealth and changes in diet discussed earlier.   Given these issues, different countries will need different solutions. Africa is going to have to deal with the double burden of increasing populations and more drought risk. Solutions in Africa need to focus on sustainable intensification with better solutions in increased yield and reducing waste through pests, diseases and storage. One technological solution is to develop drought-resistant crops, although the efficacy of this is debated. The issue here is not the technology but how to distribute it.  According to the Global Plant Council, while some farmers are using these drought-resistant varieties successfully (5m smallholder farmers in 2014), the adoption of these seeds varies from country to country. Some farmers are unaware of the availability of the seeds and others are unable to either access or afford them. In the developed world, experts are more concerned by the health risks associated with obesity and our focus needs to be on sustainable nutrition. There is a lot of evidence that diets which are healthier for us as individuals are also better for the environment. No one has yet identified an “ideal diet” but according to a Food and Climate Research Network report in 2014, the lower the meat, fish and dairy content of a diet, the lower the environmental impact. However, nutritionally, that will mean that reduced meat intakes need to be compensated for with increases in the quantity and diversity of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and legumes. We also have to be careful that demands we make on the food system in this country do not increase problems in other countries and we do not shift the burden of production. This can be done through the use of, for example, Life cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA aims to address the environmental aspects and potential environmental impacts (for example, the use of resources and the environmental consequences of releases pollutants) throughout a product’s lifecycle from the acquisition of raw material, through the production, use, end-of-life treatment, recycling and final disposal. However, LCA is a general approach which can be applied to any product and, because of the complexities of the food system, needs to be tailored in order to be used more effectively. The “simple” solution to the issue of food security is that we all demand less, eat more sustainably and be more careful with our resources. That is clearly much easier said than done. If there is plenty of food in the supermarket it is difficult to believe it matters if we buy that extra packet of biscuits – and we are up in arms that the price of Marmite might increase.  Even the future leaders of some countries do not believe in climate change. However, alarming though the potential lack of Marmite is, we should bear in mind that other countries are already suffering the burden of food insecurity and focusing our resources towards finding solutions in those countries will benefit us on many levels. _This article is part of a series by The Conversation on food security.

"The world’s largest global forum for young leaders will open on Tuesday, as more than 2,000 young people from across the world converge on London. One Young World’s 10th annual summit will welcome young delegates from more than 190 countries as well as political and humanitarian leaders, including the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, the former president of Ireland Mary Robinson, Sir Richard Branson, Sir John Major and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. “Our young delegates are founders, activists and entrepreneurs in their own right, united by a common goal to resolve some of the world’s most pressing challenges – from climate change and violent extremism to sexual violence and poverty,” said Kate Robertson, a cofounder of the UK-based not-for-profit organisation. In a world where the most recognisable climate activist is a 16-year-old girl from Sweden, Robertson said: “At the heart of every global threat is a failure of leadership. This new generation is the most informed, most educated, most connected generation in human history.” Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com The organisation estimates that almost 21 million young people have been impacted by its ongoing programme of mentoring across the world. The Duchess of Sussex, the singer Ellie Goulding, the supermodel Leomie Anderson and Edward Enninful, Vogue’s editor-in-chief, will also attend the annual four-day summit, which will be London’s largest and most international event since the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The summit will also feature speeches from 30 global chief executives, including Alan Jope of Unilever, James Quincey of Coca Cola, Bram Schot of Audi, and Feike Sijbesma from DSM. They will be speaking to some would-be leaders of the future, among them: Madhav Datt Datt founded Green the Gene as a small environmental club in his school when he was eight years old. The organisation is now one of the world’s largest youth-run environmental non-profits. It has projects in 62 countries and has mobilised more than 7,000 young people, all under 24, to build tangible solutions for communities facing acute climate crisis. Now 23, Datt has created a number of technology and data projects to address specific problems, including low-cost water filtration units, providing safe water to more than 40,000 people in rural Tanzania, recycling 3,000,000+ litres of swimming pool water annually in Haryana in India and planting more than 1,500,000 trees in Gambia and 600,000 in India. As a software engineering intern at Google, Datt developed machine-learning algorithms for Nest thermostat energy demand response programs, to reduce energy used by home heating/cooling systems during peak demand times. I learned about the climate crisis at firsthand: the water level in our local dam had fallen by 2ft, which meant our water and electricity was severely rationed. There was nothing abstract about the issue for me. Starting the environmental club, planting trees and talking to local shopkeepers about plastic bags were things I couldn’t not do. One of the biggest things that being young gave me was the power to go up against huge issues because I simply didn’t appreciate that they were widely regarded as impossible problems. Bella Burgemeister Burgemeister was 10 when she decided to write a book to help school-aged children understand the climate crisis. The book, now in its second edition, is in every school in her community in the south-west of Western Australia. In the past three years, Burgemeister has spoken to 5,000 children and 8,000 adults in schools, conferences and meetings. She is a climate activist and organiser. It was tough, aged just 10, to get my head around things like economic growth and responsible consumption but it’s important that children understand these issues because for most of my life, the major political parties have done as little as they can get away with when it comes to climate change.Young people like me are the ones who will live with the consequences of inaction on climate. That was a huge motivator for me. Some politicians and local councillors said I was too young but I didn’t care: I knew what I was doing was right. Edgar Edmund Edmund founded Green Venture Recycles, a company that turns plastic waste into affordable building products, when he was 14. The Tanzanian company has already turned more than 20m plastic bags into 20,000 bricks. I was 12 when I became aware that climate change was causing the floods that regularly destroyed my community. The flood waters were always full of plastic waste. When I was 15, I had a lightbulb moment: I realised that plastic was harder after being heated, which meant I could use the plastic waste to rebuild my community’s homes strong enough to withstand the floods. It was one solution to two problems. I asked myself whether I was too young to deal with this but I realised that if I had to wait for someone else to solve the problem, it would be too late. I designed my first machine using $20 of savings. It took me a year of hard work but after I’d finished, I took it to a science fair and won $100. I used that money to make a more efficient machine which was nominated for a prize in South Africa. I won $15,000 in that competition and used it to create an electric machine. Then I was invited to Sweden and won $7,000 and met investors who helped me get the machine into production. Brighton Kaoma Growing up in the Zambian city of Kitwe, 12 -year-old Kaoma saw the impact of climate breakdown firsthand: as floods and droughts began to destroy his community, he found he was having to walk an extra mile to fetch water and suffered repeated respiratory infections because of the toxic emissions from nearby copper mines. When he was 14, Kaoma asked a local radio station if he could present a show on the environment. Environmental Watch became one of the station’s most popular programmes, educating listeners about the problems affecting them – from global heating and deforestation to pollution – and how they could help. Now 25, Kaoma has founded Agents of Change Foundation, training young people to be agents of change in their community. It has trained 260 children so far, many taking up leadership positions in their own communities. I mobilised my community, we planted trees, I organised marches, opened conservation clubs in schools across the area. By the time I approached the radio station, they had already heard about me and my work. Being so young meant I was free-spirited: I wasn’t afraid on my programme to call a spade a spade. I called to task multinationals and government.  People said I was too young. They threatened me by saying my life would be affected by getting on the nerves of everyone from government to local business. But I was fearless. I was too scared of my future, living in a world with no resources other than those that had been polluted, to let them scare me. Noga Levy-Rapoport Levy-Rapoport, 17, is a core UK Student Climate Network organiser and spokeswoman for Labour for a Green New Deal. She led her first London climate strike at 16. I have aways been aware of climate change but we all grew up being told that if we recycled more and switched off the lights, we would save the planet. I realised as I got older that that’s wrong. I realised that I couldn’t plan my future 20 to 30 years ahead because the world was going to hit a brick wall: it would descend into chaos. Young people have so much power because we’re so angry. We’re growing up in climate change and amid political disasters.  There’s always a risk that adults will think that we will sort this out but we’re really clear: we don’t have time for us to grow up before a solution is found. We’re very clear that it’s your mess and you must clear it up. Kehkashan Basu Winner of the 2016 International Children’s Peace Prize, Kehkashan Basu has been campaigning on behalf of children’s rights, gender quality and climate change since she was 8 years old. When I was 8, I planted my first tree and began talking to the children and grown ups around me about environmental issues. I realised that the children were so much more responsive and enthusiastic than the adults I was speaking to, so I determined to work with children instead, informing them about environmental issues and what they could do about it. Young activists have an advantage over adults because we have an uninhibited view of the world. We’re not affected by cynicism or by awareness of how big problems are. We are determined to solve problems and are truly open to new solutions. The world needs more of that attitude. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com "

Hat-tip: Bernd Felsche at FB. 
In his article Brandt analyzes data to see if weather extremes, especially in the form of heavy rainfall episodes (30+ litres per sq m in 24 hours), are more frequent than they were 30 years ago.
Brandt looked at a representative central German weather station – in Bonn – and looked at the period of 2007 – 2013, i.e. 2357 days. On average 2.19 mm of rain fell each of the 2357 days, the range was 0 to 59 l/m².
30l/sq m or more fell an average of less than 2 days per year.
Analyzing the data, Brandt found that:
The total rain amount increased over the 30-year period just few percentage points. Since the mid 1980s average daily precipitation went up from an average of 2 l/m² per day to 2.2 l/m² for the last 6 years.”

That’s a 10% increase, which is well within the range of natural variability. Brandt adds:
The frequency distribution for precipitation has not changed much when one looks at data from the 1980s and 1990s.
Since the 1980s in Bonn, 2 days a year can be expected to see a rain amount of 30 l/m² or more. A significant increase in heavy rain events since the mid 1980s cannot be found. The state environmental office of North Rhine Westphalia reached a similar result in a study of numerous weather stations in North Rhine Westphalia from the 1950s until today.”
Brandt then goes on to explain that the biggest problem is the growing asphalt and concrete surfacing, which he says grew 1% per year between 1997 and 2007. This is the primary factor in river flooding.
Brandt summarizes:
This small study indicates that heavy rain events have not increased significantly as many people may have assumed. In our cities however, we have to expect rainfalls exceeding 30 l/sq m or more in 24 hours to occur 2 times per year.
The water management of the city has to be able to deal with this amount of water over the long term, so that repeated damage can be avoided.”
Globally, no trend in precipitation over past century!
Okay, this is for Central Europe only. What about the globe as a whole? Surprisingly even Wikipedia writes the following when it comes to global precipitation:
Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterArctic sea ice extent today is, for all practical purposes, BACK TO NORMAL!

Chart source: http://www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/en/home/seaice_extent.htm.
That return to normal only means one thing. The “dramatic melt” of August 2012 had to have been reversed completely by an equally dramatic refreeze this winter. Unfortunately we’re not going to find any news stories about that in the media, are we? Ice and many other climate developments are only one-way dramatic for the warmists, i.e. only when it melts, and not when it refreezes.
“Oh! But hold on!” some of you out there may say. “It’s thickness (i.e. volume) that’s really important, and not area.”
Yes, that’s correct. But how come we never here the media talk about ice volume in August? In August, suddenly only area counts. Funny how they bring up volume only when ice refreezes and things are back to normal.
If you do look at volume (Antarctica and the Arctic), then there really is nothing to worry about. Global ice volume varies by only a few thousandths of a percent globally each year – even over decades. I discussed this once already not long ago HERE.
If you charted global ice volume (Arctic + Antarctica) over time, the thickness of the line would more than cover the decadal variations. But don’t hold your breath waiting for a warmist to show such a chart. You’ll never ever see it from them.

"The 2019 hurricane season, which has already seen parts of Texas flooded and the Bahamas devastated, is prompting existential angst for a unique US culture that fears being torn asunder by the climate crisis. Fiercer storms and the encroaching seas are gnawing away at the Gullah Geechee nation, a distinct cultural group that historically dwelt on a 425-mile stretch of coastline from Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida. Today, the bulk of this community, descendants of African slaves and native Americans, resides only on the low-lying fringes of South Carolina and Georgia.  Hurricane Dorian, which lacerated the Caribbean in early September, uprooted trees and left debris strewn across historic Gullah Geechee sites, according to Queen Quet, the elected chieftess and head of state for the community, which declared its own nationhood in 2000. A destructive recent pattern, marked most severely by Hurricane Matthew in 2016, is taking hold. “The biggest concern is the massive number of [storms] that are arriving on our coast annually,” said Queen Quet, also known as Marquetta L Goodwine, who is also a computer scientist and historian. In the English-based creole language used by the Gullah Geechee, she is known as the “head pun de boddee”. “We are convinced that this is directly linked to climate change dynamics,” she said. “There have never been this many hurricanes and tropical storms in succession. This is causing a major strain on the community being able to recover financially from these.” A rapidly warming ocean and atmosphere is helping fuel stronger, if not more numerous, hurricanes, climate scientists have found. But periods of drought and rising sea levels are also a major concern for the Gullah Geechee, owing to their precarious perch on a string of tidal and barrier islands called the Sea Islands, previously the site of rice, cotton and indigo plantations. “The very existence of the Gullah Geechee nation is threatened by the rapid erosion of our Sea Islands due to the sea level rise issues brought on by climate change,” said Queen Quet, who has attempted to rouse the US government and the United Nations to the cause of a culture expressed through its arts, basket weaving and spiritual music, much of it based upon an intrinsic link to the sea.  Because of their geographic isolation, the Gullah Geechee developed a distinct language and culture, stemming from west and central Africa. Beginning in the late 19th century, theirs was a slow-paced life of fishing and mule carts on dirt roads. Dishes were based around okra, rice and yams. Many of the traditions continue today, with heritage tours helping provide locals with an income as well as cultural preservation. Threats loom, however. Earlier this year Queen Quet appeared in front of a congressional committee to explain how prized seafood is disappearing as the waters warm. Shellfish are threatened as the ocean acidifies while once-common catfish are vanishing. Her people’s unique culture “will not continue to thrive or survive if we are displaced from the Sea Islands,” Queen Quet warned. The plight of the Gullah Geechee is echoed in other distinct cultures across the US that find themselves on the frontline of the climate crisis. Often forced on to land vulnerable to drought or flooding by colonial dispossession and a lack of political clout, these communities face an overwhelming threat to their way of life. “There will be tremendous stories of adaption and change as well as horrifying stories of losing homelands, family and cultural practices,” said Kyle Whyte, an expert in indigenous environmental issues at Michigan State and a member of the Potawatomi native American people. “Lots of indigenous cultures place importance upon resilience but that doesn’t mean that climate change risks aren’t a threat. Many are going to have to work very hard to maintain their way of life.” In Arizona, the Navajo are under pressure from rising temperatures and a dwindling water supply. In Washington state, the Quinault Indian Nation is attempting to relocate the village of Taholah – including its housing, post office, school, daycare, gym and police and fire service – to 200 acres of higher ground due to the threat of riverine flooding. Further north, Alaska is heating up at twice the global average, causing roads to buckle and houses to subside as permafrost locked in the soils starts to melt. Native communities, which rely on stable sea ice for subsidence hunting and transportation, are at particular risk, with at least a dozen towns attempting to relocate. One, the small coastal town of Newtok, received $15m in federal funding last year to start moving houses to safer ground, although the fate of other at-risk towns remains unclear. The threat to traditional practices has helped spur a legal challenge led by young Alaskans who are suing their state government over the harm caused by the climate crisis. “Climate change is not just a political issue for me, it’s my lifestyle, it’s what I face every day back at home,” said lead plaintiff Esau Sinnok, an indigenous Alaskan from Shishmaref, a barrier island menaced by coastal erosion. “The one and only place I get to call home is being eaten by the sea.” Adapting to the changing environment isn’t simple – funding and political will is lacking and minority communities can feel wary dealing with US authorities that have previously wrought dispossession and discrimination. Splits within communities can also appear. Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana, populated by the ancestors of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe who were forced there after fleeing persecution, has lost 98% of its land mass over the past six decades due to coastal erosion, leaving a slender strip of land just two miles long and a quarter-mile wide. In 2016, residents were the first to be given federal funding to relocate the community to drier ground, although many now don’t want to sever their deeply rooted bonds to the island. “This here can’t be remade someplace,” island resident Chris Brunet told the LA Times. “Cultural practices across the US have already been threatened for many decades and climate change is making things worse,” said Whyte. “These people are often tied to a certain area and don’t have the options to move like other people. They can exercise their culture and self-determination on small areas of land only. Native people certainly didn’t choose to be in this situation.” Queen Quet said lawmakers need a much greater appreciation of the cultural threat posed by climate change. “Without the ability to continue our cultural traditions on the land and the sea, we would not be able to continue to live in the healthy, balanced manner that is central to traditional Gullah Geechee culture,” she said.  “You may move to another place, but that does not mean that the environment of that new place will allow your cultural traditions to be sustained. Heartache has killed many people that have been displaced.”"
"The town of Fria in Guinea was built around bauxite mining in 1957. It used to have good facilities: water, electricity, schools, housing and hospitals. But since the last company mining there began to decrease activities in 2008 after the financial crisis and a fall in aluminium prices, the population has increasingly lived in poverty with high rates of unemployment. Families that used to provide for their extended families cannot today afford to care for the needs of their own children and immediate relatives.    In 2009 Julien Brygo, a French photojournalist, wrote:  Many of the benefits the locals used to enjoy are being lost. While accommodation remains free, the children’s nursery is closed, the swimming pool, athletics tracks and sports stadium have fallen into disrepair, water and electricity are now rationed. The Pechiney hospital, as the locals still call it, long recognised as the best in Guinea, is no longer regularly supplied with medicine. Russian parent company RUSAL finally closed the mine in 2012. The move left more than 1,000 permanent employees and 2,000 outsourced workers without pay. One resident spoke of a starving population who were “selling their property, their homes, and plots of land and even furniture to survive”.  Fria’s sad decline is because it is an “enclave”, a town built to respond to the needs of a refinery, run by a succession of companies before RUSAL took up operations 16 years ago. It is just one of an increasing number of makeshift towns built around rural mineral extraction sites in African countries including Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Sudan, and Nigeria, which are being driven by growing foreign investment in mining. These new urban developments are sustained, managed and controlled by the mining companies. And although the nature of these towns vary between countries and what is being mined, they all share some common characteristics. They are all administered by foreign companies in accordance with the norms of “home” states, such as the US, France and Australia, and mostly managed by foreign nationals – with heavy support from outside investment.  It means these enclaves develop economies that are totally disconnected from the wider realities of the host countries. And in the case of Fria, the danger is that when mining activities stop, the people living there are left in extreme poverty with no alternative livelihoods.  Despite slow economic growth in Guinea between 1958 and 2008, the mining sector is the largest contributor to the state’s export revenue and its most stable source of tax revenue. In 2008, Bauxite – the main source of the world’s aluminium accounted for about US$596m (40%) of the country’s total exports. Industrial mining activities provided about 22,000 direct full-time jobs and created over 50,000 indirect jobs.  And enclaves come with some advantages. In Guinea, for example, because high amounts of electricity are needed to extract alumina from bauxite, the enclaves benefit from 24/7 electricity. And although much of the highly skilled expertise is provided by expats from abroad, the mining sector still offers job opportunities to nationals, sometimes creating collaborations between mining companies and local education centres.  In Guinea, bauxite mining is the second-largest employer after the civil service. Then there are the jobs needed to run operations: drivers, technicians, engineers, cooks and security agents. And because many of those involved in operations are Western foreigners, the infrastructures are built to those standards and often health services are the best in the country.  In two other Guinean enclaves, Kamsar and Sangaredi, employees and their families live with 24/7 access to water and electricity, reliable healthcare, subsidised food, supermarkets, air conditioning, good schools, free housing, good roads and cultural spaces. Everything has been built to meet the standard of living expected by foreign expatriates. Though the state provides some security services and administrative officials, these staff, too, benefit from the lifestyle created.  But life in an enclave is totally different from that lived by the majority of Guineans outside of it. Less than 15 minutes’ drive away and you step outside the enclave bubble and into the realities experienced by the majority of Guineans. Much of the population faces poverty with no access to basic infrastructure such as water, electricity and health services. Life in the enclaves is what the majority of Guineans would like to see the mining sector provide to wider society.  There are some formal and informal economies that crop up just outside the mining enclaves, which enable at least some other Guineans to benefit from the mining sector. For instance, outside of Kamsar there is a large market created to meet the needs of the mine workers and their families and which draws in local entrepreneurs from elsewhere in Guinea who want to take advantage of the higher salaries linked to the enclaves.   But after 50 years of development of the extractive industry, Guinean society as a whole is yet to benefit significantly from the revenues of its mining sector. And worst of all, when mining activities stop, it is the general population who have never benefited from the mining who also end up with environmental damage such as land degradation and pollution. After the investment is gone, most of the services provided in the enclaves disappear as do the jobs. Towns like Kamsar and Sangaredi are still attractive now, but unless the government intervenes to make sure the rural economy is developed and unless mining revenues are more fully fed into the overall economy, these towns won’t contribute to sustainable development in Guinea. Talking to people in local communities near bauxite mining areas in Guinea, I found many expressed dissatisfaction about the division between those inside and outside the enclaves. It doesn’t help that in Guinea, in contrast to places like Sudan, Nigeria and Angola, mining activities happen in close proximity to local communities, meaning company transportation passes through local towns. Some have resorted to addressing mining companies directly with specific demands for the development of their towns in return for the stability of mining activities.  Between 2007 and 2012, for example, mining firm Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (CBG) (part-owned by the Guinean goverment), was the victim of several youth-led protests in Kamsar demanding more support to improve their livelihoods. Protests lead to the temporary disruption of mining activities which in turn can lead to lost revenue for the company. To avoid the disruption of their mining activities, CBG told me in 2014 that it had responded to the youth protests by implementing several community projects. One of these projects,  “Toutes Petites Entreprises” was created to promote, support and sponsor local youth led enterprises and to ensure that the CBG offers job opportunities to youth living in neighbouring local communities. These initiatives have contributed to improving the relationship between CBG and neighbouring communities. But more remains to be done in order to ensure that mining revenues benefit wider Guinean society.  In order to avoid further clashes with local communities, mining companies such as CBG urgently need to work together with the state to ensure that profits from mining benefit all. And to prevent mining companies leaving ghost towns like Fria, plans must be put in place to promote the kind of economic development that will sustain the population long after mining has finished."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAxel Bojanowski has written a piece at the online Spiegel titled “Madness of the Do-Gooders” where he reviews Hans von Storch’s and Werner Krauss’s new book: “Die Klimafalle” (The Climate Trap), which has harsh words for climate alarmism.
Many of the harsh words are aimed, not surprisingly, at Germany’s notoriously alarmist and catastrophe-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), which is directed by Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber.
Bojanowski brings up many of the points that I brought up in an earlier post here, e.g. that the “climate debate has reached a dead-end“, that “the science is suffering from a credibility crisis“, and that some scientists like Schellnhuber have “taken on the role of prophets“.
Bojanowski adds other points, first reminding us that there is no consensus on the science and that opinions run across the board. He emphasizes that von Storch and Krauss do not want in any way to play down the seriousness of climate change: “Climate change is a serious problem“. Yes, that’s especially true if the world is preparing for the completely wrong scenario.
Bojanowski quotes von Storch and Krauss concerning the politics and science:
Climate science has been kidnapped by politicians who claim their decisions are already prescribed by science and therefore are without alternatives.”
Von Storch also calls the IPCC climate report a “joint production by science and politics.” Bojanowski adds: “Scientists have succumbed to the temptation of shaping policy“.

Von Storch makes one assertion I think needs to be responded to. He says he is in no way on the same side as the climate skeptics, and tends to label both sides of the debate as disgraceful. The problem here is the narrow fashion in which von Storch and Krauss view the debate to start with. They view it as non-believers vs devout believers, when in truth it’s a debate of many non-catastrophe believers vs a small group of fanatic catastrophists.
Indeed there are many luke-warmers who believe in greenhouse-gas warming among the “skeptics”. Many have no interests at all, except in finding the truth. Here von Storch and Krauss commit a huge disservice in throwing legitimate skeptics in the same bag with denier wingnuts.
On the subject of consensus, Bojanowski writes that reaching consensus is the duty of policymakers, and not scientists.
One of the main targets of von Storch’s and Krauss’s book is the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the WBGU, which advises the German government on climate issues. The WBGU’s 9 members come solely from catastrophe-obsessed institutes, like the Potsdam Institute, and call for a rash, complete overhaul of the global economy in order to ward off a “dangerous climate change“. Von Storch and Krauss criticize this, rightfully claiming: “No grand global plan can bring about the solution.”
Bojanowski writes in the end that the advisers at the Potsdam Institute have made it very clear they will not comment on von Storch’s and Krauss’s critical book. “The PIK scientists recently published a comic book that explains the ‘Great Transformation’ to children – with the PIK advisers themselves as comic heroes.”
That sums it up nicely.

"Cornwall, on England’s south coast, is best known these days for surfing and sandcastles. But for centuries it was world famous for its tin and copper mines. Now, a recent discovery could see a mining boom in the county once again – and the whole UK should benefit. On January 19, the British company Cornish Lithium entered into an agreement with Canada’s Strongbow Exploration to explore and potentially develop lithium mining in Cornwall. This is just a first step and it may be years before any lithium comes on stream, but it’s worth taking a look ahead.    Lithium is a light and shiny silver metal with high conductivity which makes it ideal for use in products such as batteries. Since lithium has been the hottest commodity of the past year, a new domestic supply could help the UK become a global player in the burgeoning electric car market. While most commodities faced price declines over the past few years, lithium has been on the rise. Until late 2015, it hung around the $6,000 per tonne mark but it has since surged due to a rise in demand. By mid 2016, the price had more than tripled to over $20,000 per tonne. Demand for lithium is driven by the growth in electric vehicles and renewable energies, besides ongoing demand from ceramics and glass. The metal is a key ingredient in the Li-ion batteries needed to run new electric vehicles and consumer gadgets such as mobile phones, laptops and cameras. Chinese megacities are also getting serious about electric bikes, scooters and vehicles to combat air pollution, and Tesla’s order books for the recently announced Model 3 are swelling. Goldman Sachs expects 20.5m electric vehicles to be sold globally between now and 2025 – almost 10m more than it expected one year ago. The industry’s lithium consumption will increase fivefold.  Chemical companies that process raw materials for batteries will benefit, and so could the Cornish lithium miners, if they manage collaborations with such companies. However, the next few years are likely to be a preparation for this “take-off”, rather than a rapid scale up.  Things are more uncertain in the medium term – consumers may lack confidence in the next generation of electric vehicles, and car makers are likely to advertise more traditional models and lobby against new regulation until they are “ready-to-go”. Consequently, the lithium industry won’t enjoy much certainty – for now. However, the outlook is promising – speakers at a Goldman Sachs low carbon event stated that not even the changing US policy landscape under President Trump is likely to alter the core market forces driving the growth in electric vehicles. They forecast a transformative tech shift, with electric vehicles adding to the momentum in energy efficiency, solar PV and onshore wind.  But markets change fast and there is a huge risk of high-tech disruption and vulnerabilities as suppliers are manifold, often small, and conducive to risks of both finance and regulation. Changes in the supply chains will affect many automotive suppliers, the chemical and oil industries, and potentially the steel industry, too. With headwinds expected from China, Japan and other countries, companies will have to accelerate efforts to access these markets, and stretch out to new miners and suppliers across the world. But a robust industrial strategy across all these sectors should benefit Cornwall and the UK. While lithium may be a crucial ingredient in these batteries, the good news is that it only makes up a small share (around 3%) of production costs. Even if prices continue to be volatile – a consequence of rapid development in risky regions and sectors – it shouldn’t affect batteries too much. Lithium is usually extracted from brine (salty water) found in salt flats. The process involves using large amounts of water and chemicals, with severe consequences for these sensitive ecosystems.  Miners in Cornwall hope to produce lithium from hot spring brines while using geothermal energy extracted from these springs, which could drive processing costs down. But the project will not be without risks, including the possibility that radioactive radon could be released from granite. Also lithium recycling is not (yet) feasible, but recovering other materials from batteries such as magnesium, mercury and zinc may well trigger recycling efforts.  Cornish Lithium must now begin the crucial task of getting local people and other stakeholders on board – what’s known as a social license to operate. Cornwall already benefits from a thriving tourist industry. However, its centuries-long history as a mining region means it may well cope with the associated challenges. It has the potential to become a wellspring of new industrial activity, and Britain’s first lithium boom."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen you look at what’s going on in some of the world’s leading democracies today, with some institutions running rampantly out of control without oversight, we should not wonder why people in droves are losing faith and trust in government.
Government issues pamphlet identifying enemy skeptics
The latest example comes from the powerful German Ministry for Environment: Umweltbundesamt (UBA) with the release of its latest 123-page pamphlet titled: Und sie erwärmt sich doch…Was steckt hinter der Debatte um den Klimawandel (It is indeed warming…What’s behind the climate change debate?). In the brochure the UBA (Germany’s equivalent of the EPA) insists the climate catastrophe is coming, and appeals to the public not to listen to skeptics.
In fact, the German government pamphlet specifically singles out, identifies and targets US and German skeptics, portraying them as “spreaders of half-truths and misinformation“. Welcome to open and tolerant debate in the Federal Republic of Germany!
You’ll recall that the UBA are the ones who recently admitted being baffled by the 15-year global temperature stagnation that has taken hold.
Government makes it clear: climate debate not welcome!
Reading the pamphlet, it is clear that this is a one-sided, catastrophe-obsessed propaganda piece that advocates completely the alarmist side of the debate and outright dismisses and marginalizes the growing non-alarmist side. The pamphlet is truly a disservice to the German taxpayers and a mass deception of the public. The Greens and the Ministry of Environment, as you will see, are brazenly targeting specific individuals and organisations whose only “crime” is having a differing opinion. Skeptics are being viewed as a threat.
I can’t imagine how intimidated those named in the pamphlet (especially the German skeptics) must feel today. The full power of the German government has them in its sights.
Only alarmists are cited as honest sources
Just a look at the references cited at the back of the pamphlet on page 116 already tells the story. Sources cited include radical environmental groups Germanwatch, Greenpeace and klimaretter.de, ultra-alarmist institutes like the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and dogmatic outlier scientists like Stefan Rahmstorf, Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, and Naomi Oreskes, just to name a few.
UBA has black list of American skeptics
According to the UBA, all the climate doubt stems mainly from the USA. Beginning on page 100, the UBA lists the Americans responsible for “spreading doubt and false information“, among them: ExxonMobil, Fred Singer, Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon, Frederick Seitz, Joe Barton, Pat Michaels, John Christy, Ross McKitrick and the Heartland Institute. The UBA cites the Union of Concerned Scientists and a one-sided Die Zeit smear from November 2012 as its reliable sources for this information.
The name “Rahmstorf” appears throughout the pamphlet. One quickly gets the impression that the pamphlet stems from the German Ministry of Rahmstorf. Little wonder that when taken as a whole, the pamphlet is a huge public deception. Then again, misleading the public is nothing new for Professor Rahmstorf, for German readers: http://www.klimastorch.de/rahmstorf-vs.meichsner.pdf.

On page 106, the UBA claims that the Climategate e-mails “were stolen”, as if by criminals.
The UBA endorses RealClimate.org
On page 116, the UBA tells readers what it feels are reliable information sources of information on climate science. The German Ministry of Rahmstorf , of course, suggests Stefan Rahmstorf, who is “an international renown climate scientist who is often featured in up-to-date books, newspapers and television shows” against the “climate skeptical half truths and false reports“. The UBA also recommends Rahmstorf’s Internetblog Klima-Lounge and the Potsdam Institute.
Moreover, the UBA recommends the site of “a group of 11 American and European scientists, among them Stefan Rahmstorf and Michael Mann, RealClimate”. The UBA also suggests alarmist site Klimaretter.Info as a good source of all sorts of information.
Government black list of German skeptics
The UBA also tells us to whom not to go for information (the bad guys) and publicizes a sort of black list of skeptics. On page 110 it lists the “climate change skeptics in Germany“, which include the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning, journalists and publicists Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch, film-maker and publicist Günter Ederer, and newspaper Die Welt.
In government’s view, skeptics are crackpots
In a nutshell, here we have the German government informing the public which people to be on the look-out for. If this holds up legally, remains to be seen. It is not the job of the government to tell the public who the goods guys and bad guys are in a public debate.
In its closing statements, the UBA pamphlet writes (p. 113) that:
– Parts of industry are financing campaigns to spread doubt and a false information over the results of climate science; the target is to fool the public;
– Often scientists of foreign disciplines and without any knowledge of climate science appear in public with climate-skeptical claims.”
In the UBA’s view, those who publicly doubt the coming climate catastrophe are to be viewed as crackpots and industry hacks, and are thus to be ignored. The pamphlet reads like a declaration of war. I have a feeling that we have not heard the last of this story.
More tomorrow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSaturday I posted about a recently published study by He YuXin et al, which happened to catch the watchful eye of Sebastian Lüning of kaltesonne.de/. Lüning comments on what the paper means for Michael Mann:
=================================================
Medieval warmth at the northern Tibetan Plateau casts doubt on Michael Mann’s temperature map 
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning
In 2009 the inventor of the renowned hockey stick graph Michael Mann and his colleagues published a paper in the journal Science where they attempted to refute the global significance of the Medieval Warm Period. The idea behind the paper was to show that the warmth in some areas was offset by cold in other parts of the world. To show this the authors searched out places that were colder than normal 1000 years ago.
The problem was the Atlantic region, which had an excellent amount of data to support the Medieval warmth. Here the temperatures stood at least at today’s levels. Therefore Michael Mann searched around for other regions where far less data was available and found the Central Eurasian region would do just fine. The scarcity of available data left lots of room for interpretation. This is how the authors plotted a huge region of cold over a large swath of Central Eurasia during the Medieval Warm Period, which supposedly offset the inconvenient Atlantic warmth.

Figure 1: Temperature anomalies during the Medieval Warm Period 1000 years ago as to Mann et al. (2009). In Central Eurasia the authors interpreted a pronounced cold zone.
A Chinese team of scientists led by He YuXin of the University of Hong Kong, however, took a very close look at Mann’s liberally interpreted data and his postulated Central Eurasian cold zone. Using sediment cores extracted from two different lakes and using the so-called alkenone method, the Chinese scientists reconstructed the temperature development over the past 2000 years for the northern Tibetan Plateau, which according to Mann was significantly colder 1000 years ago.

The surprise was big when the new, hard data showed the opposite was in fact true. It turns out that the region of the theoretical cold in the northern Tibetan Plateau during the Medieval Warm Period was indeed not colder but was warmer than today, see Science Bulletin.
In their paper, YuXin and his colleagues made yet another interesting discovery. In the abstract they write: ‘Further, our temperature reconstructions, within age uncertainty, can be well correlated with solar irradiance changes, suggesting a possible link between solar forcing and natural climate variability, at least on the northern Tibetan Plateau.’
The surprisingly good synchronicity between sun and climate in the region of study is clearly visible from the study’s chart:

============================================
1) Open letter to the PIK by Josef Kowatsch
To: Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)
Date: January 15, 2013 11:04 AM
Subject: Your alleged heatwaves as proof of a (non-occurring) climate heating / PIK press release
Dear Madam or Sir,
Of course heat records have been recorded in various regions of the world over the last 10 – 12 years. Yet temperatures during this period have neither risen in Germany nor globally; rather they have fallen slightly. Moreover, a number of cold records have occurred. In your press release you completely ignore these cold records and avoid mentioning them. What follows is a chart of Germany’s temperature over the last 15 years:

Chart source: Josef Kowatsch, EIKE; Data source is the DWD German Weather Service
Over the same time period, global CO2 emissions have increased. The increase in CO2 has had no warming effect. Indeed there has been a light cooling. These are the facts. Your press release is simply not honest.
I’ve sent this letter to other media outlets as well.

2) Veteran meteorologist Dr. Wolfgang Thüne slams climate science
In a commentary posted at his website, meteorologist Dr. Wolfgang Thüne aims harsh criticism at warmist science. The article is titled: The Greenhouse: A House of Bondage. As the title suggests, Thüne describes a science that has run amok, and now threatens to take over the lives of every citizen on the planet – how we behave, think, and what we eat.
He reminds us that attempting to control “weather and climate” by controlling human behavior is an utter folly, and there are other far more powerful factors at play in dominating weather and climate – like the sun.
To illustrate this point he describes how temperatures on can vary by up to 100°K at some locations. In Oymyakon in Yakutia, Russia, a record low temperature of -68°C was once recorded. At the same location, the temperature reached a record 34.6°C on July 28, 2010. Thus the temperature here can fluctuate over a range of more than 100°K. What does CO2 have to do with that? CO2 is even higher there in the winter, yet it’s far colder. Clearly the sun is the driving factor.
Thüne concludes at the end of his commentary: “The statement that CO2 concentration, whether natural or man made, is the main factor in driving air temperature is a scientific fairy tale that’s rich in fantasy. Making climate forecasts is spook-watching!”

"A new rocket launch site has been proposed in the far north of Scotland to send small satellites into space. The plan is for a £17.3m spaceport on the A’Mhòine peninsula in Sutherland, a site chosen because it is so remote and surrounded by water and open countryside in case a rocket launch goes wrong. But the proposed site is next to protected peatland, part of the Flow Country of northern Scotland, the largest blanket bog in Europe, estimated to store 400 million tonnes of carbon, which is vital in the fight against climate breakdown. A report this year by a team of researchers was critical of the development, saying: “The damage caused by the construction and operation of the spaceport will lead to the further destruction of this Highland ‘wild land’.”  The Flow Country is full of deep peat and needs protection. Like all peatlands, it is made up of the remains of plants such as sphagnum moss, which took in carbon through photosynthesis when the plants were alive and, after the plants died, the carbon was locked away in the peat. This peat is more efficient at storing carbon than forests, but peatlands are fragile and threatened by development, forestry, wildfires and drought, and they urgently need to be preserved."
"Water may well be everywhere, but freshwater lake ecosystems are among some of the most vulnerable on Earth. In recent decades, freshwater species have suffered double the rate of decline of land species. And nearly 50% of fresh water lakes, rivers and streams across Europe failed to meet the EU Water Framework Directive, which aimed to achieve “good ecological status” of freshwater in Europe by 2015. Part of the problem is that current tools used to monitor the so called “health” of a lake can be costly, time consuming, inefficient, and in some cases, lethal to the organisms they are sampling. Which is why our new research is pioneering a new way of monitoring water species – using techniques more familiar to fans of crime TV shows. Environmental DNA, also known as eDNA works in the same way as regular DNA testing, but rather than using saliva or hair, samples of water, soil or even air are taken and tested. The method works because every creature in freshwater leaves behind traces of its eDNA as it swims around, shedding minute flakes of skin, eggs, sperm or in the case of plants, pollen or seeds.  The majority of eDNA studies so far have focused on detecting single species using highly specific DNA-based procedures which focus on detecting one species at a time. Our study instead used a form of DNA testing called “metabarcoding”. This is where a single region of DNA called a “barcode” is simultaneously sequenced from a whole community of organisms. This enabled us to analyse millions of DNA sequences from water samples, identifying the DNA of a broad range of species and looking at whole communities of organisms – rather than just detecting single species. Metabarcoding of eDNA is a very new technology, and has only been tested in controlled conditions – such as in aquaria – or on a small scale in natural environments. But this technique has the potential to be a game changer for biodiversity monitoring, as it is completely non-invasive and extremely sensitive. It detects more species than established methods, and gives a surprisingly good indication of how abundant they are within the water environment.  We used this method of testing in Lake Windermere, England’s largest lake, to discover what fish species are living in the water and their relative abundance. And the information provided by these humble water samples exceeded all our expectations.  Windermere’s fish population has been monitored since the 1940s, by the Freshwater Biological Association and, more recently, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, using a combination of established fish survey methods such as netting, angler’s catches and hydroacoustics.  So to see how eDNA would compare to these established methods, earlier this year we braved all that the Lakeland weather could throw at us – from blizzards to glorious winter sunshine – to collect over 60, two-litre water samples – from the very northern tip to the southern tip of the lake. The eDNA metabarcoding detected 14 of the 16 species ever recorded in Windermere – perch, roach, brown trout, pike, Arctic charr, bream and eel were the most common. Only the two rarest species, river and sea lamprey, were missed, but it is possible they are not present in the lake at the time of sampling. Whereas only four species were detected in the corresponding net survey.  Previous studies suggested that estimating how many fish are in an area of water from eDNA data would be problematic. Encouragingly though, our data indicated that eDNA may be better as measuring the quantity than previously thought. And we also found a clear pattern in the spatial distribution of eDNA in the lake. Windermere is divided into two separate basins, the north and the south basin. With the South Basin more nutrient rich – also known as “eutrophic” – than the north. eDNA from species that don’t like nutrient rich conditions – such as Arctic charr – were found to be more common in the North Basin, while species that aren’t choosy were detected throughout the lake. This suggests that eDNA data could reliably indicate the ecological condition of lakes. These results are a highly encouraging step towards eDNA becoming a game-changer in biodiversity monitoring. And we are now working closely with the Environment Agency and other groups to drive this research forward – to help ensure that the health our lakes is monitored in the most efficient and cost effective way possible."
"For thousands of years humans turned to nature to cure and soothe their ills. Modern science built on these ancient foundations and the “natural product discovery” programmes established by pharmaceutical companies provided us with medicines that could treat cancer, infections and more. But discovering medicines found in nature is far from straightforward. It’s hard enough to gather sufficient numbers of the useful organism, whether that be a tree root or a venomous snake, and it’s even harder to isolate the exact medicinal compound and then produce it in large quantities. With all these stumbling blocks it’s no surprise that pharmaceutical companies shifted their focus from nature to the laboratory and began designing compounds from scratch, huge numbers of which could then be screened for promising activity. From the 1990s onwards the pharmaceutical companies duly terminated their nature discovery programmes and the huge collections of screening extracts they amassed were sold or disbanded. Recent developments in genetics have prompted a shift back towards natural products, however. Scientists can now mine an organism’s entire DNA to search for useful compounds, and it is becoming increasingly evident that we have barely scratched the surface of nature’s molecular diversity, which has been honed by more than three billion years of trial and error. There are many more drugs still undiscovered, lurking within plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. This realisation, and looming health crises like the rise of antibiotic resistance, has renewed interest in the search for useful compounds in nature – known as bioprospecting. Most nature-derived medicines today are sourced from plants, fungi and bacteria. Those medicines that have been extracted from animals have largely come from just a few sources: venomous vertebrates like the gila monster lizard or jararaca snakes, leech saliva, or the venoms and secretions of organisms like sponges or molluscs. But animals are incredibly diverse, and we’ve barely tapped into the potential pharmaceutical use of the most diverse group of all – insects. Insects occupy every conceivable terrestrial and freshwater niche on Earth. Consequently, they have a bewildering array of interactions with other organisms, which has meant they’ve evolved an enormous variety of compounds to protect themselves or for preying on others. Of the tiny proportion of insects that have been investigated, several interesting compounds have been identified. For example, alloferon, an antimicrobial compound produced by blow fly larvae, is used as an antiviral and antitumour agent in South Korea and Russia. The larvae of a few other insect species are being investigated for potent antimicrobials. Beyond flies, a compound sourced from the venom of the wasp Polybia paulista can kill cancer cells without harming normal cells. So why is it that bioprospectors have paid relatively little attention to insects? The sheer variety is partly to blame – with many millions of species to search through, finding a useful insect is like looking for a needle in a haystack. And though we consider insects to be everywhere, the reality of this ubiquity is vast numbers of a few extremely common species. Most insects are hard to find and very difficult to rear in captivity.  And even when a useful species has been identified and reared successfully, it’s still incredibly difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of the relevant material. Insects are generally very small and the glands inside them that secrete interesting, potentially useful compounds are smaller still. The good news is that we can overcome some of these difficulties by using knowledge of natural history to target our efforts. Myself and David Wilcockson at Aberystwyth University term this approach “ecology-led drug discovery”.  Many insects advertise the production of potentially useful compounds in the way in which they live and where they live. Some produce potent, complex venom for subduing prey and keeping it fresh for their offspring. Others are masters at exploiting filthy micro-habitats, such as faeces and carcasses, where they are regularly challenged by myriad micro-organisms. The insects in both these examples have a battery of antimicrobial compounds to deal with pathogenic bacteria and fungi which could potentially serve as or inspire new antibiotics for humans. Although natural history knowledge points us in the right direction it doesn’t solve the problems associated with the small size of insects and the tiny quantities of interesting compounds they produce. Fortunately, it is now possible to identify and then snip out the stretches of the insect’s DNA that carry the codes for the interesting compounds and insert them into cell lines that allow larger quantities to be produced.  As much as I’d dearly love to help develop a blockbuster insect-derived medicine, my main motivation for looking at insects in this way is conservation – I want drugs from bugs to generate funds for basic exploration, species discovery and natural history. All species, however small and seemingly insignificant, have a right to exist for their own sake, but this sentiment lacks the political clout needed to fight for the urgent preservation of nature. We need something more tangible, something that is directly relevant to people, and you would be hard pressed to find anything that is held so dear as health. If we can shine a light on the darker recesses of nature’s medicine cabinet, exploring the useful chemistry of the most diverse animals on the planet, I believe we can make people think differently about the value of nature."

In North American folklore, the groundhog can apparently be used to foresee the future, as many a town in the US and Canada will vouch on February 2 as they celebrate Groundhog Day. Groundhogs are great diggers and spend much of their time hunkered down in their burrows – understandably since they feature in far too many food webs. They’re among nature’s “true hibernators”, and become fully dormant for much of the winter. This period, so the story goes, is broken on February 2 when they emerge from their burrows. For the human celebrants of Groundhog Day, everything depends on whether the animal is spooked by its own shadow. If it is cloudy, the hogs stay out and about and spring will come early. But if the sun shines brightly and the groundhogs catch sight of their own shadow, they flee back underground, and winter will apparently return for another six grim weeks of ice and rain.  Some groundhogs really do wake up from hibernation in early February, while the weather is still very cold, before going back to bed until March. However, this has nothing to do with scary shadows.  Their early emergence is primarily down to males checking out the whereabouts of neighbouring females with an eye towards amorous opportunities later in the spring. Given this, jumping back into your burrow at the slightest hog-shaped silhouette might not be the best reproductive strategy.  In some European traditions, the weather on February 2 has a similar significance, but without the groundhogs. In the north of America, the hogs are essential, perhaps an evolution of Germanic folklore imported by immigrants who became the Pennsylvania Dutch (from the German: Deutsch). The custom spread, and today many towns have annual ceremonies.  There are even celebrity groundhogs, with their own entourage of handlers. After all that time underground, you might expect a dazzled groundhog would be spooked by anything, especially a fan club of oddly dressed town elders. Meanwhile “Groundhog Day” has entered the popular lexicon in the wake of the 1993 film of the same name in which a pompous weather forecaster arrives in town to deride the locals’ affection for their fortune-telling rodents, only to find himself trapped in a time loop, the day repeating itself until he is redeemed by love. Further south in the US, a menagerie of other species has acquired this remarkable gift of prescience, including coypu and crayfish. However, among planet Earth’s fortune telling fauna the groundhogs’ weather forecasting is tame. The US National Centre for Environmental Information has investigated Punxsutawney Phil, the most famous groundhog of all, and found his forecasts show “no predictive skill”.  In recent years, the football futurology talents of Paul the octopus has attracted particular acclaim. Paul, who lived in a Sea Life Centre in Germany, correctly predicted four of six matches in Euro 2008, then seven of seven in 2010. Statisticians were consulted and, understandably, weren’t sure what to make of this, probably because all the octopuses that were not so on the ball were not being recorded.  After Paul’s death, an imitator, Otto, tackled not only football but eventually the UK’s Brexit referendum. Sadly, her football punditry proved poor and her career ended with a whole-hearted, or, more precisely for an octopus, whole-three-hearted, prediction of a victory for Remain. Maybe we’re better off sticking with groundhog forecasts."
"Prince Charles has called on the City of London to help protect the environment by investing trillions of pounds into green investments which help create a sustainable economy. In an interview with the Evening Standard the heir to the British throne said big businesses and City investors must drive a rapid decarbonisation of the economy before the environmental crisis becomes “a total catastrophe”.  The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts The prince said green investment has “suddenly taken off” because the returns on sustainable projects are now better than those for fossil fuels. “The money is now at last beginning to become available … because there are trillions of pounds out there, particularly in the private sector [which can now potentially be harnessed to drive real change]. The key is the private sector, which has to lead, then you can create a partnership with the public sector,” he said. He said: “The problem that I’ve found is that after 35 to 40 years of trying my best with corporate, social and environmental responsibility with the private sector, and countless seminars and workshops, trying to get people to recognise the huge challenges we face, we could never actually crack the real problem, which was the lack of the real understanding on the part of the financial services and capital markets sector to understand why there was such a need to invest.” He added it was now “more critical than ever” for the private sector to look for sustainable investments which direct money to the most effective sustainability projects. “Whether it is regeneration, reforestation, sorting out fisheries and ocean issues to make them more sustainable. Or agriculture and how to rebuild soil fertility – which is completely degraded around most of the world – because if you can get the soil fertility back again, you can capture carbon much more quickly,” he said. The prince spoke to the Evening Standard in Tokyo during his visit for the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito. His visit took place less than two weeks after Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan, causing at least 80 deaths and underlining the need for governments to prepare for extreme storms, now more likely because of global heating."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot surprisingly Dana Nuccitelli of SkepticalScience.com obstinately refuses to see the facts, even when they are staring him right in the face. Richard Tol at Twitter has thrown the now notorious John Cook survey, of which Nuccitelli was a co-author, into the dustbin of history.
Here’s the exchange between the two:

 
Tol’s last comment pretty much sums up the quality Cook’s and Nuccitelli’s work. I could say every day last year in my hometown was over 25°C (if I ignore 320 of them and misclassify a quarter of the 45 I did count).
Dana Nuccitelli is becoming a real asset for the skeptics, one that we certainly don’t want to lose.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week, the German Federal Umweltbundesamt (UBA), Germany’s version of the EPA, issued a one-sided alarmist pamphlet that attempts to declare the climate debate over and attacks prominent skeptics.

Controversial 123-page pamphlet…in it the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) declares climate debate over and names and portrays skeptics as “spreaders of half-truths and misinformation”.
In the pamphlet, he German government UBA specifically singles out, identifies, targets and attacks US and German skeptics, thus sparking outrage.
Some of the Americans targeted include scientists Fred Singer, Sallie Baliunas, Willie Soon, Frederick Seitz, Pat Michaels, John Christy, Ross McKitrick and conservative think-tank Heartland Institute. The German targets include European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Fritz Vahrenholt, and Sebastian Lüning, as well as journalists and publicists Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch, and film-maker / publicist Günter Ederer, and national newspaper Die Welt.
Today flagship daily Die Welt has a commentary by law professor Thorsten Koch titled: “State Propaganda – The Federal Environment Agency violates the rules of neutrality”.

In his commentary Koch writes:
The pamphlet is a product of official state action in which in one sense the claims that contradict the ‘scientific consensus’ made by ‘climate change skeptics’ (p. 110) are polemicized. Even the ZDF public television website ‘heute.de’ diagnosed it as ‘official state defamation’. This makes the matter legally questionable.”
Koch then explains that the government is allowed to participate and take a position on the climate issue, but adds:
Strange however that a government office is attempting to bindingly specify the state of knowledge in a scientific question. That is the job of a scientist. Even more it is neither scientifically or legally appropriate if scientific truths – and thus ultimately only the current state of the error – are announced with official authority.
Deciding scientific controversies is no duty of the state. The attempt we have here by the Environment Agency to decide a scientific controversy is in this form unique.”

And we may also add that it is also not the duty of a handful of scientists to decide political controversies…at least not in democratic societies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOther than NASA GISS, few institutes are as climate warming-obsessed as the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). To keep the global warming fear machine up and running in the future, it looks like the PIK is expanding its facilities (warning: at this PIK link there’s an atrocious translation to English).

Hello? Anybody here? Warmist PIK’s new facility construction shut down by snow and cold! Photo source: pik-webcam.
However, it’s obvious from the above photo that construction of its new global warming facilities have been stopped – because of bitter cold!
The photo taken this morning by the PIK webcam doesn’t show any construction activity at all happening on the site. It has been shut down by the unusual late-March bitter cold and snow, which according to PIK’s own climate models, were supposed to be a thing of the past.
And that isn’t about to change anytime soon as the forecast for the days ahead doesn’t look good: -13°C over the weekend! This means no work until at least after Easter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne website talks about the latest study on Antarctic ice. Remember that we keep hearing that the next IPCC report will be even scarier than the last one of 2007.
========================
Antarctic Ice Sheet Indeed Melting Slower Than Originally Thought
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning (translated, edited by P Gosselin)
We often read that the ice caps are melting faster than ever and that sea level rise has accelerated over the last decades. It is feared that sea level could be 2 mters higher by the year 2100. It is true that a majority of water stored on land as ice is located in the Antarctic ice sheet. If it melted completely, sea level would rise 60-65 m.
Luckily today we have satellites to permanently monitor the ice caps on Earth. And so far over the years, we have collected a good amount of data. Indeed it is only necessary to measure in detail the height of the ice cap over the continent and then automatically compute an ice volume. From the change, one could then calculate the melt rate.
But things aren’t quite that easy. When the last ice age ended 12,000 years ago, part of the Antarctic ice thawed. This reduced the load on the continent and thus allowed it to rise like an unloaded cargo ship – a process that is still taking place today. This is called glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). This value itself is not easy to determine. The uncertainty here is estimated to be 50-150 billion tons per year (gigatons/year). That’s no chicken feed – especially if you consider that the melt rate assumed so far is only 26 gigatons per year. Here we see that the uncertainty is multiple times more than the actual data signal itself. That hardly induces much confidence in the results.
An international research team led by Erik Ivins of the Jet Propulsion Lab of Pasadena, California has taken a closer look at the GIA-correction and has reworked the data. They just recently published the results in the Journal of Geophysical Research. Based on data of the last decade, they’ve determined that the Antarctic ice melt represents in the worst case an amount of o.16 mm/year in terms of global sea level rise. That is signficantly less than what the IPCC proposed in its 2007 climate report. Back then the IPCC propoosed a sea level rise contribution by Antarctica in the worst case of 0.56 mm per year, see Table SPM1 of IPCC AR4).

"What is so refreshing about the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is that they recognise the inherent tension between economic development and the ecology of our planet. Or so it seems. The preamble affirms that “planet Earth and its ecosystems are our home” and underscores the necessity of achieving “harmony with nature”. It commits to holding global warming below 2℃, and calls for “sustainable patterns of production and consumption”. This language signals awareness that something about our economic system has gone terribly awry – that we cannot continue chewing through the living planet without gravely endangering our security and prosperity, and indeed the future viability of our species. But if you look more closely, a glaring contradiction emerges.  The core of the SDG programme relies on the old model of indefinite economic growth that caused our ecological crisis in the first place: ever-increasing levels of extraction, production and consumption. SDG 8 calls for “at least 7% GDP growth per annum in the least developed countries” and “higher levels of economic productivity” across the board. In other words, there is a profound contradiction at the heart of these supposedly sustainable goals. They call for both less and more at the same time. This call for more growth comes at an odd moment, just as we are learning that it is not physically possible. Currently, global production and consumption levels are overshooting our planet’s biocapacity by nearly 60% each year. In other words, growth isn’t an option any more – we’ve already grown too much. Scientists tell us that we are blowing past planetary boundaries at breakneck speed and witnessing the greatest mass extinction of species in more than 66m years. The hard truth is that our ecological overshoot is due almost entirely to over-consumption in rich countries, particularly the West. SDG 8 calls for improving “global resource efficiency” and “decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation”. Unfortunately, there are no signs that this is possible at anything near the necessary pace.  Global material extraction and consumption grew by 94% between 1980 and 2010, accelerating in the last decade to reach as high as 70 billion tonnes per year.  And it’s still going up: by 2030, we’re projected to breach 100 billion tonnes of stuff per year. Current projections show that by 2040 we will more than double the world’s shipping, trucking, and air miles – along with all the things those vehicles transport. By 2100 we will be producing three times more solid waste than we do today. Efficiency improvements are not going to cut it. Yes, some GDP growth may still be necessary in poorer countries; but for the world as a whole, the only option is intentional de-growth and a rapid shift to what legendary ecological economist Herman Daly calls a “steady-state” that maintains economic activity at ecological equilibrium. De-growth does not mean poverty. On the contrary, de-growth is perfectly compatible with high levels of human development. It is entirely possible for us to shrink our resource consumption while increasing things that really matter such as human happiness, well-being, education, health and longevity. Consider the fact that Europe has higher human development indicators than the US in most categories, despite 40% less GDP per capita and 60% less emissions per capita. This is the end toward which we must focus our full attention. Indeed, the surer route to poverty is to continue on our present trajectory, for, as top economist Joseph Stigltiz points out, in a world of ecological overshoot, GDP growth is diminishing living standards rather than improving them. We need to replace GDP with a saner measure of human progress, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator, and abandon the notion of exponential economic growth without end. Sadly, the SDGs pass this urgent challenge down to the next generation – at the bottom of SDG 17 it states: “By 2030 build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable development that complement GDP.” In other words, they shelve the problem until 2029. But what of employment? Whenever I lecture about de-growth, this is always the first question I get - and we have to take it seriously. Yes, de-growth will require eliminating unnecessary production and work.  But this presents us with a beautiful opportunity to shorten the working week and give some thought to that other big idea that has captured the public’s imagination over the past couple of years: a universal basic income. How to fund it? There are many options, including progressive taxes on commercial land use, financial transactions, foreign currency transactions and capital gains. Let’s face it – in an age of rapid automation, full employment on a global scale is a pipe dream anyhow. It’s time we think of ways to facilitate reliable livelihoods in the absence of formal employment. Not only will this assist us toward necessary de-growth, it will also allow people to escape exploitative labour arrangements and incentivise employers to improve working conditions – two goals that the SDGs set out to achieve. What’s more, it will allow people to invest more of their time and effort into things that matter: caring for their loved ones, growing their own food, nourishing communities, and rebuilding degraded environments."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his klimazwiebel.blog here, Professor Hans von Storch posted an interview conducted with German Weather Service (DWD) press spokesman Gerhard Lux that had appeared earlier in the Offenbacher Post.

Arctic, public domain photo – NASA.
The interview focused on the new hypothesis put out by some scientists now claiming that the cold winters are caused by global warming, i.e. a warm Arctic is disrupting northern hemispheric weather patterns and thus causing cold winters in Europe and elsewhere.
Here’s what von Storch had to say about that hypothesis:
An interesting aspect that demonstrates the difficulty in which climate science now finds itself is that here a hypothesis was formulated (Arctic ice deficit, subsequent winter anomaly) that ends up being a possible explanation in a model experiment. But here it cannot be concluded that this is the only or even the dominant explanation. What’s next is falsification of the suggestion using forthcoming observations to see whether the explanation is robust, or whether maybe indeed other explanations are more effective (e.g.: stochastic climate fluctuations). This is actually a normal process in science, and the fact that the explanation came afterwards, and was not searched and found before the occurrence of the phenomenon, is just more reason for doubt.”
Other experts also doubt (or outright dismiss) the hypothesis:
1. Veteran meteorologist Klaus-Eckard Puls:
This is an embarrassing calamity for German climate alarmists, who 2 years ago began concocting a meteorologically adventurous hypothesis in an attempt to save face. […] The climate models had predicted nothing of the sort.
Proof that winter weather in one region can be derived from the earlier summertime weather of another region has yet to be found by the generations of meteorology! If it were the case, the problems of longer-term seasonal forecasts would finally be solved.
To this day there is no correlation whatsoever between NAO with CO2.
Our winter weather is still always made in the winter, and there is absolutely no evidence for claims to the contrary!
This completely contradicts meteorological and textbook knowledge: High pressure systems are not created above warm water – low pressure systems are.”
2. Gerhard Müller-Westermeier of the German Weather Service (DWS) in January 2010 found the British claim (warming Arctic leading to reduced pressure difference between Iceland and the Azores) to be “very adventurous”:
We’ve had mainly mild winters in  which single cold months have been widely scattered, like 2009. This winter [2010] is an cold outlier that doesn’t change anything in the overall picture. In general it’s going to get warmer, also in the winter.”
This appears to be about an earlier variant of the theory.
3. Prof. Jochem Marotzke, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (Jan 2010) on the above variant:
They got caught in a classic trap. They are only looking at one factor from the many that determine our climate. For higher air layers, at about 8 km in altitude, we expect that the atmosphere over the tropics will warm more quickly than over the Arctic. That would increase the temperature difference. Moreover the greenhouse effect will overlap the changes in air pressure difference.”

Notice all the contradictions popping up already.
4. Veteran meteorologist Thomas Globig:
I’ve been hearing from some media that it’s all because of the ice melt in the Arctic. That is when the Arctic gets warmer, here it gets colder. Naturally that’s all nonsense! Back then [in 1853] there was no large summer ice melt in the Arctic. Therefore the whole thing has nothing to do with a trend. It is simply just plain weather!”
5. Andreas Friedrich, German Weather Service DWD says in the daily NZ of 8 April 2013, p.7, that there’s no seasonal relationship to be found in weather:
Meteorologists are arguing over the supposed relationship between March cold and July heat. […]  A cold spring is no sign for a hot summer. There’s no relationship; the weather does not have a memory. […] That a cold March – and Match 2013 in Germany was much too cold – allows us to draw the conclusion of a hot summer is refuted by the data of the past years. […] There’s no relationship; it’s all completely coincidental.”
Here Friedrich is talking about spring dictating summer – reminding us that one season’s weather does not dictate the weather of the following season, let alone the season after that!
6. German Weather Service (DWD) press release, 12 April 2013:
Also according to the estimation of the National Weather Service it cannot be conclusively judged whether these research results indeed will be true. The Earth’s climate is a complex system of feedbacks and an exact forecast of its behavior is possible only with great difficulty.
Notice how the German Weather Service press release ignored von Storch’s comments I quoted above. They just left them out.
7. Thomas Stocker, IPCC lead scientist. Weltwoche, No. 15.13, p. 36-40, on the Arctic warming/cold winter explanation:

That’s the statement of one or two publications, but still no scientific consensus. Building a consensus is a tough job. At the IPCC we simply just cannot take in every single study from all the institutes worldwide. It’s possible there will be a statement on this in the coming report, i.e. how the Arctic ice cover influences the statistics of high pressure regions. But for now we are still working on it.”

We wish Stocker lots of luck getting a consensus on that one. (Models aren’t going to cut it).
8. Even Gerstengarbe, one of the study’s authors, expresses doubt!
The studies of this development are ongoing, and so at the moment no conclusions can be made on whether or not Central Europe will have the ‘pleasure’ of cold easterly winds more frequently.”
The media just forgot to mention Gerstengarbe’s little disclaimer clause.
To sum up, the “warm-causes-cold” scientists remind me of the alcoholic who claims his hangovers are due to his leather allergy: Every time he wakes up with his shoes on, he has a big headache!
But the warm Arctic theory is far worse because there’s a correlation only for a couple of years. We can see that the IPCC scientists are setting themselves up to look like complete asses once more.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Hans Labohm writes at the Dutch Standaard that one of the world’s leading geologists, Peter Ziegler of Switzerland, recently made a presentation on the factors driving climate. It’s not CO2, he said.

 Peter Ziegler. Photo from Ziegler family archives. GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version.
Labohm writes at the Dutch Standaard blog here that Arthur Rörsch and Peter Ziegler have been busy lately with the editors of a special issue of Energy & Environment, where a number of prominent climate skeptics are sharing their views on the factors that determine climate. This publication will be communicated to the members of the UN climate panel (IPCC) in due course.
Labohm then writes that Peter Ziegler has also recently completed a presentation based on peer-reviewed literature and current measurements, where he shows that the sun is mainly driving climate change, and not CO2.
The main points of the presentation, Labohm writes:
● Climate changed in response to natural processes that are active also at present, including variations in solar activity and the galactic cosmic ray [GCR] flux and ocean current oscillations.
● Changes in solar activity and temperature correlate closely.
● The temperature changes and rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations of the last 33 years are at odds with the rapid Global Warming Concept of IPCC.
● Temperature forces atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and not vice-versa.
● During industrial Global Warming, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, anthropogenic emissions and temperature do not correlate.
● Early Global Warming coincided with a slight increase in CO2 emissions, while Global Cooling was paralleled by a dramatic increase in CO2 emissions from 4.0 Gt/yr in 1942 to 20.0 Gt/yr in 1975.
● During the negative PDO [Pacific Decadal Oscillation] of 1942 to 1977 the World cooled, CO2 emissions increased 5-fold while atmospheric CO2 concentration accelerated sharply.
● During the positive PDO of 1977 to 2000 temperatures, CO2 emissions and atmospheric CO2 concentrations rose rapidly.
● Early Global Warming coincided with a slight increase in CO2 emissions, while Global Cooling was paralleled by a dramatic increase in CO2 emissions from 4.0 Gt/yr in 1942 to 20.0 Gt/yr in 1975.
● Water vapor and clouds cause 90-95% of the total greenhouse effect, CO2 4.2– 8.4% and methane, ozone, N2O, CH4, CFCs etc. about 1.3%.
● The temperature effect of the first 20 ppm of CO2 is far greater than of the next 400 ppm.
● The total industrial atmospheric CO2 increase caused a temperature rise of ±0.10°C.

● GCMs [General Circulation Models] assume that doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration from a pre-industrial level of 280 ppm will cause by outgoing IR blockage 1.1 C warming that is amplified by associated water–vapor related IR blockage, giving rise to a positive feedback of 2.1 C, resulting in a net temperature increase of 3.2 C.
● Observations show, however, that the combined water vapor, clouds and albedo feedback is with –0.8 C clearly negative and thus reduces the postulated net CO2 warming effect to 0.3 C.
● Since 1750 atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased by about 35.5%. Of this about ⅓ is attributed to anthropogenic emissions and ⅔ to natural sources.
● δ13C-based and mass balance calculations suggest that about 30% of the current atmospheric CO2 are isotopically depleted with more than ⅔ originating from natural marine and biogenic sources and less than ⅓ from anthropogenic emissions.
● Variations in solar activity dominate climate change. Variations in GHG concentration and composition (water vapor, CO2) play a secondary role.
● GCM [General Circulation Models] neglect the PDO [Pacific Decadel Osccillation].
● The Modern Warm Period is not an anomaly but one in a sequence reflecting astronomically–controlled solar oscillations.
● 40% of the about 0.5 0C warming between 1715 and 1970 is accounted by direct solar forcing, the remainder by indirect solar forcing in which the GCR flux plays an important role.
● The sun with its planets, combined with the Galactic Cosmic Ray flux drive the Earth’s climate and not CO2, as professed by IPCC.
● The 20th Century Solar Grand Maximum of general warming that started in 1924 and ended 2008 will be followed by an episode of lower solar activity and notable cooling.

From Wikipedia:
Peter Alfred Ziegler (Winterthur, November 2, 1928) is a Swiss geologist, who made important contributions to the understanding of the geological evolution of Europe and the North Atlantic borderlands, of intraplate tectonics and of plate tectonic controls on the evolution and hydrocarbon potential of sedimentary basins.
He is a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences and the Academia Europaea. He is a life member of the Bureau of the International Lithosphere Program and an honorary member of the Geological Society of London, the European Geosciences Union, the Geological Society of Poland and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.
At the occasion of his 80th birthday the Swiss Geological Society honoured Peter A. Ziegler with a symposium on the theme “Deep Earth – from Crust to Core”, held in Lugano, November 23d, 2008. Peter A. Ziegler is still active and regularly contributes to geosciences by reviewing papers and research proposals. It is the unending support by his wife Yvonne that has shaped his career. Hats off to her!

Professor Malberg starts his article by showing and discussing various solar activity charts. Today I’m a little short on time, and so I’ve translated his outlook and conclusion part of the article, which sums it up nicely.

Outlook
The sun is currently at the start of a quiet phase of activity and will likely reach the critical mean value of 50 sunspots during the current cycle, or even fall below it, i.e. the boundary value between a warm and a cold period. Analogous to the climate conditions during the time of the Dalton Minimum of 200 years ago, we have to expect a climate cooling for the decades ahead.
Only the “fickle“ sun will decide the general extent of the expected cooling and when the temperature again will gradually start to increase. The latter is expected to occur in the second half of the 21st century, when the sun returns to a more active phase.
Both the 200-year De Vries cycle and the 80 to 90-year Gleissberg solar activity cycle point to an imminent drop in solar activity that will have consequences for global climate and food supply.

Russian scientist I. Abdussamatov of the Russian Pulkovo Observatory near St. Petersburg (www.eike.eu) has reached the same conclusion. Also according to his results, the solar minimum – which corresponds to the peak in cooling – is expected to be reached during the solar sunspot cycle around the year 2055.
CO2 will neither be able to keep Europe nor the globe from cooling. At most it will help temper the temperature decrease a bit.
Global temperature has not risen in 15 years. It has stagnated, and in recent years has even shown a downward trend – despite the massive annual increases in CO2 emissions. (Why hasn’t the public been informed of this by the media?) For the politically motivated IPCC and its followers, it is now time to give up the dogma of CO2’s climate dominance and the marginalization and branding of those who differ with climate science. Just because one belongs to the mainstream does not mean he automatically has a better knowledge of the science.
Predicting a global warming of 4°C and associated apocalyptic consequences by 2100 by the CO2-dominated climate models (World Bank, PIK) is pure hypothesizing. As long as the solar effects and associated interactions are underestimated and the effects of CO2 exaggerated, no realistic climate conclusions can be expected.
The earlier analyses of climate allow only one conclusion to be made:
Compared to the integral solar climate effect, with all its complex, non-linear interactive mechanisms (ocean, clouds, albedo, biosphere, cosmic rays,…), the anthropogenic greenhouse/CO2 effect is only of subordinate significance. Also the media attempts to trace back singular weather events to an anthropogenic influence has no merit. History shows that hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, droughts and floods have occurred on and off over the centuries as a result of synoptic constellations. However, because of the population growth to 7 billion, more and more people and their goods are being impacted by natural catastrophes.
Instead of attempting over-rated and ineffective climate protection, all efforts should concentrate on global environmental protection: clean air, clean water, uncontaminated soil and an intact ecosystem are among the fundamental rights of people. Measures for reducing CO2 can be justified by the limited fossil fuel resources and pollution that comes from combustion processes. So-called climate protection is, on the other hand, the least effective of all measures. There never has been a stable climate over the course of history, and there isn’t going to be one in the future.”

"Weather forecasters can predict Britain’s notoriously variable weather as it changes from day to day or even hour to hour. But what about year to year? After all, 2013 saw weeks of unbroken sunshine whereas summer this year has barely got going – despite some blazing hot days now and again – even by late August. Some winters are wet and stormy, others mild and dry. While we can now predict winter seasonal weather with some accuracy, our summer efforts are less advanced. But why shouldn’t we be able to forecast a scorching summer with more accuracy? A new study, published in Climate Dynamics with colleagues at the University of Sheffield, should help. It all depends on the jet stream, the ribbon of strong westerly winds which blows across the Atlantic 10km or more above the surface. Britain is located near the easterly end of the North Atlantic jet and so the jet stream influences much of the variability in its weather. In summer, a jet lying to the north of the British Isles steers any rain-bearing, low-pressure systems northward towards Norway and away from Britain. This results in the UK experiencing the sort of warm dry weather seen for weeks on end in 2013.  However, when the jet stream lies further to the south, those same low-pressure systems tend to hit north-western Europe, resulting in wet weather. A difference in rainfall between north-west Scotland and south-east England highlights this difference. In 2012, for example, while most of the British Isles experienced well above average rainfall, north-west Scotland was unusually dry. In drier summers, however, north-west Scotland tends to experience the higher rainfall associated with a northward jet displacement. In most recent years, this southerly shift in the jet stream has prevailed. This has in part been attributed to warm sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic which lead to lower pressure and increased summer rainfall. A number of recent summer extremes such as the record-breaking wet summers of 2007 or 2012 and the warm dry summer of 2013 have heightened the need for improved understanding of summertime jet stream variability. After all, improvements in seasonal forecasting would lead to great socio-economic benefits – imagine being able to plan your summer months in advance, already knowing whether rain and cloud or endless sunshine is more likely. Ultimately, our research found that there was no single factor that causes the jet stream to shift around. Changes in the sun’s strength from year to year play a role, as does the extent of sea-ice in the Arctic and sea surface temperatures in both the North Atlantic and, perhaps more surprisingly, the tropics near Indonesia. However there is little evidence that the well-known El Niño phenomenon has any influence in summer. It takes quite a while for changes to have an impact on the jet stream. For example, it would seem that solar variability three to five years previously is more significant than solar variability at the time of any given summer.  Likewise, our work found an intriguing and as yet unexplained link between sea ice extent in the previous autumn in the Barents and Kara seas, north of Norway and Russia, and the position of the jet stream in the following summer.  Increased sea ice is associated with a northward shift in the jet, which means drier summers in the UK. Given how fast the Arctic is melting, less ice could contribute to a southward shift in the jet and an increased probability of wet British summers. However, we still don’t know exactly how this will play out in future, and it’s possible that continued sea-ice decline will have some unexpected effects. At present, dynamical forecasting models are showing some skill in making seasonal predictions for the North Atlantic winter, but demonstrate almost no skill for the summer months. Our work found that, while much of the jet variability is attributed to seemingly random atmospheric “noise”, the predictable component of summer jet stream variability may be as high as 35%. This may seem quite small but ensuring such factors are adequately represented in the forecasts will help us predict what’s in store next summer."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust be patient. The warming is really coming. It’s just going to take a little longer than we first thought.
After David Viner had made his now famous “Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past” claim in 2000, the always publicity-seeking Prof. Mojib Latif of Germany’s Max Planck Institute made sure to get in on the act, telling Spiegel only days later: “There aren’t going to be winters with strong frosts and lots of snow at our latitudes anymore, like 20 years ago.”
Today, as Germany reels from its 5th colder-than-normal winter in a row (a record), Latif’s words are sounding cavernously hollow. As a result, Germany’s fundamentalist warmist, catastrophe-obsessed blog site klimaretter.de (climate rescuers) has gone into the damage-control mode, and has conducted an interview with the Prof. Latif in order to re-convince the public that the threat is still out there, is real and that we must remain afraid.

Latif is a meteorologist and climate scientist at the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel (Geomar). He’s also a top IPCC scientist. Photo credit: Björn Láczay from Moosburg, Germany. Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.
Latif: Warming has been small so far
In the interview Latif claims that people have simply forgotten what a winter really looks like, and that’s why snow makes us think the winter is harsh.  He tells us that also in times of global warming there can be real winters. “The warming so far with 0.7 to 0.8 on a global average is still small.” The natural climate fluctuations can still have their full impacts. “Still small”? Before they told us that kind of warming was “unprecedented”.
Latif now postpones warm winters by up to 100 years!
When asked about his David Viner-like comment made to Spiegel in 2000, Latif is forced to amend it, saying: “Indeed there won’t be any more cold winters in 2050 or 2100, if the mean temperatures are several degrees higher.” There we have it: Warm winters suddenly postponed 50 – 100 years.

Latif: Recent cold winters are just weather
When asked to explain what is behind the unexpected, recent harsh winters, Latif tells klimaretter that there are currently 2 explanations: 1) The Arctic ice melt may be changing the atmospheric currents, or 2) changes to currents in the stratosphere. Latif then seems to go on and dismiss both of these explanations, offering his own: “My hypothesis is: The cause is the completely normal chaos of the weather.”
Latif: Warming has stopped but is taking place “in the background”
Ooooh, we’re so scared. Latif acknowledges that warming has stopped over the last 15 years, but labels the conclusion that the AGW theory is therefore wrong as “nonsense”. The recent temperature stagnation “is not in contradiction to global warming“, and cites natural fluctuations that “can have an impact for decades“. He insists that “warming is still taking place in the background“.
Latif: Accelerated warming is just around the next corner!
In the interview, Latif claims that once the natural and man-made causes start complimenting each other, global temperatures will take off again. “The current stagnation means everything but calling off the alarm.”
Now IPCC scientists are telling us that the big bad warming is still out there, that we still need to be very afraid, but that it’s only postponed…maybe up to 100 years… But it’s out there!
This all reminds me of a scene in the 1986 movie “Stand By Me” (one of my favorites) where scaredy-cat Vern is guarding the camp, scared crapless of a cricket (at 10:12).

"The climate crisis is driving alarming levels of hunger in the world, undermining food security in the world’s most vulnerable regions, according to this year’s global hunger index. The annual report, a ranking of 117 countries measuring hunger rates and trends, shows progress since 2000, but warns that the world still has a long way to go to reach the zero hunger target agreed by world leaders by 2030. The report is published as a series of committee on world food security meetings take place in Rome in the run-up to World Food Day on 16 October. The findings show levels of hunger are “serious” or “alarming” in 47 countries, and “extremely alarming” in one: the Central African Republic. Rates are categorised as “alarming” in Chad, Madagascar, Yemen and Zambia. Nine countries have worse scores today than in 2010 – the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Venezuela, Yemen, Jordan, Malaysia, Mauritania, Lebanon and Oman. Data is lacking for several countries – Burundi, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Libya, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, South Sudan and Syria. The authors acknowledge an overall global decline in poverty and increased funding for nutrition but argue that current action and spending will not meet the global sustainable development goals or World Health Assembly nutrition targets. Dominic MacSorley, CEO of Concern Worldwide, co-sponsors of the report with Welthungerhilfe, said that progress towards the zero hunger by 2030 goal is now “under threat or is being reversed”. “Approximately 45 countries are set to fail to achieve low levels of hunger by 2030,” he said. “Conflict, inequality, and the effects of climate change have all contributed to persistently high levels of hunger and food insecurity around the world.” The report finds that the number of undernourished people across the globe is increasing. The rise has been biggest in countries in Africa that are south of the Sahara and affected by conflict and drought. Extreme weather events are putting food production and security in jeopardy and the risk is expected to increase. Food production is likely to fall due to higher temperatures, water scarcity, greater CO2 and extreme weather events. Yields of maize and wheat are already declining. It is estimated that the global food system contributes 21–37% of total human-related emissions. Loss of food after harvesting and before reaching the retail level is estimated at 14% globally, meaning a proportion of food production is likely to exacerbate the climate emergency without even contributing towards food security or nutrition. Current climate commitments are projected to result in warming of 3–4C by 2100, and increased climate pressures could lead to further conflict, according to the report. The authors conclude that what is needed is a profound shift toward sustainability, with changes in values and behaviours and a fairer global balance of power. In her foreword, the former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson, said: “With the number of hungry people rising from 785 million in 2015 to 822 million in 2018, we can no longer afford to regard the 2030 agenda and the Paris climate agreement as voluntary and a matter for each member state to decide on its own.” Instead, she called for “the full implementation” of both to secure “a liveable world for our children and grandchildren”. “This requires a change of mindset at the global political level,” she added. Responding to the report, Lawrence Haddad, executive director of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, said that the poor quality of diets is at the heart of malnutrition and also has a critical impact on greenhouse gas emissions and natural resource use. He too believes that global systems must be reformed, with nutritious foods simply out of reach for billions of people, “either because they are not available or are too expensive”. “To change this we need to transform the food systems that low and middle-income people depend on – and that means supporting the growth of small and medium food businesses that already produce and market nutritious foods,” he said."
"Angus Taylor’s office has left major questions unanswered in its latest attempt to explain allegations it relied on a forged document and false figures for a political attack on the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore. Taylor has spent the week embroiled in allegations his office used a false document with grossly inflated figures about the City of Sydney’s travel expenses to attack the council for driving up emissions while claiming to take a stand on climate change.  Taylor accused the council of spending “$1.7m on international travel and $14.2m on domestic travel” for councillors. The true figures were $1,727.77 on international travel and $4,206.32 on domestic travel. The figures in question are contained in an annual report on the council’s website. That annual report is available for download in PDF and Word form online. Taylor is claiming that his office got the false figures by downloading a version of the annual report from the council’s website last month. This has been hotly disputed by the council, which says the documents have remained unchanged since they were uploaded in November last year with the accurate figures. It has provided metadata and screenshots of the system used to manage its website to corroborate this. Under significant pressure, Taylor issued a statement on Friday afternoon saying he had evidence that suggestions his office doctored the document were “outrageous” and without basis. He said he had “clear evidence” that, contrary to the council’s claims, different versions of the report have existed at various times on its website. To back this up, Taylor’s office produced comparisons between the PDF and Word versions of the annual report as they currently exist on the website. He pointed to minor formatting differences – mainly different line spacing – between the Word and PDF versions. Effectively, he is saying there must have been multiple versions of the document uploaded to the website by council because the PDF and Word versions currently online are slightly different. If multiple versions have existed on the website, it leaves open the possibility that his office downloaded some past version of the document containing the false figures. Taylor’s office has left it up to the council to explain what versions existed on its website and when. “Clearly, given the document and its various drafts and versions, are on the servers of the City of Sydney, only they can prove which documents have existed, and may still currently exist.” The council has already said the PDF and Word versions have been the same – completely unchanged – since November last year. The evidence muddies the waters but is likely to do little to resolve the matter. At its most basic, all it shows is there are minor formatting differences between the PDF version and the Word version of the annual report as they currently exist on the council’s website. This doesn’t necessarily mean the council has uploaded multiple versions of the document to its website. The formatting differences could be explained by the different versions of Word software used to access the documents. Accessing Word documents using Mac, compared to a PC, can create minor formatting differences. The City of Sydney also says this in its statement: “Difference in formatting occur as a consequence of file export and operating system used to open the documents.” The formatting differences also could have existed in November 2018, when the documents were first uploaded, which would negate the suggestion that the council has been uploading different versions of the report to its website. Taylor’s office has not produced direct evidence that he ever downloaded a document with the false figures in it from the council’s website. He has asserted that his office accessed the website on 9 September. The Daily Telegraph says Taylor’s office previously told the paper that it accessed the site on 6 September. But the office has provided neither metadata nor other records to show the document was downloaded on that date. Further, no evidence has been provided that the document ever existed on the council’s website in a form that contained the false figures. Taylor’s office has still not provided evidence to show when and how the document was accessed on the council’s website."
"In addition to providing updated guidelines on which images our editors should use to illustrate the climate emergency, we have updated our style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. Our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, said: “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue”. These are the guidelines provided to our journalists and editors to be used in the production of all environment coverage across the Guardian’s website and paper:  1.) “climate emergency” or “climate crisis” to be used instead of “climate change” Climate change is no longer considered to accurately reflect the seriousness of the overall situation; use climate emergency or climate crisis instead to describe the broader impact of climate change. However, use climate breakdown or climate change or global heating when describing it specifically in a scientific or geophysical sense eg “Scientists say climate breakdown has led to an increase in the intensity of hurricanes”.2.) “climate science denier” or “climate denier” to be used instead of “climate sceptic” The OED defines a sceptic as “a seeker of the truth; an inquirer who has not yet arrived at definite conclusions”. Most “climate sceptics”, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, deny climate change is happening, or is caused by human activity, so ‘denier’ is more accurate. 3.) Use “global heating” not “global warming”‘Global heating’ is more scientifically accurate. Greenhouse gases form an atmospheric blanket that stops the sun’s heat escaping back to space.4.) “greenhouse gas emissions” is preferred to “carbon emissions” or “carbon dioxide emissions”. Although carbon emissions is not inaccurate, if we’re talking about all gases that warm the atmosphere, this term recognises all of the climate-damaging gases, including methane, nitrogen oxides, CFCs etc. 5.) Use “wildlife”, not “biodiversity”We felt that ‘wildlife’ is a much more accessible word and is fair to use in many stories, and is a bit less clinical when talking about all the creatures with whom we share the planet.6.) Use “fish populations” instead of “fish stocks” This change emphasises that fish do not exist solely to be harvested by humans – they play a vital role in the natural health of the oceans. Since we announced these changes, they have been reported widely, shared across social media channels, and even prompted some other media outlets to reconsider the terms they use in their own coverage. The update to the Guardian’s style guide, originally announced earlier this year, followed the addition of the global carbon dioxide level to the Guardian’s daily weather pages – the simplest measure of how the mass burning of fossil fuels is disrupting the stable climate. To put it simply, while weather changes daily, climate changes over years and decades. So alongside the daily carbon count, we publish the level in previous years for comparison, as well as the pre-industrial-era baseline of 280ppm, and the level seen as manageable in the long term of 350ppm. In order to keep below 1.5C of warming, the aspiration of the world’s nations, we need to halve emissions by 2030 and reach zero by mid century. It is also likely we will need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, perhaps by the large-scale restoration of nature. It is a huge task, but we hope that tracking the daily rise of CO2 will help to maintain focus on it.Viner said: “People need reminding that the climate crisis is no longer a future problem – we need to tackle it now, and every day matters.” Access the Guardian and Observer style guide Sign up to the Green Light email"

"It looks like Donald Trump’s “great, great wall” is actually going to happen. Its likely impact on human society has been well-noted, but in the longer-term a barrier across an entire continent will also have severe ecological consequences.  The US-Mexico border is around 1,900 miles (3,100 km) long and some of it has already been fenced off. According to Trump the proposed wall will cover approximately 1,000 miles and “natural obstacles” such as rivers or mountains will take care of the rest. Aside from the debates over whether or not the wall will do much to stop drug trafficking or illegal immigration, how much it will cost the US taxpayer, or whether Mexico will pay for it, a 1,000-mile wall has significant environmental costs. For a start, all that concrete will generate millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions. And then you have the fact the wall will ravage a unique desert habitat that straddles the two countries and will prevent the movement of local animals.  US Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) has estimated that the wall will threaten 111 endangered species as it passes through four key wildlife reserves on the US side of the border and several nature reserves on the Mexican side. Some of the affected species are obvious: animals with cross-border populations include bighorn sheep, ocelots and bears. Splitting plant and animal populations by building a concrete wall promotes inbreeding and a decrease in genetic diversity, which makes many species susceptible to diseases and epidemics. The wall is also likely to wipe out the few jaguars still lingering in Arizona and New Mexico by cutting them off from breeding populations south of the border. Other species are more unexpected: the bald eagle, America’s national bird, can obviously fly over any barriers yet the disruption to its habitat means it makes the FWS’s list of affected migratory birds. Even marine animals such as manatees or sea turtles can’t escape the wall’s impact. The Trump wall may never become anything more solid than a metaphor for increased border surveillance, aided by technology, to keep illegal immigration under control. However, if a vast concrete wall really is built, and if it is as tall and impenetrable as Trump hopes, it will presumably last for thousands of years. This will have long-term ecological consequences.  The glacial and interglacial cycles of ice ages and warm periods unfold over thousands of years. Over the past 11,000 years we have had a relatively stable climate, but anthropogenic warming is delaying the arrival of the next ice age.  As species start to feel the pressure of a warming climate, they will need to move towards the poles as their habitats shift. Plants and animals currently found in central Mexico may find their “natural” home moves north of the border. The wall will make such movement impossible and will make these species vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Equally, in the much longer term, if or when the next ice age eventually begins and ice sheets start to expand southwards, species from the north of the wall will need to move south to escape the freezing temperatures. The Trump wall will pose a significant obstacle for such movements.  On evolutionary timescales of millions of years, such an obstacle in the movement of animals and plants will drive extinctions and the emergence of new species. A political act of this kind can have far-reaching consequences for the ecological and even evolutionary landscapes. Preexisting security barriers across the US-Mexico border are already making life difficult for local wildlife, according to peer-reviewed research. Scientists across the world consistently call for more permeable border fences in order to allow animals to move through them. One 2011 study even looked specifically at the US-Mexico border. The authors warned species were being forced into risky unfenced “bottlenecks” and called for better planning tailored towards wildlife movement. Our knowledge of how to conserve animals across international borders has come a long way. Many nations have embraced shared responsibility for shared wildlife, and a number of international legal instruments also set out the “dos and don'ts” for conservation in transboundary regions. If Trump really wants to show his prowess in construction, and wants to leave a long-term infrastructure legacy, then he should build bridges for wildlife on the US-Mexico border – not walls."
"UK backing for a World Bank fund to help poor countries will hinge on reforms at the global institution to channel more money into tackling the climate crisis, improving gender equality and ensuring vulnerable countries can pay their debts. Speaking in Washington, the international development secretary, Alok Sharma, said the size of the UK’s contribution to the Bank’s concessional loan facility for the world’s least-developed countries would depend on a more focused anti-poverty approach. The Bank is currently seeking contributions from rich countries for the 19th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA 19), which provides soft loans and grants for countries in financial difficulty. Britain is one of the few countries to meet the United Nations target for spending 0.7% of national income on development assistance, and the size of the aid budget meant it was the biggest single donor to IDA 18, a three-year $75bn (£58bn) round of funding which expires in 2020. Sharma, with the Bank keen to raise even more money for IDA 19, made it clear he intended to use the UK’s leverage to secure change. In a meeting with Malpass at the Bank’s annual meeting in Washington, Sharma said action was needed to: Increase the Bank’s financial support to tackle the climate crisis, including helping the most vulnerable communities to become more resilient and preparing for potential natural disasters Preserve biodiversity and invest in innovative nature-based solutions such as reforestation Focus on mobilising private-sector investment for the poorest countries – and making a priority of green, quality infrastructure projects that form the backbone of economic growth Bring about improved debt transparency and sustainability, through balancing the need for finance with limits on how much governments are borrowing from different sources before the International Development Association agrees more loans Provide extra money and an increase in World Bank staff based in fragile and conflict-stricken countries Improve rights of women and girls through increasing access to safe family planning services, ensuring girls can go to school and stronger laws against gender-based violence. Sharma said: “The UK is leading the way to build sustainable economies. It is my ambition that within 10 years our partner countries will raise 10 times more resource through private-sector investment and their own tax revenues than they receive in UK aid. “To help meet this challenge, the World Bank must prioritise fighting climate change, investing in quality infrastructure, improving the rights of women and girls and giving a lifeline to people living in conflict zones.” A World Bank spokesman said: “We are always grateful for the United Kingdom’s support of IDA. The proposed policy package in IDA 19 will direct more funding toward people in fragile and conflict-affected situations, and will reaffirm our commitment to projects that benefit the climate and promote greater inclusion, for example on gender and persons with disabilities.”"
"The European Investment Bank (EIB) has balked at a proposal to halt new investments in fossil fuels, raising concerns that Germany and other nations are plotting to water down what would be one of the financial sector’s most ambitious climate moves. The EIB, the largest public bank in the world, announced this year that it would end lending to new gas projects, having already curtailed funding for coal and oil. This would free up more money for renewable energy developments. The details of the plan were expected to be confirmed by a board meeting of EU finance ministers on Tuesday but last-minute lobbying has forced a postponement.  Executives of the bank, which is owned by EU member states, said the plan was still on course and would probably be approved next month. “The new energy lending policy is a milestone on the EIB’s road to transform itself into the EU Climate Bank. I am pleased about the important progress made today and am confident of securing a final approval in November,” said Andrew McDowell, the EIB vice-president responsible for energy. But climate campaigners fear the measures will be delayed further and weakened. “This delay is a direct result of Germany and the European commission pushing to add more fossil fuels back into the policy. This is the opposite of the leadership demanded by millions of climate strikers and activists around the world,” said Alex Doukas of the NGO Oil Change International. “We are in the middle of a climate emergency, so it shouldn’t be hard to say no to more public money for fossil fuels.” Between 2013-17, the EIB provided almost €12bn (£10.4bn) in loans to fossil fuel projects, almost all for gas. Supporters of the gas industry argue it is a “transition” fuel that reduces demand for higher-carbon oil and coal while providing energy security. Climate campaigners say gas projects release high levels of methane, which has a far greater greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide, and that they will delay the transition to zero-carbon renewables such as wind and solar power. The EIB says it has provided more than €65bn of new financing for renewable energy projects, but the bank’s president, Werner Hoyer, has called for more urgency. “We believe that gas emissions are too high and cannot be maintained. We must move out of these fossil fuels. We are aware it takes a transition period. We are aware that it takes help for the regions that are dependent on coal and gas. But one should not hide behind these arguments in order to perpetuate the use of these types of materials,” he said in a recent interview. EU leaders plan to describe global heating as an “existential threat”, according to a leaked copy of a summit communique, but there are divisions over the speed of action. Poland and Hungary are among a handful of countries that oppose the setting of an EU-wide zero-carbon target by 2050. Germany reportedly believes gas is necessary for energy security, at least on an interim basis as it moves away from coal and nuclear power. The clamour for urgent action is increasingly loud, spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, student climate strikers, Extinction Rebellion protesters and influential establishment voices such as David Attenborough and the Church of England. Scientists warned last year there was little over a decade to transform energy systems if the world was to have any chance of keeping global heating to a relatively safe level. Yet the world of finance continues to move in the opposite direction, particularly in the private sector. In a weeklong investigation, the Guardian revealed the world’s largest investment banks and asset management companies had aggressively expanded into new coal, oil and gas projects since the 2016 Paris climate agreement. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned that many of these assets will be left stranded, leading to bankruptcies and a growing risk of a global financial crash."

Here he explains to his German readers how the temperature really developed over the Holocene and why the 20th century is “unique”.
To do this, Rahmstorf uses the findings of the already refuted Shaun Marcott et al paper, reminding us that Marcott et al “tried out 20 different averaging methods and carried out 1000 Monte Carlo-simulations ” in order “to confirm the robustness of their results“. Rahmstorf writes:
To put the main results in a nutshell, it appears as follows:

Fig. 1. Blue curve: global temperature reconstruction from proxy data from Marcott et al., Science 2013. Shown is the RegEM version – noteworthy differences between the variants with different averaging methods appear only at the end, where the number of proxy series decreases, but where the temperature course is well-known from the instrumental measurements. Red curve: global temperature for (HadCRU). Graphic: Klaus Bittermann.”
Next Rahmstorf explains how there had been a long term general cooling over 5000 years, and that that this was interrupted suddenly by a skyrocketing warming over the last 100 years, a warming that completely cancelled all the cooling that had taken 5000 years to accomplish.
Rahmstorf then compares the Marcott reconstruction to the PAGES 2k reconstruction, as shown in his Fig. 3:


Fig. 3. The last two thousand years taken from Fig. 1 compared to the PAGES reconstruction (green), which is explained in Part 1. Graphic: Klaus Bittermann.”
On Fig. 3 Rahmstorf comments:
What we see is that both reconstructions produce consistent results. The course of the last 1000 years is practically identical and is, by the way, one more confirmation of the ‘hockey stick’ from Mann et al. 1999 – see part 2 of this series, The hockey stick debate.”
So now in Rahmstorf’s mind, the hockey stick is back to life (again).

Next Rahmstorf asks if the modern warming is unique, and explains the methodology used for the 20th century temperature reconstruction:
Because of the mentioned limitations of sediment cores, the new temperature reconstruction does not extend to the present, rather only until 1940, and the number of data curves used decreases significantly before that. (Therefore the shown range of uncertainty becomes increasingly wider near the end and reconstructions with various averaging methods diverge here – here we show the RegEM method because it works the best with the decreasing data coverage – see the blog from Grant Foster for more details, who is a professional statistician). The warming of the 20th century is therefore only captured to some extent, which is not a big problem because the warming is optimally documented by weather stations. There’s no doubt about the climate development of the 20th century.”
True there is no doubt about the 20th century. All the doubt surrounds the reconstructions over the course of the Holocene, and there’s very much in dispute. Moreover, splicing datasets coming from totally different measurement methods is dubious in the least, and is thus nothing less than creative curve designing. On the splicing, Rahmstorf comments.
There is a certain amount of room for play on how one splices the proxy data (blue) to the thermometer data (red) – Here I made it so that the mean value of the Marcott curve is the same as the mean value of the PAGES 2k reconstruction for the time period of 1000 to 1940 AD.”
Rahmstorf does admit that there are problems with the Marcott paper, yet feels that in principle it is correct and that the 20th century warming is unique, citing three reasons: 1) other proxies have never shown a warming like that seen in the 20th century during the entire Holocene, 2) statistics expert Grant Foster says so, and 3) such a rash warming must have physical reasons, and thus would have to disappear just as quickly.
Rahmstorf summarizes by saying that although the Marcott curve can be improved on, he believes that the course of the curve is “for the most part correct” and claims that a gradual cooling over the last several thousand years was abruptly interrupted in the 20th century.
To drive the point across to his readers, Rahmstorf then reaches ever deeper into his creative curve-designing toolbox and next splices on a scenario produced by model projections that use the worst-case climate-sensitivities (which have been shown to have been completely exaggerated) to the already dubiously diced and spliced proxy/instrumental reconstruction. By now the curve looks worse than Evel Knievel did after his worst motorcycle crash:


Fig. 4. Global temperature since the last ice age 20,000 years ago and extended until the year 2100 for a intermediate emissions scenario with about 3°C of warming. Graphic: Jos Hagelaars.”
This is not above finger-painting of curves in climate-kindergarten.
Rahmstorf’s Fig. 4 tells us what will happen if we “do not rashly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases”. He writes that “we are in the process of catapulting ourselves out of the Holocene.” and that if we continue on, “we will know longer recognize our Earth by the end of the century.”

"Oil has been a game-changer for humanity. It turbocharged more than a century of growth and destruction: people got bigger, went further, stayed warmer and lived longer. Oil powered travel, exploration, science, industry and innovation. But it also powered conflict, both as a fuel and a potential spoil. It exacerbated inequality. And it polluted – oceans, rivers, wildernesses and, of course, the atmosphere.  It is clear that we cannot go on like this. That is why it was heartening this week to learn that renewables were experiencing such strong growth that demand for oil might peak in the next decade. Barely a week goes by without some new renewables record being achieved. In London, environmental activists are glueing themselves to trains and railings to urge the transformation that can halt the climate crisis. It may be quietly and slowly happening already.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his Die Welt blog, journalist Ulli Kulke has a commentary on the recent scientific study issued by the NOAA and its latest findings concerning the US drought last year, which now states that it was due to just plain bad, natural weather and was not man-made.
Kulke calls the findings embarrassing for President Obama, who now likes to “blame such single meteorological events on man-made climate change”.
Kulke writes that the tragic drought in the US states had no connection with climate change, at least nothing of significance. Even more embarrassing: “The study had been written by scientists of the US government and was made public on Thursday by five different government institutes.” The NOAA report concluded:
The Central Great Plains drought during May-August of 2012 resulted mostly from natural variations in weather.”
Kulke adds concerning the lack of southerly winds from the Gulf and lack of midwestern thunderstorms, which led to the drought (my emphasis):
The study’s authors trace both phenomena back to the jet stream – an upper altitude strong wind that blows from west to east around the northern hemisphere and influences weather events – has been a little more to the north lately (by the way: sober meteorologists also blamed a shift in the jet stream for the drought in Russia three years ago and for the catastrophic floods in Pakistan). No climate model ever predicted such a situation.”

Let’s be very clear on that, as some scientists are now scrambling to connect jet stream variation to man-made climate change using “model simulations”.
Kulke tells German readers that the study found no relationship between a man-made climate change and an increase in extreme weather events, even if such events are always gladly postulated. Kulke reminds us: “Also the IPCC has not been able to find such a relationship. President Obama should have learned something from that.”
The NOAA report of course is not only an embarrassment for the president, but also for scientists, like Kevin Trenberth, who is employed by the NOAA, and who now requests studying to see if the jet stream shift is perhaps connected to climate change. Kulke sarcastically states that for Trenberth today, “There can be no large meteorological event that is not influenced by man.”
Kulke reminds German readers that Trenberth is the scientist who in a Climategate e-mail wrote of another major dilemma that has long dogged climate science: the lack of warming, “We can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty  that we can’t.”
Kulke concludes: “Even if someone does manage to slap together a relationship between the jet stream and climate change, it’s still not going to help Trenberth at all to get out of his dilemma.”

"British Prime Minister Theresa May is visiting India on her first significant overseas visit outside the EU – and there is real interest in how it could be a harbinger of Britain’s post-Brexit future. Analysts are cautious about any major breakthroughs or significant trade deals, especially given strained relations between the UK and India over issues of immigration, which affect students and professionals in particular. But part of the UK’s agenda is to work bilaterally with India on a number of areas of mutual interest at the UK-India Tech Summit. Discussions will include the technological possibilities for “smart cities”, an area that has been identified by the UK delegation as a major focus for the event. This also resonates with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s high profile smart cities initiative, launched last year. Plans focus on making these urban settlements technologically-enabled, to ensure connectivity and communication using the latest information technologies. But what is missing is a sense of how cities may also be “ecologically smart” by securing the essential needs of their inhabitants – particularly clean air, especially important in smog-hit Delhi, and drinking water. It is also important to recognise that “ecological smartness” must include an understanding of the interests, aspirations and current circumstances of the different groups that live in these places.  Over the past three years, a project jointly funded by the UK Department for International Development, the Natural Environment Research Council and the Economic and Social Research Council, has investigated the ways in which people living in and around six small towns in the Western Himalaya access water through a diversity of sources. These range from springs to piped supply, and the project also examined the sustainability challenges faced by these sources.  Through these multiple and far-ranging case studies in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Nepal, the team highlighted important lessons relevant to understanding water supply and how it is used and sourced in the urbanising hills. It has also outlined the policy options for securing water supplies for the needs of these hill residents. There are a number of key lessons that emerge from this project, which provide helpful guidance on how to make all cities ecologically, as well as technologically, “smart”. These are: The importance of critical water zones. The long-term sustainability of water sources is essential for the maintenance and growth of urban settlements. Urban planning and development occurs within city boundaries – but we must also proactively identify, manage and protect the critical water zones – the areas that are essential for the maintenance and regeneration of water flows across all landscapes, and which are often under threat due to rapid urban expansion, encroachment, changes in land use and deforestation. Inequality and the politics of water distribution. Within towns, cities and surrounding rural settlements, water is highly unequally distributed. Access is determined by a range of historical and socio-economic factors – and negotiations and conflicts around water access, distribution and quality between up- and downstream settlements characterise life in the hills. The diversion and appropriation of water to urban areas could create new conflicts – and we need to understand them. Local preferences and diverse water strategies. Households in the hills depend on multiple water sources, complementary to piped water connections. This is to do with cultural preferences – such as a belief that spring water in the mountains is sweeter – and risk management, due to the unreliability of municipal supplies. This continued preference for traditional sources alongside technological innovations should inform interventions to improve water availability, especially in small towns.   Large infrastructure decisions and management choices. States and donors are increasingly developing top-down, large-investment infrastructure projects to supply water in mountain areas. These so-called “solutions” don’t always consider the full range of possible options – especially those that are more local, small-scale and relevant to those they serve. Multiple overlapping institutions for water supply. Water supply systems to address the needs of small towns are adopting new and varied governance structures. Donor and state-led systems should engage with local people and institutions both up and downstream, to ensure that development is useful to the communities it affects. Decision-making and research in the hills often takes place with little access to data, as most of the areas do not have long term monitoring and records. In such contexts, different forms of knowledge are required – these include local wisdom, experience over generations, expert opinion, as well as more innovative approaches to address data gaps (such as modelling). As India and the UK look to each other for areas of mutual dialogue, a focus on ecological smartness might provide a unique opportunity for harnessing the considerable wealth of research on these issues in both countries, as well as responding to the challenges that both India and the UK face as they become increasingly urbanised.  The dialogue around technology involving Britain and India must expand to include the importance of finding ways for living well and sustainably in the rapidly urbanising 21st century."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal investment in renewable energies in the first quarter of this year plummeted a whopping 22%, falling to $40 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance here.
The consequences for many companies and their employees of course will be calamitous to say the least. So many employees had been given the false promise of green jobs. Now, as governments are realizing that green energies are enormously expensive, and man-made climate change is over-hyped, subsidies are being slashed.
On their own, renewable energies are unable to compete and investors are turning their backs.
Green investment plummets 96% in Spain
Ironically, the hardest hit country was Spain, writes gstriatum.com. In the first quarter of 2013 Spain saw almost all of its investment in renewable energies evaporate, plummeting a mind-numbing 96%. President Obama once touted Spain as a shining example of green economy success, see here and here. Clearly Obama’s energy advisers had no clue about the complete lack of viability of renewable energies and have left the President standing embarrassed.

France and Italy have also been hard hit.
Michael Liebreich, Chief of Bloomberg New Energy: “For investment in clean energy to play its role in stemming the growth in world emissions, we would need to see investment levels at least double by 2020, rather than fall.”
What Liebreich really means here is: If countries cannot even afford the current level, then doubling the investment is completely out of the question. Expect green energy to die on the vine. The boom is over.
Bloomberg blames the collapsing investment on the uncertain political conditions in key markets like USA and Germany. Clearly the two countries are thinking twice about following Spain’s footsteps.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Economist here has an excellent analysis of the German “Energiewende” which is the country’s bold transformation to (80%) renewable energy by 2050. Right now the Economist is not too impressed, and its report should serve as a warning to other countries contemplating a similar move.
Hat tip Judith Curry (must read).
Some quotes:
“Germany’s Energiewende bodes ill for the country’s European leadership.”
“The reality has been messier, marked by price distortions, political U-turns, surging costs and inadequate infrastructure.”
“Businessmen say the Energiewende will kill German industry. Power experts worry about blackouts. Voters are furious about ever higher fuel bills.”
“…people see no paradox in demanding an end to nuclear power but objecting to the new transmission grid being built in their backyard.”
“…modern, clean natural-gas power plants are not viable. Only ageing, dirty brown-coal power stations with low variable costs can compete. The result is a web of grotesque distortions.”

“The cost of this mess is passed on to electricity users.”
Here we note that the Greens propose having industry take over the costs, but so far have been unable to explain what industry would do with these added costs. Not being able to think more than one step ahead is a chronic illness of the Greens.
“Germany’s most energy-intensive industries are now eyeing expansion on the other side of the Atlantic.”
Read the entire report here: www.economist.com/tilting-windmills.
The direction of the Energiewende is clear, and thus it is not hard to predict what’s up ahead for the country if it doesn’t make radical adjustments soon. Yet, its leaders refuse to pull their heads out of the sand and insist it’s going to work…somehow. From a sociological point of view, it is intriguing to observe a movement that is so cock-sure of itself, proud, arrogant, and obstinate that it would prefer to compromise the entire nation before admitting it has erred. History repeats.
The problem is that the green movement is massively institutionalized at every civic level and has been codified as the moral thing to do by all parties. How can it backtrack now and save face? Can we expect it to dismantle itself? The answer is clearly no.
Global warming science prematurely became fact and settled science years ago in Germany. Anyone who disagreed was labelled a heretic, outcast or extremist. Just take a look at the latest UBA brochure. As the Economist shows, it is truly a sad situation when a country meanders so far off course that its “extremists” in the end are proven to have been right all along.
I don’t see any change of direction coming at all. The green religion has even been hammered deep into the psyche of schoolchildren. Germany finds itself back in familiar historical territory. The only thing that can save it now is a major explosive upheaval. The longer the pressure builds…

"When Charles Darwin stopped briefly at the Falkland Islands on the famous voyage of the Beagle, he ran into one of the great mysteries in animal evolution. The islands had just one native terrestrial mammal, which he confusingly described as a “wolf-like fox”. It wasn’t clear what the species was descended from, or how it had ended up in such a remote place, hundreds of kilometres from the nearest mainland. The Falkland Islands wolf, known also as the warrah or Dusicyon australis, was hunted to extinction in the latter half of the 19th century. As such it was little studied. Darwin’s visit, in the species’ final decades, remains one of the only scientific observations of this poor animal. Scientists long thought that the extinct Falklands wolf was, as its name suggests, similar to a wolf. However, new research by colleagues and me published in the journal Mammal Review reveals that, in terms of skull shape and feeding habits, this mysterious “wolf” was more like a jackal. The Falklands wolf had previously been linked to wolves, coyotes and domestic dogs, and scientists even named it Canis antarticus. It wasn’t until 2009 that DNA analysis was used to prove its closest living relative is the maned wolf of South America, which is actually neither a wolf nor a fox. Nevertheless, this species of wild canid (the wider dog family) is characterised by unusually tall limbs, which make it very different from the rather sturdy Falklands wolf. So where did the Falklands wolf come from? By looking through the South American fossil record, scientists identified its direct ancestor as an extinct fox known as Dusicyon avus which was once found as far south as Patagonia. A 2013 study found Falklands wolf DNA split from its mainland ancestors about 16,000 years ago – during the last ice age.  At that point, when sea levels were much lower, Patagonia was only separated from the Falklands by a small passage of shallow sea which would have frozen over at times. This meant Dusicyon avus probably walked across an ice bridge to the Falklands, before evolving in complete isolation into the warrah.  Mystery solved. So we now know where the warrah came from, but what was it actually like? I wanted to figure out its ecology, and that meant looking at its bones and comparing them to other canids and what we know about their behaviour. To do this, I worked with a team of LJMU colleagues, a paleontologist from Argentina, and curators at the Natural History Museum (NHM) in London. We dug through the cupboards at the NHM and World Museum Liverpool to build a database of more than 120 digital images of representative skulls of living wild canid species, including rare specimens of Falklands wolf and its ancestor Dusicyon avus.  We then mapped out various anatomical landmarks that would be present in each (the tip of the upper and lower jaw, say, or the relative position of upper and lower canines and molar teeth) and used this information to quantify the shape of all the wild canid skulls we investigated. This gave us directly comparable data which helps reveal similarities and differences between species.  We realised the Falklands wolf and Dusicyon avus most closely resembled the jackal species found in Africa and Eurasia. Shared features such as wide elongated muzzles, narrow cheekbones, large first lower molars and thick lower jaws, are typical of medium-sized opportunistic predators.  As with jackals alive today, the Falklands wolf would have been an unfussy eater, capable of scavenging or killing everything from small ground-nesting birds to marine mammals like seal pups. Jackal-like feeding habits may even have determined the fate of these “wolves”, as they would also have targeted sheep which were imported to the Falklands from the 1850s onwards. The Falkland Islands wolf is one of many species that, after colonising South America, quickly evolved features similar to distantly-related counterparts in the Old World. The bush dog of South America is another. With its short muzzle and wide cheekbones, this small canid resembles in skull morphology the much larger African hunting dog and the Asiatic dhole. All three species hunt in packs and independently converged on the same head shape, which gives them an unusually strong bite and means they can grab hold of fleeing large prey like deer or capybara.  South America represented an important “laboratory” for the natural selection of modern canid species. The continent now has the world’s richest diversity of dogs, wolves and their relatives. The historical loss of the Falkland Islands wolf highlights, again, that humans are their greatest threat."
"How time flies. But as the festive season draws to a close there is one thing left to sort out: what to do with the Christmas tree? Do we recycle it or just throw it away?  The tradition of decorating Christmas trees is still going strong. Yet there is an inevitable seasonal increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Nobody wants to be a Grinch or a Scrooge. But, perhaps it is possible to reduce our carbon footprint by thinking about what we do with our Christmas trees afterwards. It is commonly thought that real Christmas trees are better for the environment than artificial trees. Real trees can be decompose into compost and be recycled or be turned into wood chippings for reuse. All local authorities will provide some form of recycling service for Christmas trees. But statistics for Christmas tree recycled are not recorded separately from other forms of waste. It is estimated that 160,000 tonnes of real Christmas trees is either flytipped or goes to landfill. That could amount to local authorities having to pay up to £12.8m in landfill taxes – a lot of money that could be better spent on improving recycling and other council services. A real Christmas tree that is sent to landfill has a carbon footprint of about 16kg. As it decomposes, it produces methane. But an artificial tree produces more than twice the greenhouse gas emissions than that of a real tree that goes to landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree that is incinerated. An artificial tree is also thought to have a higher initial carbon footprint because it is made of plastic, which comes from oil. Recycling, landfill and incineration are not the be-all and end-all of waste management. According to the waste hierarchy, which forms the basis of EU and UK waste policy, reuse and prevention should be seen as higher priorities. While artificial Christmas trees cannot be recycled, they can be stored away in January and reused year after year. Real trees cannot generally be used more than once. If you can hold on to an artificial Christmas tree for at least 10 years, it becomes the greener option. In other words, using one artificial tree for 10 years produces the same amount of carbon emissions as buying a new, real tree a year for 10 years. As evergreens, real Christmas trees can be reused if they still have their roots. As well as being replanted in gardens, they can shore up flood defences or offset carbon emissions. But they do that anyway without being chopped down for Christmas.    Real Christmas trees may be a minority taste anyway. Some 6m to 8m real trees are sold every year in the UK. But, according to research carried out in 2012 by consumer group Which?, only 20% of households were planning to buy real trees, with 50% of households opting for artificial trees. The falling pound may have given British Christmas tree growers a boost over artificial tree manufacturers.      The debate over whether real or artificial Christmas trees are better for the environment goes on every year. But whether a tree is man-made or natural is not necessarily what matters. What counts in the battle against climate change is what happens after Twelfth Night, when it’s time to take the fairy lights down."
"More than one in five shareholders of mining giant BHP have backed a resolution calling on the company to resign its membership of any industry associations whose advocacy is “inconsistent” with the Paris climate change agreement. BHP’s board recommended shareholders vote against the resolution at its annual meeting in London, but 22% of shareholders voted in favour, with another 7% abstaining. While the resolution failed, campaigners are seeing the strength of the vote as a sign pressure is building on both BHP and the Minerals Council of Australia to bring their advocacy in line with the Paris goal of keeping global heating “well below 2C”. In the spotlight is BHP’s membership of the Minerals Council and the associated Coal 21 – an industry-funded group that was set up to develop lower-emissions technology but which has spent millions on pro-coal advertising. The resolution recommended BHP suspend memberships of any industry group which, since January 2018, had carried out advocacy that “demonstrated, on balance, inconsistency with the Paris agreement’s goals.” In a speech before the vote, BHP’s CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, said mining trade associations “deserve our full engagement”. He said: “The move to renewables demands a multifold increase in the production of metals in the decades ahead, which makes mining one of the most vital components of our low-carbon future. “At a time of increased focus on local solidarity, protection and intervention, in response to increased insecurity and global changes, it’s our participation in industry associations which can contribute to the more global solutions also required for a more progressive world.” He said a taskforce he led across the mining industry was working to make “our vehicles greener and safer” and that this “typifies the vast bulk of the work of all the trade associations we join and we work tirelessly to make sure this kind of work is their major and predominant role.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a July speech, Mackenzie said the world’s dependence on fossil fuels “carries risks with it that could be existential”. In its notice to shareholders before the meeting, BHP reiterated it was still reviewing its industry association memberships, with the outcomes of the review to be released before the end of 2019. The scope of that review had changed from a previous review to include the company’s membership of Coal 21. A previous 2017 review saw BHP leave the World Coal Association but staying with the Minerals Council to work with it on new climate and energy policy positions. Brynn O’Brien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which organised the resolution, described the vote as “phenomenal” and said it showed a transformation was under way. The centre argued in supporting statements to the meeting that the Minerals Council, Coal 21, and other industry groups BHP was a member of had carried out advocacy that was not consistent with the Paris goals. O’Brien said: “That companies should suspend funding to organisations that undertake lobbying counter to the goal of a habitable planet is an idea whose time has well and truly come. “BHP should reconsider its position in advance of the BHP Group Ltd AGM in Sydney on 7 November.” “Every single trade association that lobbies to undermine the goals of the Paris Agreement is on notice: your time is up.” Earlier this month, Australia’s biggest superannuation fund warned the MCA its updated climate policy did not go far enough in explaining how its members were working towards climate goals. The Minerals Council has pledged to release a “climate action plan” in 2020 that its chief executive, Tania Constable, said would “support strong and innovative action by Australia’s world-leading minerals sector to address human-induced climate change.” In September, a report from UK-based thinktank InfluenceMap named the Minerals Council of Australia as “one of the top 10 most obstructive trade associations” globally on climate policy."
"A few hours after this column is published, I hope to be in a police cell. I don’t yet know what the charge will be, where I will be arrested or when, but I know that if I go home this evening without feeling the hand of the law on my sleeve, I will have failed. This may sound like a strange ambition, but I believe it is a reasonable one. If I succeed, I will be one of many. In the current wave of Extinction Rebellion protests, more than 1,400 people have so far allowed themselves to be arrested. It’s a controversial tactic, but it has often proved effective. The suffragettes, the Indian salt marchers, the civil rights movement and the Polish and East German democracy movements, to name just a few, all used it as a crucial strategy. Mass arrests are a potent form of democratic protest. They work because they show that the campaigners are serious. When people are prepared to jeopardise their liberty for their cause, other people appear more likely to listen to what they say, and more likely to recognise its importance. Those who founded Extinction Rebellion researched these histories and sought to apply their lessons to the greatest predicament humanity has ever faced - the gathering collapse of our life support systems. Nowhere on Earth does government action match the scale of the catastrophes we face. Part of the reason is the remarkably low level of public discussion and information on this crisis. Another is that the political risks of action are higher than the perceived rewards – a balance the protesters want to redress. But perhaps the most important factor is the brute power of the pollutocrats driving this disaster. As the Guardian’s The polluters series shows, the big fossil fuel companies have used political funding, intense lobbying and gross deceptions of the public to overwhelm environmental protections and keep harvesting their massive profits. Those who confront them have no such power. We cannot buy television channels and newspapers, pour billions into political lobbying or seed dark ads on social media. We have only one strength: our vulnerability. By putting our bodies on the line and risking our liberty, we make this great neglected issue impossible to ignore. So far, the campaign has been remarkably successful. Alongside the youth climate strikes, Extinction Rebellion has changed the global conversation about climate and environmental breakdown. These movements are directly responsible for the declaration of a climate emergency by the UK parliament and many other political bodies. But this is not enough. It is one thing to recognise an emergency, another to act on it. We must do more. I cannot justifiably say “we” if I don’t mean “I”. I know this action will expose me to criticism as well as prosecution. Like other prominent activists, I will be lambasted for hypocrisy: this is now the favoured means of trying to take down climate activists. Yes, we are hypocrites. Because we are embedded in the systems we contest, and life is complicated, no one has ever achieved moral purity. The choice we face is not between hypocrisy and purity, but between hypocrisy and cynicism. It is better to strive to do good, and often fail, than not to strive at all. Other criticisms carry more weight. Extinction Rebellion is too white, and too middle class. Both charges are true, as the organisers recognise: they know that they must do more to break down the cultural barriers the movement unconsciously erects, engage with community leaders, and listen to voices that have not been heard. But I cannot help who I am. I accept that the costs of arrest for people like me – a white, middle-class man with an established career – are lower than for other people. But this means I have a moral duty to use my privilege. The victims of climate breakdown have so far been mostly voiceless and invisible to us. But we know that, even with just 1C of global heating, climate chaos is already a bigger cause of forced migration than either poverty or political oppression. Large numbers of people in Somalia, Mozambique, Bangladesh, the Caribbean, Central America and many other parts of the world are already losing their homes and livelihoods. The poor parts of the world are the least responsible for climate disaster but the most likely to suffer its effects. They carry the cost of our consumption. We have imposed this crisis on others, and must do what we can to curtail it. Since I began writing this article, getting arrested has become easier: the police have imposed a blanket ban on “any assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion autumn uprising” across London. This looks to me like a breach of article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: “Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.” Over the past four decades, the police have acquired an extraordinary array of powers – enabling them, in effect, to shut down any protest. But they deem even these insufficient: at a recent press conference they demanded new “banning orders” for “habitual” protesters. Given that regular protest has proved throughout history to be an essential mechanism for political reform, this looks like a direct attack on democracy. Far from deterring me, the draconian ban this week and the police demand for even greater powers has strengthened my determination. Now I feel I am standing not only for the habitability of the planet but also for the continued right to protest. This is my duty, and I intend to fulfil it. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"Over breakfast at our riad in old town Marrakech, conversation was dominated by Donald Trump’s election victory and what kind of world we had woken up to. We’re here in Morocco for COP22, the latest round of UN climate change talks. Climate experts from across the world have gathered here to decide on the actual detail of the Paris Agreement which was signed last year at the previous conference, COP21. Our group from the University of Sheffield is very diverse – delegates come from India and Zimbabwe as well as Britain – yet we were all in agreement: Trump’s election is shocking and scary news for the world. We arrived at the COP22 “blue zone” for delegates and were quickly approached by a French TV crew, wanting to hear our thoughts on Trump. Unsurprisingly, we said this was a disaster for the climate and a disaster for global equality. It then began to dawn on us that there was something very different about the atmosphere at COP22. When we visited Paris last year, the sense of excitement in the air was palpable. But today, things feel altogether more sombre. Trump’s assertion that climate change was a hoax “created by the Chinese” was never far from any of our minds.  Swedish and American delegates discussed with us their concerns that Trump would now seek to renege on the US’s ratification of the Paris climate treaty. The Americans hoped “the system” would not let him.  An American artist we spoke to couldn’t even express her shock. She lived in Marrakech, she told us, and her work asked questions about human nature and our existence. Now, she questioned what had happened to her home country.  A Norwegian delegate and negotiator said the world needed to unite to contain right wing populism. And a member of the Libyan negotiation team, who had lived in the UK for five years, said, pessimistically, that this was just a game of democracy. For us, it feels like the endgame of neoliberal democracy. We’ve seen big anti-establishment movements before – after the 1929 Wall Street crash in the US, for instance, during the rise of fascism in 1930s Germany, or in response to various more recent recessions. But, as scientists, we feel that the impact of these historic events on the environment was buffered by the planet’s natural resources, which allowed economic growth to continue. In the UK, for example, the economy was rescued by the exploitation of North Sea oil. Those resources – or at least those resources we could use remotely sustainably – are now all but exhausted.  Americans have elected an anti-sustainability president, a man unwilling to face up to environmental degradation. The US people have voted for a dream based on a time past – when America was “great”, oil prices were low, and the white working class felt secure. Whether the planet has the capacity to support a new round of unsustainable consumption is highly in doubt. However, it was brought starkly home to us that the rest of the world feels that Brexit paved the way for Trump’s victory. As a Moroccan scientist candidly said to us: “Well, you started it.” To get a broader perspective, we moved from the UN delegate area to the “green zone”, where companies showcase their sustainable technologies and civil society organisations explore their role in climate change mitigation. Our conversations here made it apparent that this diverse community has the appetite to effect change, but will need to demand sustainability and reject economic models dependent on growth. We, as a planet, now have to choose between the path of self-destruction by overconsumption or a more equitable and sustainable future."

"Meat and farmed animals are wrongly blamed for the climate crisis without considering their benefits for society, argues a new campaign launched by the livestock industry in Europe. Billboards appeared this week in Brussels metro stations together with a social media campaign #meatthefacts. The adverts are being funded by European Livestock Voice, which is backed by organisations representing EU farmers, foie gras producers and the fur and leather industry.  “We believe this campaign is necessary in order to address misinformation,” said a spokesperson for Livestock Voice. The group said they want people “to think about the whole picture and all the consequences that simplistic speeches calling … for a ‘drastic reduction of livestock’ could have on Europe’s rural areas and on society in general.” The campaign group says the current debate around meat and livestock has been one-sided, and that livestock’s contribution to biodiversity, bioenergy and the rural economy has been overlooked. “An EU without livestock would not only lose locally produced food, but also essential habitats and biodiversity. It would also mean increased fires, lack of natural fertiliser and green energy, and a rural exodus,” it says. Europeans eat more than twice as much meat as experts recommend. A report last year called for a 40–50% reduction in the size of Europe’s meat and livestock sector to reduce its environmental footprint. Research published in Nature journal concluded that beef consumption in western countries needs to fall by 90% in order to avoid dangerous climate change. The livestock sector is believed to be responsible for a minimum of 14.5% of global carbon emissions. But the new campaign group said that the livestock sector accounts for less than 6% of the EU’s total climate emissions. Replacing animal products with plant-based alternatives is not the universal solution to climate change, it  maintains, as alternative foodstuffs have environmental footprints of their own. Replacing fossil fuels with green alternatives was a more effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the group said. Michael Lee, professor in sustainable agriculture at Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire, one of the oldest agricultural research institutions in the world, said current eating habits were not sustainable, but livestock still had an important role to play. “Complete removal of livestock would be a disaster for agriculture sustainability, the long-term environment (due to loss of grassland), rural communities and human health – as not every vegan can be a selective nutritionist. Equally our current consumption levels are a disaster – with growing obesity and environmental damage due to high levels of emissions. “The solution lies in a more plant-dominated diet but with a modest amount of high-quality livestock product – which is valued for the key nutrients it contains, its soil-improving properties and the landscape we all want to support and live in,” he said.A spokesperson for the European Livestock Voice said: “It is well known that a section of the European population over consume animal products, but there is no evidence to suggest that reducing production will lead to any decrease in consumption. The consequences of a drastic reduction on consumption of animal products by replacing them with ‘meat substitutes’ or other activities could well be worse than the benefits of meat consumption, without leading to a significant environmental or health improvement.”"
"The world’s most seemingly-toxic lakes are under threat. And they are also home to one of our most familiar birds: the flamingo. All flamingo species have evolved to live in some of the planet’s most extreme wetlands, like caustic “soda lakes”, hypersaline lagoons or high-altitude salt flats.  One species, the lesser flamingo, has taken this relationship to the limit. Most are found in super-alkaline lakes throughout Africa’s Great Rift Valley, which host immense blooms of microscopic blue-green algae (called cyanobacteria). These poisonous plants produce chemicals that, in most animals, can fatally damage cells, the nervous system, and the liver. The lesser flamingo, however, can consume enormous amounts with no ill effects (unless you count their colourful plumage, which comes from a pigment in the algae). Two of the lesser flamingo’s preferred habitats, Lake Bogoria in Kenya and Lake Natron in Tanzania, are hypersaline and hostile to practically all other forms of life (Natron water can even strip away human skin).  For the flamingos this a bonus. Special tough skin and scales on their legs prevent burns, and they can drink water at near boiling point to collect freshwater from springs and geysers at lake edges. If no freshwater is available, flamingos can use glands in their head that remove salt, draining it out from their nasal cavity.  With few other animals able to cope in such conditions, there is minimal competition for food, and these toxic wetlands are home to massive flocks. Million-strong gatherings provide several benefits. Mass synchronised nesting gives flamingos the best possible chance to raise the maximum number of chicks, while on choppy days a dense mass of birds swimming together also helps create the optimal feeding environment (still water) within the centre of the group. Sheer numbers also make it harder for predators like hyenas or jackals to identify individual victims. As such, a single flamingo is not a happy flamingo. The species is happiest in huge gatherings, and these won’t occur around any old lake – the lesser flamingo specifically needs its toxic, salty paradise.  But these places are rare. Across the six flamingo species there are only 30 or so regularly used breeding sites worldwide and, while the global population of around 3.2m lesser flamingos is impressive, it is largely reliant on a few huge groups (about 75% nest at Lake Natron alone). What if something happens to one of their highly-specialised breeding sites? Unlike many other species that can still breed in smaller populations as their habitats become damaged, these birds cannot easily survive in small groups. Having evolved in such a hostile environment with few rivals, they would have trouble adapting to a more competitive lifestyle elsewhere. With most of their eggs in one toxic basket, the lesser flamingo is unusually vulnerable for a species with millions of individuals. Indeed, the number of lesser flamingos in the wild is already decreasing each year. And humans are to blame. Wetland habitats have been polluted by agricultural chemicals and sewage, feeding and breeding grounds have been disturbed, and declining algal blooms mean some populations are starving to death. Even a diet of toxic algae can’t save flamingos from ecological disturbances. If humans take too much water from a lake, or climate change causes excess evaporation, then salinity levels will become unstable. Populations of cyanobacteria can explode and the birds end up consuming new species which can poison them and cause mass deaths. Attempts to extract sodium carbonate (a useful industrial material known as soda ash) from Lake Natron represents another danger. Mining would disturb the birds, who like privacy when breeding and tend to nest far from shore, on remote islands that have been isolated by flooding. It would also make the water more choppy, affecting their food gathering.  Given how slow flamingos are at adapting and changing to new nesting areas, any Natron development must be avoided. Anthropogenic disturbances have previously caused lesser flamingos to abandon suitable breeding sites, and back in 1993, polluted water in Lake Bogoria and nearby Nakuru killed more than 20,000 lesser flamingos – the first of a series of recurring deaths. The latest mining proposal has been withdrawn but such developments haven’t been completely shelved. Conservation groups remain alert. Monitoring and protecting the population at Lake Natron is the top priority for lesser flamingo conservation, according to a recent assessment by BirdLife International. Large-scale soda ash extraction, the report says, would be “disastrous for the species” and could see the flamingos become officially “vulnerable” or even “endangered”. The importance of these unique, and apparently hostile, wetlands is clear to see. Life in the Rift Valley lakes is a delicate balance. And it is clear that we are already harming these unique and fragile ecosystems. If humans were to cause drastic changes, their spectacular pink inhabitants would vanish forever."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust call it the Great Solar Energy Bubble! It has popped for good, and what’s left behind is a whopping 21 billion euros in destroyed capital, Germany’s flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) writes today.
One of the arguments used to convince people of the virtues of solar energy was that “the sun doesn’t send a bill … energy from the sun is free!” Even Dave Suzuki once claimed that.
The notion that “solar energy is free” has turned out to be an expensive myth. Quite to the contrary, the bills for solar energy are now coming in, and they’re huge.
Hat-tip Benny Peiser.
Not Long ago investors were exuberantly bullish when it came to investments in solar energy in Germany, so were large companies. Today, however, many have since lost their shirts. And the FAZ now writes large corporations who placed their bets on solar power and solar heat are “pulling out disillusioned“. “The strategy ended in a debacle.”
As an example, the FAZ cites Siemens, who announced on Monday that its solar unit would be liquidated and shut down completely by next spring after the company’s solar strategy “ended in a debacle” after having “poured about a billion euros into the business“.

Looks as if the solar industry in Germany is “dead”
The FAZ writes that Siemens now follows a long list of failed solar companies in Germany (once ballyhooed as a model for the rest of the world), joining Bosch, who announced too that it would withdraw from the solar business, thus putting the jobs of 3000 employees at stake in economically depressed East Germany. Supervisory board chairman Franz Fehrenbach now says it looks as if the solar industry in Germany is “dead”.
Solar manufacturers blame the plummeting prices for panels and modules, as well as competition from China. FAZ reports that “a total of 1.56 billion euros had been completely written off by the company by the end of 2012. On top of that come operating losses totaling 750 million euros”.
The FAZ then tallies the total capital destruction by the German solar industry as a whole, pegging that number at 21 billion euros! The FAZ writes:
Investment stars Solarworld and Q-Cells have destroyed capital to the tune of double-digit billions of euros. In December 2007 the East German Solar Valley cell and module manufacturer Q-Cells was considered to be an aspiring candidiate for the first league stock market. Nothing came of that. Instead the company declared itself insolvent in 2012 and was bought up by a Korean company. Private investors practically lost everything.”
So much for the claim that “solar energy is free”. Once again, the central planners demonstrate again how effective and talented they are when it comes to destroying wealth and capital.

"The WWF’s new Living Planet report highlights a 58% decline in the abundance of 3,706 animal species since 1970, reinforcing the fear that humanity is bringing about a sixth mass extinction. The roots of this fear stretch back more than a century, when a series of well-publicised extinctions provided incontrovertible evidence that human actions could wipe out other life forms, even superabundant ones such as the passenger pigeon. These extinctions had a profound influence, and saving species has been a fundamental tenet of conservation ever since.  What is less widely appreciated is that contemporary usage of the term extinction encompasses a wide variety of meanings and applications, each with a distinct role in conservation advocacy. In a 2008 paper we classified several different types of “extinctions” to better understand the rhetorical power of each, and to ask whether they reinforce or undermine conservation communication. Here’s an updated version of our list: True extinction is well summarised by the IUCN definition that there is “no reasonable doubt that the last individual [of the species] has died”. This category includes many iconic species such as the dodo, passenger pigeon, great auk and Steller’s sea cow. Here, extinction only refers to species that we know of: if not, how could the fate of a last individual be ascertained? Ecological extinction is where a species only survives in zoos and private collections. The Scimitar oryx, Spix’s macaw and the pheasant-like Alagoas currasow all fall into this category and are classed by the IUCN as “extinct in the wild”. Local extinction refers to when a species has been wiped out from part of its range. The beaver is a good example. Once common, it had been hunted to extinction in the UK by the 16th century but many people are now working to bring them back. Wallacean extinction is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, a contemporary of Charles Darwin who independently developed a theory of natural selection. It refers to species that are erroneously classed as extinct due to our ignorance of where they actually live – that is, species that are “lost” rather than extinct. The most famous example is the coelacanth, which was classed as an extinct fossil fish until a living specimen was found in 1938 off the east coast of South Africa. These rediscoveries are a continued source of hope for people trying to find animals like the Tasmanian tiger or the ivory-billed woodpecker. Linnaean extinctions, named after Carl Linnaeus who invented the system of scientific species names, involve the large discrepancy between the number of species described and the likely number out there. Here, extinctions are extrapolated from the rate of habitat loss for known and undiscovered species. This type of extinction underpins widely used estimates of tens of thousands of extinctions per year. Lazarus extinction refers to cases where there is still hope of resurrection because DNA of extinct species lives on in domestic breeds and a “replica” species could be recreated though back breeding. De-domestication is a component of European rewilding. Herds of wild cattle resembling the extinct Auroch in looks and ecology are being established in natural areas in the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Romania. Closely related to Lazarus extinctions is the concept of de-extinction, the idea that advances in synthetic biology will eventually allow us to extract DNA from the preserved remains of extinct species and insert them into the eggs of surrogate animals. An elephant with mammoth-like traits may well be born within the next 20 years. “Extinction is forever” was a rallying cry of the conservation movement during the 1960s and 1970s. Images of gorillas, tigers and rhino made extinction feel real and meaningful and reminded people of the sense of collective loss and remorse they would feel if these species died out. Fast forward several decades, and individual species no longer have such an impact. In September 2016, for instance, the death of the last Rabb’s fringed-limbed tree frog passed with little media comment.  Since the 1990s conservation rhetoric has focused on the zoomed-out, planetary-scale Linnaean extinctions. Conservation International’s extinction clock presents the end of a species as a routine and impersonal event happening every 20 minutes. Why should one extinction be newsworthy if more than 26,000 are happening each year? Nevertheless, it was the spectre of mass extinctions that grabbed the attention of policymakers. While they may not have shed any tears for an individual tree frog species, they rightly feared the loss of economically-valuable ecosystem services. Governments responded with a massive and systematic expansion of protected areas internationally. However, the impact of “sixth mass extinctions” and other doom and gloom rhetoric may be on the wane, especially since the 2007 global economic crisis. A different tack might be needed: one that repersonalises extinction and balances stories of loss with stories of hope. This could be achieved by bringing local and Lazarus extinctions to the fore. Both of these can be tied to reintroduction projects that offer an optimistic sense that humanity can make amends for the ills it has inflicted on other life forms. We need to match reports of alarming declines in species with reports analysing places where populations can be restored. The idea that “extinction” is in some cases reversible certainly supports the new practice of ecosystem restoration. If conservation is to regain the initiative it needs to both protect what’s left, and restore what is lost."
"Brexit risks harming the UK’s environment unless the government passes stiff new legislation before it triggers Article 50. That’s the conclusion of a major new report by the Environment Audit Committee, a cross-bench group of 16 MPs.  In the run-up to the referendum, most experts were very worried about the environmental impact of Brexit and, since the vote, some of these concerns have been confirmed – think, for example, of Michael Gove and John Whittingdale inviting companies to draw a wish list for a bonfire of EU social and environmental legislation. On the other hand, some environmental NGOs have launched a campaign to achieve a “Greener UK” after the vote, seizing Brexit as an opportunity to increase, not decrease, environmental ambition. So, which way is Britain going to go? This depends on whether Theresa May’s government uses the Brexit negotiation to actually deliver on its manifesto commitment to “be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than it found it”. As with anything Brexit-related, a “green Brexit” is full of uncertainties, and faces both technical and political difficulties.  However the audit committee’s report can help us draw “green lines” on which to judge how eco-friendly Brexit is really likely to be.  Long before the referendum the government started working on two parallel 25-year plans for the environment and agriculture/food. But progress has been slow, and consultation on this flagship policy has still not started. As with Brexit more generally, clear environmental goals have been promised but not yet delivered. The absence of clarity on what the government is trying to achieve for farming and the environment makes it difficult to ensure these unknown objectives are not inadvertently thwarted during the Brexit negotiations.  A first Brexit green line, then, is that negotiating objectives should be, as much as possible, aligned with the 25-year plans. The MPs’ report suggests the basic framework and consultation on both plans should take place before the government officially starts negotiating to leave the EU. This would ensure any conflicts between the two plans and the Brexit negotiation brief are considered and hopefully mitigated. The prime minister has called for a “Great Repeal Bill” to transfer to UK law all applicable EU law and ensure a smooth transition. But copy-pasting legislation is not so straightforward: the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, told the environmental committee that, of the 800 or more pieces of European environmental legislation, up to a third would not be automatically carried over. What is striking in the committee’s report is how little is known about what these gaps actually are, and which policy areas are particularly at risk.  A second green line for Brexit would be to identify these gaps as soon as possible and make sure they are effectively plugged by the time the UK leaves the EU. To do this, the committee suggests that “any provisions which cannot be transposed into UK law should form the basis of a new Environmental Protection Act”. May’s government is working on a Brexit deal for the “whole UK”, but environmental policy is a devolved area. While there are of course EU-wide rules, they’re implemented slightly differently in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Common rules limit regulatory divergence, although it still exists: for example, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have banned their farmers from growing genetically modified crops but England has not. The Great Repeal Bill therefore risks fuelling constitutional tensions within the UK. Establishing UK-wide rules, such as minimum pollution standards, would see Westminster taking back control from the devolved administrations, and not just from Europe. It would be politically difficult – indeed the Scottish government is clearly opposed to it – but may be, to some extent, environmentally necessary.  A third green line for Brexit would thus be to achieve both minimum standards throughout the UK and to respect devolved administration’s competences to adopt more ambitious and innovative policies. Coordination will not only be needed between devolved and central administration, but within central administration itself. How the UK answers the two central Brexit questions – in or out of the single market? In or out of the customs union? – will have major impacts on the environment. Notably, if the UK opts for a hard Brexit (out of both single market and customs union) and is to negotiate its own trade deals, environmental standards could be at risk. Just think of the Europe-wide mobilisation against the EU-US trade deal TTIP on this very basis. A fourth green line for Brexit is that the UK environment should not lose out from these new deals. The committee asks that “the government should guarantee that it will not trade away environmental protections, animal welfare and food safety standards, as part of the negotiations to leave, or as part of future trade deals”. These four green lines will allow us to gauge the Brexit negotiation from an environmental perspective. A first test will be in how the government responds to the Environment Audit Committee’s report. But the key test will be the UK’s official negotiation position and whether it makes any mention of the environment."
"Since 2015 the Australian government has committed more than $1.5bn of taxpayer funds to climate change projects that plant or protect native habitat. Over a slightly longer period it has also spent nearly $62m on a policy to plant 20 million trees promised under Tony Abbott. At the same time the country has significantly stepped up land-clearing programs in several states, bulldozing hundreds of thousands of hectares of forests, mostly for agriculture. Official data allows an estimate of the scale of the contrast: little more than two years of land clearing will effectively cancel out what the public is spending to avoid 125 million tonnes of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere. The equivalent to what has been planted over several years in the 20 million trees program is wiped out in just six months of land clearing. “It’s pretty absurd,” says Jess Panegyres, the Wilderness Society’s national nature campaigner. “We’re putting huge amounts of taxpayer dollars into avoided deforestation and reforestation and at the same time we’re allowing Australia to become a deforestation hotspot globally. Any of the gains that we’re making under these taxpayer-funded schemes are being wiped out almost immediately.” What is being lost can be cut up in different ways. Using government figures, the Wilderness Society estimates a Melbourne Cricket Ground-sized area of forest and bushland was cleared every two minutes in 2017. Over a longer timeframe, an academic study found last month that more than 7.7m hectares – an area larger than Tasmania – of potential threatened species habitat had been cleared since 1999. It said 93% of this land had not been referred to the federal environment department for assessment and approval before being cleared, as required under national environment laws. Not all land cleared is equal. Much of it is regrown forest in areas that have been felled before. But a significant minority is intact mature forest, which is a deeper store of carbon dioxide. Scientists say both need to be protected if Australia is to stem an unfolding extinction crisis. Australia has a long history of forest clearing. The proportion of the country covered by forest has fallen from about 30% to less than 16% since European invasion. But, after a relative decline, a big upswing in land clearing began in 2013, when Campbell Newman’s Liberal National government relaxed laws preventing mass deforestation in Queensland. Data from the state’s world-leading vegetation monitoring system, known as Slats (statewide landcover and trees study), shows that in the five years that followed about 1.7m hectares – an area larger than greater Brisbane – of native vegetation was bulldozed, far more than in the rest of the country combined. In the most recent two years in which data is available, ending in June last year, about 40% of that was in Great Barrier Reef catchments, increasing the amount of sediment running into the ocean along the coast. The Labor state government passed legislation last year that the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said would end broad-scale land clearing – despite environmental lawyers warning that the new laws were full of loopholes. The latest Slats data that will show the result of that are yet to be released, but Panegyres says while the laws should work to reduce the bulldozing of mature forest, anecdotal evidence suggests the loss of growing forest and native vegetation has continued in some areas. “There’s a lot of land clearing still being reported to us,” she says. While Queensland closely tracks land clearing, the picture in other parts of the country is less clear. Neither Western Australia nor the Northern Territory keep jurisdiction-wide data. In the west, where land-clearing laws were relaxed under the former Liberal premier Colin Barnett in the name of removing red tape, a partial picture can be calculated by tallying the permits granted by some departments – but this leaves significant gaps. Land clearing in New South Wales is unarguably on the rise. While it has not reached the heights of Queensland, figures from the state’s Office of Environment and Heritage show clearing for crops pasture and thinning tripled between 2014-15 and 2017-18, the year the state government introduced more lenient native vegetation protection laws. More than 27,000 hectares, nearly 100 times the size of Sydney’s central business district, were cleared for agriculture in the latest year for which data is available. Most of the clearing has been between Moree and the Queensland border. If native forestry is included, the figure rises to 58,000 hectares. The data shows land clearing had already escalated before the laws came into effect, farmers having apparently anticipated the change. Though some Liberal ministers are deeply concerned about the scale and pace of the escalation and its impact on biodiversity, the National party has repeatedly called for protections to be wound back. The contrast makes little sense to some people planting trees on behalf of taxpayers. Around the Moree water park, a human-made water-skiing area 6km north-west of the New South Wales town, a small forest of native trees is taking root, despite two years of drought, thanks to a $29,500 grant from the 20 million trees program. Eventually 7,000 trees will be planted. John Mailler, 80, a retired share farmer and volunteer working on the project, germinates his own plants from local seed at his property 40km away and drives in regularly to tend the trees, which are being planted by a local employment group. He lists the local species: carbeen, casuarina, box trees, emu apple or grewi, brigalow and roly poly. Mailler’s trees are bred so they don’t need drip irrigation and can survive with an occasional watering. He loves the work but says the loss of local vegetation around Moree is heartbreaking. “It’s definitely changed. That was open grass country,” he says, gesturing towards the horizon to the east. “But it’s now crops, barley, wheat, chickpeas, lupins, cotton. “They buy this wide machinery, and they say it’s too much of a problem to go round the trees so they get rid of them. It’s tragic.” The north-west of NSW is ground zero for tree loss. In the Moree council area alone, 1,189 hectares – roughly the size of the greater Melbourne area – of woody vegetation was lost to cropping, pasture and thinning in 2017-18. Even more went in neighbouring council areas. The situation is set to get worse in the next year. The NSW government has said it will not pursue cases against farmers who broke the old laws and it is planning to introduce regional plans, beginning with the north-west, that could further increase broad-scale clearing. On a national scale, some experts have doubts about whether national greenhouse accounts accurately reflect the full impact of forest clearing and have called for the federal government to introduce a nationwide monitoring system on a par with that used in Queensland. Even without that, Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist with Berlin-based Climate Analytics, says a key message from the national emissions data published by the government is that it expects clearing to continue at current rates for at least the next decade. Specifically, pollution from land clearing is projected to stay at about 46m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year to 2030, roughly equivalent to emissions from three large coal-fired power plants. “That’s the bottom line,” Hare says. “This is significantly damaging the climate, as well as the natural environment, and Australia is not planning to do anything to stop it.”"

Here it is:
By the way, talking about deceit. THIS WAS A GLOBAL WARMING ISSUE. that is the game you chose. To then conveniently turn into Climate Change, which is redundant since over the history of the earth, no place on earth has had a constant climate, because of the nature of the planet and its relation to the sun ( ever notice most of the land is in the northern hemisphere, ocean in the south, a continent at the south pole of the earth, a  frozen ocean at the north, the seasons,  and the changes in feedback at different times of the year, check out MJO phase charts if you wish to see a classic example of that)  is merely deceit. No one denies that there is variance or climate,   THE ISSUE IS CATASTROPHIC WARMING AND WHEN IT STOPPED  you simply decided that if you point out occurrences that people were not able to see as fast before,  then you can point out all the wild things that actually have been happening on the planet since time began. But now you get to see them point them out and say see. Classic example hurricanes. Both Irene and Sandy were not major hurricane yet in 1954 and 1955 5 major hurricanes hit the east coast from NC north in  a two year period. In 1938  a hurricane drove 15 feet of water in Providence rhode island. The weather you see now is just like the weather in the 1950s, the last time the atlantic was warm while the Pacific was cooling and we are seeing the same  things in the 3 true canaries in the coal mine, western Europe, Alaska and the far east where winters first turn colder. Because of the reduction of available moisture from a cooling tropical Pacific, the US first turns dry and dryness breeds heat. Anyone that looks at decadol charts  from the 1950s can see that, along with the increased hurricane threat on the east coast, which so  far can not hold a candle to the 1950s.   But I am sure none of this matters to you. But changing the game from what you started, GLOBAL WARMING, to something none of deny, climate and the variances, is simply cheating. You started it , you are getting whipped, and its only going to get worse once the atlantic flips into its cold mode  and the decreased TSI due to the sun takes over. I made a forecast 4 years ago that by 2030 temperature would return to where they were in the late 1970s, at the start of the satellite era,  and at the end of the last cold cycle of the Pacific, before it warmed ( now back to colder).
By the way, just how are your computer forecasts that have caused draconian measures to be advocated that inhibit the progress of men doing.. well lets see
http://c3headlines.typepad.com…
Point is you are the ones deceiving people. You are the ones changing the playing field  You are the ones that said global warming, saw you were getting whipped and are trying to change this to something that is inherent to the system naturally, in an effort to deceive  people.    Stick with what you said,  GLOBAL WARMING IS THE ISSUE,  and face the facts. And quit lying about people that  know darn well that the earth is in a constant state of change, and with change, comes conflict, which over a period of years produces the climate  NATURALLY.”
I don’t know about dumb statements, Joe, but C3 Headines show 44 definitely dumb model forecasts.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCountries considering implementing green energy feed-in schemes may want to look at what is going on in Germany.

Michael Limburg warns that Germany’s EEG renewable energy act is driving the country to ruins. Photo source: Michael Limburg
Few countries have moved as aggressively as Germany in promoting renewable energy. Some tout the German system as a model for the rest of the world.
But in an interview with DIE FREIE WELT, Michael Limburg, Vice President of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), called Germany’s EEG renewable energy feed-in act “ideological and expensive” and warns it threatens to economically ruin the country.
My time is a little short today, and so I’ll present only the main points of the interview.
Limburg on why people are becoming increasingly agitated by Germany’s EEG feed-in act
It’s obviously the new, real experience that the falsely named ‘renewable energies’ are nothing what the politicians promised they would be. Not only are they not free, but they really do burn a hole in your pocket. […] Especially low income households feel the pain. […] The reality is that it’s the state that initiated this expensive mess, and it is now asking the consumer to cough it up. Up to the end of last year, it had already cost € 98 billion euros ($130 billion). That’s 10 times the amount the Federal Department of Transportation is allowed to spend this year for investment and repairs for our roads and highways.”
Limburg’s criticism on photovoltaics and wind turbines
Of all the alternative energies available, these two are the most expensive, the most volatile, and thus the most useless. In Germany we get as much sun as Alaska does. That’s why PV systems here operate at only 8% of their rated capacity in the middle of the year.
Wind is the same when it comes to volatility and quality. It is useless. But with a subsidy of 9 – 15 cents per kwh, it’s a bit cheaper. Like biofuels, the problem is the vast amounts of area that are needed. Their low energy density means you need huge areas in order to collect and concentrate the energy. Conventional energies are infinitely superior.

For example, to replace one conventional 1400 MW power plant with wind, you’d have to erect onshore approx. 3000 2.3 MW class wind turbines. Offshore, you get double the yield, but the investment costs are much higher and the wear and tear is far greater. Producing 1400 MW offshore with wind would cost € 13 billion, and then you would need a conventional back-up power plant for windless times costing another € 2.6 billion. That comes out to a total of € 15.6 billion for power that could be generated simply by running the conventional plant full time. And never mind the power transmission lines for now.
The result: a cost that is 6 times higher for a lower quality product. Only the state is capable of making such a ridiculous economic decision.”
Limburg on the role fossil fuels in Germany
After the senseless shutdown of nuclear power in Germany, their importance has once again increased. Because of the shale gas revolution on the global market, fossil fuels will now get even cheaper. Moreover, Germany has huge reserves of lignite and their conversion to power is on the rise. Because of the feed-in of green energies, only lignite remains economical. We should be grateful to have such large reserves at hand.
Limburg on the current risks to the power grid and generation 
The danger is not only that the whole green energy infrastructure is expensive and massively burdens citizens, but that the high costs are driving out the industry, and the entire supply chains that feed them. This will lead the country to economic ruins, and the people along with it.”
Limburg on what needs to change
The energy feed-in act must be abolished immediately and the subsidies eliminated. Moreover, green energy producers must be paid only for the power they actually deliver. This would force them to install storage systems at their own expense.”
Limburg on how expensive it is going to get
By the year 2015 the costs arising from the renewable feed-in act will amount to € 570 billion.”
Wow – all this to delay the theoretical global warming on the planet by a whole 23 hours over the next 100 years. Only the state is capable of such a bargain.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith atmospheric CO2 concentrations reaching the 400 ppm level, the media and a number of alarmist scientists have set off the mega-alarm bells, claiming “record high levels” of CO2 had been reached, and that the planet is on the verge of an overdose. This is based purely on ignorance of the Earth’s history.
Worrying that 400 ppm is too high is like worrying about your fuel tank overflowing when it reaches the 1/8 mark during filling.
Figure above-right: At 400 ppm CO2 levels are actually dangerously low in historical terms.
From a historical perspective, an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 400 ppm is actually almost scraping the bottom of the barrel. Over the Earth’s history, atmospheric CO2 concentrations have ranged from 180 ppm to 7000 ppm, see Figure 1 below. On that scale we are in fact today barely above the Earth’s record lows.
Figure 1: Atmospheric CO2 concentration is just barely above the life-sustaining levels of 150 ppm. For life to have real buffer against mass extinction, CO2 needs to be closer to 1000 ppm. Source here. 
That 400 ppm is actually dangerously low is a fact the alarmists keep avoiding and suppressing. Below 150 ppm, plant-life dies off on a massive scale. The Earth actually came very close to that point many times over the last 2 million years during the ice ages. At the bottom of the last ice age just 20,000 years ago, life on the planet literally teetered on the brink when CO2 fell to a level of just 180 ppm. Do we really want to live on the brink of extinction.
It’s a fact that biologists have shown that once the atmospheric CO2 level falls below the 500 ppm level, plants really begin to suffer. Many of us have seen the video showing how plants grow faster under higher CO2 concentrations. The following charts show the growth curves of some plants as a function of CO2 concentration:

Figure 2: Plant growth vs CO2 concentration. Plants really begin to suffer once CO2 concentrations fall below 500 ppm. Source: click here.
Note that at high CO2 concentrations, such as 800 ppm, plants thrive. But as CO2 levels fall off, growth rates really start to plummet once they fall below 500 ppm. History shows that the Earth sustains much more life, i.e. is much greener and fruitful, when CO2 levels are higher, i.e. in the vicinity of 1000 ppm.
No one disputes that man’s activities have helped to increase atmospheric CO2 concentration, and it should not be in dispute that plants and life on the planet are thankful that man has done so. At 400 ppm, the planet is a safer place to be and will be even safer at 1000 ppm.

"If one in five people in richer countries adopted low-meat diets, and threw away a third less food than they currently do, while poor countries were assisted to preserve their forests and restore degraded land, the world’s agricultural systems could be absorbing carbon dioxide by 2050 instead of adding massively to global heating as they do at present. Tree-planting and improving the fertility of soil through better farming practices would also be needed, according to a study of global forests, farming and food systems published in the journal Nature Climate Change.  Managing agricultural and other land in a more environmentally sound manner could take the world nearly a third of the way towards meeting the Paris agreement goals. “These [measures] are feasible now and deliver many other benefits,” said Stephanie Roe, environmental scientist at the University of Virginia and lead author of the paper. “Recent reports on the state of our forests and food systems show a worrying lack of progress in the land sector, and our window of opportunity to deliver on the Paris agreement is getting smaller. However, I remain optimistic because we have all the tools we need, as well as increasing public pressure and political will to turn things around.” The changes would also allow for healthier diets globally, improve livelihoods in poor areas, preserve wildlife and flora, and make for higher water and air quality. Many of the measures suggested, such as cutting food waste and shifting from excessive meat consumption, would also save money. For example, improving soil management through organic farming practices would cost about $57bn (£43.9bn) but save nearly $2tn over the period, according to one estimate used in the study. Land accounts for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, or 11 gigatons of carbon dioxide a year. With the right measures, according to the study, it would act instead as a carbon sink absorbing 3 gigatons from the atmosphere a year by 2050. That could give some scope for other sectors such as aviation to continue to use limited amounts of fossil fuels while staying within the global carbon budget needed to avoid a temperature rise of more than 1.5C (a rise of 2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. The authors set out a roadmap for the six large-scale measures they propose, including: reducing deforestation, peatland burning and mangrove destruction by 70%; restoring forests, peatlands and coastal mangroves to generate enough carbon dioxide saving to cancel out China’s annual emissions; planting trees to save as much carbon dioxide as that emitted by the EU. Improving farming practices, including moving to more organic practices, would mean better soil management that could cut carbon dioxide equal to India’s annual emissions. Consumer food waste in rich countries and big developing countries could be cut by a third, while the losses from food production in poor regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia could be cut drastically through simple measures such as more refrigeration and better transport. Moving a fifth of people to plant-based diets in developed and emerging countries, particularly the US, the EU, China, Brazil, Argentina and Russia, is seen as possible by 2030. These near-vegan diets would involve consuming less than 2,500 calories a day and no more than 60g of animal protein. The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts Prof Thomas Crowther, founder of the Crowther Lab, who was not involved with the study, said: “This is an excellent review of the many carbon drawdown solutions that the land can provide. There are immense benefits of restoring natural ecosystems like forests, wetlands and peatlands. Managed ecosystems can also be critical through effective agroforestry, biochar techniques and regenerative agriculture that can increase soil carbon sequestration. The review also reveals the considerable uncertainty and challenges that we face in realising this carbon drawdown potential, highlighting the need for more quantitative research into the scale and dynamics of carbon storage on land.” Developing nations are hoping that the forthcoming UN meeting on the climate emergency, COP25 in Santiago, will encourage rich countries to focus on helping them cut emissions through better land use and management of the oceans. A spokesperson for the UK’s Department for International Development said: “Cutting carbon emissions by helping developing countries change how they use and farm land is a priority for UK aid. We are fighting illegal deforestation and supporting poor farmers to make their practices greener. By making farming practices more efficient, we reduce the amount of land needed to produce food.” Nancy Harris of the World Resources Institute, a co-author of the study, said: “The longer we delay action to protect forests, the more difficult it will be to achieve the Paris agreement targets and the more we will need to rely on unproven negative emission technologies.”"

This is the book that sent shock waves across the German climate science establishment, causing many media outlets to fret that the end of the world may not be coming after all.
Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s book claims that the climate models have been hopelessly distorted by IPCC scientists, and that these models irresponsibly exaggerate the impact of CO2 on our climate.  The authors support their assertions with a crushing load of scientific evidence stemming from hundreds of peer-reviewed papers; they cite over 900 sources – most peer-reviewed. Their conclusion: The sun plays a far greater role in driving climate than what the IPCC would have us believe.
Vahrenholt, a professor of chemistry, was once a big believer in the IPCC’s science. The high profile professor and Environment Minster of the City Of Hamburg was made CEO of German power giant RWE Innogy, the renewable energy arm of the company. His job: To put the power giant on the path to renewable energies. Vahrenholt led the installation of massive offshore windparks. No one has been responsible for installing more wind power in Europe than Vahrenholt.
But after just a few short years, RWE was surprised by the much lower than expected results – as if the wind in northern Europe had gone into the doldrums.  RWE demanded an explanation from Vahrenholt, who had relied on wind forecasts from experts. In search for an answer Vahrenholt found a paper by Lockwood that showed Europe’s climate was strongly correlated with solar activity and that it was in part responsible for the wind doldrums.

In December 2009, Vahrenholt was asked by the IPCC to review the draft report on renewable energy. He was horrified by what he had found: 293 errors and deficiencies in the 1000+ page report. Worse, in February 2010 at a Washington D.C. meeting of IPCC experts, no one refuted these errors. He asked himself: “Could it be that the same sloppy approach was used for the core area of climate protection?”
RWE colleague Dr. Sebastian Lüning, a geologist, gave Vahrenholt a copy of Andrew Montford’s The Hockey Stick Illusion. Vahrenholt tore through the book in a matter of days and dug deeper into the science. He was shocked by the deception and distortions he found in the IPCC literature. This is what eventually led Lüning and Vahrenholt to write Die kalte Sonne.
Many readers here have asked if and when the book would be printed in English. Now I’m pleased to say that the the printing presses are gearing up to print in English.
The English version is considerably updated and includes newer literature and developments, which not surprisingly confirm Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s suspicions of reduced CO2 climate sensitivity.
Actually The Neglected Sun has turned me into a mild luke-warmer. The evidence presented in the book does not dispute the greenhouse properties of CO2, and shows that they are real and are a factor, but that they are quite exaggerated. Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s conclusions are actually not far from those of many serious climate scientists.
It’s emerging that Vahrenholt and Lüning are turning out to be correct with their assertions on CO2 climate sensitivity. You’ll can read all about it. The English version has been changed around a bit, and I assure you that you will not be able to put it down after the first short introductory chapter.

Does Anders really want to play this game?
Let’s just take one moment to recall some of the really dumb things warmists have claimed. Shall we make a list of the 100 dumbest things said by warmists?
Heck, one could easily find 1000 dumbest things ever said by them…and you’d still only be scratching the surface. Let’s recall some of the absurd things Hansen, Gore, Viner, Latif, Rahmstorf etc. have claimed, e.g. snowless winters, death trains, Earth’s center is 1 million degrees, warming causing cold weather, 1.8 meter sea level rise and so on.
The multitude of really dumb things said by warmists is indeed the main reason why they are getting crushed in the climate debate and need the German government’s environment ministry UBA to help them out.
If any reader wants the job of making a list and publishing it here, be my guest. Better yet, ask Anthony Watts to publish it so that 100,000 climate readers will be reminded of the mega-follies of the global warming movement.

"In the geographical heart of Africa lies a huge wetland. After years of exploring these remote swamps, our research shows that the region contains the most extensive tropical peatland on Earth.  Astonishingly, 145,500 km² of peatland – an area larger than England – went undetected on our crowded planet until now. We found 30 billion metric tonnes of carbon stored in this new ecosystem that nobody knew existed. That’s equivalent to 20 years of current US fossil fuel emissions. You can read the important science in Nature. Here we describe how we did it, and our struggles against sabotage, arrest, and losing our own minds. Peat is usually associated with cold places, not the middle of the hot, humid, Congo Basin. It’s an organic wetland soil made of partially-decomposed plant debris. In waterlogged places those plants can’t entirely decompose, and are not respired as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The peat thus builds up slowly, locking up ever-more carbon. The amounts involved are huge: peat covers just 3% of Earth’s land surface, but stores one-third of soil carbon. We knew that peat can be formed under some tropical swamp forests. Might the world’s second largest tropical wetland, known as the Cuvette Centrale, overlie peat? After the eureka moment of asking the right question, we searched to see if somebody else already knew the answer. About once a decade from the 1950s some obscure report would mention in passing that there was peat in the Congo Basin. Not one gave a grid-reference, village or river to locate it. It was important to confirm whether it was present, though, as peatlands in Southeast Asia have been targeted for palm oil  and other industrial agricultural projects, leading to huge carbon emissions and catastrophic wildlife losses. Palm oil is now on the march in Africa. For our Congo search, we had nothing to go on. Given the Congo Basin is slightly larger than India, it is not practical to just turn up and begin your search on foot. To pinpoint where to go, we combined data from different satellites to identify year-round waterlogged areas with the right sort of plants. In 2012, with researchers from Congo and UK universities plus NGO Wildlife Conservation Society, we began to look for peat in northern Republic of Congo. No one was really prepared for the reality of life in the swamps. The forest is quite open, which increases the equatorial heat, but humidity is still 100% which makes it extremely sweaty. Your feet are wet and your new world is filled with insects.  Walking through the swamps is only possible in the dry season. Wading is the mode of transport at all other times. But then when it is dry, there isn’t any free-flowing water. We often had to filter drinking water from the pits that crocodiles excavate and live in. Dry land and water kept us leashed near the edges of the swamp. But, happily we found some peat. There were various hiccups. The team allegedly did not have the right papers, and was put under “town arrest”, confined to the provincial capital Impfondo. A week in and still no movement, but a friendly BBC journalist asked if the government had any comment on the arrested UK student. The next day everyone was free.  On another occasion, a curious panther unearthed and broke our instrument measuring the water table. But, as the work progressed, we learned more and more about the swamp from the local villagers who made the expeditions possible. We would see elephant feet and gorilla hands imprinted in the peat. We were increasingly in awe that a remote, almost unknown, wilderness such as this could still be found on Earth today. We were then able to undertake our biggest expedition yet: a 30km walk to the centre of what we suspected was one of the largest single areas of peatland in the region.  In February 2014, our team of three scientists and five assistants from local village Itanga, with the blessing of their chief and elders, began its trek to the middle of the swamp. With all our food and equipment on our backs, the days were spent advancing our way through (or sinking into) the forested swamp, sampling the peat and overlying vegetation every 250 metres, then doubling back to pick up more food and equipment.  In the evenings, we made wooden platforms, on which we could pitch freestanding mountaineering tents. We washed in one of the many muddy pools of water on offer. The team would then sit round the fire – on a platform, to be out of the water – and enjoy a meal of cassava and smoked-dry fish. After 17 days, covering just 1.5km a day, we finally reached the centre of the swamp between two of the major rivers. Our reward was not only the knowledge that these peatlands are indeed vast. We also found ever-deeper peat, reaching up to 5.9m, roughly the height of a two-storey building.  Yet being in such a remote location was mentally disconcerting. We knew that tree roots would always stop us sinking into the peat up to our necks. And we knew that the rain in a single torrential storm was not enough to flood the swamp and erase our path out. But our senses informed our brains that this was a dangerous place. Days later, wading the last river, we appeared blinking into the bright sunlight of the savanna, all eight of us sank to our knees, elated to have survived. Our field measurements revealed that just two specific forest types have peat underneath: a year-round waterlogged swamp of hardwood trees and a year-round waterlogged swamp dominated by one species of palm. We then used satellite data to map these two specific peat swamp forests to determine the boundaries of the Congo Basin peatlands. Combining this area with peat depth and peat carbon content from our laboratory analyses allowed us to calculate that just 4% of the Congo Basin is peatland, but it stores as much carbon below ground as that stored above ground in all the trees of the other 96%. And now what? In policy terms, while the area is not under immediate threat, it needs protecting: as well as being critical habitat for gorillas and forest elephants, the Congo peatlands are only a carbon-rich resource in the fight against climate change when left intact.   The good news is that the Republic of Congo government is considering extending the area of protected swamp by expanding the Lac Tele Community Reserve by up to 50,000 square kilometres. And for us scientists? Now we know that this vast new ecosystem exists, we’d like to know how it works."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis week’s print edition of FOCUS includes an interview with the producer of a new environmental film to be shown in German cinemas beginning in January: Climate Crimes – Environmental crimes in the name of climate protection. It will premiere soon in Vienna.
Here’s the trailer (in German): The pictures tell the story…

If you are one of the skeptics, much of the film probably will be familiar to you. But if you’re a devout environmentalist who has been reading and believing all the climate propaganda put out by “environmental” and “climate protection” groups and institutes, then you may want to have an ambulance ready outside the cinema. It might be really tough to take.
Be sure to bring your environmentalist friends to see this film. Their reaction will be most interesting as it will reveal if they are truly open to the truth. Face it, there’s a huge industrial lobby behind the “green” movement too.
The film was produced by Ulrich Eichelmann. It is “The story of unique ecosystems, rare species, and people who are living with nature. They are all threatened – not by climate change, but by climate protection.”
Eichelmann believes that what is being sold as “climate protection” is not stopping global warming, but is actually accelerating the destruction of the environment and harming humans.”
We are able to show that many supposedly ‘green energies’ such as hydro, biodiesel and biogas are neither ecologically sensible nor sustainable, but are in fact crimes against nature and defrauding customers.”
Eichelmann cites Germany’s biogas and biodiesel sectors as examples. He claims that ‘on all continents large natural areas are now threatened’, all in the name of climate proection. “In Indonesia 2 million hectares of forests are wiped out annually and replaced with palm oil plantations so that we can fill up with bio-diesel.”
Eichelmann reminds us that hundreds of thousands of people are losing their homes because of “climate protection projects” like huge dams. Thousands of species are also threatened by monoculture-agriculture. Eichelmann says:

Many German companies and banks, often with the support of politicians, are involved in environmental crimes in other parts of the globe.”
While Eichelmann presents many examples of climate protection destroying the planet”, the alternatives he offers are hardly convincing:
We have to alter our lifestyles and drastically cut back our consumption. It is not that we are not producing too little energy – we are consuming too much.”
But getting people to consume less means increasing the price of energy. That in turn becomes a major threat to the world’s poor. And nothing is a bigger threat to the environment than human poverty.
Although I haven’t seen the film, I suspect there is little in it about the threats from wind parks, which involve widespread deforestation and altering of the landscape. never mind the threat they pose to birds.
If I had to infer Eichelmann’s underlying message, I’d say he’s advocating a very fundamentalist position like: No fossil fuels – and also forget most of the renewables like hydro, biogas and bio-diesel. Scale back industry as well. Learn to go without!
That of course would end up making lots of people very poor, limit their access to energy, and so they would have no way to keep warm – except, that is, to burn trees.
In summary, Eichelmann concludes the green movement has been a total environmental disaster so far.
If you consider all the environmental horrors caused by “green” energy, fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas are beginning to look real attractive again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new study titled Snow variability in the Swiss Alps 1864–2009 appearing in the Journal of Clmatology by Scherrer at al doi: 10.1002/joc.3653 shows a temperature trend reversal has been taking place in the Swiss Alps since 2000.

The paper looks at nine Swiss Alpine snow series that cover different altitudes (450–1860 m asl) and go back more than 100 years. In addition the authors analyzed data from 71 stations covering the last 50–80 years to get a more complete picture of Swiss Alpine snow variability.
They analysed data for trend and variability for:
– New snow sums (NSS)
– Maximum new snow (MAXNS)
– Days with snowfall (DWSF)
According to their abstract (my emphasis):
Our results reveal large decadal variability with phases of low and high values for NSS, DWSF and DWSP. For most stations NSS, DWSF and DWSP show the lowest values recorded and unprecedented negative trends in the late 1980s and 1990s. […]  The fraction of NSS and DWSP in different seasons (autumn, winter and spring) has changed only slightly over the ∼150 year record. Some decreases most likely attributable to temperature changes in the last 50 years are found for spring, especially for NSS at low stations. Both the NSS and DWSP snow indicators show a trend reversal in most recent years (since 2000), especially at low and medium altitudes. This is consistent with the recent ‘plateauing’ (i.e. slight relative decrease) of mean winter temperature in Switzerland and illustrates how important decadal variability is in understanding the trends in key snow indicators.”
The study shows snow and temperature are naturally variable and that temperatures in Switzerland, as is the case globally, are no longer rising, and are now trending downwards.

"On Christmas Day in 1879 the combination of fog and smoke was so dense over London that it was virtually dark at noon. Nowadays, with many people staying at home and fewer vehicles on the road, the ambient air quality on Christmas Day is typically very good. However air in the home may be at its worst.  On Christmas, indoor sources of air pollution can generate particles that, in terms of number and mass concentrations, significantly exceed background levels. Here are a few reasons why. Cooking the traditional Christmas dinner can result in elevated levels of a number of pollutants. Ultrafine particles (UFP) smaller than 100 nanometres are of special interest from a health perspective, since they can penetrate deep into the respiratory system and cause inflammatory effects. A number of studies have reported increased UFP concentrations associated with electric stoves and cooking utensils, perhaps from heating detergent residues. The number of particles emitted during cooking depends upon factors such as the raw food composition, cooking temperature and style – stirring food has been shown to produce larger aerosols as the ingredients are splashed about and tiny specs fly into the atmosphere. Gas cooking is a major source of both nitrogen dioxide (a harmful gas) and particulate matter (tiny, often hazardous particles suspended in the air). Kitchens with gas cooking can have higher levels of nitrogen dioxide than even a busy roadside. In fact it has been shown that gas cooking is associated with increased risk of both current and lifetime asthma. The health risks associated with cooking are poorly understood, although UK regulations require extractor fans in kitchens. Given that it takes more than four hours to prepare and cook the average Christmas dinner, people with asthma or cardiovascular disease may want to avoid the kitchen. When cooking, especially with gas, it is important to keep the extractor fan on or open a window.  Wood burning is becoming more popular – often for aesthetic reasons – and this releases significant amounts of particulate pollution into the outdoor environment. Wood smoke is a significant reason why many cities are exceeding European air quality limits during winter. In Denmark, emissions from wood-burning stoves are calculated to cause 400 premature deaths every year, while in London it accounts for between 7% and 9% of wintertime particle pollution. Studies have also shown wood smoke can enter neighbouring homes. Even if wood is burnt in modern stoves rather than open fires, start-up, stoking and reloading can still cause high emissions. Smoke from firewood contains hundreds of compounds which can cause cancer, mutations or defective pregnancies.  To reduce emissions allow wood to season before burning it. Keep it dry as it burns most efficiently when its moisture content is below 20%. The use of candles to create a warm, festive atmosphere is common in homes over Christmas. While they look attractive, once lit, they emit ultrafine particles which may contain metals released from the colour pigments. Soot can also be produced, typically when the candle flame flickers due varying air flows.  Scented candles are even worse as they release various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), identified by the EU as priority indoor pollutants. However certain house plants can help clean up these compounds. Party poppers are an often overlooked source of indoor air pollution. In Britain, they are classified as fireworks. While the impact of fireworks outdoors is well documented detailed knowledge of how it affects the indoor environment is lacking. Although party poppers are short lived, they can generate large concentrations of ultrafine particles.  The figure below shows the result of 10 party poppers in a typical dining room. Particle concentrations are more than 100 times higher than those at the roadside and these levels can persist for some time.  It also needs to be remembered that many household activities such as sweeping, hoovering, or even simply moving about, can generate larger particles – although hopefully no one is cleaning the house on Christmas Day. But if you are particularly worried about indoor air pollution a low-cost sensor would make an excellent scientific stocking-filler."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI like checking the temperatures in Siberia using the map at Joe Bastardi’s Weatherbell. Today I found a real extreme reading.

Eastern Siberia, -61°F, see center. Source: www.weatherbell.com/.
Now we know it’s been pretty damn cold in Eastern Europe and all over Russia, but this is getting ridiculous. This has been going on for weeks now!
I remember 2010 when there was the big heat wave in Central Russia in the summertime when temperatures soared over 100°F. “An unmistakable sign of global warming!” the media shrieked for days and days.
But now that it is deadly cold. with dozens freezing to death every day, there’s not a peep about that in the warmist media. No, we don’t want to report that. 
Don’t ask me where that reading was recorded. That area is just as foreign to me as Mars.
Hansen will probably just chuck out that reading anyway.

"In 2015 the Welsh singer and activist Charlotte Church was widely ridiculed in the right-wing press and on social media for saying on BBC Question Time that climate change had played an important part in causing the conflict in Syria. From 2006 until 2011, [Syria] experienced one of the worst droughts in its history, which of course meant that there were water shortages and crops weren’t growing, so there was mass migration from rural areas of Syria into the urban centres, which put on more strain, and made resources scarce etc, which apparently contributed to the conflict there today. Goaded on by the tabloids, Church reaped a whirlwind of public ridicule: But what she said was correct – and there will be an increasing convergence of climate, food, economic and political crises in the coming years and decades. We need to better understand the interconnectivity of environmental, economic, geopolitical, societal and technological systems if we are to manage these crises and avoid their worst impacts.    In particular, tipping points exist in both physical and socio-economic systems, including governmental or financial systems. These systems interact in complex ways. Small shocks may have little impact but, a particular shock or set of shocks could tip the system into a new state. This new state could represent a collapse in agriculture or even the fall of a government. In 2011, Syria became the latest country to experience disruption in a wave of political unrest crossing North Africa and the Middle East. Religious differences, a failure of the ruling regime to tackle unemployment and social injustice and the state of human rights all contributed to a backdrop of social unrest. However, these pressures had existed for years, if not decades.  So was there a trigger for the conflict in the region which worked in tandem with the ongoing social unrest?  Syria, and the surrounding region, has experienced significant depletion in water availability since 2003. In particular an intense drought between 2007 and 2010, alongside poor water management, saw agricultural production collapse and a mass migration from rural areas to city centres. Farmers, who had been relatively wealthy in their rural surroundings now found themselves as the urban poor reliant on food imports. Between 2007 and 2009 Syria increased its annual imports of wheat and meslin (rice flour) by about 1.5m tonnes. That equated to a more than ten-fold increase in importing one of the most basic foods.  There is a tendency these days to believe that global trade will protect the world from food production shocks. A small production shock in one region can be mitigated by increasing, temporarily, imports of food or by sourcing food from another region. However, certain shocks, or a set of shocks, could create an amplifying feedback that cascades into a globally significant event.  The food system today is increasingly complex and an impact in land, water, labour or infrastructure could create fragility. A large enough perturbation can lead to a price response in the global market that sends a signal to other producers to increase their output to make up for any shortfall. While increased prices can be beneficial to farmers and food producers, if the price increase is large enough it can have a significant impact on communities that are net food importers.   Additionally, food production is concentrated both in a relatively small handful of commodity crops such as wheat, rice and maize as well as from a relatively small number of regions, for example the US, China and Russia. This concentration means any disruption in those regions will have a large impact on global food supply. Reliance on global markets for sourcing food can therefore be a source of systemic risk. In 2008 the global price of food increased dramatically. This increase was the result of a complex set of issues including historically low global food stocks, drought in Australia following production lows in several other areas over the previous few years, and speculation and an increase in biofuel production in North America.  This spike in global food price in 2008 was a factor in the initial unrest across North Africa and the Middle East, which became known as the Arab Spring. As prices peaked, violence broke out in countries such as Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. In Syria a local drought which coincided with this global shock in food prices resulted in dramatic changes in the availability and cost of food. In response small groups of individuals protested. The government response, combined with a background of rising protests, existing social tensions and instability in the wider region, quickly escalated into the situation we are experiencing today. The events in Syria, then, appear to stem from a far more complex set of pressures, beyond religious tension and government brutality, with its roots in the availability of a natural resource – water – and its impact on food production. This is worrying as decreasing water availability is far from a localised issue – it is a systemic risk across the Middle East and North Africa. Over the coming decades this water security challenge is likely to be further exacerbated by climate change. To better manage these types of risks in the future, and to build societal resilience, the world needs to understand our society’s interdependence on natural resources and how this can lead to events such as those that unfolded in Syria. We need analytical, statistical, scenario or war game-type models to explore different possible futures and policy strategies for mitigating the risk. By understanding sources of political instability we hope to get a better handle on how these types of crisis arise."
"At the recent launch of his book on climate change, Prince Charles observed that: We might also be more inclined to think about the longer term if we were more aware of what is happening around us. Perhaps daily weather forecasts could include a few basic facts about the Earth’s vital signs, or details of where climate change is increasing the likelihood of damaging weather? Using a few “vital signs” to raise public awareness of the planet’s state of health is a good suggestion. These signs could provide people with a meaningful description of the climatic changes that are underway. They could also provide a common basis for international responses to climate change. The recent Paris Agreement, for example, commits governments to come together every five years to review their pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It would be helpful if they shared common perceptions of what is happening in the climate system. At present, we have only one vital sign: global surface temperature. Its rise is driven primarily by the elevated concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and it is widely used as a measure of the size of the problem the world is facing. Temperature goals have been used to coordinate the preparations of scientists and diplomats for many international negotiations, and the now famous 1.5℃ and 2℃ goals framed the groundbreaking agreement reached in Paris. The world is now focused on reducing emissions and on coping with the changes that are already occurring. But global surface temperature by itself will not serve as well in this second phase as it doesn’t describe all that happens in the climate system.  Of the additional heat trapped by elevated greenhouse gas concentrations, more than 90% goes into the ocean. The total heat content of the ocean, from the surface to depth, is thus a more fundamental measure of climate change. The additional heat also causes ice to melt, meaning the states of glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice are useful measures of change, but they are not related to global surface temperature in a simple way. Meanwhile any assessment of how global warming will actually affect people’s lives requires measures of local and regional change. We therefore need a richer picture of the climate’s behaviour, conveyed by a basket of indicators. The situation is no different to medicine, central banking or any other issue where people must diagnose systems of great complexity in order to understand what is at stake and to make decisions. Some might say following more than one indicator at a time could be confusing. Yet a doctor starts every appointment by checking many different vital signs – blood pressure, weight, heart rate, cholesterol and so on. We know that body temperature alone doesn’t tell us all we need to know about our health. Today’s satellites and observational networks are ready to support the creation of vital signs. They keep track of the frequency and severity of extreme weather events around the world. Land surface temperature and rainfall have been recorded routinely since the 19th century and now satellites give us the global picture.  Satellite instruments also measure changes in the Arctic and Antarctic and monitor global sea level with exquisite precision. A worldwide network of observatories is collecting measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide and hundreds of other greenhouse gases. For vital signs to be used internationally as a common benchmark, we’ll need global agreement on who generates, certifies, and sponsors them. This may take some time given there exists a constellation of observing groups and supporting agencies for each potentially relevant dataset. For example, sea surface temperature is monitored by ships and satellites from many different countries, and an international collaboration provides a network of nearly 4,000 underwater robotic floats that measure the heat content of the upper ocean and increasingly the deeper ocean too. Several UN and other international agencies, including the WMO, IPCC and the UN’s climate secretariat, are working to define by the end of 2017 a small number of vital signs – maybe five or six – that will give a better overall description of climate change. Planetary vital signs, by conveying common perceptions of climate change, could help international leaders agree on coordinated, global actions. They could alert people to the risks of climate change and move local leaders to play their part. And they would let voters see how their leaders are protecting them from climate risks. But to make it all work, the planet’s vital signs will need to become as familiar as the weather report."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe PIK has issued a press release on another one of its patently alarmist, statistically selective and manipulative studies, BASED ON MODELS, claiming the end of the world is near.  I’m sure this study will be shown to be preposterous in just a matter of days. No matter, the German media can hardly contain itself.
80 percent of observed monthly records would not have occurred without human influence on climate, concludes the authors-team of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the Complutense University of Madrid. Monthly temperature extremes have become much more frequent, as measurements from around the world indicate. On average, there are now five times as many record-breaking hot months worldwide than could be expected without long-term global warming, shows a study now published in Climatic Change. In parts of Europe, Africa and southern Asia the number of monthly records has increased even by a factor of ten.

Record-breaking hot months have become much more frequent. (For full graphic see Fig. 4 in the study) Graphic: PIK       

“The last decade brought unprecedented heat waves; for instance in the US in 2012, in Russia in 2010, in Australia  in 2009, and in Europe in 2003,” lead-author Dim Coumou says. “Heat extremes are causing many deaths, major forest fires, and harvest losses – societies and ecosystems are not adapted to ever new record-breaking temperatures.” The new study relies on 131 years of monthly temperature data for more than 12,000 grid points around the world, provided by NASA. Comprehensive         analysis reveals the increase in records.

The researchers developed a robust statistical model that explains the surge in the number of records to be a consequence of the long-term global warming trend. That surge has been particularly steep over the last 40 years, due to a steep global-warming trend over this period. Superimposed on this long-term rise, the data show the effect of natural variability, with especially high numbers of heat records during years with El Niño events. This natural variability, however, does not explain the overall development of record events, found the researchers.
Natural variability does not explain the overall development of record events
If global warming continues, the study projects that the number of new monthly records will be 12 times as high in 30 years as it would be without climate change. “Now this doesn’t mean there will be 12 times more hot summers in Europe than today – it actually is worse,“ Coumou points out. For the new records set in the 2040s will not just be hot by today’s standards. “To count as new records, they actually have to beat heat records set in the 2020s and 2030s, which will already be hotter than anything we have experienced to date,” explains Coumou. “And this is just the global average – in some continental regions, the increase in new records will be even greater.”
“Statistics alone cannot tell us what the cause of any single heat wave is, but they show a large and systematic increase in the number of heat records due to global warming,” says Stefan  Rahmstorf, a co-author of the study and co-chair of PIK’s research domain Earth System Analysis. “Today, this increase is already so large that by far most monthly heat records are due to climate change. The science is clear that only a small fraction would have occurred naturally.”

The paper unfortunately ignores the siting issues of modern temperature stations, most now located next to airport tramacs and within urban sprawl. The horror scenarios also contradict observed temperature trends and projections of further stgnation or even cooling in the next decade.
All climate models have been exposed as exaggerated
Joe Bastardi shows how observed temperatures over the last 30 years have been below all 38 model projections put out by a variety of “climate institutes.” The consensus of the models has been revealed as being dead wrong. Bold blue dots represent the observed trend:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Geophysical Research Letters has just published the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research’s crystal ball visions for the monsoons in India, PIK press release here. I’ve highlighted the language to emphasize the speculative nature of the study.
Ups-and-downs of Indian monsoon rainfall likely to increase under warming

Day-to-day rainfall in India might become much more variable due to climate change – potentially putting millions of poor farmers and the country’s agricultural productivity at risk. The Indian monsoon is a complex system which is likely to change under future global warming. While it is in the very nature of weather to vary, the question is how much and whether we can deal with it. Extreme rainfall, for example, bears the risk of flooding, and crop failure. Computer simulations with a comprehensive set of 20 state-of-the-art climate models now consistently show that Indian monsoon daily variability might increase, according to a study just published by scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

‘Increased variability – this rather technical term translates into potentially severe impacts on people who cannot afford additional loss,’ says Anders Levermann, one of the study’s authors and co-chair of PIK’s research domain Sustainable Solutions. ‘The fact that all these different models agree is a clear message that adaptation measures can be built on.'”
Let’s stop right here. Models are pure speculation and only a gambler gambling with someone else’s money would trust them. To get an idea of just how much we ought to trust models, let’s have a look at how global temperature models have been doing so far:

Global temperature model performance thus far: drroyspencer.com/
Sorry Anders. I don’t mean to be picking on you today, but the “state-of-the-art climate models” have been crap so far, to put it diplomatically. As one reader commented over at WUWT, “98% (TM) of climate models say that 97% of climate scientists are wrong!”
The PIK press release continues:

Even if seasonal mean precipitation would remain unchanged, impacts could be substantial, Levermann points out. “Focusing on the average is not always useful. If rainfall comes in a spell and is followed by a drought, this can be devastating even if the average is normal. This requires the right kind of adaptation measures that account for this variability – such as intelligent insurance schemes, for example.” 
‘Limiting global warming is key, adaptation cannot replace but rather complement it’
The strongest change of 13 to 50 percent is found in a scenario in which greenhouse gases continue to be emitted unabated. However, even if global warming would be limited to the internationally acknowledged threshold of 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, this would bear the risk of additional day-to-day variability between 8 and 24 percent above the pre-industrial level, according to the analysis. ‘So limiting global warming is key to reduce day-to-day monsoon variability, adaptation cannot replace but rather complement it,’ says Levermann.”
The above monsoon variability claim is an assumption based WAGs (wild ass guesses) built into models. It’s pure speculation, and has no better quality than the global temperature models presented above.
The researchers focused on the ten models with the most realistic monsoon pattern – a conservative approach, as these ten models yield generally lower rates of change. The other ten models showed higher rates of change. ‘This is not about exact percentages. It is the clear trend that conveys the message,’ says Arathy Menon, lead-author of the study. The scientists used the latest ensemble of climate models, prepared for the 5th assessement report of the International Panel on Climate Change. All of them show increased variability.
‘This is a robust indicator’
Taking into account all 20 models, the spread of results reduces when the scientists looked at the rainfall changes per degree of global warming independent of the exact time path of the warming. The consistent result is that 4 to 12 percent variability change of daily monsoon rainfall in India are to be expected per degree Celsius of warming. ‘This is a robust indicator,’ says Menon.”
The “ensemble of models” used have been completely wrong so far, as Dr. Roy Spencer’s chart above shows. Faulty climate models cannot possibly be used as a basis for a “robust indicator”.
About 80 percent of annual rainfall in India occur during the monsoon season from June through September. Factors that could perturb rainfall regularity include the higher holding capacity of moisture of the warmer air, but also more complex phenomena like cooling in the higher atmosphere which changes current pressure and thereby rainfall patterns.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel has finally gotten around to conceding that global warming has ended, at least for the time being.

Yesterday Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski published a piece called: Klimawandel: Forscher rätseln über Stillstand bei Erderwärmung (Climate change: scientists baffled by the stop in global warming).
We’ve been waiting for this admission a long time, and watching the media reaction is interesting to say the least. Bojanowski writes that “The word has been out for quite some time now that the climate is developing differently than predicted earlier”. He poses the question: “How many more years of stagnation are needed before scientists rethink their predictions of future warming?”
Bojanowski adds (emphasis added):
15 years without warming are now behind us. The stagnation of global near-surface average temperatures shows that the uncertainties in the climate prognoses are surprisingly large. The public is now waiting with suspense to see if the next UN IPCC report, due in September, is going to discuss the warming stop.”
The big question now circulating through the stunned European media, governments and activist organisations is how could the warming stop have happened? Moreover, how do we now explain it to the public? To find an answer, Bojanowski contacted a number of sources. The result, in summary: scientists are now left only to speculate over an entire range of possible causes. Uncertainty in climate science indeed has never been greater. It’s back to square one.
One explanation Spiegel presents is that the oceans have somehow absorbed the heat and are now hiding it somewhere. Yet, Bojanowski writes that there is very little available data to base this on: “There is a lot of uncertainty concerning the development of the water temperature. It has long appeared that also the oceans have not warmed further since 2003.” Spiegel then quotes Kevin Trenberth concerning NASA’s claim that they’ve detected a warming of the oceans: “The uncertainties with the data are too great. We need to improve our measurements“.
Spiegel also writes that the missing heat may be lurking somewhere deep in the oceans. But here Bojanowski [Spiegel] quotes Doug Smith of the Met Office: “This is very difficult to confirm“. Jochem Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI) suspects that energy has been conveyed to the ocean’s interior, but there’s a dire lack of data to confirm this. Bojanowski writes over the current state of ocean data measurement: “Without intensifying the data measurement network, we are going to have to wait a long time for any proof“.
Scientists also suspect that the stratosphere may have something to do with the recent global temperature stall. Susan Solomon says the stratosphere has gotten considerably drier, and so warming at the surface may have been reduced by a quarter. But Bojanowski reminds us that under the bottom line, the scientists are pretty much without a clue; he writes:
‘However, climate models do not illustrate stratospheric water vapour very well,’ says Marotzke. The prognoses thus remain vague.”
Well then, maybe it’s due to aerosols from China and India blocking out the sun, some scientists are speculating, and “thus weakening warming by one third“.  Spiegel writes that “If the air were cleaner, then climate warming would accelerate.” But aerosols have always been used a convenient joker in climate models to explain unexpected cooling, such as from 1945 to 1980.
In fact, all the explanations presented by Bojanowski above have already been thoroughly looked at in a book-  one year ago – by a pair of scientists: Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning. Last year much of the media massively ostracised them for floating “crude theories”. A year later it’s indeed strange to see that their “crude theories” are now completely in vogue.
How does Bojanowski sum it up? “The numerous possible explanations do show just how imprecisely climate is understood.”
Trenberth is left with only anecdotes, isolated singular events

//-->




Yet, as Bojanowski points out, some scientists refuse to give up on the AGW theory. He writes:
Under the bottom line, there are a number of various ominous signs of warming: rising sea levels, Arctic sea ice reduced by a half in the summertime, melting glaciers. At some locations there are signs that extreme weather events are increasing. ‘There are many signs of global warming,’ emphasizes Kevon Trenberth, “near surface air temperatures is only one of them.'”
Sorry, but isolated singular events do not constitute trends, let alone science. Prof. Trenberth really ought to know that. This is pathetic. The observed data and measured trends have stopped showing global warming. So are scientists now claiming that singular events are robust signs? This would be only one step away from astrology!
Bojanowski reminds us again that the science is poorly understood and that a number of factors are at play. He writes:
Indeed new surprising data keep popping up. Recently a new study appeared showing that soot particles from unfiltered diesel engine exhaust and open fires have had an impact on warming that is twice as high as what was first thought.”
Bojanowski also tells his readers that “Computer simulations have shown that warming has made tropical storms more seldom.”
He also mentions other factors that are poorly understood, such as: solar radiation’s impact on clouds, water vapour cycles, and natural and man-made aerosols.
Short term prognoses remain “especially uncertain”. But longterm ones are sure?
Spiegel at the end of the article seems to be duped into thinking that short-term prognoses are uncertain, but longterm ones are rather sure. Spiegel quotes warmist Jochem Marotzke of the MPI:
Climate prognoses over time periods of a few years still remain especially uncertain. ‘Our forecasting system in this regard still lets us down,’ says MPI director Marotzke. “But we’re still working on it.”
This to me appears to be an attempt to have readers believe that although they’ve botched the short-term projections completely, they are likely still right about the longterm projections of warming. Now take five minutes to get your laughing under control. … If the models failed for the first 15 years, then they are no good! Period! They’re crap, and you cannot rely on them for projecting the long-term. They belong in one place only: the dustbin! How long must we wait before climate scientists return to science?
Don’t get me wrong, at least this article, admitting something is terribly amiss, is a very encouraging step in the right direction. But it’s difficult to remain hopeful when climate scientists continue demonstrating that they do not even know what proper scientific methodology is.
Lastly, I like they way Bojanowski ends his piece:
Current prognoses warn of a 5°C warming if CO2 emissions continue as before. But it is not now well-known just how much natural climate impacts are able to change the temperature development – the new NASA data have revealed this as well.”
Spiegel science writers would be well-advised to read Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s “Die kalte Sonne“. Practically every question brought up by Bojanowski has been answered there – one year ago. Moreover, Lüning”s and Vahrenholt’s temperature model for the next 100 years so far has been dead on.

"Disaster was narrowly averted after America’s tallest dam threatened to release a deluge of water over thousands of homes on February 12. Dramatic scenes of water cascading from the Oroville dam emerged after a hole the size of a football field appeared in the spillway floor, allowing water to rip through its foundations and compromise the whole structure. Authorities ordered 180,000 people to evacuate while the water level was lowered to relieve pressure on the damaged spillway. But 48 hours later, the immediate danger had passed and residents were allowed to return home.  This near catastrophe is just the latest symptom of the chronic ill-health of America’s civil infrastructure, which has suffered from decades of under-investment and neglect. But the Oroville dam crisis could provide an unexpected opportunity for the new Trump administration to take on both problems – and win. Winning is important to the US president, Donald Trump. This is not in dispute. He has built his name, his fame and his entire presidential campaign on being seen to be a winner. In office, he has been quick to reject situations where there is no easy win in sight: from his opposition to the environmental lobby, to his dislike of multilateral trade deals and his “shut up shop” attitude on migration. But when it comes to infrastructure, the win is clear to see: stuff is broken, stuff can be fixed by good, honest blue-collar workers driving proper US-made machines. These things can be paid for using money – and money is what Trump knows about. New roads, new jobs, a New Deal even – these all look like wins for a relentlessly ambitious president. But renewing the nation’s failing infrastructure is not a simple process, as successive White House administrations have found. Up to US$1 trillion is required to repair or replace ageing dams, bridges, highways and all the other components that support modern civilisation. Where to source the money has been a subject of political wrangling for decades.  Arguments between state and federal administrations, fuelled by political in-fighting and lobbyists – including environmentalists who are opposed to big infrastructure on principle – have all contributed to the stasis. But with a new strategy, Trump might just be able to score a big win where other presidents have lost out.  For water infrastructure, such as Oroville dam, perhaps the most obvious part of the problem is the weather. After five years of extreme drought, this winter has brought record rainfalls. Just prior to the crisis, the Oroville reservoir and others like it were at more than 150% of their normal capacity. Under these conditions, every storm becomes a challenge for water resource engineers. But what has this got to do with Trump’s infrastructure promise? Year-on-year variations in seasonal weather are highly unpredictable. But in the longer term, atmospheric rivers (a key factor in Californian climate) and similar extreme weather events are robustly predicted to increase in frequency as the global climate warms. The strong balance of scientific evidence and opinion suggests that greenhouse gas emitters worldwide are at least partially responsible: particularly in the US and China, which together generate a third of world emissions This presents Trump the climate change denier with a dilemma. To get the win on infrastructure, he needs money. To get the money in a reasonable time frame, he will need corporate investors who are prepared to cut through the political deadlock. But investors require incentives to channel funds into long-term public works, for which Trump will claim the bulk of the credit. And market economics suggests that if there was any money in it for them, this would already be happening. The Oroville dam, though, demonstrates that some of the largest imminent threats to infrastructure will increase through climate change. If Trump could take an executive decision to shift his position on that – surely not hard for someone who deals so readily in “alternative facts” – then a pathway to the win could open up.  Apportioning blame for carbon emissions could bolster his case for tariffs and other sanctions on Chinese imports. A similar economic stick for domestic polluters would be less palatable, but the money raised could be used to provide corporations with financial incentives to invest in maintaining infrastructure, expanding renewables and adopting green, energy-efficient technology. All these projects promise long-term gains for US businesses and jobs, if only the initial inertia could be overcome. Carbon reduction tariffs, linked specifically to infrastructure renewal incentives, could provide that vital momentum. Such ideas have been around for decades: environmental thinkers including Paul Hawken and Amory Lovins espouse the notion of “natural capitalism” – a market-driven economics which centres on the value of natural resources. The Oroville dam provides compelling evidence of the hard economic costs of inaction on infrastructure.  Accepting man-made climate change could provide Trump with a chance to deliver on one of his major campaign promises, change the face of capitalism and perhaps even save the world along the way. Doesn’t that look like a win?"

Altmaier’s latest climate-saving campaign: “Put the lid on your electricity consumption.” Source: www.bmu.dep
Now that cancer is threatening to return to Germany – this time in the mutated form of radical environmentalism. A recent campaign by Environment Minister Peter Altmaier reminds us of the propaganda campaigns used by old German regimes to manipulate public behavior.
At Die Achse des Guten Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch write that German Environment Minister Peter Altmaier has slipped and stooped to resurrecting the old campaigns of failed regimes in order to get people to save energy.
Back in the old East Germany days, the system wasn’t even able to supply the people with the most basic products and services – like electricity. And so they launched campaigns to stigmatize their consumption. Today, as Germany rushes madly into renewable energy from the intermittent sources of wind and sun, demand is beginning to outstrip the ever increasingly precarious supply. Once again the government is now pleading that its citizens save energy (to save the climate).
Maxeiner and Miersch report on Altmaier, who recently provided his latest energy saving cooking tips:
‘When you cook food with the lid on, you can save up to 30% electricity,’ announced Environment Minister Altmaier in an advert. ‘Switch off the cooker and oven before the end of the cooking time and allow to simmer.’ Hooray, this is how we can succeed in achieving the transition to renewable energy.”
This is the latest PR campaign by the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Protection and Reactor Safety: A smiling Peter Altmaier (see above) is shown giving cooking tips, with slogans like: “Put the lid on your electricity consumption.“
In the 1950s, to help overcome the electricity supply bottlenecks resulting from Communist mismanagement, the East German regime also rolled out a campaign to get its citizens to cut back on electricity consumption. The campaign was called the “Blitz contra Wattfraß” (blitz against the Watt-Eater).

Communist East Germany’s “Watt-Eater” electricity saving campaign. “Do you know him? It’s the Watt-Eater. Hunt him down! It’ll pay off!”
In 1958, Spiegel described that campaign as follows:
Lab-worker Waltrud Peter was just getting ready to brew herself a cup of coffee at the Buna-Werk in Schkopau near Merseburg when suddenly she got a visit. In her laboratory a so-called special unit of the “Freien Deutschen Jugend” (FDJ – Free German Youths) appeared and switched off Waltraud’s electric cooker.”
This was all part of the SED communist party’s new campaign designed to stop citizens from wasting electricity. It turns out that the Watt-Eater campaign is just the child of the Nazi propaganda campaign: the “Kohlenklau“ (coal-thief), which was designed to get citizens to save energy by severely stigmatizing those who consumed energy “needlessly”.

“Who is the KOHLENKLAU? He’s a miscreant from whom we have to especially protect ourselves against because he threatens us and our wartime economy.” 
Other Kohlenklau posters and propoganda wrote:
He brings cold into warm rooms, Lights are on in empty rooms, The radio is playing without any listeners around…everywhere valuable coal, electricity and gas are wasted, the Kohlenklau has a hand in it!”
The old Nazi campaign implied that anyone who wasted energy jeopardised the Fatherland’s war machine – and that was punishable by death. Today it’s getting so that people who waste energy are now jeopardising the climate-rescuing energy transition to renewable energy.
Of course Minister Altmaier cannot to be compared to the old miscreants of the past, and is surely a good guy. But he needs to ask himself what has become of a country that finds itself resorting to the old campaigns from failed regimes.
A government’s duty is to provide its people with a secure and reliable supply of energy, and not to diminish it.

"In Europe, the majority of oil and gas production (OGP) comes from mature offshore facilities that are approaching the end of their lifespan. The current low oil price is prompting decisions about the decommissioning of this ageing infrastructure, particularly in the North Sea.  Many producing regions, such as Europe, have regulatory frameworks requiring – with relatively limited exceptions – the entire infrastructure to be removed once production ceases. These regulations, for example the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR), were put in place to ensure that the ecosystems where OGP takes place would be restored to their pristine state once production stopped.  But what are the consequences of this? And will they benefit the natural world? Ecosystems are complex and adaptive – that is, they are systems composed of many interacting species. Crucially, these interactions can change over time depending on the internal and external forces being applied to the system. The very nature of ecosystems means that we cannot think about them as we would an engineered system.  A wealth of studies have shown over the past two decades that ecosystem restoration is complex and that removing things like the infrastructure that supports the North Sea oil and gas industry does not necessarily result in a return to the ecosystem’s original state. The introduction of the OGP infrastructure has changed the North Sea. Structures such as platforms, thousands of kilometres of pipelines and other sub-sea structures have been in place for decades – and have been used as a medium for new ecosystems to establish themselves.  And so our current understanding of ecosystem dynamics raises some important questions. What is the North Sea’s pristine condition? How do we get it back to that state? And would that really be the best thing to do? Ecosystems can exist in different states depending on how the species within them interact. The transition, or shift, between states can depend on external factors, such as perturbations or the introduction of novel habitats. Overfishing is the best known example of how a marine ecosystem state shift can occur.  One textbook example is the shift between kelp forests and sea urchin barrens. The over exploitation of sea otters for their fur on the US Pacific coast led to a boom in the populations of sea urchins – which are prey for otters and which overgrazed the kelp forests and completely transformed the coastal ecosystem. While this particular shift led to a less productive and therefore less desirable ecosystem, state shifts do not necessarily change ecosystems for the worse. The pre-OGP North Sea was blighted by over-fishing and was still recovering from being a naval theatre of war. Several fish stocks were collapsed with unknown consequences for the ecosystem. Is this really the ecosystem we should aim to recover?  And if we go further back, humans have been using the North Sea for millennia. If we take the view that humans are a species apart from nature, we need to discover what would constitute a “pristine” North Sea state – that is to say, a North Sea unaffected by any human activity and influence. And how would we restore the sea to this state without considering the needs, and impacts, of other users such as shipping and fishing – or indeed the species thriving there now?  Alternatively, we could take the view that humans and their influences – such as OGP infrastructure – are an integral part of nature. This enables us to take into account the possible benefits of human activity. We should consider, for example, the role played by OGP infrastructure in the over-fishing restoration efforts in the North Sea over the past 30 years – and, importantly, what will happen if we remove all of the structures.  We also need to look at how these OGP structures have provided new habitats. In other regions, the rigs-to-reef concept, where infrastructure is either dragged near shore or left in place to form reefs, has been a useful strategy in the decommissioning process. After all, reefs are a prevalent ecosystem in these regions, predating OGP, and the infrastructure can provide the basis for new reef systems. We should consider whether sub-sea infrastructure – redundant or otherwise – that offers novel and productive habitats must be removed. These are open questions, societal challenges, that we need urgently to face. A dogmatic approach to decommissioning – one that insists that all infrastructure is completely removed – is likely to work against the original motivation of the regulations. We just don’t know what will be the impact on the existing environment of such a change – it might shift the system towards a “better” or “worse” state. The one thing we know for sure about ecological systems is that they continuously change – so the notion of “returning” an ecosystem to a “pristine” state, while romantic, is not a useful way of looking at it. In fact, it is counterintuitive. This does not mean that we should adopt a laissez-faire approach, but that we should aim for a decommissioning process that maximises the health and resilience of the current ecosystem.  We need to develop a comprehensive environmental decision support system that considers what benefits the removal of each component might bring and what impact this might cause.  If things go ahead as planned, we are about to transform the North Sea into a giant demolition site, a process that will last for the next 20-40 years. Decommissioning on that scale has never been done really. The environmental impact of this new stage of human activity will not be trivial. It will affect both ecosystem functioning and species we care about, particularly those sensitive to noise, while also contributing substantially to carbon emissions.  The OGP infrastructure has been in place for decades, much of it acting as fisheries exclusion zones. Some might now sustain species and habitats crucial to ecosystem functioning. The benefits of complete removal, as originally intended, are therefore now less clear.  We need a holistic approach to decommissioning that integrates the environmental costs and benefits at every level and doesn’t just assume that all of the infrastructure is “bad”. That way, the North Sea ecosystem stands the best possible chance of thriving into the future."

"In the UK, roughly a third of the food grown in the field never actually makes into anybody’s mouth. For every three pigs raised on a farm, the equivalent of one will ultimately be sent to landfill. A third of all apples, perfectly good for consumption, will somehow be discarded. The message is simple: we waste food, and we waste a lot of it. Food waste is a global problem,  but in the developed world, where our farming and manufacturing practices are efficient, the food waste that occurs at these early stages is largely unavoidable (meat bones, egg shells, banana peel and the like).  Conversely, in UK homes – where 7m of the 13m tonnes of food waste comes from each year – 77% of waste is either avoidable (at some point, it has been perfectly good food) or possibly avoidable (food that some people eat, but others don’t, such as potato skins and meat fat). This is akin to throwing away one shopping bag in five as you leave the supermarket – with an annual cost to a family of four of more than £740.  Clearly, not all food waste is equal. The cost and environmental impact of a kilo of beef is much higher than that of a kilo of potatoes, as would be expected. And so with short shelf-life food categories. Fresh produce, bakery, meats and dairy top the most wasted list – and have the largest energy, CO2, and water footprints – and so should be the main focus for reducing waste. It seems too easy to say that it is the responsibility of consumers to reduce these ridiculous levels of waste. And it is too easy. A couple of years ago, Professor Tim Lang wrote here about food waste being a symptom of a much bigger problem, explaining that the relative low cost of food almost forces a consumer society to buy more food than it can eat. It is arguably the economic powerhouses (in this case, the food giants) that drive this through brand advertising, store layouts and clever pricing strategies. So the question is now: isn’t it the food providers’ responsibility to reduce food waste? Well, the answer is that both providers and consumers have a part to play. For the consumers, the argument for this is easy: wasting less food equals saving more money, and you feel good for doing less harm to the environment. For the providers (manufacturers and retailers), the drive is less clear: selling less food equals less profit. So how can food providers help consumers reduce food waste, but still remain profitable? There are a few options, but some of them are not easy to swallow. The price of food seems a pretty obvious place to start. Consumers currently spend around 11% of their income on food and drink. Five decades ago, the proportion was three times higher, so naturally people wasted less. In sub-Saharan Africa, where consumers spend half of their income on food, it would be difficult to envisage high levels of waste. But increasing the price of food such that consumers “value” it more is likely to be very unpopular – and such a move would fly in the face of the modern food industry and its apparently eternal price wars. Looking at the statistics, it appears that a large proportion of food waste is due to products with short shelf-lives not being used in time. Consequently, there is potential for improvements in food processing or packaging and storage to increase the useable life of such products and reduce the potential for spoilage before use.  But given that leading supermarkets demand 90% of product life at the point of store entry, and goods already have extended lifetimes due to already excessive packaging and protective atmospheres, significant increases in shelf-life are unlikely.  A brave move might be to abolish “use-by” and “best-before” dates (we didn’t have them before the 1970s), but this would open up a legislative can of worms. Until somebody invents a device that can reliably tell whether a leg of lamb has gone off, I suspect these dates are likely to stay. You could just make sure you eat the food before it goes bad, but the nation’s already bulging waistline might struggle with this extra consumption. Food waste via overconsumption is yet another issue. Perhaps the greatest improvement would be to completely change the food provision market. Consumers are like micro-manufacturers: they buy stock (ingredients) and use processes (cook) to meet a demand (their family’s hunger). But unlike manufacturers, consumers aren’t very good at managing their inventory, using their processes efficiently or predicting demand accurately. This leads to food waste.  There is therefore an argument for food providers to help consumers meet their families’ needs by selling meals, not food. It’s not inconceivable to imagine in the future people planning meals and then ordering them off the internet for home delivery – it might build better relationships between providers and consumers, too. Even if consumers pay more for food which is delivered when wanted and actually gets eaten, it would be more convenient and could well end up being  cheaper overall. Whichever approaches materialise to successfully reduce food waste, one thing is certain: there needs to be a collaborative, mutually beneficial approach for both providers and consumers. Only with this market-level change can we expect the amount of food we throw away to diminish."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnce again German meteorologists are reminding us how the predictions of warm, snowless winters made in 2000 are turning out to be completely false, as Bild writes here, just when Germany gets socked by more snow and cold.
A few days ago I wrote a post about Mojib Latif postponing warm winters by up to 100 years into the future as a result. It seems indeed much of what Latif writes and says needs to be taken with much caution. Not everything he says is accurate. In fact sometimes he plays it a little fast and loose with the truth.
In the very same interview at klimaretter, he is quoted as saying (my emphasis):
When I was a kid in the 1960s, we sometimes still had snow at Easter. In the meantime we have really forgotten how a winter really appears – and there can be winters also in times of global warming.”
Well, he was a kid growing up in Hamburg. So just how many snow-blanketed Easters did Hamburg see in the 1960s? We know it saw one hell of a hurricane that makes Sandy look like a picnic.
Latif used the word “sometimes” to describe the frequency of “having snow at Easter” in the 1960s, implying 3, 4, or maybe 5 times. It would be stretch calling 2 times “sometimes”. Once is certainly not “sometimes”.

Sorry I have to do this, but what follows are the Easter snow ON THE GROUND statistics in cm for Hamburg of the 1960s, looking at Holy Thursday through Easter Monday:
1960: 14-18 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1961: 30 March – 3 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1962: 19-23 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1963: 11-15 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1964: 26-30 March; 0,0,0,0,3cm
1965: 15-19 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1966: 7-11 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1967: 23-27 March; 0,0,0,0,0
1968: 11-15 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1969: 3-7 April; 0,0,0,0,0
Of the 50 days of Easter-time during the 1960s, only one single day saw snow in Hamburg – a whole 3 cm on Easter Monday, March 30, 1964!
Maybe there’s a good reason why people don’t recall the winters that Mojib says we supposedly used to have. Perhaps it’s because they never really occurred as he claims they did. Or did Mojib spend his Easters up in the mountains during his childhood and he’s confusing them with Hamburg?
We don’t want to be too hard on Mojib, as it is true that the 1960s were colder than say the 1990s or 2000s.
But if someday you should ever find yourself drinking a beer together with Mojib and he starts telling his fishing stories, just remember his Easter snow stories.

"Have you ever wondered where the foam in the ocean comes from? Or why the sea can look clear on some days and green, brown, or even pink on others? And how fish get the ingredients to make those omega-fatty acids that we’re told are so good for us? Well, the single word answer to all of these questions is: “plankton”.  Plankton are organisms that inhabit all water bodies – from lakes and ponds to oceans. The word plankton is derived from a Greek word – πλαγκτός (planktos) – meaning “I drift”, and so while plankton can move between deeper waters and the surface and vice versa, they cannot swim against the current. So sometimes we have vast numbers of planktonic jellyfish, fantastic swimmers within the water columns but helpless against the tide, stranded on our beaches. In size, plankton range from microscopic, single-celled organisms to multi-celled animals such as krills, jellyfish, crab larvae and juvenile fish.  We often think of the sea as being dominated by fish and whales. But microscopic, single-celled plankton are, in fact, the main drivers of life in Earth’s oceans. But how well do we really understand them? For decades, the accepted view has been that these single-celled microscopic plankton can be divided broadly into two types. Food producing “phytoplankton” (also known as microalgae) are like tiny marine plants. “Microzooplankton”, on the other hand, eat the phytoplankton and are in turn eaten by bigger zooplankton, such as krills.  This division of microscopic plankton is akin to the plant-animal split in terrestrial ecosystems. However we now know that, beneath the waves, there is another microscopic plankton group – “mixotrophs” that combine features of “plant-like” phytoplankton and “animal-like” microzooplankton. And their mode of feeding is, but for their microscopic scale, the stuff of horror stories. They are like miniature triffids, which can engulf living prey, suck out their innards, poison them, harpoon them, make them explode, and steal and reuse body parts. They can kill whole ecosystems in a matter of hours and alter the colour of the water – and yet they also shape the Earth’s atmosphere and support the growth of larval fish at critical stages of their life cycle. For decades, these mixotrophs have been considered to be freaks of nature, prospering only when phytoplankton and microzooplankton are disadvantaged. Over the past five years, however, through a project funded by the Leverhulme Trust, we have established that the mixotrophs are far from freaks; indeed, mixotrophy is the norm rather than the exception.  This has major implications – it means that the base of the oceanic food web doesn’t follow the traditional “plant-animal” pattern. Instead, it is dominated by the activities of the single-celled mixotrophs, microscopic “triffids” which can photosynthesise like plants and eat like animals – all within the one cell.  Based on our findings, we have proposed a new model for life in our oceans, arguing that the traditional split between the “plant-like” phytoplankton (microalgae) and the “animal-like” microzooplankton used to describe the oceanic food-web is no longer tenable. This model could overturn a century’s worth of our understanding of marine biology.  Indeed, mixotrophs have the potential to impact all of our lives, not least because they are major contributors to the food webs that support fisheries. This is especially true for the healthy growth of very young fish, which depend on them for food during the summer months.  Just like the triffids of John Wyndham’s classic sci-fi novel, however, mixotrophs can be dangerous, too – and to more than just other microplankton. The release of nitrates and organic nutrients, such as raw sewage or silage slurry, into coastal waters contributes to an imbalance of nutrient loads, which causes mixotrophs to produce toxins and mucus. The toxins can kill fish and close shell-fisheries. Muddy-coloured foam in estuaries during summer is the result of plankton secreting excess mucus – and this mucus can clog the gills of fish, effectively drowning them.  Mathematical models are used widely to aid environmental management, to study fisheries and to investigate the impacts of fishing and climate change on them. But such models do not take into account the presence and activities of the mixotrophs that we now realise comprise more than half of all microscopic plankton.  And this could result in serious flaws. We have shown that marine food web and climate change models that don’t include mixotrophs could be giving questionable results. Indeed, based on our modelling studies, we suggest that we start to take mixotrophs more seriously and include their remarkable impacts in mathematical models used to predict climate change and aid environmental management. They may be microscopic, but we ignore these little triffids at our peril."
"Nine more people in Bristol and 13 in Derby are going to have a stroke because of air pollution. Dirty air will give 12 more people in Birmingham and 87 in London a heart attack. In Liverpool, seven extra children with asthma will be hospitalised, as will five more in Nottingham. These stark figures from King’s College London on the impact of high pollution days on individual towns are a reminder that dirty air is a killer and that the climate emergency is a health emergency.  But it is also a clear warning that while the NHS and local government are gradually getting to grips with the air pollution crisis, piecemeal solutions will fail without massive government action. Cutting air pollution by a fifth would result in 77 fewer children in Oxford and 150 in Southampton suffering low lung function each year. Twenty fewer people in Manchester and 17 in Liverpool would develop lung cancer. Like the microscopic particles themselves, air pollution is sometimes difficult to detect in the climate emergency debate. It is certainly part of the narrative, but the immediacy and severity of its threat is yet to be highlighted fully by campaigners. It is hard to think of a more compelling message than we are being poisoned in our own homes, right now, every day. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has been one of the most outspoken campaigners, ramming home the message that 86% of UK children are breathing dangerous levels of toxic air. The harm even begins before birth: a Belgian study found thousands of pollution particles per cubic millimetre of tissue in every one of 25 placentas they examined of non-smoking women in a low-pollution town. One of the key advisers to the college is clinical researcher Professor Stephen Holgate. His expert evidence was crucial in persuading the high court to overturn the coroner’s verdict that nine-year-old Lewisham girl Ella Kissi-Debrah’s death in 2013 was caused by asthma. Her mother, Rosamund, wants the new inquest next year to consider whether Ella was killed by air pollution. Such a verdict would be a world first.  Public services are beginning to mobilise. The NHS is responsible for a third of the public sector’s carbon emissions, while health and social care together account for around 6% of the carbon footprint of England. Although these emissions have fallen by approximately 20% over the past decade, the NHS has struggled to make reduction a central goal. But that is changing. The King’s College analysis brutally exposes that this a health crisis. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens is now pushing that argument, giving licence for NHS organisations to act. Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust has declared a climate emergency and is tackling the problem with energy and creativity, looking at everything from ambulances to anaesthetic gas. Greater Manchester and its mayor, Andy Burnham, are aiming to make the city carbon neutral by 2038, with plans including taking control of the bus network and tackling heavily polluting coaches, lorries and taxis. But Scottish Power has exposed the deception behind the UK government’s declared aim of zero carbon emissions by 2050. It estimates that to achieve this the UK will need 25m charging points for electric vehicles – which means installing 4,000 a day – and 23m electric heat pumps to replace home gas boilers, all at a cost of £300bn. This rams home the scale of action required if the zero emissions target is to be anything other than meaningless rhetoric. Looking at the fiasco around the rollout of fast broadband, such a gargantuan change to our infrastructure – never mind our lifestyles – looks far beyond our reach. Local public services have big contribution to make to cleaning up our air. But without a huge push from central government we are doomed to keep hearing rubbish as we breathe dirt."

In Northern Greece temperatures dropped to -7°C Monday morning – schools remained closed.
The situation is even worse in southeastern Europe. Up to 3 feet of snow have fallen in northern Montenegro, reports the AP here. “At least nine deaths across the region have been blamed on the snow and deep freeze, with temperatures as low as -15 Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit). […] In Croatia, doctors issued warnings to the elderly and sick to stay indoors as local hospitals reported dozens of cases of broken limbs from falls on the ice and snow.
Fortunately warming is forecast to arrive later in the week, and thus this will likely crank back the death toll.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI commented at Facebook about Lance Armstrong earlier today, writing that I had pretty much lost respect for Lance when he paired up with jet-setting climate activist and “rock star” Sheryl Crow, and watching John Kerry acting like his best fan at the 2004 Tour.
Today it doesn’t surprise me that he has turned out to be a dishonest cheater. Of course, he doesn’t see it that way. Such folks never do.
Climate research robs cancer research
But whatever you may think of Lance, you have to respect the work he’s done in raising awareness and millions for cancer research. The key to fighting many types of cancer is researching and developing life-extending drugs and treatments. Many patients are literally on the brink, hanging on, hoping they’ll still be around long enough to see the next new effective treatment.
I friend of mine was recently diagnosed with multiple myeloma. Although it was a devestating blow, and the outlook at first looked pretty bleak, there are some good news out there. Firstly, at the age of 49, he is relatively young and strong, and thus can endure different life-extending treatments.
Secondly, I’ve read up about it and was encouraged and impressed by the variety of new, promising treatments that have been developed so far, or are now in development. Multiple myeloma, once a death sentence, is now becoming a treatable cancer, and many patients’ lives are being extended for years. However, development is slow and extremely costly. There just isn’t enough funding out there. Sure progress is being made, but I can’t help but wonder what treatments would have been developed by now had cancer research been more generously funded – had it not been robbed.

Imagine what could have been accomplished by now if a part of that enormous sum of money sucked up by climate research had gone into cancer research instead. With $100 biliion, imagine the number of treatments that could have been developed and the number of lives extended or even saved. Those of you who know someone with a serious case of cancer, you know all to well the hope they desperately cling to, hoping the next treatment arrives before they leave. For many, it’s a race.
Sure some climate research has produced good results, and I’m not saying all the climate funding could be shifted to cancer research. However, looking at the massive climate conferences and bogus studies out there, one can’t help but to think that a considerable share of climate research has been dubious, and even bordering on fraud and lunacy. Eventually, this is going to cost us. Just today, they’re finding out their climate models have been completely wrong. They couldn’t even get the first 15 years right.
Lance needs to lobby the government.
I don’t wish anything bad on anyone, but I’d like to ask many world-travelling IPCC climate scientists out there how they’d react if one day they had the misfortune of being diagnosed having an incurable form of cancer, with the doctor saying, “Well, there’s no effective treatement out there, at least for now. With the current level of research, we may find an effective treatment in maybe 10 or 15 years. Unfortunately, you’ve got only a year or two to live.”
You’d probably wish they had done more research.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman flagship news magazine Spiegel Online today has an article authored by Axel Bojanowski which takes a close look at the recent John Cook survey. German alarmists like the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research hailed it as proof that climate science was settled and done.
But Spiegel draws a different a totally conclusion.
First Bojanowski describes how a large number of Americans have serious doubts when it comes to man-made climate change, and so surveys get conducted with the aim of trying to sway public opinion. The latest was carried out by John Cook of the University of Queensland in Australia, and the results were published in the journal of Environmental Research Letters: 97% of thousands of papers surveyed agree that climate change is man-made, it asserted.
But Bojanowski trashes the findings:
There’s an obvious discrepancy between the public perception and reality. The authors speak about ‘consensus on man-made climate change’ – and thus this threatens to further increase confusion within the public. The survey confirms only a banality: Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that man is responsible for at least a part of the climate warming. The important question of how big is man’s part in climate change remains hotly disputed.
In the draft of the next UN report that will summarize climate science knowledge in September, it is stated: ‘It is extremely likely that human activity is responsible for more than half of the warming since the 1950s.’ The estimations from scientists on the exact extent vary vastly – here the consensus ends.”
Bojanowski then gives Spiegel readers the results produced by Cook: “About two thirds took no position on the subject – they remained on the sidelines. 97% of the rest supported man-made impact.

Also in an additional step, 35% of the authors who took no position were left out of the survey results altogether.
A new German survey produces similar results: no consensus!
Bojanowski then reports on another still unpublished German survey conducted by the University of Mainz in Germany. Senja Post told SPIEGEL ONLINE that “123 of 292 climate scientists asked participated in the study“. The result (warmists may want to sit down before reading):
Only 5% of those responding believed natural factors played the main role in the warming. However, Post then asked about the extent of the man-made warming. The result looked very different. Only 59% of the scientists said the ‘climate development of the last 50 years was mostly influenced by man’s activity. One quarter of those surveyed said that human and natural factors played an equal role’.”
Only 10% of German scientists say computer models are sufficiently accurate
Bojanowski then writes that skepticism is even far more widespread when it comes to the reliability of computer models. “Only 10% said climate models are ‘sufficiently accurate’ and only 15% said that ‘climatic processes are understood enough’ to allow climate to be calculated.”
Bojanowski sums up: “There’s plenty of fodder there to continue the ideologically influenced debate about climate – no matter what is said about consensus.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThings are worse than we thought when it comes to renewable energy in Europe. Online Forbes has an article titled: Requiem For Spanish Wind?
The pain in Spain cannot be sustained. That’s the conclusion of the Spanish government, which is slashing its subsidies for wind power and other renewable energy as part of a deficit-fighting move. Spain is the latest European country to cut subsidies for clean energy — following similar moves in the U.K., Germany and Italy — because they’re driving up costs for consumers. […]
It’s a sad end for a program once heralded as a model by the Obama administration for its own renewables initiative. Yet it’s also not a surprising one. […] Without government subsidies, it simply isn’t a viable business.

Germans thinking twice about sacrificing natural beauty
Meanwhile Germany’s online Spiegel is also taking a critical look at Germany’s wind industry in a piece (in English) called Eco-Blowback: Mutiny in the Land of Wind Turbines. It’s a good summation of how the wind energy is doing in Germany so far. Public resistance is reaching ever higher levels.
With the prime coastal locations already taken, operators are increasingly turning their attention to areas further inland. Even valuable tourist regions — such as the Moselle valley, the Allgäu and the foothills of the Alps — are to be sacrificed. […]

Michael Succow, a prominent German environmentalist and winner of the Alternative Nobel Prize, is also threatening to abandon ship. He fears soulless stretches of land and lost tranquility. […]
And his fears are not unfounded. Back in the 1980s, tree-huggers put up Aeroman wind turbines in their front yards — but those days are long gone. Just the masts of today’s wind turbines can reach up to 160 meters high. When active, they kill so many insects that the sticky mass slows the rotors down.

Moselle, Allgäu, foothills of the Alps? Nothing like sacrificing national and natural treasures for the sake of a neurotic climate obsession.
And I wonder how long it’s going to take other countries before they wake up and notice this isn’t working out. My home state of Vermont, for example, is planning to install an array of solar panels along an interstate. I wonder who is going to shovel the snow off 6 months a year? It’s amazing how duped and caught up with an idea seemingly intelligent people can get.

"The climate crisis was everywhere and nowhere to be found in Tuesday night’s Democratic presidential primary debate. American foreign policy – and wars in the Middle East, especially – are deeply bound up in the politics of oil, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. The conflict in Syria discussed at length can be linked to historic droughts fueled by rising temperatures, which pushed many people off land they could no longer farm. The Wall Street banks Elizabeth Warren worked to regulate through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – an agency Joe Biden took credit for creating – have funneled $1.9tn into the fossil fuel industry since the adoption of the Paris agreement. And the billionaires Bernie Sanders hopes to eliminate have some of the largest carbon footprints on Earth. Given that it’s the context in which all politics over the coming century will play out, ever-accelerating climate impacts can already be found in virtually every policy field brought up on stage last night. Several candidates – Sanders, most frequently – used questions about them as a bridge to talk about rising temperatures and a Green New Deal. Debate moderators with CNN and the New York Times just couldn’t be bothered to mention it.  What did we get instead? An entire round of questioning was kicked off by asking Bernie Sanders about his recent heart attack, and the last of the night asked candidates to opine on a surprising friendship like the one between Ellen DeGeneres and George W Bush. Amy Klobuchar – now polling at 1.6% – was asked to speculate about whether Democrats could get elected by running on universal programs like Medicare for All. After hosting a seven-hour town hall about the climate crisis several weeks back – inaccessible to anyone who didn’t have cable – CNN seems to have patted itself on the back for a job well done, having checked the box of having to talk about the potential end of human civilization. Devoting that much programming to an issue it hardly every discusses on air was laudable, but hardly a substitute for continuing to press candidates on how they plan to rapidly decarbonize the economy. The Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, shares plenty of the blame too. As organizers with the Sunrise Movement demanded that Democrats hold a debate dedicated to the climate crisis this summer, Perez fought each step of the way to make sure it wouldn’t happen. His reasoning – explained in a defensive Medium post – was that there was no reason for a dedicated debate on something candidates were sure to bring up regularly. “I have the utmost confidence that, based on our conversations with networks, climate change will be discussed early and often during our party’s primary debates,” he wrote then, doubling down on a DNC rule that would penalize candidates for participating in any unsanctioned debates. So what happened? It could be that there just wasn’t any money in it. Since the town hall was a ratings loser, the network might have figured it should just skip over climate entirely this time around to keep its numbers up. It wouldn’t be the first time: an analysis by Media Matters found that, in 2015, CNN gave five times more airtime to advertisements from fossil fuel companies than to climate coverage. The network repeatedly fails to connect the dots between extreme weather and climate breakdown. And while the New York Times regularly features quality and in-depth climate coverage, the company as a whole frequently run “advertorials” from fossil fuel interests, paid content disguised as journalism. As Fox News pumps out wall-to-wall coverage of a Green New Deal – trying to build the case against any sort of climate action – CNN should be ashamed of itself for letting a network perhaps best described as state media define the conversation about such a grave threat, failing to give advocates for that policy suite as much airtime as they’ve given to huckster climate deniers in the name of presenting “both sides” of a debate over science that never really existed. And they certainly shouldn’t be trusted to host any more debates."

"Forget about oil or gas – you should be worrying about the less discussed but far more concerning fact that the world is running out of clean, drinkable water. I wrote this article while in Kathmandu. Nepal’s capital and largest city has a severe water shortage. Even though all homeowners pay a fee to the government to get water on tap, supplies run only once a week for a few hours. Desperate residents are then forced to purchase water from private suppliers. While this is affordable for richer people, it’s a big problem for the lower and middle classes. For many in the developing world, water is really the difference between prosperity and poverty. More than a billion people around the world have no reasonable access to fresh water. Most of the diseases in developing countries are associated with water, causing millions of deaths each year (a child is estimated to die from diarrhoea every 17 seconds). Given all this, we have to come up with a solution to global water use fast, before water scarcity becomes a major cause of international conflict. The vast majority of our water is found in the oceans. Only 3% is fresh and can be used for farming and drinking, and in any case most of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. That means just 0.5% of the Earth’s water is accessible and, of this, more than two thirds is used in agriculture.  If we’re going to cut back on our water usage, we have to focus on making our farms more sustainable and efficient. With the global population still growing, we’ll need to produce ever more crops using less water, in less agricultural land. Worldwide, just over a third (37%) of the land that could be used to grow crops is currently used. Potential farmland is available, but it’s not developed due a lack of infrastructure, forest cover or conservation. A lack of land isn’t really a big problem as of now – but water is.  So how to grow crops using less water? One option would be to find a sustainable way to remove salt from our (essentially infinite) reserves of sea water. The farm in South Australia pictured below uses energy from the sun to extract seawater and desalinate it to create fresh water, which can be used to grow crops in large greenhouses.  Such farms are based in barren areas, and the plants are grown with hydroponics systems that don’t require soil. Growing crops like this all year round would significantly reduce freshwater usage in hot and dry regions, but the cost of setting up these greenhouses remains an issue. Water shortages would also ease significantly if farmers could simply use less water to produce the same yield. Easier said than done, of course, but this is especially important in drought-prone areas. Plant scientists around the world are busy identifying genes that enable plant growth in arid, dry conditions. For example, what is it that makes upland rice grow in dry soil while lowland rice requires well irrigated paddy fields for growth? Once the keys to drought tolerance are identified, they can be introduced in crops through genetic engineering (and no, this doesn’t involve injecting food with toxins as suggested by a Google image search). Farmers traditionally bred drought tolerant crops through the slow and painstaking process of selection and crossing over many generations. Genetic engineering (GE) provides a short-cut. A recent study identified diverse root architecture systems in different chickpea varieties. Future studies hope to identify genes that make some roots efficient at capturing water and nutrients from dry soils. Once a genetic factor is identified, scientists are able to directly deliver the gene that helps plants to capture more water. A key factor for drought-tolerance in plants is the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), which increases plants’ water efficiency in droughts. But ABA also reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis, which reduces plant growth in the longer term, and as a result crop yields decrease. But plants didn’t always have this trade-off: modern crops have lost a key gene that enabled early land plants like mosses to tolerate extreme dehydration. This enabled early plants to colonise land from freshwater around 500m years ago. Modern desert mosses also collect water through their leaves which helps them to grow in dry conditions.  This is the big challenge for plant scientists. To engineer crops that can be grown with minimum irrigation and that will eventually help relieve water scarcity, we’ll have to reintroduce the dehydration tolerance systems which many “higher” plants have lost but things like moss have necessarily retained. Genetic engineering remains controversial even though extensive scientific studies report GE crops available in the markets are safe for consumption. This is partly just a communication failure. But the fact is we will eventually need to use all the tech available to us, and GE crops have too much potential to ignore."
"As George Monbiot highlights (Today, I aim to get arrested. It’s the only way to save the planet, 16 October), nonviolent civil disobedience has been a vital part of achieving political and social change. Examples in the UK range from votes for women to the rights of Welsh speakers. Progress comes from below, not from above. While some may be more critical of Extinction Rebellion than others, the police’s outrageous attempt to ban its protests in London is a reminder that active nonviolence disturbs the powerful and those who maintain the status quo. Extinction Rebellion is one of several major examples of nonviolent civil disobedience and direct action over the last year, including the school climate strikes and the resistance to the DSEI arms fair in London in September, which itself resulted in over 100 arrests.  Nonviolent resistance exposes as a lie the claim that power can be maintained only through violence. Active nonviolence – including direct action, civil disobedience and mass non-cooperation, as well as many forms of lawful campaigning – undermines the common notion that we must choose between violence and passivity. As pacifists have long maintained, nonviolence is an ethical and effective alternative to both. Symon HillCampaigns and communications manager, Peace Pledge Union • Polly Toynbee is spot-on (The veteran heroes of Extinction, G2, 16 October). We oldies have been demonstrating against Trident, the Iraq war, the poll tax, etc for many years – and getting arrested. I am unable to be in London for the present actions, although I have marched and demonstrated about climate change in Scotland. I am biding my time until November next year, when the next COP summit takes place in Glasgow. This gives me lots of time to plan something really significant.Rose HarvieDumbarton"
"Republicans in the US have axed Obama-era anti-corruption rules for energy and mining companies. The move, which is awaiting sign-off by President Trump, reverses years of progress in a sector often accused of dodgy dealings. It also threatens to kick off a global race to the bottom, as countries compete to offer oil firms the murkiest business environment.  The rule in question is a requirement for American oil, gas and mining companies to publicly disclose all payments of US$100,000 or more to foreign governments in connection with projects abroad. A version of the rule was first adopted in 2012 under the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in response to the financial crisis. After several years of legal battles with industry lobbyists, the latest version was implemented in 2016. On February 3 the Republican-controlled Senate passed a resolution to scrap the requirement entirely. The resolution has already passed through the House of Representatives, and Trump is expected to give final approval within days. Energy firms have always been bitterly opposed to these rules – and for good reason. For decades, many of them have used corruption to exploit developing countries that are resource-rich but badly governed. As far back as 1976 the Watergate scandal revealed several well-known American oil companies had counterfeited their records abroad or utilised shell companies  in tax havens such as the Bahamas. It is not surprising that Rex Tillerson, Trump’s new secretary of state, personally lobbied against those transparency rules when he was Exxon’s top executive. The Republicans have sided firmly with the energy firms. The latest resolution was sponsored by Senator James Inhofe from oil-rich Oklahoma, a man who once displayed a snowball in congress to show global warming wasn’t happening. In the Senate, Inhofe argued the previous transparency “struck at the heart of American competitiveness” by making public information held by the US’s “very best companies” on “how to win oil and gas deals” – information that foreign competitors don’t have to provide. In other words, in the wake of President Trump’s desire to cut regulations for American businesses, the Republicans have decided to deliberately give a green light to secret and potentially corrupt deals abroad – all to protect the competitiveness of US energy companies. Trump was supposed to be a champion of impoverished middle class Americans, of course, shunned by a corrupt political establishment. More and more that looks like a bad joke. A series of blatant conflicts of interest and special political interventions are proving just the opposite.  Across the world, the energy sector is particularly prone to corruption. Partly, this is down to the uneven distribution of oil and gas reserves which boosts their geopolitical importance and means countries who need to import energy may feel they’re forced to bend or break the rules. The concentration of enormous amounts of wealth in relatively few countries and firms also gives the sector “an unfair advantage in the political marketplace”, with professional lobbyists able to influence government decisions. Energy industry corruption is so pervasive that a country can even discover lots of oil and gas and yet still see its development decline – a paradoxical phenomenon known as “resource curse”. The Niger delta provides a perfect example, where vast oil reserves have led to conflict and a tremendous amount of crude spilled from pipelines has harmed the local environment and people. Yet despite this grim scenario, the sector was actually becoming less corrupt before the latest intervention. The process started in the 1970s after the public condemnation that followed Watergate. It was then indirectly fostered by further economic globalisation, which inherently requires a trading system with at least some transparency and fair dealing. Over the past two decades anti-corruption laws were passed at the international level by organisations like the UN or the OECD, while individual countries imposed their own rules like the UK’s Bribery Act 2010. In the US, opposition to corruption made it into the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy which was adopted in May 2010. Three years later the EU, following America’s example, adopted a new Accounting Directive, which requires oil, gas and mining companies to publish details of payments made during their commercial operations.  The complete change in the US’s anti-corruption strategy risks sending everyone back to the old days where multinational corporations acted with impunity. In fact, it is hard to believe that other virtuous countries will continue to impose transparency rules that are more stringent than those applicable to the firms of the world’s largest economy. Congress’s decision represents a major blow to global anti-corruption efforts. And, as the Panama Papers demonstrated for the umpteenth time, corruption primarily benefits the dominant class of a country. No wonder politicians are rarely serious about tackling it."
"Paradoxically, of the one billion people classified as food insecure by the United Nations, about 500 million are smallholder farmers in developing economies. Some of these producers are exporting luxuries such as coffee, cocoa, exotic fruits and sugar for consumers in developed economies. Due to poor and volatile prices coupled with unfair trade rules, they simply don’t earn enough to feed their families all year round and often experience the problem of seasonal hunger between harvests.  This lack of nourishment can lead to stunting, weakened immune systems and more vulnerability to disease and infection. Children are particularly vulnerable, as periods of under-nutrition can hinder both their physical and mental development. Seasonal hunger is a serious problem for many coffee and cocoa farmers. Smallholder coffee farmers in three Central American countries were found to have no guarantee of food security for three to four months every year. Fairtrade was set up initially to work with marginalised smallholder farmers as a “a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect that seeks greater equity in international trade”.  Sales of Fairtrade products have grown to €7.3 billion (£6.3 billion) working with 1,230 producer organisations consisting of 1.6m farmers. Fairtrade certification actively supports producers in developing countries through importing and retailing their products. Moreover, acting as a social movement, fair trade campaigns for changes in the conventional terms and conditions of international trade which disadvantage producers in developing economies.  The movement prioritises socioeconomic factors by working to facilitate market access for producers, paying producers a fair minimum price which provides producers a guaranteed price when the world market price falls below this level. The stability of the Fairtrade minimum price means that producer cooperatives may be able to obtain finances and credit services. Cooperatives also gain security from longer-term contracts with exporters through the Fairtrade market.  In addition, whatever the conventional market price, producers in the Fairtrade system are also paid a social premium per tonne of produce (for cocoa it is US$200 per tonne) which is used for community infrastructure projects such as crop diversification schemes to combine cash and food crops, building schools, water provision and health services.  Jane Sepkazi, 36, a member of the Sireet OEP tea co-operative in Kenya, is one of the farmers who have been trained by their Fairtrade partners to grow different crops as part of her organisation’s plan to increase food security for farmers. The idea is to make farmers less reliant on tea for their income and offer ways to use their land to produce food. Sepkazi lives on her 0.2-hectare farm with her parents and two children and as well as tea, she has chickens and a kitchen garden. “I’ve been taught poultry keeping so I don’t rely just on my tea crop,” she said. The impact of Fairtrade is significant. A study by the Center for Evaluation at Saarland University in Germany found that smallholder farmers who benefited from Fairtrade enjoyed higher and more stable incomes than producers in the respective comparison groups. A further study involving coffee farmers in Uganda showed that participation in Fairtrade increased household living standards by 30% and significantly reduced the
prevalence and depth of poverty. Banana farmer Julio Mercado Cantillo, 57, lives on his farm in Macondo, Colombia, with his wife Alicia, children and grandchildren. For Cantillo, one of the benefits of Fairtrade has been better and more stable prices for his bananas, which has improved his income and the food security of his family. Cantillo explains: When we began growing bananas, it was tough. There were some days when we only had one meal. Since we joined Fairtrade, everything has changed. We now have all of our daily meals and we have also managed from the extra income from Fairtrade to buy farm animals which provides an extra source of food, and the opportunity to bring in more income by selling the animals. Nicaragua is the second poorest country in Latin America after Haiti and during the “thin season” before the coffee harvest, farmers in central Nicaragua often rely on food programmes to feed their children. To tackle this, the COOMPROCOM coffee cooperative has invested its Fairtrade Premium income in programmes that focus on food and nutritional security in the community. These include setting up a revolving fund that allows farmers to access quick loans to make emergency purchases of food. Another is a programme focusing on child nutrition that encourages farmers to grow food crops (such as beans, rice, tomatoes and corn) and diversify diets so that they are less reliant on food purchases. To help tackle the problem of seasonal hunger, the Fairtrade movement has also given birth to some very interesting financial institutions such as Shared Interest, Oikocredit and Cordiad which provide social finance for innovative trade mechanisms for smallholder farmer groups such as pre-finance for individual orders, credits and loans for stock facilities and pre-harvest loans when cash flow is a major problem for producers. Being part of the Fairtrade system provides a very useful safety net for smallholder farmers, but it can’t do everything in isolation. Fairtrade works best when it operates as part of a bigger system – within a framework of collaboration backed by supportive policy at national and local level and coupled with meaningful commitments from business.  There is still much work to be done to continue the positive impact of Fairtrade – the movement needs to keep the pressure on both policy makers and business leaders to ensure consumers can choose Fairtrade at the point of purchase. In the UK, Fairtrade companies are having to fight hard to maintain their position on the supermarket shelf – and the movement needs to redouble its efforts to communicate with consumers to explain how their purchase of Fairtrade goods can help people like Sepkazi and the Cantillo family keep their heads above water even when times are tough. _This article is part of a series by The Conversation on food security.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGood to see that the British government is finally realising that renewable energy is “foolish” and that a fundamental change in course is necessary.
This is revealed by an undercover video rolled by Greenpeace, who of course are shocked that Britain would want to end its folly.

At the 4:19 mark Greenpeace has Peter Lilley saying:
Basically I think Osbourne wanted to get people into key positions who could begin to get the government off the hook of the commitments it made very foolishly. […] We could well see, certainly amendments to the Climate Change Act.”
High time!
That means Britain is 2 steps ahead of the US in ending its climate madness. Under Obama the US is now contemplating committing to green energy, which first has to be done before the country can next think about getting off the hook.
Our friend James Delingpole is featured in the video as an “extreme” element operating in a “militant” wing of the Conservative party.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe climate-catastrophe-obsessed Klimaretter brings us an amusing anecdote which illustrates the absurdity of the green economy. It shows that it’s not really green at all. It’s pure bullshit, and Germans couldn’t care less about scaling back their lifestyles.

The 330-meter long indoor skiing facility in Wittenburg, Germany, gets €1 million in subsidies to install a PV system. (Photo: Schiwago/Wikimedia Commons)
It’s an 8-million euro photovoltaic system that’s as big as 6 football pitches and produces enough power to supply 1700 homes. It’s been subsidized by the Mecklenburg state government to the tune of one million euros. But this particular solar facility is not installed on the roof of a barn or of a green technology production company, rather it was mounted on the roof of an energy-guzzling indoor skiing facility – with the help of government subsidies.
The large photovoltaic system on the indoor skiing facility in Wittenburg, will go into operation in just a few days, and the greens are hardly amused because the “energy-wasting” indoor skiing facility received 1 million euros in subsidies from taxpayers to have it installed. Worse, the indoor skiing facility will end up consuming three times more power than what the photovoltaic system on its roof could ever provide.


Wittenburg, Germany. (Photo: Schiwago/Wikimedia Commons)
While local politicians are patting themselves on the back for greening up the facility, the opposition greens are claiming it amounts to a subsidy for an energy-gobbling, environmentally-unfriendly project, and not the photovoltaic system itself.

In reality it gobbles enormous amounts of power – together with the adjacent hotel, three times more than what the photovoltaic facility on the roof itself produces. That’s not how environmental protection is supposed to appear.”
But this is precisely how the green movement does appear, and operate. Making token green gestures is all that’s needed to have one’s environmental sins forgiven.
For example, two weeks ago Arnold Schwarzenegger flew all the way from California to Austria in his private jet just to give a speech on the importance of protecting the climate. He also said he fills up his big SUV with bio-fuel. That’s real environmental responsibility, Schwarzenegger claimed.
Another example: every year thousands of delegates and environmental planet-rescuers fly to some swanky resort city for the annual planet-saving, 2-week long climate conferences. All the carbon emissions get offset by planting trees somewhere of course! Al Gore is making hundreds of millions. That’s how environmental protection appears nowadays. The whole thing is a farce and a scam.
The indoor ski slope and hotel facilities in the state of Mecklenburg are said to provide the area with 150 badly needed jobs.
While the greens see this photovoltaic project as an environmental effrontery, the indoor skiing-facility operators view it differently: Not only does the photovoltaic system help make the skiing facility more competitive, it also means less people will have to burn fuel to travel all the way down to the Alps to go skiing. Good point!
But klimaretter is not convinced:
The indoor skiing facility belongs to the Van-der-Valk Group, which makes money with hotel and vacation-apartment rentals. Just as a windpark was being planned in the area of Rostock, the corporate group lobbied against it – in the end the criteria for wind energy in the area were redefined and the area was deemed as being unsuitable. Here, up to 30 times more green energy could have been produced by wind than with the photovoltaic facility in Wittenburg.”
To me it looks like a good place to take the family on a hot summer day.

"Conventional wisdom has it that sloths are simple, lazy creatures that do very little other than sleep all day. Even the very name “sloth” in most languages translates as some version of “lazy”. It seems astonishing that such an animal survives in the wild at all.  In 1749, French naturalist Georges Buffon was the first to describe the creature in his encyclopedia of life sciences, saying:  Slowness, habitual pain, and stupidity are the results of this strange and bungled conformation. These sloths are the lowest form of existence. One more defect would have made their lives impossible. Given such a precedent, it is of little surprise that sloths are subject to such profound speculation and misinterpretation, ranging from the benign – that they sleep all day – to the creative anecdotes I regularly hear, such as: “Sloths are so stupid that they mistake their own arm for a tree branch”.  The truth is that sloths are incredibly slow movers, but for a very simple reason: survival. The fact that slow sloths have been on this planet for almost 64m years shows that they have a winning strategy. But in order to understand exactly what it is that makes them such slow movers, and why this works so well, we have to look at the biology of these unusual animals in more detail. Three-toed sloths are indeed the slowest-moving mammals on the planet, but exactly how slow is slow? At the world’s only sloth sanctuary in Costa Rica, we have been monitoring the movement and activity patterns of wild sloths using small data loggers combined with tracking devices inside specially built “sloth backpacks”. We’ve found that, contrary to popular belief, sloths don’t actually spend inordinate amounts of time sleeping; they sleep for just eight to ten hours a day in the wild. They do move, but very slowly and always at the same, almost measured, pace.  Moving slowly unequivocally requires less energy than moving fast, and it is this principal that underlies the sloths’ unusual ecology. Sloths are not the only creatures in the animal kingdom to adopt a slow pace. Cold-blooded ectotherms such as frogs and snakes, are commonly subject to enforced slow movement when faced with cold temperatures, due to their inability to regulate their own temperature independently of the environment. Just like any chemical reaction, cold muscles are slow muscles so cold reptiles are slow reptiles.  This is in stark contrast to most homeothermic mammals which maintain a stable, high core temperature via a process of adaptive thermogenesis, and are consequently able to move fast and effectively regardless of the ambient conditions. But this athletic ability comes at a cost: high body temperatures mean high metabolic rates, and somehow the energy bill must be paid using food. So where do sloths fit into this dichotomy? They move slowly at all temperatures and, unsurprisingly, deviate from the typical homeothermic mammalian plan by operating at lower body temperatures than most mammals, while apparently having a reduced ability to thermoregulate. The average temperature of the three-toed sloth is around 32.7℃ (91℉), compared to humans’ 36.5℃/97.8℉. Much in the manner of ectotherms, sloths depend on behavioural and postural adjustments to control their own heat loss and gain, showing daily core temperature fluctuations of up to 10℃. By perpetually moving slowly and partially departing from full homeothermy, sloths burn very little energy and are able to function with the lowest metabolic rate of any non-hibernating mammal, with estimates ranging from 40–74% of the predicted value relative to the sloth’s body mass. As a result of all this, sloths don’t need to acquire much energy or to spend time looking for it. Both two and three-fingered sloths have a predominantly folivorous (leaf-based) diet, consuming material with a notably low caloric content. There are plenty of other mammals which specialise on a leaf-based diet, but usually these animals compensate for their low-calorie diet by consuming relatively large quantities of food. Fellow leaf-eating howler monkeys move at a normal pace but consume three times as many leaves per kilogram of body mass as sloths, digesting their foodstuff comparatively quickly.  Therein lies another sloth peculiarity: for the majority of mammals, digestion rate depends on body size, with larger animals generally taking longer to digest their food. Sloths appear to break this rule to an unprecedented extent. The exact rate of digestion remains unclear, but current estimations for the passage of food from ingestion to excretion range from 157 hours to a staggering 50 days (1,200 hours). Unsurprisingly, the sloth’s four-chambered stomach is constantly full, and so more leaves can only be ingested when digesta leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine. Food intake and, critically, energy expenditure are likely limited by digestion rate and room in the stomach. Indeed, the abdominal contents of a sloth can account for up to 37% of their body mass. All this points to an extraordinary lifestyle, with sloths living on a metabolic knife edge where minimal energy expenditure is finely balanced with minimal energy intake. With their plethora of energy-saving adaptations, sloths physically don’t have the ability to move very fast. And with this, they do not have the capacity to defend themselves or run away from predators, as a monkey might. Instead, their survival is entirely dependent upon camouflage – a factor aided by their symbiotic relationship with algae growing on their fur. Sloths’ main predators – big cats like jaguars, ocelots and birds such as harpy eagles – all primarily detect their prey visually, and it is likely that sloths simply move at a pace that doesn’t get them noticed.  The sloth life is certainly not the “lowest form of existence”, but as strategic as that of any other animal. They are energy-saving mammals taking life at a slow pace to avoid the rush and tumble for food, while subscribing the movement patterns that help them avoid being identified as prey. There must be a lesson somewhere in that for all of us."
"Engineering firms are under increased pressure from their own employees to abandon controversial fossil fuel projects, as the sector turns its attention to the climate crisis. About 1,000 Australian engineers and 90 organisations – including large firms and respected industry figures who have worked with fossil fuel companies – have signed a declaration to “evaluate all new projects against the environmental necessity to mitigate climate change”. As the Australian Engineers Declare movement gathers pace, some industry figures say firms that work on Adani’s Carmichael coalmine project face a potential revolt from staff, and might struggle to recruit highly skilled people. In the past few months, integrated services firms Aurecon and Cardno have both announced they would cut ties with Carmichael. The resources lobby has attempted to nullify the impact of environmental activism with veiled threats that companies might be effectively blacklisted from work on other projects. But little attention has been focused on a likely more compelling factor in those decisions – the influence of employees, whose expertise is the only real asset of most firms. “I worked in the fossil fuel extraction industry and I’m proud of the projects I worked on,” says Robert Care, the 2014 professional engineer of the year, and one of the industry’s most influential figures. “But I wouldn’t do that work today, no I wouldn’t.” Care said most engineers could recognise the energy sector was transitioning, and that they should help shape that transition rather than clinging to the way things are. The approach is in contrast to Australia’s resources sector, whose sales pitch has been focused on the provision of jobs in thermal coal. “If we don’t act and act together, then at some stage in the future we will have … disenchanted, disenfranchised people, workers who have been cast aside,” Care said. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “I think we do now know there’s a problem with continuing the way we are. We’ve got to change. Now we know there’s a problem we need to work together. The young engineers I encounter, they understand the concerns and they want to be part of the solution.” Engineers Without Borders Australia interacts with about 10,000 university students through training courses each year. The organisation’s chairman, Gavin Blakey, says young engineers care about building sustainable futures. “As an organisation actively building the engineering workforce of the future, we are seeing an increasing number of students and professionals who passionately believe in the role the sector can play in addressing global challenges,” Blakey said. Michael Green, the director of Bradman Recruitment, said engineers seeking work were clearly prioritising firms that made careful decisions about which projects they worked on. “(Firms) will start having problems recruiting, particularly younger people. The last couple of years the climate emergency concept is there, it is affecting people’s decisions. If you’ve been lucky enough to pick up expertise in renewables, you’re going to be far more favoured by employers than those who don’t.” Next week, environmental activists intend to again ramp up pressure on GHD, an engineering and services company whose statements about its work on Carmichael have not been definitive. GHD has worked as a consultant and contractor for Adani in Australia for almost a decade. In a statement on its website, the company has made clear its contracts expire in December, but has not made clear whether it would consider future work. Care said firms taking on controversial work could face a “revolt” from staff. “GHD are now in the situation where no matter what they do they’re going to draw flack,” he said. “We should be doing everything in our power to say we don’t do projects that are not going to benefit (the community and climate).” One of the world’s most storied engineering firms, Arup, has signed on to Engineers Declare. The 12-point declaration acknowledges that engineers are connected to 65% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and pledges to actively work towards a low-carbon future. “Engineers are uniquely placed to make a significant contribution to tacking climate change, through the projects we choose to do and how we choose to do them, our ability to solve complex problems and the investments in research and innovation that we make,” the chair of Arup Australasia, Peter Chamley, said."
"The people of Paris could be using the waterways instead of roads, as early as summer. A new design concept called the Seabubble is due to be piloted in the French capital. The people behind the idea foresee a fleet of small electric hydrofoil taxi vehicles carrying passengers along the Seine, and much like a car sharing arrangement, its designers have even suggested they may be piloted by individual users. Seabubbles, which can seat up to five people and are shaped like a car, employ proven hydrofoil technology which has been in use since Enrico Forlanini first baffled the inhabitants of Italy with it in the early 1900s.  Hydrofoil technology uses an underwater foil or arm which helps to lift the boat’s hull out of the water so that it can coast on the water’s surface. The drag reduction on these fast and efficient modes of water transport means a smoother ride – even in choppy waters. Larger hydrofoils are in use across the world. You can already catch a hydrofoil ferry in St Petersburg, Russia.  If these hydrofoil vehicles were adopted as a city transport, it would provide a fun, silent, electrically propelled and emission-free alternative to spending time in cars or buses on congested roads, or in the gloom of the Paris Metro system. Its designers are reportedly also seeking permission to use them on the Thames in London.  Paris already has an established and successful dry land equivalent in the electric car sharing scheme Autolib, so the Seabubble already has a lot going for it. While the thought of using a water vehicle to get around a city with a 30-mile diameter may seem curious, let’s not forget that water has been used to travel across large cities for years. London, Venice, Hong Kong, Buenos Aires, New York, Auckland, and Rotterdam all use water buses and taxis of some description.  The river system in Paris snakes its way through the city in such a way that many important parts of town would be in easy walking distance from any moored boat. But as promising as this may be, there are still many unanswered questions.  Although water transport is used across the globe, they are all usually operated by a captain, and run along set routes, but Seabubbles’ designers propose that they could be driven by members of the public. Anyone operating a boat in France requires a boat licence. In fact, there are three different licence types, depending on the type of “driving” you intend to do. So whether there would be enough incentive for someone to embark on a lengthy and thorough training course is yet to be seen. It might make more sense for these to exist as a taxi service for most.  It’s fair to assume that navigating the waters would require some measure of seamanship since avoiding collisions with other Seabubbles and drifting objects would present a daily challenge. Larger vessels would also be a constant and inflexible presence on the Seine and if a large quantity of Seabubbles come into use, they will contribute significantly to the on-water traffic, of which there is already plenty. Nevertheless, Seabubbles claim that compared to roads, there would be less objects to hit in the water and that their vehicle is easier to handle than a car. They also suggest that innovative detail solutions could take care of any likely gremlins. Technology such as sonar and sensors could be employed to “read” the water ahead and reduce engine performance when objects are spotted. Or an automatic parking function could self-moor the vehicles once they are within reach of their landing. Seabubbles can reach a speed of 20mph, and although this is seemingly modest, it is actually quite respectable on water. However, water feels firmer at higher speeds so this can put strain on the vehicle body. The stresses on their gliding points are high, and their structure is subject to a high levels of vibration – meaning that hydrofoils require regular and extensive maintenance. This combined with high usage and a potentially changing, relatively inexperienced clientele, means they may come in for frequent repairs.  All this considered, the project already has the backing of the city of Paris. And if the French pilot phase goes well, some of these questions should be answered, and Seabubbles may well provide Paris with another attraction."
"The Marrakech Climate Conference in Morocco, which opened on November 7, marks a new beginning in the global battle against climate change. The 100 countries fully signed up to the Paris Agreement to tackle carbon emissions, which is newly in force, are committed to fighting climate change beyond anything we have seen to date.   The agreement is focused on keeping the rise in world temperatures to 2℃ and trying to limit it to 1.5℃. This is partly about taking the carbon out of energy production, which is well underway through the likes of wind and solar power. Last year, most new electricity generation under construction across the world was renewable for the first time, and it was the leading source of power in the EU.  Yet at the same time, almost nothing has been done about making heating renewable. This is a huge oversight: heating amounts to a third of carbon emissions worldwide. In the UK, for example, only 6% of heating is renewable, mostly thanks to burning wood in homes and industrial biomass boilers. Clearly we can’t decarbonise without addressing this problem. So what’s stopping us? The political will has undoubtedly been lacking around the world as oil and gas have been cheaper for the last couple of years. But at the same time, heat is trickier to deal with than electricity. Heat is produced by millions of separate installations from different fuels and at different temperatures. The result is that heat metering is uncommon, which makes it harder to develop renewable heating policies or measure their effectiveness.  The UK has arguably been leading the way through a subsidy system known as the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). Launched in 2011 for businesses and then 2014 for homes, the system encourages participants to install things like solar water heaters, heat pumps, and wood-fuelled boilers. Rather than giving people or businesses a one-off grant, it works by paying them for the heat they produce.  For households and small businesses, this is similar to the feed-in tariffs system that has successfully encouraged UK homes to install solar panels and other renewable power sources. But while feed-in tariffs exist in over a hundred countries, including Australia and South Africa, the RHI remains the only one of its kind.  To date it has not been as successful. By March 2012, two years after feed-in tariffs launched in the UK, there were 314,843 installations of small renewable power, mostly of solar photovoltaic panels. By the end of March 2016, the equivalent month for the domestic RHI, the number of installations of household renewable boilers, heat pumps and solar hot water panels was only 47,743. (The most recent figures for the two schemes, from September, are 868,098 and 54,849 respectively.) Businesses are a different comparison because the subsidy system for renewable electricity changes for larger quantities. Suffice to say they are not on target either: they comprise nearly 90% of all renewable heat installed to date, since the installations tend to be much bigger. But the latest UK government information makes clear that no one expects the 2020 target for 12% renewable heat to be met.  When it comes to smaller installations, this is not a cost issue per se. The levels of investment required for renewable power and heat are similar, with solar panels and biomass boilers and heat pumps broadly costing in the £10,000 to £20,000 range and giving a circa 12% return on investment. Surveys meanwhile suggest that householders are primarily satisfied with the application process for the RHI, while the risk of cowboy installers has been reduced through a government certification scheme.  What is an issue is insulation. Buildings can only be eligible for the RHI if they meet a certain standard of energy performance by being properly insulated first. This is because the right insulation allows buildings to be heated by smaller-scale, lower-temperature heat installations of the kind that make renewables more viable.  The government has been preparing the ground with increasingly strict rules about insulation standards for new builds and by offering grants to other householders to improve their insulation. The UK is moving in the right direction, with roughly 173,000 homes improved since May 2015 and a target for one million within five years. While the country makes this shift to high-quality insulation, it makes sense that demand for renewable heat technologies is weaker.  For households at least, a second restricting factor is likely to be that making changes to heating is much more personal than putting panels on your roof. It affects the aesthetics and cosiness of your home, as well as sometimes involving changes to behaviour such as buying and storing bags of pellets to burn in the boiler. Partly for these reasons, people often invest in renewable heat at the same time as other home improvements – meaning it tends to be part of a bigger outlay.  In short, we shouldn’t be surprised that renewable heat subsidies haven’t been as quickly effective as those for renewable electricity. Both technologies are aiming for 750,000 installations by 2020. That looks a big stretch for the RHI, but this certainly doesn’t mean the system won’t work in time.  The UK’s installation figures are a reminder about the extra challenges around decarbonising heat. As the other countries that have committed to the Paris Agreement decide how best to reduce carbon emissions from heating, the UK’s experience can at least provide indications of what lies ahead. The past year has been a remarkable one for climate change legislation. The world’s leading nations now need to use the momentum to make renewable heat a reality."
"Socially and politically, 2016 was a momentous year for Britain. It was also a record breaking year for energy and the environment, but thankfully for all the right reasons. Britain’s electricity was the cleanest it had been in 60 years, as coal collapsed and renewables rose to record levels. In 2016, just 9.3% of British (not UK – as Northern Ireland is calculated separately) electricity was generated from coal, down from more than 40% in 2012. This is the lowest share coal has ever provided in the system’s 100-plus year history, and the lowest absolute quantity burnt since the start of World War II. In fact, at 10.2% of generation, wind farms produced more electricity, a significant milestone in Britain’s low-carbon transition. Natural gas has picked up most of the slack and posted its best year since 2010; but nuclear, solar and biomass are all also on the rise. The demise of coal means British carbon emissions from electricity generation have halved over the past four years. This is not greenwashing or creative accounting. When factoring in the emissions released abroad from producing electricity and biomass that is then imported, Britain’s electricity sector released 82.4m tonnes of CO2. The last time annual emissions were below 100m tonnes was back in 1955. Emissions were 25% lower than in 2015, so changes in the electricity mix mean that each Briton effectively produced 400kg less CO2 – without lifting a finger. The carbon content of a unit of electricity has fallen to 277 grams per kWh, beating the strict pathway set out in the Climate Change Act’s Carbon Budgets by up to four years. The coal collapse led to a number of other milestones being reached, including solar generation being greater than coal over the months of May, July and August. For the first time since the national grid was established in the 1930s, there were times with no coal generation at all. After first occurring on May 10, there have now been 200 coal-free hours. Scotland’s power sector is now entirely coal free, after its last station at Longannet closed in March. Electricity demand continued its downwards trend, and now stands 20% lower than its 2005 peak, despite the population rising by 5m in that time. Demand is therefore back to levels seen in the late 1980’s, which also contributed to reduced fuel burn and reduced emissions. Wind had a solid year, but annual output fell slightly as the number of storms of late 2015 were not repeated in the 2016 winter. Additional wind farms were deployed, and Britain’s capacity reached a new high of 14.33 GW. This meant that, during Storm Barbara just before Christmas, wind was able to set new records for weekly, daily and hourly output, peaking at 5.30pm on the December 23 when it generated 10.7 GW of electrical power (nearly a quarter of the national total at a peak time of day and year). Solar also had a solid year, with installed capacity surpassing the 10 GW mark, despite fears about subsidy cuts. Throughout the year it amounted to 3.2% of all British output, though at its peak on May 12 it nearly reached 20%. Biomass also posted its highest ever output at 14,198 GWh over the year, up 25% on 2015, and almost double its output in 2014. Output should continue its upwards trend now that the third coal unit at Drax power station in Yorkshire has permission to be converted to biomass (this means it will burn wood pellets imported from the US – a practice more sustainable than it sounds). Renewables have seen a dramatic rise in Great Britain, with just over 28 GW of wind, solar and biomass installed – around 1 kW for every household. This is five times more than just five years ago, and as of December 2016, Britain has more renewables (combined) than any other type of generation, beating even gas turbines. Putting together renewables, nuclear, and imports from France (which are almost all nuclear and hydro), Britain hit the milestone of supplying more than half its electricity from low carbon sources in the summer of 2016, up from 20% in 2010. It seems Britain’s low-carbon transition is proceeding at full force. Renewable capacity and output are breaking new records, a combination of carbon taxes, fuel prices and clean-air legislation have forced coal down to levels not seen for two generations, and demand is falling thanks to improving energy efficiency. After a decade of relative stagnation in the 2000s, the 2010s have marked a dramatic shift, resulting in emissions halving in just four years.
A bit of good news to start 2017. The data used in this article is based on the Energy Charts and Electric Insights websites, which allow readers to visualise and explore data on generation and consumption from Elexon and National Grid. Data from other analyses (such as BEIS or DUKES) will differ due to methodology, and particularly by including combined heat and power, and other on-site generation which is not monitored by National Grid and Elexon. Our estimated carbon emissions are based on Iain Staffell’s research published in Energy Policy, and account for foreign emissions due to electricity imports and biomass fuel processing."

There’s not a damn bit of correlation. CO2 hasn’t had any warming effect whatsoever. CO2 up, temperature down! Why are you (Spiegel) too stupid to see that?

Spiegel here:
Globally in 2011 a gigantic 34 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide were emitted – thus the burden on the Earth’s atmosphere reached a record level, reports the International Economic Forum for Regenerative Energies. The figures leave little room for interpretation.”
Spiegel adds that experts at the Dutch Environmental Research Institute PBL confirmed the trend, and that the “promises for reductions at the climate summits of the last years have hardly yielded anything”.
What the hell are you talking about? Temperatures haven’t risen at all. Isn’t that the result you wanted to begin with? What more could you possibly want? We are talking about only a few molecules of CO2 per million.
Not surprisingly, Spiegel forgets to mention that global temperature in 2011 fell about a “gigantic” 0.2 degrees.
In fact, I repeat, global temperature hasn’t risen at all in 15 years. How come? Natural factors stopped playing a role, remember?

"Humans have a much longer and wider penis than the other great apes. Even the largest of gorillas, more than twice as heavy as a human, will have a penis just two and half inches long when erect. However our testicles are rather small. A chimpanzee’s testes weigh more than a third of its brain while ours weigh in at less than 3%. The relative size of our penis and testes is all down to our mating strategies, and can provide some surprising insights into early human culture. Primates exhibit all sorts of mating behaviour, including monogamous, polygynous – where males have multiple mates – and multimale-multifemale. One indicator of which behaviour occurs in a species is the size difference between males and females. The greater this sexual dimorphism, the more likely the mating is either polygynous or multi-male to multi-female. This can be shown by observing chimpanzees and gorillas, our closest living relatives.  Male chimpanzees are much larger than females, and they have a multi-male to multi-female mating system. Essentially, male chimps have sex all the time with any female and with any excuse. A female therefore may contain sperm from multiple partners at any one time, which puts the sperm itself – and not just the animals that produce it – into direct competition. For this reason, chimpanzees have evolved huge testicles in order to produce massive amounts of sperm, multiple times a day. Male gorilla are also much larger than females, but they have a polygynous or harem-style mating system where many females live with a single male. With little or no competition actually inside the uterus, gorillas have had no need for a testicular arms race to facilitate the production of more and more sperm. Their testes, therefore, are relatively small. This is similar to modern humans, whose testes are also of very modest size and produce a relatively small amount of sperm. In fact human sperm count reduces by more than 80% if men ejaculate more than about two times a day. The human penis is large when compared with those of our closest relatives: chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. However, primatologist Alan Dixson in his wonderfully detailed book, Primate Sexuality, suggests that if we look at all primates, including monkeys, this is just wishful thinking.  Comparative measurements show the human penis is not exceptionally long. The Hamadryas baboon, for instance, a native of the Horn of Africa, has an erect penis that is five and half inches long – slightly shorter than an average human male, but they weigh only a third of our weight.   The human penis is in fact extremely dull – it does not have lumps, ridges, flanges, kinks or any other exciting feature that other primates have. In primates, this lack of penis complexity is usually found in monogamous species. This observation clashes with the fact that men are significantly larger than women. This suggests our evolutionary background involved a significant degree of polygynous, rather than exclusively monogamous, mating. This is supported by anthropological data showing that most modern human populations engage in polygynous marriage. Anthropologists Clellan Ford and Frank Beach in their book Patterns of Sexual Behaviour suggested that 84% of the 185 human cultures they had data on engaged in polygyny. However, even in these societies most people remain monogamous. Polygynous marriages are usually a privilege reserved only for high status or wealthy men. It is worth noting that hunter-gathers around the world practice only monogamy or serial-monogamy which suggests that our ancestors may have used this mating system.  At first sight, however, it would seem sensible for males to reproduce with as many females as possible. Human monogamy has long puzzled anthropologists, and lots of effort has gone in to working out what keeps males hanging around. Three main theories have been put forward. First is the need for long-term parental care and teaching, as our children take a long time to mature. Second, males need to guard their female from other males. Third, our children are vulnerable for a long time and infanticide could be a risk from other males. So to ensure that children are able to reach maturity the male is likely to stay to protect them, both socially and physically. This may be why males have maintained their larger relative size. If we view the evolution of monogamy mating systems in humans through the lens of human society it is clear that it takes a huge amount of social effort to maintain and protect more than one mate at a time. It is only when males have access to additional resources and power that they can protect multiple females, usually by ensuring other males protect them. So monogamy seems to be an adaptation to protect one’s mate and children from other males. This monogamy is reinforced by the high social cost and stress of attempting to do this for multiple partners, and it has become supported by cultural norms. So when living in complex human societies the largest and most important sexual organ is the brain. Somewhere in our evolutionary past how smart and social we are became the major control on our access to sexual partners – not how big or fancy a male’s penis is."
"Lake Chad is a hydrological miracle – a life-giving, freshwater lake in the Sahara desert. But the region around the lake has been engulfed in a violent crisis for more than a decade, which has left nearly 10 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Military crackdowns on insurgent groups such as Boko Haram have failed to end the violence. Bringing durable peace to the region requires unpicking a Gordian knot of many interlinked factors: poverty, sectarian mistrust, political marginalisation and corruption. The risks posed by the climate crisis to the rainfall-dependent livelihoods of the people of Lake Chad are an important strand of this challenge.  For years, the prevailing narrative about Lake Chad is that it has been in inexorable decline as a result of the over-extraction of water and climate crisis. A much-repeated factoid is that the lake shrunk by 90% between the 1960s and the 1990s. This statistic is employed to back up a compelling series of causal links to explain the many problems that the region faces. The story goes as follows: the declining lake has done farmers and fishermen out of their jobs, who have been recruited into armed groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State, fuelling the ongoing violence that blights the region. Under this logic, refilling the lake might seem a step worth taking – to reverse the decline of both lake and region. And the Inter Basin Water Transfer project proposes to do just that. It calls on international donors to bankroll the 2,400km (1,500 mile) Transaqua canal from the Ubangi river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Lake Chad, through war-torn Central African Republic, at an estimated cost of $50bn (£39bn) – roughly a third of the annual global aid budget. A feasibility study is already under way. Nigeria, with the support of the African Development Bank, is actively looking to raise the money needed for the project. Our two-year study of climate change and security risks in the Lake Chad region charts the hydrological health of the lake over the last 30 years. The conclusion – uncomfortably for the pipeline’s proponents – is that the lake is not actually shrinking. True, the size of the lake did fall steeply between the 1960s and the 1990s. True, the lake fluctuates dramatically over the course of each year and across decades. However, since the 1990s Lake Chad’s size has, on average, been stable. By some measures, it has even been growing. The story of an ever-shrinking lake has been built on snapshots of data – the extremes of lake size in the 1960s and 1990s – taken out of their wider context. It has proved to be a doubly convenient narrative for leaders in the region: it takes the spotlight off serious governance failures, which set the stage for the conflict in the first place, and it also makes the case for a highly lucrative, technical fix as the solution. The danger is that the canal will not address the various problems facing the region and instead, at best, provide multiple opportunities for corruption and personal enrichment for those involved and, at worst, exacerbate the region’s environmental and conflict challenges. Let’s be crystal clear here: we are not suggesting that the Lake Chad region is immune to the effects of the climate crisis, quite the opposite. Temperatures in the region are rising one and a half times faster than the global average. The unpredictability brought by climate change is worsening the political and economic conditions that gave rise to the violence in the first place. But, so far at least, it is not happening due to a shrinking lake. Lake Chad is caught in a conflict trap that undermines people’s ability to deal with the changes that an increasingly variable climate is bringing. A thorough, fact-based understanding of the interlinked climate and conflict risks facing Lake Chad is fundamental to appropriate solutions to ensure that hugely costly responses do not actually make things worse.

"It must have been an incredibly morbid sight. Walkers on Marazion beach in Cornwall, at the south-western tip of mainland Britain, recently discovered tens of thousands of dead fish had been washed ashore overnight. One eyewitness told the Plymouth Herald the fish stretched “as far as the eye could see”.  People speculated that pollution or natural predators such as dolphins or porpoises chasing the fish ashore may be to blame. But a much simpler explanation soon unfolded when the Cornish Sardine Management Association said that one of its vessels had been fishing close inshore and had had to release one of its catches for safety reasons.  Exactly what happened in this case remains unclear. But why would a ship ever need to dump fish for safety reasons? After all, catching lots of fish is surely the entire point. In any case, a European Union discard ban was first implemented in 2015 in order to stop this sort of thing.  The ban applies to the discarding of commercially valuable species for which an EU catch quota is set. The process is being phased in gradually and first on the list are “pelagic” fish like mackerel or herring that live in the midwater to close to the surface of the sea. These species of fish were chosen because they are seen as the least complicated fisheries that generally have few bycatch species associated with them.  Other more complex fisheries like those for cod, Norway lobsters (scampi) and Dover sole, that have a greater mix of species in their catches, will gradually come under the rules of the discard ban. By 2019, all quota species will be encompassed by the legislation. TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s Fish Fight campaign successfully made it seem abhorrent to throw back perfectly edible fish simply because a vessel had no quota. Yet the Marazion stranding highlights the potential tension between well-intended legislation designed to reduce waste, and the issue of vessel safety and perhaps unintended consequences of management measures.  Most of the fish in question were reported to be sardines. At present, sardines are not a quota species and hence are exempt from the EU’s discards ban, which means there is probably no further cause for concern from a legal perspective.  But thousands of dead fish on a popular beach is a horrible sight, whatever the law says. It makes fishermen appear wasteful and creates a negative impression of the entire fishing industry.  Although fishing is a highly sophisticated business these days, it remains imperfect. Mistakes can happen, however experienced the skipper.  In sardine fishing, the net is typically laid around the shoal and tightened like a bag. The net is then retrieved slowly to the side of the vessel and the fish are brought aboard. In the case of the Marazion deaths, the vessels involved will be relatively small and have limited storage space so keeping everything balanced is crucial. If by sheer bad luck the net encircled a shoal of fish that was larger than the skipper realised, the boat is immediately put in a dangerous situation. A large catch on one side of the vessel will create an imbalance that will make it much more prone to capsizing when in rough seas. A fisherman died off the coast of nearby Devon in 2012 when his heavily-laden trawler capsized in similar circumstances.  Therefore if the catch is physically too large to retrieve, the vessel would have no choice other than to release the bottom of the net so that the catch falls away. So surely the fish will swim off? Sadly not in this case. Many midwater species like sardines and mackerel are quite delicate and vulnerable to damage due to the high number of fish caught in the net. In this instance the sardines would most likely likely have been incapacitated as a result of being hauled to the side of the vessel, and when released from the net they would have been washed ashore with the action of tide and waves. No one wants this to happen – not least the fishermen themselves. Improving the welfare of fish within nets is an emerging area of research, as reducing stress during capture improves the quality (and price) of the fish that end up in restaurants.  Sonar that can better estimate the size of schools of fish, along with other improvements to fishing technology, will gradually eliminate the sort of mistakes that led to the reported fish kill. Fishermen have every incentive to adopt these technologies as slipping fish is not only undesirable, but also a dangerous, even life-threatening situation."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome of Germany’s leading media outlets are reporting that 500 German police officers and tax authorities raided mighty Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt earlier today. According to Die Welt here, five managers have been linked to a scam involving the trading of carbon permits. Arrest warrants have been issued. Also see Reuters here.

No wonder Deutsche Bank had always been such an active proponent of global warming and the emissions trading scheme. There was lots of easy cash to be made! Gee, I wonder at whose expense?
Die Welt writes:
Hundreds of police officers marched into the twin towers of Deutsche Bank, more than 20 police vehicles were parked in front of the high-rises and other office buildings. At times staff were not even permitted to use the elevators. Eight police officers were posted in the entrance with large caliber guns in reach.”
This is not the first time DB has been investigated for tax evasion involving the trade of carbon emission permits. Investigations were conducted in 2010. There have been other raids. Die Welt writes:
Indeed it became clear that the affair has reached a new level of escalation today.”

The alleged scam is not isolated to the lower or midde management levels, but reaches the very top. Deutsche Bank co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen is also the focus of the widening carbon trading tax evasion probe.
Also Reuters here writes:
Prosecutors said they were investigating 25 bank staff on suspicion of severe tax evasion, money laundering and obstruction of justice, and searched the headquarters and private residences in Berlin, Duesseldorf and Frankfurt.”
Reuters adds that back in October a German judge had sentenced six men to jail. “He stopped short of prosecuting Deutsche Bank staff but noted that the bank – through its conduct – had left the door open for tax evasion.”
Today 500 authorities used that open door. Obviously German authorities feel the carbon trading scam is much broader in scope.
A ring of traders was accused of participating in a conspiracy to evade around 300 million euros in value-added tax (VAT) on carbon permits between August 2009 and April 2010.”
According to the nwzonline.de, Judge Martin Bach sharply criticized Deutsche Bank for the trading that took place in European foreign countries, and thus evading tax obligations.
All that is left now is for the government to expand the investigation to include the scam that is “man-made global warming”.

"While the energy in fossil fuels is valuable for society, burning them has well documented environmental consequences – global warming, smog and the effects of nitrous and sulphur oxides. Many think the time has come to stop burning them almost entirely. This led to the Guardian launching a campaign a couple of years ago to “keep it in the ground”, which attracted much support.  The Paris Agreement is a shift in this direction with its commitment to keep the global temperature rise this century to 2℃. But within days of it coming into force last November, Donald Trump was elected American president. He wants the US to withdraw from the agreement and has appointed a fossil fuels champion, Rex Tillerson, as secretary of state.  There may however be a way to reconcile these two sides that is not being discussed. Instead of burning gas and coal in power stations and burning petrol and diesel in cars, we could extract their energy by burning them at source – in offshore power stations. In parallel with developing green energy technologies like wind and solar, much attention in recent years has been devoted to cleaning up traditional fossil-fuel power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS).  Most of the emphasis has been on post-combustion capture, which involves removing carbon dioxide from the power station flue gases then compressing it into a liquid. This is then pumped to a storage facility, commonly proposed in the UK to be depleted oil and gas fields offshore.  So far CCS in the UK is still not much further forward after more than ten years of endeavour. It doesn’t help that the technology has several major difficulties. The process of removing, treating and pumping carbon dioxide is costly and energy intensive, which is somewhat self-defeating. And moving the hydrocarbons hundreds of kilometres from their source to treat and burn them only to pump the carbon dioxide all the way back again is very inefficient.   So why not move the power station to the oil and gas field instead? You would burn the hydrocarbons in their containing rock by feeding them oxygen or air, while pumping pressurised water from a surface facility – per the diagram below. The heat from burning the hydrocarbons would convert the water into steam, which would be piped up to the surface to power a turbine to produce electricity that could be transmitted to shore using power cables.  In-situ combustion No hydrocarbons would be taken to the surface in this process, and the carbon dioxide and other environmentally unfriendly combustion products would remain locked within the subsurface reservoir. And in case you are wondering if the process is unsafe, it isn’t. Isolate the oxygen supply and you can quickly stop combustion. There’s also no question of explosions because these need a free path. Hydrocarbons are stored in a rock matrix, so no such paths are available.  Not only would this be a new form of green power for homes and businesses, with a concerted shift to electric cars it could displace petrol and diesel. It could also potentially be applied to onshore shale oil and gas reserves. In short, this is about having our cake and eating it.  In-situ combustion has already been used for many years in places such as the US and Romania to extract heavy oil. This involves injecting air or oxygen to burn the oil and gas within the reservoir, but instead of producing steam like in my proposal, the heat thins the heavy oil and turns lighter components to vapour, enhancing the flow to the surface.  That said, subsurface steam generation and surface power production present numerous uncertainties. We’d need significant research and development to prove the concept. Areas to be addressed include:  Modelling the combustion process: developing a model of the heat generation and the way the thermal front would move through different kinds of rock is likely to be extremely complex.  Efficiency of heat transfer: how much of the heat could be captured to produce steam? Steam well design: this would require a new well completion arrangement with materials that could handle very high temperatures.  Surface facility and transmission requirements: what does the surface facility look like – steam turbines, high-voltage DC generation? What other support systems are required? What are the requirements for moving the power onshore?  Effect of combustion products over time: would the build-up of carbon dioxide and other gases undermine the process? Where would these products migrate to and what would happen to them?  Reservoir seal integrity: would the seal that prevents hydrocarbons and combustion products escaping be maintained, or would the process compromise its integrity? Effect on hydrocarbon recovery: current techniques for extracting oil from the North Sea can remove a maximum of about two thirds of what is in a reservoir. Would burning the materials in-situ enable you to access more of the energy over the conventional process?  Integration with other infrastructure: what potential is there for linking this kind of facility with other oil and gas fields and also offshore wind farms? Commerciality: you would of course need to calculate full capital and operating costs for the process, together with the associated revenue streams. Conventional accounting might prejudice analysis of such a scheme, however, unless there is a value ascribed to the benefit of emissions reduction using full-cost accounting techniques, the overall benefits for society will be missed. Developing this kind of scheme would not come cheap. In the UK it would require such a level of investment, integration and commitment across the competing energy companies that the current fully private set-up would be a barrier.  The best route would be to set up a state energy company – accepting that nationalising the remaining resource in the UK continental shelf was necessary to maximise what was left. This sort of thinking is necessary if we are to achieve our climate change goals. Offshore power stations could be exactly what we are looking for."
