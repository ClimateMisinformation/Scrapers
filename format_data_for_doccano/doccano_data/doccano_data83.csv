"Climate activists have kept control of four sites in London for a second night, with police saying they have caused “serious disruption” affecting half a million people in the city. After the Extinction Rebellion activist group threatened to disrupt the city’s public transport network on Wednesday, Transport for London disabled wifi on the underground at the request of the British Transport Police. Thousands of people have taken part in the civil disobedience protests since Monday, blockading four landmarks in the capital in an attempt to force the government to take action on the escalating climate crisis. On Wednesday morning, the four sites – Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus – remained under the control of protesters, causing delays and diversions in the surrounding areas. “We’re working closely with the police to manage the impact of disruption to London’s transport network,” a TfL spokesperson said. “Customer wifi in underground stations has been temporarily switched off. We will restore access as soon as we are able to do so.” Passengers were not informed about the decision to turn off the network, and many travellers wrongly attributed the disruption to conventional technical faults. Disabling public communications networks is an increasingly common tactic used in policing disruption across the world. Almost eight years ago, San Francisco’s Bart transit system turned off the mobile phone service across the network to prevent a similar campaign aimed at stopping trains in protest at the killing of a man by Bart police. That decision was criticised by the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it was reminiscent of censorship in the Middle East. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said that while he shared the passion of the protesters about the urgent need to tackle climate change he was “extremely concerned” about plans to disrupt the underground. In a statement on Twitter, Khan said: “Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change, as well as risking Londoners’ safety and I’d implore anyone considering doing so to think again.” At least 168 arrests were made on Tuesday, the Metropolitan police said, bringing the total of Extinction Rebellion-related detentions since Monday up to 290. Hundreds of Extinction Rebellion protesters were still dancing around a boat stage at Oxford Circus just after 10pm, as police tried – apparently in vain – to clear the area. The events in London were part of an international “climate rebellion” organised by Extinction Rebellion. Organisers said demonstrations had taken place or were planned in 80 cities across 33 countries – from India to Australia, and around Europe and the US. In The Hague on Tuesday, activists occupied the international criminal court building.  In Scotland, more than 1,000 protesters blockaded the North Bridge in Edinburgh, bringing one of the main routes into the city centre to a standstill. Police said they made 29 arrests. The blockade began at 3pm, when groups of people on bikes converged from both sides of the bridge, before a human chain formed across the road. At about 5.30pm, protesters crossed Princes Street and unfurled banners. Most were immediately carried off the road by police. The biggest protests have been in London, with thousands of parents and their children joining scientists, teachers and environmentalists to demand urgent action in the face of “possible human extinction”. Among the protesters was the prominent UN environment lawyer Farhana Yamin, who helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement. Just after 2pm, she glued her hands to the pavement outside Shell’s headquarters near the River Thames. Nearby, police moved on to Waterloo Bridge to begin a second wave of arrests as hundreds of protesters continued their blockade. Some of those on the bridge had been locked or glued to a lorry parked across the carriageway since Monday night. By about 5pm, the atmosphere at Waterloo Bridge had calmed after police stopped arresting people.  On Tuesday evening, police turned their attention away from Waterloo Bridge to Oxford Circus. Officers circulated around the crowd in groups, informing people that if they stayed in that location they were at risk of arrest. The Guardian witnessed at least one person being carried away, while others left the crowd voluntarily after speaking to police. “We are peaceful, what about you?” protesters chanted as police made an arrest. Many protesters said they were willing to remain at the junction all night in order to hold the space. Harriet Gold, 26, a student from Bristol, was among them. “I feel really confident,” she said. “I was surprised to wake up to hear that they had Waterloo Bridge still.” Elmo MB, 20, was manning a wellbeing tent. He said he was not worried about the police order to leave the area. “I think breaking the law is the point,” he said. “There are lots of brave folk and a lot of people have been arrested so far, but they pull one person off and two people come back on. I’m not sure how long this will last, but I imagine it will last through the night.” Extinction Rebellion was formed in the UK last year and held its first civil disobedience protests in London in November. It is calling on the UK government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to devise an emergency plan of action to tackle climate breakdown and biodiversity loss. On Tuesday, Supt Colin Wingrove of the Metropolitan police confirmed a section 14 order was in place and called on the protesters to leave Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Parliament Square but they could continue their demonstration at Marble Arch. “In order to impose this condition, the Met required evidence that serious disruption was being caused to communities in London. We so far have 55 bus routes closed and 500,000 people affected as a result … we are satisfied that this threshold has been met and this course of action is necessary.”"
"Our unsustainable lifestyles and commitment to perpetual economic growth have become the major drivers of climate change and loss of biodiversity on Earth (Only rebellion will prevent an ecological apocalypse, 15 April). Our politicians fail to grasp the scale and urgency of the risk humanity faces. The UK signed up to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015, but has yet to develop a coherent and rigorous national plan for their domestic and international implementation. Encouragingly, the SDGs form a new roadmap for our future that in principle aligns the economy with the Earth’s life support systems. Yet, a recent report by the Stockholm Resilience Centre shows that attempting to achieve the socioeconomic goals using conventional growth policies would make it virtually impossible to reduce the speed of global warming and environmental degradation.  The research team tested three other scenarios, and the only one that met all goals implemented systemic transformational change. A key element was reducing inequality by a redistribution of wealth, work and income, including ensuring that the 10% richest people take no more that 40% of the income. We clearly have an unprecedented and immense challenge before us, with little choice but to engage as a mass movement to create a system-wide transformation in our politics and our economy.Stephen Martin Visiting professor, University of the West of EnglandStephen Sterling Emeritus professor of sustainability education, Plymouth University • Both Extinction Rebellion and the climate strikes are reminders that we need to rebuild our societies now if we are to avoid them facing climate collapse in the near future. But both initiatives need to avoid the fate of the Occupy movement, which had huge support 10 years ago but disintegrated because of a lack of precise demands and concrete policy goals. Fortunately, many such policies already exist. The organisation I founded, the World Future Council, has identified the best policy solutions available in countries, regions and cities worldwide. British Columbia has a carbon tax. Maryland, US, has obligatory environmental literacy education. Rwanda has a successful reforestation policy. Japan has an effective energy conservation law. Costa Rica has an exemplary biodiversity law. These provide starting points. But the UK has gone in the opposite way: 10 years ago the WFC helped MPs introduce feed-in tariff legislation (originating in Germany) to speed up the production of renewable energy. But the coalition government hastened to emasculate it. As many proposals are rejected over cost, a key recommendation is the adaptation of quantitative easing to fund the energy transition. One WFC proposal is for central banks to buy fossil fuel “stranded assets” on condition the money paid is invested in renewables. How this can be done sustainably is explained in our study “Unlocking the trillions”. As central banks cannot go bankrupt in their own currency, they can also buy – and add to their reserves – long-term and low- or zero-interest bonds to kickstart the required emergency reforms in poor countries.Jakob von UexkullFounder, World Future Council • Larry Elliott is informative on a subject that matters, as usual (Threadneedle Street’s timely warning for banks and insurers: take climate change seriously, 16 April). But insurers have taken it seriously since at least 2009, when a representative of Munich Re wrote: “Climate change probably already accounts for a significant share of economic losses from weather-related natural catastrophes in the period since 1980, which totalled $1.6tn (in original values). “In the light of these facts, it is disappointing no breakthrough was achieved at the Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009. At Munich Re, we look closely at a multitude of risks and how best to handle them. Risks that change in the course of time are especially hazardous. Climate change is just such a risk of change.” But even the premium increases 10 years later don’t appear to have cut emissions sufficiently. So the Bank of England must convince the government to take more effective action. For example, as in the second world war, introduce rationing of any production of greenhouse gases.David MurrayWallington, Surrey • Are US college courses teaching how not to be duped by bullshit really necessary (‘Calling bullshit’: the college class on how not to be duped by the news, theguardian.com, 17 April)? If students haven’t developed their critical thinking faculty by the time they get to college, they are probably lost to the agencies of disinformation and manipulation. In Britain, it is obvious that our education system, designed as it is to provide compliant labour to increase the wealth of a few, has failed when its cities are filled with humanity-saving, peaceful demonstrators. It is inspirational to observe their ability to recognise what is truly important and disregard the odium of passersby – normal people going about their business, in many cases to finance or produce goods harmful to humanity and the natural world. These protesters are the freethinkers who have escaped the bullshit net.Geoff NaylorWinchester, Hampshire • In This Changes Everything, Naomi Klein defines one legacy of the free market: “In virtually every country the political class accepts the premise that it is not the place of government to tell large corporations what they can and cannot do, even when public health and welfare – indeed the habitability of our shared home – are clearly at stake.” In the streets, yes, but in the ballot box we bring about the inevitable and dismiss our free-market political class. We build a new system.John AirsLiverpool • I admire Ben Smoke’s action at Stansted (Journal, 16 April), but disagree with him about arrest, though agree about not glorifying it and being clear about the consequences. I am a Quaker, a psychotherapist member of the Climate Psychology Alliance, which aims to support activists therapeutically, and a member of Extinction Rebellion. What we need is a mass movement with arrest as a possible and necessary part of it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEurope’s winter refuses to let up as large areas saw a white Easter accompanied by record lows and snowfall amounts. Media outlets are warning that this year could the year without a spring. Germany’s number 1 daily by circulation Bild writes here that the cold weather may be around even until Pentecost (mid-May)!
The German Weather Service (DWD) reports that March, 2013 was the 6th coldest in 132 years of measurements. The forecast for Germany calls for the cold weather to persist through the rest of the week. Nighttime temperatures will plummet to -10°C.
Some people think that the chances for a hot, sunny summer are higher after going through a long, cold winter. But meteorologist Karsten Brandt says this is not so. Bild writes:
Brandt is skeptical: ‘I can imagine brief, hot phases, but in many years  when the winters were cold, the summers were also not better.’“
If that’s the case this year, then Germany could wind up putting 2013 in the books as one of the coolest on record.
The situation is a disaster in Eastern Europe: “At least 100,000 people in Poland without power due to heavy snows…up to 30 centimeters of new snow. … Also in the Czech Republic and Slovakia up to 40 centimeters of new snow fell in 24 hours. … In Moscow a new snow record was set for the date…65 centimeters on the ground.”
German Weather Service: “Global warming is increasing”
Bild then asks ideologically warmist German Weather Service (DWD) meteorologist Christoph Hartmann if the cold winters mean global warming has stopped.

Bild: And what’s with global warming? Snow and frost in April. Is it now an ice age instead of global warming?”
Hartmann: No, it remains warming; global warming is increasing. One cold winter does not refute it. What happens in Germany or Europe has no significance for world climate.
Bild: Apparently climate warming is taking a break in Germany.
Hartmann: Between 1985 and 1995 the temperature rose continuously. But since then not much has happened. However, worldwide new high temperature values are measured every year.
Very sloppy terminology by Hartmann and poor reporting by Bild aside, we have to ask what impression the reader ends up getting here. “Global warming is increasing,” says Hartman. Warming means increasing temperature, and so increasing increasing temperature means accelerating temperature. Have the meteorologist at the DWD looked at any global data lately, say the last 15 years?
 
Where’s the accelerating temperature? (Source woodfortrees.org).
Not only does Hartmann use sloppy terminology, but his facts are completely wrong. Where are the “new high temperature values measured” every year? The trend is actually downwards over the last 10 years. Quality at the DWD has deteriorated to comic levels.

Chancellor Angela Merkel clashed vs. challenger Pier Steinbrück in yesterday’s only major televised campaign debate. Not once did the subject of climate change come up. Photo credits, Merkel: Alexander Kurz – CC-BY-SA-3.0 License; Steinbrück: SPD
But you would have never known it watching yesterday evening’s nationally televised campaign debate between incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel and challenger Pier Steinbrück. The debate was shown live by four major German networks as German voters get set to elect a new government on September 22, or to keep the one they now have. It’s the only debate scheduled between Angela Merkel of the conservative CDU party and Pier Steinbrück of the SPD socialist party.
The 90-minute debate was moderated by 4 media and television personalities and covered a variety of issues. Candidates fielded questions on issues ranging over every thing from the economy, jobs, pensions, health care, the euro crisis, Syria, foreign policy, taxes, Greece bailout, to name a few. Yet, not once were the candidates asked about the “greatest crisis facing humanity” – climate. In fact the word climate was not even uttered once by anyone! To add insult to injury, even minor issues such as day-care for toddlers and a proposed national toll for Germany’s autobahns were discussed. Climate? Absolute zero!
Major setback for climate activists

This is a major setback for the global warming alarmists who want to make climate change the central issue of our time, such as Professors Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber and Ottmar Edenhofer of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. If that doesn’t tell them where they really stand on the list of Germany’s priorities and the things that are really important for Germans, then they are living in a fantasy world. At Twitter, a number of German greens and activists grumbled bitterly that climate change had been ignored in the debate.
Renewable energies “a disaster”
Also the problems with Germany’s Energiewende (transition to renewable energy) and the associated skyrocketing prices were discussed briefly. Candidate Steinbrück called the management of the Energiewende “a disaster“, and that the best anyone could hope for now is to slow down the price increase.
No support for a US-led attack on Syria.
Concerning support for a US led attack on Syria, both candidates said outright they would not support an attack without UN approval.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday here I wrote about some comments made by Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber at a press release  last week on the first day of the World Conference on Climate Impacts in Potsdam Germany.

Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber confirms that oceans are a major factor in global temperature. Image source: www.climate-impacts-2013.org/.
While answering a question from a journalist about why global temperatures have stagnated over the last 15 years, Schellnhuber blamed the cool oceans for absorbing the heat that everyone is missing and searching for.
At around the 35-minute mark of the video, Prof. Schellnhuber tells us (my emphasis):
So what we probably see now is a sort of saturation of deeper ocean layers, …but once the job is done, the surface will warm once again, and even faster actually later on. This is by the way accompanied by, if you look at the data as I did this morning, you had many more La Nina events, that is the cool phase in the Pacific, in the last decade then you had in the previous decade. This is in a sense precisely in a La Nina event the oceans more or less take up heat while in an El Nino event they release heat. So just wait for the next big El Nino and we will have again a boost in global temperature.”
First it is clear that Prof. Schellnhuber doesn’t really know where the heat is, and is only assuming that it is hidden at the “deeper layers of the ocean“.
Secondly, and more importantly, he tells us that La Ninas take up heat from the atmosphere and that El Ninos release heat into the atmosphere. “So just wait for the next big El Nino and we will have again a boost in global temperature.” Clearly he is telling us that the oceans indeed do have a big impact on global temperature. So why hasn’t he included this in the models?
If Schellnhuber agrees that El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO) leave their mark on global temperature, then he cannot possibly deny that the PDO and AMO phases do the same. In cool phases they remove heat from the atmosphere, in warm phases they release heat into the atmosphere. Schellnhuber acknowledges this. We’ve been measuring this for decades now.
The following chart shows the PDO:

The positive PDO released gargantuan amounts of heat into the atmosphere from 1980 – 2006, a time when global temperature jumped 0.5°C. Chart source: Giorgiogp2, data from jisao.washington.edu/PDO.latest, the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
The chart above clearly shows that the massive equatorial Pacific was releasing mega-heat into the atmosphere from 1980 – 2007. This heats up the global atmosphere just as Prof. Schellnhuber describes above. The question is what factor got all the credit for that heat? The PIK and many warmist scientists wrongly assigned it to CO2. But now that the globe has stopped warming, they are blaming the oceans.
Why was the heat released by the 1980 – 2007 positive PDO not properly assigned in the climate models? No wonder the models look like jokes today. Schellnhuber needed the PDO heat in order to make CO2 look bad. It was the only way to come up with a dangerously high CO2 climate sensitivity.
The same applies with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO):

AMO climbed from 1975 until 2000. Public domain chart
So the heat that was added by the positive PDO and AMO since 1980 has to be subtracted from the CO2 account. If you do that, then you will see that CO2 climate sensitivity is far less, and is no longer a problem.
Good to see that Schellnhuber acknowledges the AMO and PDO. All he has to do now is build them into his climate models.

THIS IS A MUST READ if you live in a country that wants to mandate renewable energies.
Consumer advocates and aid organizations say the breaking point has already been reached. Today, more than 300,000 households a year are seeing their power shut off because of unpaid bills. Caritas and other charity groups call it “energy poverty.”
Lawmakers, on the other hand, have largely ignored the phenomenon. In the concluding legislative period, the government and opposition argued passionately over a €5 increase in payments to the long-term unemployed. But no one paid much attention…

Spiegel’s print edition cover story today features Snowden and Obama on the front cover:

This week’s SPIEGEL cover: “Alone against America. Edward Snowden: hero and traitor. How the US intelligence agency spied in Germany”.
Latest must read Spiegel story today here: www.spiegel.de/html. 
I keep hearing people like John Kerry, Diane Feinstein, Dick Cheney, Sarah Palin, etc. say that espionage is all part of the game, and are all trying to put the full blame for the debacle on a single man: Edward Snowden. Few of us are so naïve to believe that. The truth is that US intelligence has run totally amok. It is no longer even able to distinguish friend from foe.

One essential part of successful intelligence is at least first having the cerebral intelligence of being able to distinguish between your friends and foes. If you can’t do that, then soon everyone starts appearing like a foe, and everything runs amok very quickly. Perhaps Snowden felt this was the case, and could not take what he saw anymore. Intelligence operations are supposed to be aimed at real foes like Iran, North Korea, China, or Venezuela and Cuba. Maybe competitors like India, Russia… But if you start treating all your allies like foes, and go to town on them like the Stasi, then you are going to find yourself alone and isolated real fast. That unfortunately has now happened.
If it had not been Snowden, then it would soon have been someone else. If Washington was trying to shed its image that it is corrupt to the core, it didn’t do itself any favors with this affair. A country that spies on its own citizens and allies on such a massive scale needs to ask itself some serious questions.
In the 20+ years I find myself in Europe, I cannot recall any situation where trust between Europe and America has disintegrated so much and so rapidly. Europeans, once in love with Obama, are struggling and unable come to terms with the new Obama reality – that they are dealing with a real Chicago-style politician, and not with a well-intentioned community organizer.
Spiegel presents here has a list of 17 quotes made by German leaders in response to the affair.
So how much damage has Snowden done? Perhaps the question that needs to be asked is: How much damage has America’s strayed foreign policy done to itself? One of the virtues of a real patriot is to have the courage to stand up and to point out the faults of your country and to demand that they be fixed. Patriots are what America needs more than ever today, and not the sort who cluelessly wave the stars and stripes on cue.
Washington needs a serious house-cleaning. Denying and scapegoating a lowly contractor is not going to work this time.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Foundation for Freedom recently featured a speech by German journalist/author Michael Miersch, whose works often appear at FOCUS and who is a regular contributor at the Achse des Guten (Axis of the Good) blogsite. The title of his speech: “Courage for the Future”.
Rarely do I see a message delivered as powerfully as seen by Miersch here. Every young person in Germany should see this video.

Miersch tells us how that, by almost every measure, the world is a far better place today than is portrayed by Europe’s and Germany’s white-wine-sipping intellectuals.
In the clip, Miersch is first introduced by Spiegel journalist Alexander Neubacher, who brings up the Club of Rome book, “The Limits of Growth” and reminds the audience of some of the just utterly asinine predictions they made, and taken seriously by the public, 40 years ago.
Miersch, once a trendy pessimist journalist, became optimistic about the future in the 1990s and realized that German intellectuals have a completely disfigured, hopelessly pessimistic view of the world. What follows are some of the comments Miersch makes:
2.10: “For German intellectuals, optimism is a sort of American mental illness. This applies to journalists as well. Optimists are the ones with rose-colored glasses who don’t want to see just how horrible reality is: the American ‘think-positive’ gurus who either deny or are just plain uninformed.”
3.35: “Nothing sparks more outrage than optimism [in Europe].”
4:41: “I don’t view optimism for the future as an American mental illness, but as a justified life view.”
5.24: Miersch, once a trendy, pessimistic science journalist who believed all the end-of-the-world stories, tells how he turned optimist, inspired by a single innocent remark:
“One day in the 1990s in the springtime during an editorial meeting, in the middle of the city, the window was open and the song of a blackcap could be heard, to which a young intern completely inapproporiately said, ‘Hey listen, one of your extinct birds is out there tweeting again.’ The laughter triggered a sort of subversive effect and the blackcaps slowly began to change my mind.”
6.14: Miersch on his subsequent attempt by his magazine to report that things weren’t that bad, and what happens they reported good news to readers:
“…led to a wave of subscription cancellations, which quickly brought us on the list of endangered editors. It was clear that our subscribers didn’t want facts, and they begged for gloomy, hopeless, unsolvable disasters, and please, most of all, spare us the solutions.”
7.50: Miersch tells us the first law of the media: “Only bad news are news“.

8.00: Miersch then illustrates just how bad things have gotten in the media, citing a news report delivered German flagship ARD television, where the editors took good news and spun them into bad news. Miersch:
The news was actually good news: Life expectancy is rising, and not only in industrial countries, but also in developing countries. And how did the ARD News present this? ‘The global population is aging faster than ever!'”
8.25: He cites another media example, a headline about growing forest area in the Alps: “Forest growth threatens meadows!”
To illustrate the absurdity of the environmentalism, Miersch then tells the story of a reporter who showed how easy it is to get lots a people to sign a petition against “dihydrogen-monoxide” (H2O).
10.20: Miersch tells us that by all statistical measures, only one conclusion can be drawn: “The world is getting better – contrary to the impression conveyed by the media and newspapers.”
11.00 Miersch reminds the audience of the UN Millennium targets:
In the spring of 2012, the World Bank was able to announce that the most important Millenium target is already reached: the halving of global poverty by 2015. However, there were no headlines about this in Germany.”
11.50: Miersch tells the audience of the media reaction to the news from the MetOffice that global temperatures have stagnated: “This made front-page headlines in many papers in England, but in Germany there were no news about this.”
Miersch in his speech tells his audience that, no matter which measure you look at, the world’s ills are shrinking: war, mortality, disease, poverty, pollution, natural disasters, etc.. “This contradicts all the predictions from the intellectuals. There are even more polar bears today!”
14.20: Miersch then says that according to environmentalist ideology, communist East Germany should have developed into an ecological paradise:
No flights to Majorca, no kiwis from New Zealand, restricted individual mobility, no McDonalds, and highly restricted consumption. However what resulted was a huge garbage dump.”
16.35: Miersch says again that by any measure, the world is a far better place today, and that it is going to get better:
The world today could be better, and will be better if we just finally stopped bad-mouthing progress and viewing the human race as the plague of the planet. At its core, the green future-pessimistic and technologically hostile zeitgeist is an anti-humanistic ideology down to its roots. It’s only about restriction, limitation, and constant surveillance. Man is viewed as destructive and as a contaminator – in the best case as a consumer – and never as an inventor, creator.”

"The Italian photojournalist Federico Borella has won the top prize in the Sony World Photography Awards, including a $25,000 (£19,000) cash prize. His photo-series Five Degrees was commended by judges for sensitively documenting a little-known but tragic side-effect of climate change: male suicide among Indian farmers.  Borella is a photojournalist with over 10 years’ experience, who has worked across the world. In 2015, he embarked on a trip to India to photograph victims of acid attacks. While there, he became increasingly aware of extreme weather in India but wanted to tell the story in a different way. “I wanted to be able to show how our choices in the west affect people in places like India,” Borella said. “I felt obliged – but I didn’t want to produce cliched photos of desperate conditions in India. I wanted this to tell a personal story.” He set about researching and months later he stumbled across a paper from the University of California, Berkeley, documenting a correlation between climate change and almost 60,000 Indian farmers taking their own lives. “For me, this story spoke to the connection between environmental destruction and self-destruction. I felt obliged to tell it. I wanted to show how our choices in the west are having these huge consequences for people in the rest of the world, in terms of climate change.” His photographs, telling the story of a farming community in Tamil Nadu facing its worst drought in 140 years, were praised by the judges who said it instantly stood out as winner. The chair of judges Mike Trow, who was previously a picture editor for British Vogue, said Borella’s work was urgently needed, adding: “Borella documented this with incredible sensitivity, imagination and a direct aesthetic that we all agreed worked on a number of levels.” Borella wanted the photographs to speak to the absence created by suicide, and decided to photograph some of the widows, choosing a square format to create intimacy. Although it was his first time entering the competition, he was quietly confident because of the personal power of the stories he was capturing. “Of course it was a beautiful surprise when I got the call,” he said, adding “but as a journalist, you can recognise when you are really on to something that is outstanding. I really felt something about this project. I knew it had the possibility of raising huge awareness.” “Every story of every widowed woman was so intimate and so moving,” he said, talking about a woman whose husband killed himself in front of the bank whose loan he could not replay, by drinking the pesticide that he used for his crops.

"In my role as shadow minister for sustainable economics, I have spent the past year looking at what will be required of government to respond to the environmental calamity we are facing. It’s been pretty bleak, if I’m honest, as the deadly impacts scientists have long predicted have spiralled into a horror carousel of heatwaves and wildfires, floods and hurricanes, droughts and famines. For some the response is pessimism, fatalism and paralysis. In Dune, the main character declares: “The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.” With so little progress on climate, it’s little wonder we so fear what lies ahead. But two big rays of sunshine have broken through the clouds in recent months, dispelling the gloom and instilling a sense of renewed hope.  The youth strikers arrived on the climate politics scene in February like gatecrashers at a premature funeral, smashing in through the window in a shower of glass to announce to the hushed congregation that the patient is in fact still alive. Seeing these kids thronging the streets of Westminster and my own city of Norwich has been a thrilling and timely reminder of how real change happens. Meanwhile, the newly minted superstar congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the youth-led Sunrise Movement have busted open the tired assumptions of a hollowed-out US political system to demand good jobs and a liveable future, under the banner of a Green New Deal.  Friday’s declaration from the UK youth climate strikers calling for a Green New Deal in the UK brings these two strands together, and marks a shift from the oppositional to the propositional for the youth strikers. It is now up to all British politicians to heed their call. The time for incrementalism has passed. The young people striking today recognise this. They know that their only hope of a decent future is if government works with the people to throw everything we have got at this problem before it’s too late. But they also have the vision to see that the life-saving work of tackling climate change offers a golden chance to fix so many of the other things in our society and economy that decades of neoliberal dogma have broken. The youth strikers are calling for a government-led, 10-year mobilisation to completely modernise every aspect of our infrastructure and built environment, to reshape the public realm, restore threatened habitats and carbon sinks and prepare communities for the climate impacts we can no longer avoid. This epic transformation would create millions of good jobs across every corner of Britain, breathing new life into places that haven’t seen inward investment for decades. YouGov polling data released on Friday shows that these proposals are highly popular, enjoying more than two-thirds public support. People in Britain might not have heard of a Green New Deal yet, but they seem to really love the idea of it when they understand what it would mean in practice. Maybe Labour still isn’t entirely where it needs to be on this issue – but, with my encouragement, we are getting there fast. While the Conservatives dither, Jeremy Corbyn has committed to achieving net-zero emissions in the UK before the middle of the century. My boss, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is rewriting the Treasury rulebook to ensure all future public investment is green, and is looking at moving Britain towards a four-day working week, which could improve lives and reduce pressure on the environment. The Treasury under Labour would become the driver of positive environmental policy instead of a block in the system, working with each secretary of state to develop a departmental carbon budget alongside a financial budget at each spending review. Last month, the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, declared a climate and environment emergency in parliament, and the shadow business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has announced plans for a green industrial revolution that would see the UK lead the world in tidal energy, recapture our crown in offshore wind and recruit a carbon army of local workers to insulate millions of leaky homes. For those who say we can’t afford to do this, I say we can’t afford not to. Dealing with the horrors of unmitigated climate change will be incalculably more costly than intervening now to prevent them. It requires a massive public investment, but that would pay for itself many times over in the years ahead through the good quality work it would create. There are huge economic opportunities in renewable technologies and energy efficiency that are currently passing Britain by as a blinkered Tory government looks the other way. Money supply is quite literally the least of our worries. As Keynes said: “Anything we can actually do we can afford.” As the UK’s youth climate strikers geared up for their action on Friday, Theresa May was refusing to even meet the Nobel peace prize-nominee Greta Thunberg when she visits parliament later this month. My message to Thunberg and all of her British counterparts is simple: the Labour party’s door is open. We hear you, and we will work with you to do what needs to be done. • Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South"
"The global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and must take urgent steps to reform, the governors of the Bank of England and France’s central bank have warned, writing in the Guardian. In an article published in the Guardian on Wednesday aimed at the international financial community, Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, and François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France, said financial regulators, banks and insurers around the world had to “raise the bar” to avoid catastrophe. They said: “As financial policymakers and prudential supervisors we cannot ignore the obvious physical risks before our eyes. Climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a central role to play.” The warning comes as concern over the impact of climate change and the lack of urgent action is increasing, reflected in the Extinction Rebellion protests and schoolchildren’s strikes across the world. The heads of two of the world’s most influential central banks urged other financial regulators around the world to carry out climate change stress tests to spot any risks in the system, while also calling for more collaboration between nations on the issue. They warned that a “massive reallocation of capital” was necessary to prevent global warming above the 2°C maximum target set by the Paris climate agreement, with the banking system required to play a pivotal role. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” Carney and De Galhau said. Climate change poses significant risks to banks and insurers from rising instances of catastrophic weather-related events, such as heatwaves, droughts and floods, which could land them with significant losses. There are also risks for financial firms as governments accept the need to tackle climate change because banks that have lent to companies reliant on burning fossil fuels run the risk of steep financial losses. Carney has previously warned that plunging sales of diesel cars, due to new vehicle emissions tests and changes in the tax system, which have had knock-on effects for manufacturers and the wider economy, are an example of this in action. Banks could find they have stranded assets that turn out to be worthless if they are reliant on burning fossil fuels. Threadneedle Street has said as much as $20tn (£15.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change if it is not effectively addressed. The open letter from Carney and De Galhau accompanies the launch of a report from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an international group of central banks and financial regulators, outlining the steps necessary for financiers to tackle climate change. Global warming has typically been of secondary concern to central bankers since the 2008 financial crisis, as they grappled with the immediate threat of banking failures. However, there is growing recognition that action is needed to fight the risks it poses. Although they have received praise for advancing the debate about climate change, Carney, central bankers and financiers have been criticised for expecting the banking industry to reform itself without tougher regulation being introduced. Frank van Lerven, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: “Central banks across the world, and in the UK, have done a very good job of identifying the problem. The question is whether they have the right balance between being thought leaders on this issue and identifying problems and taking action.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMarc Morano of Climate Depot presents his written testimony at the Congressional Hearing on Climate Change in Fairview, West VA of May 30, 2013. This represents just the latest milestone on how far the global warming science has collapsed in the face of growing scientific skepticism over the recent years.
Ten years ago and more, the scales were actually tipped completely in favor of the warmists. The theory of man-made global warming at the time was rather new to the public and seemed plausible. The planet had just seen a couple of decades of strong warming, and it all appeared to fit together. Yet, much of the science was still poorly understood, and, as is always the case in science, skepticism refused to let go.
In the beginning the number of skeptic voices represented only a small and cautious minority – only a few scientists and blogsites were actively challenging the theory. By the early and mid 2000s, serious challenges began mounting. For example Steve McIntyre exposed Michael Mann’s hockey stick as a worthless statistical artifact, Michael Crichton had written a bestselling thriller critical of global warming, and skeptic blogs capable of reaching broad audiences were beginning to communicate skeptical science and findings. The skeptics grew in numbers, yet resembled more a disorganized motley crew who possessed limited public communication power.
But that changed in the late 2000s. Suddenly the Earth had stopped warming for 10 years, winters turned harsh, and lots of skeptic blogs were coming online and piling on. That the IPCC 4AR of 2007 was riddled with errors, exaggerations, and relied on a lot of gray literature had become clear and thus seriously damaged the UN body. The IPCC was humiliated and on the defensive.
The release of the Climategate e-mails and failure of the Copenhagen Conference made the situation even more desperate for the warmists. Claims of broad agreement on the science were exposed as having been premature and wildly exaggerated. The science was coming apart. All that was left was to effectively communicate that reality to the public.
Expert communicator Marc Morano routs the warmists
The effective communication of skeptical science got a major boost when Marc Morano stepped onto the stage. Although Morano had already been active in debunking the AGW scare and the notion of consensus as Communications Director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee under Senator James Inhofe in the 2000s, it wasn’t until he published his award-winning Climate Depot climate science/news clearinghouse site in 2009 that the message began to be heard in earnest.
With Morano, the science debunking the AGW claim had now found a powerful and talented PR expert who effectively communicated the inconvenient climate science findings to the media and public. Often we find Morano on television, radio and in the print media, nationally and internationally. Since Morano helped fire up the climate science communication machinery, the debate for the skeptics has turned into a virtual rout of the warmists.
In his written congressional testimony, Morano writes “that on virtually every claim — from A-Z — the claims of the promoters of man-made climate fears are failing, and in many instances the claims are moving in the opposite direction. The global warming movement is suffering the scientific death of a thousand cuts.” He adds “these are not good times for the promoters of global warming” and “the idea that CO2 is the tail that wags the dog is no longer scientifically tenable.”
Just how bad have things gotten for the global warming scientists? Morano adds in his testimony:

Gore and the UN IPCC are now reduced to pointing to every storm, flood, hurricane or tornado as proof of man-made global warming. The UN has been reduced to blaming man-made global warming for prostitution. See: Climate Astrology — ‘It Has Been Foretold’ of Extreme Weather: ‘UN IPCC science has a status similar to interpretations of Nostradamus and the Mayan calendars’ & Climate Astrology borrows from the past: ‘Before That Witch Moved Into The Neighborhood, We Never Had Bad Weather Or Disease’.”
Morano adds later on:
UN IPCC scientist Kevin Trenberth has said every weather event now influenced by global warming. […] They are turning themselves into anti-science activists. […] Their theory that somehow the weather is unusual that we have a ‘new normal’ — not only does it fail to convince — it becomes a laughing stock when you start actually looking at the hard data’.”
Not only have climate scientists and CO2 activists desperately used single weather events to defend their crumbling science, they also have spent the last years trying to launch smear campaigns against the skeptics, claiming they are massively funded by Big Oil, Koch Industries and coal. This is only a diversion from the real debate and scientific data.
In truth the warmists and global warming activists have been showered with billions in funding, compared to only a few million finding their way to the hands of skeptics in recent years. So why are the skeptics drubbing the warmists in the debate, even though they are outfunded thousands to one? It’s called: focusing on the scientific data. Period.
Smear jobs, weather claims, appeals to authority, and models in the end are admissions of defeat.
In his testimony, Morano sticks to the science, citing almost 2 dozen renowned international scientists, e.g.: Bengtsson, de Freitas, Plimer, Svensmark, Happer, Schmitt, Levitin, Curry, Christy, Pielke Jr., to name some. In the testimony, we do not see Morano using the diversionary tactic of questioning the billions in funding behind warmists scientists and activist groups. Keep the focus on the science and data!
On energy Morano reminds Congress that coal and “other carbon based forms of energy have been one of the greatest liberators of mankind in the history of our planet. Is it greedy to want heat, A/C, lower infant mortality, longer life expectancy? Coal is the moral choice.” Little wonder one coal power plant is coming online every week in China and that even green Germany is burning more coal once again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe ever excellent Achse Des Guten (Axis of the Good) has what is probably one of the most stinging criticisms of the solar industry I’ve read to date (and I’ve read some awfully harsh ones up to now). The latest is authored by Dr. Wolfram Weimer, a leading German publisher of news and economics magazines.

Wolfram Weimer calls Germany’s solar subsidies “a capital destroyer of historic dimensions”. Photo credit: Reto Klar, FOCUS, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
His latest piece is titled: Das sozialistische Solar-Desaster (The Socialist Solar Disaster). German solar energy and the EEG renewable feed-in act, once hailed as examples for the rest of the world to follow, are described by Weimer as a sure road to economic ruin.
Any country or state leader considering following the path of Germany may want to contact Weimer first. It may save you billions.
Over the past two years, dozens of German solar manufacturers have been shuttered, among them big ones like Solon, Q-Cells, Solar Millenium and Conergy. Recently electrical engineering giant Bosch announced that its solar operations had lost 1 billion euros, read here.
Recently German solar leader Solarworld reported it was on the brink of insolvency, drowning in billions of red ink, and that its high-flying CEO Frank Asbeck was begging the country of Qatar for a bailout.
The overall result under the bottom line for the German solar industry, despite all the massive subsidies, is devatstation. Weimar writes (my emphasis):
More than 100 billion euros in solar power subsidies have been wasted, and not a single target of the transition to solar energy has been reached. […}

A chain reaction of insolvencies and bankruptcies litters the landscape, more than 30,000 jobs have been lost. […] The German solar industry has in the meantime become a capital destroyer of historic dimensions. […]
The existing solar socialism shows where this is all headed – to a world of bankruptcies, rising electricity rates and panhandling trips to Qatar.”
Weimer writes that subsidizing industries is the sure way to ruin them.
In many fields of machine building, Germany is the global leader. And it is precisely in the fields where billions in forced payments are mobilized does one become a loser.
The solar ruin did not happen despite the subsidies, but it was because of them that it turned into a disaster. It is the very combination of eco-ideology and central planning methods that assured the collapse.
The state robs the market of the possibility to develop cheaper and more competitive power generation. Instead green bureaucrats decide what share each different type of energy is to have. Like in the five-year plans of the Soviets, quotas, targets, and amounts are prescribed inside central ministries. This ecological central planning and its subsidy monopoly continuously erodes away the market price mechanisms.”
For readers who are interested in finding out more about the total  failures of subsidzed renewable energy, you’ll find dozens of posts I’ve written over the last couple of years in the right side bar under: Categories – Alternative Energies.
Meanwhile leaders from 35 nations are now meeting in Petersberger in Berlin in order to find ways to get the whole world to embark on the “road to ruin”.

"This morning two very different kinds of harbingers brought us a message of climate doom. One was a colourful crowd of climate activists called Extinction Rebellion, who have been blocking traffic in London for the last two days, and who are today planning further “economic disruption” aimed directly at the city’s jugular: the tube and rail networks. The other was less expected. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, along with the governor of France’s central bank, Villeroy de Galhau, has written an article for the Guardian warning banks and insurers that climate change threatens them too. In the wallet. Insurance claims from droughts and floods are bad for business. Then there’s the fact that governments are now taking carbon emissions seriously, which means companies that don’t adjust will likely be adjusted out of existence. And at a certain point, when climate catastrophe deepens, there will be a “Minsky moment” – a sudden collapse in asset prices, true economic disruption.  It feels like an important moment, this joining together of the solemn and besuited with the members of a group last seen supergluing their arses to the gallery glass in the House of Commons. It amplifies the message. Tackling climate change is, after all, about psychology. How should one talk about catastrophe? Make a problem too big and people will simply ignore it (just look at Brexit). Tell them it is too late, and the human instinct is to give up, rather than make vast efforts to save the scraps. And guilt doesn’t work on most people either – they are too wrapped up in their daily concerns. This is true of institutions too: David Cameron’s government was keen on green measures for a while, but only until something more important came along. But there are certain milestones movements can hit, when it feels as if they are on their way. One is that they become cool. This happened to the modern feminist movement around the time Caitlin Moran’s book How to Be a Woman hit the shelves in 2011. It has gradually happened to climate activism too. Veganism is no longer something to sneer at. Celebrities who might have once tried to avoid looking too “hempy” now fall over themselves to burnish their climate credentials. But an even more important milestone – when you know the movement has really picked up speed – comes when it directly threatens those in power. For feminism, again, this was #MeToo: the fear it has inspired among powerful men has done more for equality than decades of gentle awareness raising and women-friendly schemes. And now Carney is framing climate change in a language banks understand: as a threat to profits. It will add to other messages reaching the city. Five Volkswagen executives face up to a decade in prison for their role in faked diesel emission tests – a scandal that has also taken a chunk out of car sales. The investor Legal and General is cutting out companies they judge bad for the climate. For the planet, a turning point might just be at hand. • Martha Gill is a political journalist and former lobby correspondent"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreen Radio of the Umweltbundesamt – UBA – (German Federal Department of the Environment) recently had a radio interview with Henrik Kirchhof, some climate expert for the UBA I guess. Topic: Why has there been no warming in 15 years? 
The German government finally concedes.
The host of the interview starts by telling the audience that “climate scientists have come under pressure because the average temperature indeed has not risen in 15 years“. Kirchhof:
In the years leading up to the year 2000, the temperature curve rose very sharply. But since then it isn’t rising so, in fact it’s not rising at all, the curve. The average temperature has stagnated at a very high level – we sort of have a plateau, and that during a time when CO2 emissions have risen considerably.”
Kirchhof then claims the 15-year period of stagnation is indeed relatively short, and, to add authority to this, Prof. Jochem Marotzke of the warmist Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg provides an audio comment:
What we are seeing here is a relatively short-term fluctuation, If one really wants to know how CO2 and global temperature are related, then you have to look at a longer time period.”
Marotzke refuses to say how long, though. We do know that CO2 was at about 280 ppm for 1000 years before the Industrial Revolution, and that during this time the global temperature fluctuated more than 1°C (in sync with solar activity). Of course Marotzke only wants to go back to 1900, as beyond that there is no correlation with CO2.
Kirchhof then adds (my emphasis):
…there is no doubt about the greenhouse effect, but even so this warming pause is remarkable because the climate scientists with all their models did not expect this.”
At this point Kirchhof of Green radio of the German Federal Department of the Environment are finally admitting that there are suddenly many more unknowns than they first thought, that the warmist scientists are indeed baffled, and that the science is not settled after all.
At the 2-minute mark, a somewhat surprised host is forced to ask how can it be that the temperature has not risen even though more CO2 is being emitted into the atmosphere. Here Kirchhof, in summary, admits they don’t know why:
Yeah, that’s the big question. The scientists here are not completely sure. But there are many possible explanations.”
Many possible explanations? That means they don’t have freaking clue! When it comes to complex systems like climate, it takes years and years of analyses and observation to untangle it all. Kirchhof (my emphasis):
A big role may be played by the oceans, which possibly are absorbing more heat, and so the additional heat is no longer being taken up by the atmosphere but instead is moving into the water. This can be measured. However if these surface water temperatures increased sharply until 15 years ago but now have stagnated, then it means that the ocean is absorbing more heat than it did before. You can suspect this, it’s very plausible, but you cannot prove it because of methodology reasons, says Jochem Marotzke.”
Marotzke:
The problem is, although it is plausible, and it is in principle in agreement with model calculations, the problem is that we do not have enough good measurements from the past to say: ‘Ah, back then the deep oceans absorbed less heat and today it is taking in more heat. These observations are simply missing.”
It makes us wonder with so much missing data and so many unknowns, how could they even have dared to think the science was settled a few years ago? Suddenly they tell us they don’t know squat, that they are completely baffled, and that they are scrambling for explanations!

The host then asks Kirchhof if there are other possible explanations. Kirchhof:
Yes. For example they have measured that the stratosphere has gotten drier. And when there is less water vapor up there in the stratosphere, then less heat is radiated back down. However, the scientists who have found this out have themselves said this effect is too small and only accounts for a quarter of the stopped warming.”
They can’t find the heat. Unknowns, mysteries, surprises…such is the life of a closed-minded climate scientist. But apart from all that, they are sure of the science.
The host then asks about the remaining three quarters of the heat. Kirchhof plays the aerosol card, which the IPCC loves to play whenever cooling isn’t supposed to happen, like from 1945 to 1975:
Yes. there’s also a third theory that sounds plausible for laypeople, namely that more dust particles, ‘dirt’ in everyday terms, is high up in the atmosphere. As a result, less solar radiation reaches the Earth and so as a whole it gets cooler.”
Kirchhof then goes on to say that Chinese and Indian power plants may be to blame for this, and says that polluting the atmosphere is not the way to solve climate change.
The host then brings up the excellent question of how long a pause in warming is necessary before climate scientists really have to rethink their science. Kirchhof:
There are in fact prognoses that this plateau could go on another five years, and if that indeed occurs, and meteorologist Jochem Marotzke also says the same, then there is something seriously wrong with the models, also when certain fluctuations cannot be precisely forecast.”
Five more years and all their arguments will disappear. And in ten years the climate scientists are going to be left standing there looking like total asses – because it’s not going to get warmer for another 30 years. The PDO, AMO and sun are all now beginning their cold phases simultaneously. One only needs to look at the past winters to see the first indications. If one major volcano blows then we are very likely back to the Little Ice Age conditions of the 17th century.
========================================
UPDATE: Meteorologist Joe Bastardi just tweeted: “IF THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE 1950S THEY WOULD SEE THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR
THEIR BLUNDER”
========================================
The models would have had much better results had the scientists taken the ocean cycles into account. But they refused to consider them because the warming that occurred from 1980 to 2000 would have had to be assigned in part to the warm phase of the ocean cycles, and correspondingly less so for CO2. The scientists were too obsessed with blaming every warming on CO2. Result: the climate scientists are left standing on the verge of humiliation today. All this is explained in detail by Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning in their book: Die kalte Sonne.
It should therefore come as no surprise that the only model that is correct today so far is the one proposed by Lüning and Vahrenholt, who took ocean and solar cycles into account. The UBA would do the German taxpayers a huge favor by reading this book.
Also crackpot scientists out there should really think twice before opening up their big, alarmist mouths in the near future. Us skeptics aren’t going to let you off the hook by any means in 5 years time. Whether you get tarred and feathered in 2020 depends on what you say today. Do you really want to become the David Viners and Mojib Latifs of the future?
Amazingly, the alarmist scientists are looking at everything except what’s really obvious: the sun. Solar activity during the 20th century was at it’s highest level in 500 or more years, but today it is at its lowest level in some 200 years. Gee, you think that could matter? The data clearly show that it did in the past.
To sum it up, it is amusing to see the UBA all baffled, surprised, and now scurrying for explanations. My feeling is that unless certain people smarten up real quick, there is going to be a lot to laugh about in the years ahead.

"As the top Republican on a congressional climate change committee, Louisiana’s Garret Graves is a surprising pick. Other Republicans on the Democrat-initiated panel have publicly doubted climate change science. Donald Trump has called global warming a hoax and the party as a whole is seen by many as an obstacle to tackling climate change. But not Graves. The third-term lawmaker sees rising temperatures as a direct and urgent threat to his state and district, which stretches from the capital, Baton Rouge, to the Gulf coast. He acknowledges fossils fuels are heating the planet, though he thinks Democrats’ plans to quickly shift away from them are unrealistic, and he hasn’t yet offered alternative proposals of his own.  Speaking in his Capitol Hill office – with signed football helmets for both Louisiana State University and the New Orleans Saints behind him – Graves chooses his words carefully. He leans over occasionally to whisper to his press aide about the most diplomatic way to phrase a thought, a skill that will be critical to his mission. “Years ago I said that I thought the Republican position on climate change is unsustainable,” Graves said. “Just sitting around totally denying the science is an unsustainable position.” Given his home state, Graves’s deviation from his party is perhaps not surprising. Louisiana is losing a football field of land every 100 minutes as its shoreline is sinking and seas are rising – a reality Graves can’t ignore. Damage from hurricanes and more intense flooding are already costing the state. Graves said people worried about climate change could emphasize conservation, efficiency and innovation, which he sees as Republican principles. They could talk about cutting electricity bills, rather than just cutting emissions. They could focus on proposals that wouldn’t undercut US competitiveness, which he said Trump is “laser-focused” on promoting. “We can be talking about the exact same thing but explaining it differently,” he said. Graves supports planning to adapt to climate change and to protect people from its worst effects. He wants to prepare Louisiana for a changed world. Graves once introduced an amendment to count his state’s Cajuns as an endangered species to overcome regulatory hurdles to coastal restoration efforts. And he acknowledges pollution reductions are also necessary. But at the same time, he represents an oil and gas state. He declined to specify how much or how quickly he thinks the US should cut fossil fuel use or say whether natural gas should ever be phased out. More and more Republicans may find themselves walking that fine line, as Americans see climate change in daily life and Democrats aim to make it a 2020 election issue. Graves said he accepted the committee position on the issue so he could ensure that Congress is planning for the risks Louisiana is already facing. He likens the idea of fighting climate change without also preparing for it, to standing on railroad tracks facing a swiftly approaching train. He said he found Trump receptive to planning for extreme weather when he talked to him at a bill signing ceremony at the White House. “The president is a numbers person. When you look at Harvey, Maria, Michael, Florence, you look at what’s happening in the midwest right now with the rivers … the president doesn’t deny the economics of making principled flood protection strategies,” he said. Graves, 47, was appointed by a Republican governor to run the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, where he negotiated with oil company BP over damages from the Gulf oil spill. Graves was born near the bayou but loves the mountains. His children are named after favorite peaks. In 1990, he stopped eating meat as part of a bet when he was at a base camp. He outlasted his friends, eventually adding back in seafood because he said there’s “only so much tofu and cottage cheese” a person can eat, particularly in Louisiana. But even though he stands out in the Republican party, he is hardly likely to embrace such Democratic policies as the Green New Deal (GND) any time soon. On the committee, Graves said Republicans plan to push Democrats to consider the costs and effectiveness of specific proposals, and he criticized the GND that many Democratic presidential contenders have endorsed as “utopian”. Despite Graves’s love of nature, he still got a 0 out of 100 on the League of Conservation Voters’ scorecard. The oil and gas industry is huge to Louisiana. And the “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that Graves and House Republican leaders promote includes burning natural gas, which is less damaging than coal but still heats the planet. Asked when the US might transition away from natural gas, Graves said “that’s crystal ball material” and that “natural gas is going to play a vital role in our energy policy for decades”. He thinks the international Paris agreement – which Trump plans to exit – would have been bad for US competitiveness because China and India will keep burning coal. But on the core science behind global warming Graves has little doubt. Even if the US used only renewable power starting next year, he said “the seas are still going to rise, according to climate models. And the temperature’s going to get warmer, according to climate models.”"
"When Mark Carney sounded a klaxon on Wednesday, the blare was unmistakable; yet it was as polite and moderately voiced an alarm as you might expect from the leader of an institution at the heart of the establishment. The governor of the Bank of England and his French counterpart warned that the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change. Writing in the Guardian, they told companies: “Fail to adjust … fail to exist.”.  There could hardly be a greater contrast than between Mr Carney’s intervention and the thousands of Extinction Rebellion activists disrupting central London and other cities worldwide. Earlier this month they grabbed attention by supergluing themselves to the public gallery in the House of Commons, semi-naked. Mr Carney is unlikely to shed his suit for the cause. But the activists’ peaceful campaign of civil disobedience is essentially a louder, brighter, less genteel version of the same essential message: “This is an emergency.”  Who is more likely to save us? Even supporters of Extinction Rebellion have voiced doubt about specific tactics, including the intention to use mass arrests as leverage for change. But a bigger debate underlies these. It has dogged the activism from which the movement explicitly draws inspiration, including the suffragettes and the civil rights movement in the US. The question is whether real change is achieved on the streets or in the corridors of power; whether moderates or militants prevail; and whether progress is made through careful negotiation and the pursuit of acceptable compromises, or radical demands which rupture the status quo. The truth is that both are needed. Young people have led the way. The 1.4 million who took part in last month’s school strikes have grown up learning that climate change is a fact, not a theory; it is built into their worldview. They know that they will pay the price for our inaction. They bat away excuses. That sense of impatience always pushes social change, but is all the more critical in this case, when every delay increases the risk of disaster. But their urgency is felt more broadly. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, was an early backer of Extinction Rebellion. An 80-year-old woman locked herself to the bottom of a lorry because, she said, “I refuse to leave a barren and broken world for my beautiful grandchildren.” Even inconvenienced drivers have voiced support. The shift can be seen at an institutional level too. Businesses are waking up to the costs, financial and physical, of the changes. Whether for reasons of strategy, sympathy or both, the police approach to these largely white and middle-class protesters has been unusually light-touch: hundreds of arrests, but made gradually, and with plenty of amicable chat on the sidelines. Yet most politicians remain shockingly timid. Labour’s declaration of a climate emergency and promise of a “green industrial revolution” is encouraging; on Wednesday protesters chained themselves to a fence outside Jeremy Corbyn’s house, saying they hoped to persuade him to go further. True, voters who voice alarm at rising temperatures can be equally vocal about rising fuel prices. But the public mood is shifting. Though the climate change deniers are entrenched, and have drawn encouragement from the election and actions of Donald Trump, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and others, the alarm about global warming is rising worldwide. According to Pew research, Britons now list it as the top threat to the UK. The evidence is mounting, and each grain of it is more alarming. The changes are felt, as well as read about, in the form of heatwaves, storms and other extreme weather. There is nothing moderate about the approaching catastrophe. Adaptation to rising temperatures is inevitable; accommodation with the forces fuelling them will be disastrous. Social movements exert pressure on internal processes of change, which are inherently incremental and cautious. That parts of the establishment are now pressing for action on climate change is critical. That others are pushing from the outside is at least equally so."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately desperate global warming-obsessed scientists have been claiming that the recent cold winters are more evidence of global warming. Cold is caused by warming, they now insist.

Source: www.woodfortrees.org/trend
Well, why stop at just the last few winters? Let’s look at the whole planet over the whole year, and do so for the last 10 years. Doing so, I’ve found solid proof of global warming!
The plotted anomaly goes from .47 to .38°C over 10 years. That’s a drop of 0.09°C, which translates to about 1°C of cooling per century. That means the year 2100 will be back to Little Ice Age conditions. The warming is worse than we thought.
Of course, crackpot warmists will say that 10 years is not enough, that is unless the trend is the other way. Heck, for them one single storm is already enough for proof, let alone a few winters.

"When I was arrested I did not hear most of the words of the police caution. I was being led from the front wheel of a deportation charter flight that I’d helped blockade at Stansted airport in March 2017. There were 15 of us in total, four around the wheel and 10 around a tripod behind the left wing. One of our number had been arrested before locking on. As an officer put handcuffs on me and walked me to the waiting bus, he started to arrest me. “I am arresting you on suspicion of aggravated trespass. You do not have to say anything – ”. When I rounded the corner, glimpsing the collection of my fellow activists, who I’d not seen since we’d cut through the fence many hours before, we all cheered, obscuring the words. Once I was arrested though, and sat alone in a police cell for hours on end, those cheers rang hollow. When we were released, and eventually charged with a terrorism-related offence – one carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment – that jubilance was replaced by endless worry, stress and pain.  Today, and in the coming days, weeks and months, hundreds – perhaps thousands – of activists hope to be arrested. Some hope to go to prison. They are part of Extinction Rebellion, a group seeking urgent action on climate change in the 12 years we have left to avert cataclysmic ecological breakdown. As part of their International Rebellion, they are seeking to “shut down” areas of central London today for as long as possible to “disrupt the ‘business as usual’ which is sending our species on a one way track to extinction”. These are laudable and righteous aims, ones that I agree with. There is no doubt in my mind that we need to move faster on climate change. Nor is there any doubt that most people would quite like to avoid a mass extinction event. Underneath it all, though, I can’t help but feel deeply concerned. In a recent video for the Guardian, the founder of the group, Roger Hallam, tells a police officer that “arrests aren’t happening quickly enough”. Later, he’s seen telling a town hall meeting that “letters, emailing, marches don’t work. You need about 400 people to go to prison. About two to three thousand people to be arrested.” After a blood-pouring action outside Downing Street, protesters bemoaned the lack of arrests. In a recent article, one protester talks about giving up their training as a dancer to devote their full time to activism. There’s undoubtedly something sexy about direct action. As activists we spend our life trying to agitate for change in a system built to resist it. Wins are rare, and the day-to-day grind of trying to transform the world into a better place – one that works for everyone – bears down on all of us. To take part in something material, that feels real, as if you’re actually doing something, is overwhelmingly attractive. But the reality is, direct action and becoming entombed in the endless bureaucracy of our glacial criminal justice system because of it, should make up only a tiny portion of our work as activists. There is an inherent privilege in being able to be arrested for protesting. The hugely disproportionate number of BAME people in prisons for relatively minor offences shouldn’t be underestimated here. To have people like Roger Hallam speaking of prison so casually undermines those who are the poorest or most oppressed in our society whose lives are ripped apart by it. There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t feel guilty about our trial and subsequent conviction (no pun intended). Not because what we did was wrong – far from it. But because even though 11 people remain in Britain because of our action, the two years that followed the action saw an unfathomable amount of resources, time, money and energy from across the movement poured into helping us fight our case, to helping us stay afloat, and avoid a life incarcerated. It took valuable resources away from those at the sharp edges of the hostile environment that we were protesting about. This is the issue with Extinction Rebellion’s ethos. The notion that 2,000 arrests will evoke the kind of systemic change needed to fight climate change is naive at best. At a time when the government has cracked down on protest, to not see that this could go the other way, and be used simply as a way of increasing already draconian anti-protest legislation and prosecutions, is shortsighted and irresponsible. But beyond that, the cost to individual activists, and the movement as a whole, would be huge. That so many people are involved and excited about activism is great – but we must be wary of glorifying arrests and incarceration as the only valid way of engaging with a movement. A movement, particularly one seeking to change society as we know it, should not be a coterie of privileged activists who can afford the expense and time getting arrested.  It should be about as many people as possible being brought on board. About making noise from all parts of society that’s so deafening, there is no option for those in power but to listen to our demands. It remains a mystery how wrapping up a whole new generation of activists in lengthy and costly court battles will achieve the changes we so urgently need. • Ben Smoke is a freelance journalist and activist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRight now as I write in Germany we are having nice comfortable summer weather with temps in the 20s C (70s F). But that is set to change today as a couple of hot days are in store. Here’s the forecast for my area:

North Germany is set for a very brief heat wave (1 day!). Source: www.wetter24.de
So this heat wave they are talking about is going to be a whole one and half days long, at least in the area I live. I think this is not even long enough to qualify it as  a “heat wave”. Granted for Southern and Eastern German areas the forecasts indicates much warmer temperatures. Here’s the forecast for Munich:

Munich forecast: Source: www.wetter24.de
But this is not something you wouldn’t expect to happen here in the summertime. Yet, llistening to the media and some climate scientists, you’d think the world is coming to an end, that the heat waves are more and more frequent than ever, and that Europe will soon burn up.

For example Express.de here warns of “horror heat”.
With all the heat in the headlines, we ask ourselves just how has 2013 been so far in Germany? Surely it will probably go down in the books as “one of the hottest on record!“.
Looking at the end of month reports from Germany’s DWD Deutsche Wetterdienst (German Weather Service), we find the monthly anomalies as to the 1981 – 2010 reference period. They are as follows:
January: -0.3°C
February: -1.8°C
March: -4.1°C
April: -0.1°C
May: -1.3°C
June: 0.0°C
July: +1.5°C
The average anomaly is -0.87°C, i.e. almost a full degree below normal. Only July was warmer than normal this year.
So tell me what has been more frequent this year, heat waves or cold snaps? It may turn out that we’ll get a few warm months and wind up with an average year, or even one that is a bit warmer than normal. This is because we have a factor out there that we used to call “weather”.
One thing is sure: Europe is not burning up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow far off have climate scientists been in projecting the future of our climate – winter in particular? They and their “models” couldn’t have gotten it more wrong!
Ten years ago they were telling us to forget seeing snow in the wintertime in the future. Now we are seeing tons of the stuff in the wintertime – and spring as well!
Reader and contributor “Jimbo” sent me a link to a report out of Saudi Arabia, a country famous for its heat and desert (my emphasis):
Saudi city covered with snow following unrelenting weather
Saudi Arabia’s northwestern city of Hael was covered with snow Sunday after almost three days of unrelenting weather conditions, according to Al Arabiya correspondents.
A number of provinces in the kingdom have been hit with floods and hailstones as temperatures dropped dramatically.
People have posted pictures on Twitter and other social networking sites showing snow allegedly taken in Saudi Arabia’s Hael.”
Unfortunately, the western climatically-correct media are just too embarrassed to bring us these news because they totally believed the global warming hoax. For years they told us that the whole world, and even the polar regions, could turn into a giant Saudi Arabia. Now, Saudi Arabia has turned polar instead (at least for a couple of days)! You just couldn’t possibly get it any wronger.
In the US, there are lots of news about snow falling across the Midwest, with some parts getting a foot or more of the stuff children weren’t ever supposed to know about.

Jimbo also provides us with a link to snow in Spain:
26 regions in Spain are under snow following an unprecedented snowfall over the weekend, reported Voice of Russia. Roads have been closed to traffic as snow thickness reaches 20 centimeters in some areas.”
A stunned reporter writes:
Also unbelievable sight are beaches under snow.”
Gee, kids won’t know what sand at the beach is anymore. A few days ago there were also reports of snow falling in Germany as well.
Isn’t it amazing how far off climate models can be? We weren’t supposed to see snow anymore, not even in the dead of winter, and now we are seeing it in late spring! Even the most sketpical among us could never have imagined the models botching it this badly. Just goes to show who is in control of the weather: Mother Nature! (and not some obscure gas molecule).
The “climate scientists” have to be beginning to feel like total idiots by now.

"Had we put as much effort into preventing environmental catastrophe as we’ve spent on making excuses for inaction, we would have solved it by now. Everywhere I look, I see people engaged in furious attempts to fend off the moral challenge it presents. The commonest current excuse is this: “I bet those protesters have phones/go on holiday/wear leather shoes.” In other words, we won’t listen to anyone who is not living naked in a barrel, subsisting only on murky water. Of course, if you are living naked in a barrel we will dismiss you too, because you’re a hippie weirdo. Every messenger, and every message they bear, is disqualified on the grounds of either impurity or purity.  As the environmental crisis accelerates, and as protest movements like YouthStrike4Climate and Extinction Rebellion make it harder not to see what we face, people discover more inventive means of shutting their eyes and shedding responsibility. Underlying these excuses is a deep-rooted belief that if we really are in trouble, someone somewhere will come to our rescue: “they” won’t let it happen. But there is no they, just us. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The political class, as anyone who has followed its progress over the past three years can surely now see, is chaotic, unwilling and, in isolation, strategically incapable of addressing even short-term crises, let alone a vast existential predicament. Yet a widespread and wilful naivety prevails: the belief that voting is the only political action required to change a system. Unless it is accompanied by the concentrated power of protest – articulating precise demands and creating space in which new political factions can grow – voting, while essential, remains a blunt and feeble instrument. The media, with a few exceptions, is actively hostile. Even when broadcasters cover these issues, they carefully avoid any mention of power, talking about environmental collapse as if it is driven by mysterious, passive forces, and proposing microscopic fixes for vast structural problems. The BBC’s Blue Planet Live series exemplified this tendency. Those who govern the nation and shape public discourse cannot be trusted with the preservation of life on Earth. There is no benign authority preserving us from harm. No one is coming to save us. None of us can justifiably avoid the call to come together to save ourselves. I see despair as another variety of disavowal. By throwing up our hands about the calamities that could one day afflict us, we disguise and distance them, converting concrete choices into indecipherable dread. We might relieve ourselves of moral agency by claiming that it’s already too late to act, but in doing so we condemn others to destitution or death. Catastrophe afflicts people now and, unlike those in the rich world who can still afford to wallow in despair, they are forced to respond in practical ways. In Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, devastated by Cyclone Idai, in Syria, Libya and Yemen, where climate chaos has contributed to civil war, in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador,, where crop failure, drought and the collapse of fisheries have driven people from their homes, despair is not an option. Our inaction has forced them into action, as they respond to terrifying circumstances caused primarily by the rich world’s consumption. The Christians are right: despair is a sin. As the author Jeremy Lent points out in a recent essay, it is almost certainly too late to save some of the world’s great living wonders, such as coral reefs and monarch butterflies. It might also be too late to prevent many of the world’s most vulnerable people from losing their homes. But, he argues, with every increment of global heating, with every rise in material resource consumption, we will have to accept still greater losses, many of which can still be prevented through radical transformation. Every nonlinear transformation in history has taken people by surprise. As Alexei Yurchak explains in his book about the collapse of the Soviet Union – Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More – systems look immutable until they suddenly disintegrate. As soon as they do, the disintegration retrospectively looks inevitable. Our system – characterised by perpetual economic growth on a planet that is not growing – will inevitably implode. The only question is whether the transformation is planned or unplanned. Our task is to ensure it is planned, and fast. We need to conceive and build a new system based on the principle that every generation, everywhere has an equal right to enjoy natural wealth. This is less daunting than we might imagine. As Erica Chenoweth’s historical research reveals, for a peaceful mass movement to succeed, a maximum of 3.5% of the population needs to mobilise. Humans are ultra-social mammals, constantly if subliminally aware of shifting social currents. Once we perceive that the status quo has changed, we flip suddenly from support for one state of being to support for another. When a committed and vocal 3.5% unites behind the demand for a new system, the social avalanche that follows becomes irresistible. Giving up before we have reached this threshold is worse than despair: it is defeatism. Today, Extinction Rebellion takes to streets around the world in defence of our life-support systems. Through daring, disruptive, nonviolent action, it forces our environmental predicament on to the political agenda. Who are these people? Another “they”, who might rescue us from our follies? The success of this mobilisation depends on us. It will reach the critical threshold only if enough of us cast aside denial and despair, and join this exuberant, proliferating movement. The time for excuses is over. The struggle to overthrow our life-denying system has begun. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"A few weeks ago I came downstairs and discovered I had left the freezer door open overnight: what a pain. We had to eat up the mushy produce as quickly as possible and some of it ended up going to waste. But my tribulations were nothing compared to the problems that Canada jays are having with their freezers right now. As winter approaches Canada jays collect up all sorts of treats to see them through the winter – juicy beetles and centipedes, mushrooms, berries, little voles and mice. These tasty morsels are hidden throughout the forest and help to see them through the lean winter months. But new research, published this week in Royal Society Open Science, shows that Canada jays living at the southern edge of their range in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, are struggling. The data shows that over the last 40 years the number of winter freeze-thaw events has increased. It appears that this frequent defrosting of the jays’ winter larders is leaving the birds hungry and unable to bring up large broods the following spring.  Many other species also rely on sub-zero winters to keep their food supplies fresh. For all of them climate change is reducing their range and forcing them to keep moving polewards."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe junior partner of Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU center-right government, the business-friendly FDP Liberal Democrats under Philipp Rösler, have made an astonishing and bold move.

The Süddeutsche Zeitung here reports:
FDP blocks climate expert Schellnhuber
He is one of the world’s most famous climate scientists. But that does not seem to impress the liberal democrats at all: The Economics Ministry under Philipp Rösler refuses to reappoint physicist Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber as director of the Environmental Advisory Board. His colleagues are outraged and are now speculating on what’s behind it.”
Hat-Tip: Roger Pielke Jr. at Twitter.
That WBGU board, filled mostly with German academics, is the famous WBGU that not long ago produced a whacko “masterplan” dubbed “The Great Transformation”, which would lead to a coercive global decarbonization of the global economy by 2050 and the civil marginalization of climate science skeptics and dissidents.
If you can credit the FDP for anything, it’s Courage. This takes really massive reproductive spheres to attempt this.
Merkel’s junior coalition partner, headed by Rösler, now we must expect the full fury and hellfire of Germany’s mainstream media to rain down upon their FDP party. In today’s modern Germany, Climatism has taken over as the country’s official religion and Schellnhuber is deemed its infallible pope.

This is a real hornets’ nest. Challenging Schellnhuber is challenging the very core of the world’s environmental movement. I hope they know what they are doing.
To know what could be behind the move, look no further than here. Schellnhuber is the main scientific force driving the green energy debacle that has pushed Germany’s energy industry and economy to the brink.
The green-leftist Süddeutsche Zeitung in its article extols Schellnhuber’s numerous achievements and awards. In there minds, he is Prof. Climate Authority.
The Süddeutsche also writes:
Now from Germany, the physicist, top climate advisor to the German Chancellor, is facing resistance. More precisely said: from the Federal Ministry of Economics. The house of Minister Philipp Rösler (FDP) is resisting with all its might the reappointment of Schellnhuber as director of the WBGU.”
Schellnhuber’s appointment would be for another 4 years, and it normally should proceed as a mere formality. But now there appears to be growing, real resistance among Angela Merkel’s government – the process of appointing Schellnhuber has been blocked for weeks now. The Süddeutsche writes: “Formally the WBGU has not been in existence for two months.”



     Also the director of the infamously green Wuppertal Institute, economist Uwe Schneidewind is facing resistance. The Süddeutsche reports that Rösler’s Economics Ministry is suggesting two alternatives to Schellnhuber and Schneidewind: Professor Axel Ockenfels of Cologne and Joachim Weimann of Magdeburg.

Schellnhuber has not commented on the stalled re-appointemnt. But the Süddeutsche writes that “the outrage among his council colleagues is big.”



This is an immense development. A junior coalition partner does not block such a key position or take such a stance without first closely consulting with its senior coalition partner, in this case Angela Merkel and her CDU/CSU party. This indicates that dissatisfaction with Schellnhuber and the WBGU has long been festering within the ruling government, and that Merkel has probably had enough of Schellnhuber’s doom and gloom scenarios, global transformation fantasies and social engineering designs. Time to get back to reality.
I repeat, expect a very very messy and ugly attack campaign against the FDP and Rösler from the media and Germany’s climate Vatican in the weeks and months ahead.

Fritz Kuhn, the mayor of Stuttgart, cites a ban used in Northern Italy in 150 cities last Sunday in order to fight air pollution. People can use their bicycles or go by foot.
By now readers may be thinking that the German Greens want to ban everything. Though it seems to be that way, this is not true.

Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele wants to legalize incest. Photo credit: Sargoth, public domain.
There are some things they want to legalize: incest for example. According to FOCUS magazine here:
The incest ruling by the European Court of Justice for Human Rights (EGMR) against a 34-year old man from Leipzig has led to controversial reactions. Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele reacted the most sharply. He wants to permit sex between siblings and other close relatives, and is requesting doing away with the incest laws. It is an isolated relic of another time when adultery was punishable, which we also have done away with,’ Ströbele told news network N24. Paragraph 173 no longer matches ‘in this time of enlightened opinion on marriage and family. It must be abolished’.”
Wonderful. Now Germans can stop driving on weekends, stay home and keep intimate company with family members. Now you know just how wacky German greens can be.
It should be noted that the early Green Party in Germany in the 1980s also supported advocates of pedophilia, this according to the leftist TAZ here, quoting Spiegel.
‘The pedophile past – In the 80s, the Green Party supposedly financially supported a working group that called for the legalization of sex with children. Cohn-Bendit: ‘That was mainstream’.'”
Amazingly, the Greens today are what often passes in the West as “progressive”.

U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Davey will make his strongest attack yet on climate change skeptics he accuses of purveying a what he calls a ‘seductive’ and’dangerous’ message that global warming has stopped.”

Sir Clueless Ed
Davey insists that global warming hasn’t stopped. Yet, a number of prominent warmist scientists don’t agree with the fear-stoking politician. Reader Jimbo sent me a list of comments from climate scientists acknowledging that the warming has stopped. Some of these scientists even recognised this years ago already.
Phil Jones saw it 8 years ago! Here’s Jimbo’s list:
5 July, 2005
“The scientific community would come down on me in no uncertain terms if I said the world had cooled from 1998. OK it has but it is only 7 years of data and it isn’t statistically significant…,” Dr. Phil Jones – CRU emails.
7 May, 2009
“No upward trend…has to continue for a total of 15 years before we get worried,” Dr. Phil Jones – CRU emails.
15 Aug 2009
“…This lack of overall warming is analogous to the period from 2002 to 2008 when decreasing solar irradiance also countered much of the anthropogenic warming…,” Dr. Judith L. Lean – Geophysical Research Letters.
19 November 2009
“At present, however, the warming is taking a break.[…] There can be no argument about that,” Dr. Mojib Latif – Spiegel.
19 November 2009
“It cannot be denied that this is one of the hottest issues in the scientific community. [….] We don’t really know why this stagnation is taking place at this point,” Dr. Jochem Marotzke – Spiegel.
13 February 2010
Phil Jones: “I’m a scientist trying to measure temperature. If I registered that the climate has been cooling I’d say so. But it hasn’t until recently – and then barely at all.”
BBC: “Do you agree that from 1995 to the present there has been no statistically-significant global warming?”
Phil Jones: “Yes, but only just.”
2010
“…The decade of 1999-2008 is still the warmest of the last 30 years, though the global temperature increment is near zero…,” Prof. Shaowu Wang et al – Advances in Climate Change Research.

2 June 2011
“…it has been unclear why global surface temperatures did not rise between 1998 and 2008...,” Dr Robert K. Kaufmann – PNAS.
18 September 2011
“There have been decades, such as 2000–2009, when the observed globally averaged surface-temperature time series shows little increase or even a slightly negative trend1 (a hiatus period)…,” Dr. Gerald A. Meehl – Nature Climate Change.
14 October 2012
“We agree with Mr Rose that there has been only a very small amount of warming in the 21st Century. As stated in our response, this is 0.05 degrees Celsius since 1997 equivalent to 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade.” Source: metofficenews.wordpress.com/, Met Office Blog – Dave Britton (10:48:21) –
30 March 2013
“…the five-year mean global temperature has been flat for a decade,” Dr. James Hansen – The Economist.
7 April 2013
“…Despite a sustained production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, the Earth’s mean near-surface temperature paused its rise during the 2000–2010 period…,” Dr. Virginie Guemas – Nature Climate Change.
22 February 2013
“People have to question these things and science only thrives on the basis of questioning,” Dr. Rajendra Pachauri – The Australian.
27 May 2013 
“I note this last decade or so has been fairly flat,” Lord Stern (economist) – Telegraph.
Many are using the word “pause” or “break” to describe the recent trend because they refuse to believe their theory is failing before their eyes. But this is only the language of denial.
Even the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) admitted that the warming has stopped and are puzzled by it: “In the years leading up to the year 2000, the temperature curve rose very sharply. But since then it isn’t rising so, in fact it’s not rising at all, the curve. The average temperature has stagnated at a very high level – we sort of have a plateau, and that during a time when CO2 emissions have risen considerably.” (2013)
And even the prince of climate darkness himself, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber conceded in April that the “pause” may even continue another decade!
Many insist that it’s only a pause, and that temperature will resume climbing with abandon once the hidden heat comes out of hiding deep somewhere in the ocean. But that’s pure speculation with no data to back it up. Right now the atmospheric data and observations are clear:
WARMING HAS STOPPED.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote 2 posts on the renewable energies folly in Germany, see here and here.
Now the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) confirms the mess with a press release and survey results of businesses and industries. The survey (see right) shows that energy prices and supply risks are threatening the ability of many German industrial companies to compete, and that many are now gearing up to move their operations to friendlier foreign locations.
Renewable energies are leading to higher prices, unreliable supply, less competitiveness and widespread job loss
In total, some 2400 companies of all sizes, sectors, and regions were surveyed throughout the country.
“Only a small share of the companies see more opportunities than risks,” reported Eric Schweitzer, President of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce. Most companies view renewable energies skeptically because of rising energy prices and fears with respect to the reliability of the energy supply.
Most of the companies see renewable energies more as a burden than a bonus. More than half of the industrial companies surveyed view renewable energies as hampering their competitiveness. The DIHK survey also says that 25% of the industrial companies are now active in some way in moving their operations to foreign countries. Three percent have already done so, 8% are currently in the process of doing so, and 14% are planning to do so. In a nutshell, renewable energies have made Germany a less attractive place for industry.

This is especially true in the energy-intensive chemical industry. For example natural gas prices are almost 70% cheaper in the USA – thanks to shale gas.
Energy prices on the rise, supply reliability in question
The DIHK report states that electricity prices in Germany are especially high and that 50% of the companies say that the importance of energy prices has increased over the last 12 months. Every tenth company is now attempting to pass the higher energy costs along to their customers.
The survey also shows that many companies are worried about the reliability of the electricity supply. Twenty one percent say that the importance of disruptions in power supply has gone up. 12% of the companies surveyed saw a power outage lasting more than 3 minutes and one out every six companies saw a power outage of less than three minutes. Ten percent of the companies incurred costs because of electric power or gas supply disruptions. Already a single short power outage can cause a company 10,000 euros in losses.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German Weather Service recently issued a press release claiming that August had been “one of the warmest on record”. Yet German data show no warming at all in the last 20 years.
============================================
Where’s The Climate Warming? Nowhere To Be Found In Germany
By Josef Kowatsch for EIKE
(Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
The following chart shows Germany’s August temperatures for the last 20 years using the data from Germany’s Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) in Offenbach. Nowhere is a steady warming trend to be found.

August mean temperatures last 20 years.
To the contrary, the trendline for the last 20 years is falling somewhat. However, the meteorologists of the German Weather Service publicly argue, in contradiction to their own data, that the trend of warming continues unabated.
But nowhere does anyone find a trend of continued warming. Also August data confirm what the annual data show.
The IPCC and other climate institutes have done their work. For 20 years temperatures have remained steady with a slight downward trend. The IPCC and the PIK Potsdam Institute can now be disbanded.
108 hectares of new UHI area every day in Germany

On the other hand, it is correct to say that summers have gotten warmer compared to the period 40 to 50 years ago. But this has more to do with a perception of warming that stems from the increasing urban heat island (UHI) from the growing and spreading building construction taking place. In Germany 108 hectares of natural landscape are converted by man into concrete, asphalt and buildings every day. Each new wind turbine consumes on average 5 hectares of land and forests. These added heat islands impact the measurement stations of the German Weather Service. The perceived warming does not stem from some greenhouse gas, but rather from the growing urban heat islands and paving over of natural areas.
Sometimes there are warmer periods and sometimes there are cooler ones. Currently the trend is again a light cooling. This is mainly due to the multi-faceted impacts of the sun and cosmic radiation. The climate of the Earth is created in space, and not on the Earth.  Apples still ripen at the same time of the year as they did 50-60 years ago. The May bug always comes out, if at all, in May just as it did 250 years ago, as described in our old songs about May. There haven’t been any major changes especially over the last decades compared to earlier times. The May temperatures for the last decades confirm this.

May mean temperatures last 21 years. 
Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have increased relatively strongly over the last 20 years. However, temperatures have been dropping slightly. From this one could only assume that more CO2 has a cooling effect on the climate. That is precisely the opposite of what is claimed by our highly-paid climate warming protectors. The climate models showing rising temperatures as a result of rising, climate-killing CO2 are pure, invented fairy tales.
We are all in favor of real environmental protection and care. But climate protection on the other hand is a pure business scam

Here’s the announcement from CFACT:
CFACT press conference at UN climate conference in Bonn
will call for UN and Obama to acknowledge
global temperature standstill,
to abandon bias and extreme statements and to embrace debate
(Bonn) CFACT will hold a press conference at the UN conference on climate change at Hotel Maritim, Bonn, Wednesday, June 5th at 11:30 AM in room Haydn.
“We at CFACT continue to be amazed at how people stay on their global warming talking points at UN climate conferences as if no new information had come in,” said CFACT Executive Director Craig Rucker. “They pay no heed to real world observational data, or the expense, ineffectiveness, waste, fraud and abuse surrounding the policies being proposed. A UN climate conference is an unrealistic wonderland.”

Measurements of world temperatures show world temperatures to have stalled with no significant warming since the nineties. IPCC climate models and real world temperatures have diverged and the Earth is cooler than projected.
CFACT recently erected a billboard graphing world temperature data reported by the U.K. Met Office in Washington D.C. to raise awareness, however, the U.S. executive branch is operating within a similar information bubble to that which encloses the UNFCCC.
“I don’t have much patience for people who deny climate change” the American President said last Wednesday. His new Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said, “I am not interested in debating what is not debatable.”
“President Obama is not being well advised.” Rucker said. “He appears to have accepted an extreme position and may well be completely uninformed about the global temperature standstill. Obama’s use of the loaded and offensive term “deny” coupled with Moniz’s call for closed minds and stifled debate are the exact opposite of what is called for. This is the kind of rhetoric which has eroded public confidence in the climate process. This is not a way forward citizens of the world can have confidence in.”
At Wednesday’s press conference CFACT will provide evidence which contradicts extreme public climate pronouncements and will provide examples of climate policy waste, fraud and abuse.
CFACT is a UNFCCC accredited NGO and the veteran of numerous UN conferences. CFACT is your ‘go to’ source for news and information for those seeking to balance coverage with reporting which challenges climate and sustainability orthodoxy. CFACT is available to all media.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCarbon Dioxide Will Cease To Be a Problem
By Ed Caryl
We do have the real world measurements of CO2, resolved to a monthly measurement with a well established seasonality that I will not describe here. We also know fairly accurately how much carbon we are injecting into the atmosphere from fossil sources.

Figure 1 is a plot of annual fossil carbon emissions (green trace), the annual atmospheric carbon increase (red trace) computed from Mauna Loa CO2 figures, and emissions minus the ocean and biosphere flux.
In Figure 1, the blue trace (fossil carbon emissions with all the biospheric carbon uptake subtracted) should equal the red trace, and in the long term average (pink trace), it comes close, so our simple model is reflecting the real world in that half the carbon emissions are being taken up by the ocean and the biosphere. The other half is contributing to the atmospheric CO2 increase. The difference between the pink and the green curves in 1977 is about 2.5 Gigatons and is increasing at an ever faster rate. The current difference is about 5 Gigatons. An increasing amount of CO2 is disappearing into the biosphere.
The part that remains is called the “air-borne fraction”. If this part is charted as a percentage you get a plot that looks like this (from James Hansen’s paper here. His Figure 3, is my Figure 2. Hansen’s caption is quoted.

Figure 2: Hansen’s Figure 3 “Fossil fuel CO2 emissions (left scale) and airborne fraction, i.e., the ratio of observed atmospheric CO2 increase to fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Final three points are 5-, 3- and 1-year means.”
I duplicated Hansen’s figure in the next figure, extended, and showed the un-averaged data. The heavy red trace is Hansen’s blue trace above:

Figure 3 above duplicates Hansen’s Figure 3 using the original data. The narrow red trace is the un-averaged computation. The black trace is a 2nd order polynomial trend line.
Note in Figure 3 that the airborne fraction of fossil-fuel carbon polynomial trend line goes to zero in about 30 years. When this happens, atmospheric CO2 will stop increasing. This roughly agrees with the atmospheric CO2 increase ceasing in mid-century as found in the previous article.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran journalist Ulli Kulke at German national daily Die Welt has a commentary at his Die Welt blog about the upcoming IPCC report. IPCC: Discuss or Ignore Warming Stop. He starts:
According to News Service Bloomberg it is currently being discussed whether to mention the ongoing 15-year pause in global in the 5th Assessment Report“ (AR 5) to be released in late September, or if perhaps it would be better to simply ignore it in order not to unnecessarily supply so-called ‘climate skeptics’ with ammunition.”
Alarmist scientists find themselves in a dilemma and aren’t sure what to do. They are eager to argue back against skeptics’s claims that the warming has stopped, yet are petrified of bringing it up. Some are saying it is simply best to ignore the pause in warming. But Kulke writes:
The attempt to keep the warming pause out of the ongoing discussion surrounding the upcoming AR 5 would be ridiculous. Semantic and formal splitting of hairs would not stick because it cannot be denied that also the In-group of the IPCC scientists have acknowledged the stop in warming – at least internally – and view this as the biggest problem. It is “a travesty” they cannot explain. That quote comes from Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the 2001 and 2007 IPCC reports. […] In the meantime Trenberth suspects, according to his models, that the missing heat is somewhere in the depths of the oceans. But this is not certain in any way; perhaps it just doesn’t exist.”
Scientists in a jam

Kulke then adds that the IPCC also will not be able to downgrade the warming pause to a mere weather event and claim that it has nothing to do with overall climate:
Just because it is still in the range of weather and has not yet reached the time span that one uses to discuss climate, ignoring the warming stop would also be outrageous because it would mean you couldn’t mention any weather event that is not at least 30 years long.”
If increasing frequency is the test that alarmists like to use, then it’s tough to get more frequent than every year over the last 15. You can’t claim a team is in a slump-trend after it has just won 15 games in a row.
For the alarmist IPCC scientists, it’s a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t situation. Bringing up the warming stop surely will be ammo for the skeptics, but so would ignoring it. Should we feel sorry for them? I don’t think so. It was they themselves who maneuvered their own jewels between the jaws of the vise. Last chance to pull them out!

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother German association of journalists has publicly demanded the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) stop the distribution of a government “blacklist” of US and German skeptics. The UBA is headed by the German Ministry of Environment – Germany’s version of the EPA.
Today Germany’s association of science, the Wissenschafts-Pressekonferenz e.V. (WPK) issued a press release condemning the UBA’s brochure and blacklisting of skeptic journalists. The WPK is an association whose members mainly include science journalists working for the print, broadcasting and Internet media. The stated objective of the WPK: “to promote quality science journalism.”
Just last week the German Association of Journalists demanded an apology from the Federal Environment Ministry. Two of the journalists, Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch, are suing the Ministry.
What follows is the press release of the WPK journalist association:

WPK criticizes the pillory of journalists by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA)
The Wissenschafts-Pressekonferenz e.V. (WPK), [English: The Science Press Conference] finds it unacceptable that individual journalists are being publicly paraded by the German Environment Agency, and portrayed as being as incompetent only because they are criticizing leading scientists.  The government body names the journalists who have opinions that ‘correspond to the state of knowledge of climate science’ in its brochure on climate change: ‘And indeed the warming continues’.
‘It is not the duty of state institutions to determine which opinions may be expressed and which may not,’ explained WPK Chairman Martin Schneider. ‘Journalists may and must represent different points of views, and they may and must always question established scientists.’ Overall it cannot be the job of a state authority to quasi certify certain scientific positions as being the truth. Also when the anthropogenic climate change can no longer be doubted, there is in the science an intensive discussion over many details, such as its consequences and the validity of certain climate models. ‘This discourse must take place within the science and journalists must accompany it critically,’ Schneider said.
The WPK requests that Environment Minister Peter Altmaier stop the further distribution of the brochure in its current form.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe now half-constructed 37-story Walkie Talkie glass skyscraper in London was given a special concave shape by its architect, Rafael Vinoly. Read here at the Daily Mail.
Photo left: Walkie-Talkie building’s faulty design focuses sunlight and scorches property below. Photo by Eluveitie, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license. 
However, just after mid day whenever the sun is shining, the building’s unique shape focuses sunlight like a ray gun to a small area onto the street and adjacent buildings below. The concentrated sunlight scorches parked cars, blisters paintwork, cracks tiles, singes fabric, and is reported to even have ignited fires.
Clearly architect Vinoly goofed and failed to take into account the impacts of the building’s shape and orientation. But it’s not like he couldn’t have know about such problems. The Mail writes that another building he designed in Las Vegas, the Vdara Hotel, built in 2010, had the very same problems.
The Mail reports that Vinoly was unavailable for comment.
Spiegel: Architect blames climate change
But yesterday, Germany’s online Spiegel here reports that architect Vinoly has commented and is partly blaming climate change for the building’s intense reflected heat.

Spiegel writes and quotes Vinoly:
The developers did not take the sun enough into account. But: When he came to London years ago, it wasn’t as sunny. Now there are lots of sunny days. ‘So, shouldn’t we also make climate change responsible, or not?'”
Right. What was the architect thinking? He knew it was a mistake in Las Vegas. Did he think that London would never see sunny days in the summertime? You only need one sunny day and the problem is there.
Vinoly’s sorrowful attempt to dodge responsibility is typical today. Nobody is ever responsible for big screw-ups or gross incompetence anymore. Now it’s always climate change. Mankind is collectively responsible for the foul-ups of sloppy and incompetent individuals.
Granted Vinoly doesn’t blame it all on climate, which any competent architect learns to take into account from day one. According to Spiegel he concedes:
We’ve made lots of mistakes with the building. We will address the problems.”
Hooray. Vinoly appears to have learned that the sun indeed does shine in London after all.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeo Hickman of the Guardian’s Environment blog Friday had a frustration-filled, teeth-gnashing screed where he expressed his disdain over so many skeptic blogs being nominated for the best Science & Technology Category of the Weblog Awards 0f 2013.

Source: Weblog Awards site.
He accuses the climate skeptics of “gaming” the competition because they’ve succeeded in generating so much enthusiasm.
It was tough not to gloat reading that piece. It’s indeed a good look at a sour grapes display by the increasingly defeated looking alarmist side, now that they see they have got no chance of winning. Of the five finalists, four are skeptic blogs. The sole remaining alarmist blog, Skeptical Science, has dropped out.
On the long list of 17, thirteen were climate science skeptics (including NoTricksZone).

If anything, the Weblog Awards results tell us one thing: the alarmist blogs have a very, very serious problem. The problem (for them) is that nobody is listening to their message any more. And, except for themselves, nobody else even has an inkling of enthusiasm left to nominate them, let alone to vote. They’re rapidly sinking into irrelevance.
The problem boils down to credibility. You can only cry wolf so many times before people ignore you totally and think you’ve completely lost your marbles. The hysterical shrieks of a world-ending climate collapse are looking more ridiculous today than ever, and many are finding it simply too embarrassing to be associated with.
The Guardian laments that it didn’t even know who some of the blogs on the long list were. Well, whose fault is it for that ignorance? Should we be surprised to hear this from a media outlet that appears ignorant of hundreds of peer-reviewed papers showing that CO2 is way over-hyped? If the Guardian had done its homework, it wouldn’t be standing there appearing so clueless. Reporting means getting both sides of the story, and not just the part you agree with and ignoring all the rest.
The skeptics on the other hand are energized, enthusiastic, and their numbers are growing by the day. Little wonder they are mopping up at the Weblog Awards. If a blog can generate that type on enthusiasm among readers, well, then it deserves to win. It gets down to having the ability to capture and engage an educated audience, and to do so without resorting to spectacular tabloidish claims of a dramatic global meltdown.
The alarmist/hysterical climate blogs have been so out-classed that those left (Skeptical Science) are now hightailing it out of the ring. Like when it comes to debating climate science in public, they are willing to step into the ring only if the fight is rigged in a way that ensures they’ll win – quality and science be damned.
PS: Thanks to readers for having nominated NoTricksZone. Being on the list of the top 17 is already a great success.

"‘From space, the view of our planet is breathtaking,” purrs Chiwetel Ejiofor, who narrates the wonderfully soporific new nature series Earth from Space (BBC One). It is a difficult time for the genre: all the pleasure to be found in viewing our natural splendour is being tainted, somewhat, by an imminent sense of doom and destruction. It’s hard to show beautiful animals without acknowledging that their habitats are at risk of disappearing entirely. Earth from Space does not evade the perils of climate change, and some of its quiet power comes from simply showing the damage being done. It opens with a family of elephants in Kenya, with a calf in danger of starvation and a herd that has barely eaten because of an extreme dry season. These animals are heartbreakingly emaciated. But the rain comes and they make it through. The approach is more gentle than bombastic. Perhaps there is a hope that, in seeing animals in their glory, we might take more care of what we have.  Earth from Space promises a new perspective on nature documentaries by using, as its starting point, images taken from some of the thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth, which are now so capable of capturing minute detail that they can pick out individual animals from space. The tinfoil hat side of my brain began to look up at the sky with suspicion, before I realised that it is safe to assume that a herd of elephants frolicking in the rain holds more interest than the tea-drinking habits of a writer in perpetual pyjamas, but even so. From these unimaginably far away shots, we get closer, and zoom in, until we’re right there on the delta with warring hippos, or in the Himalayas with snub-nosed monkeys whose tiny faces are extraordinary, their smeared, plumped lips looking as if they belong more on the cover of a celebrity weekly than slurping the nectar of rhododendron flowers. Ejiofor narrates us around the world with poetic flair, taking us from vignette to vignette with speed, and there is little time to linger. While some stories earn more time, we zip past seals on the coast of Namibia and an isolated, unexplored rainforest high on a clifftop in Mozambique; an underwater volcano is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it interlude. There is ample aesthetic appeal in seeing Earth from above, which will not be news to anyone who has recently found themselves having to select a new screensaver. Sweeping shots of Lake Baikal in Siberia, frozen over for five months of the year, reveal shards of ice stacked like tiles, and there is a grim beauty to even its most perilous spots, as the huge dark rings of meltwater threaten the survival of baby seals. There is far more here, however, than just a visual treat. Surveillance of this kind allows scientists to see places they might not have been able to access previously, and the resulting insights can be significant. The satellites pick up brown smears tainting the white ice of the Antarctic. The old adage that one should never eat yellow snow takes on a whole new meaning when its origins are revealed, and the diet of the emperor penguins that live there has a lot to answer for. It is a rare moment of optimism: spotting these new colonies, essentially identified by the trails of faeces they leave in their wake, has more than doubled the known global population. Enjoy that moment while it lasts; it is followed by a shot of a vast iceberg four times the size of Greater London breaking off from the Arctic shelf. Ejiofor explains that as well as spying on nature, satellites mean “we can also see our cities” (the tinfoil hat is vibrating again), and flashes of humans gathered en masse appear: in Mecca for hajj, Burning Man, even Glastonbury, though in my experience, it would be kinder all round not to zoom in on revellers too closely. In central China, though, the beauty is truly remarkable, and the programme-makers have saved the best until last. Thousands of students of Shaolin kung-fu, who train for six hours a day, six days a week, perform a routine in near-perfect unison. Even from a regular point of view, this is an astonishing spectacle. But from above, from far away, it looks like a grand, magnificent flower unfurling. It seems inappropriate, in the light of the underlying message that people are ruining everything, to come to this point, but here we are, with human beings, stealing the show again."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Mitteldeutsche Zeitung (Central German Newspaper) reports on Europe’s extended brutal winter. In today’s online article, it reminds us that the cold is not only a phenomenon that is isolated in Central Europe, but one that is widespread and extends all the way across Russia to Siberia.
The article writes that there’s lots of data showing that March, 2013, was a record cold month, citing German meteorologist Dominik Jung
In northeast Germany, March 2013 was even the coldest March in 130 years. However, not only Germany and wide areas of Europe suffered from the cold wave reports Dominik Jung: ‘Quite to the contrary, the dramatic negative temperature deviations from the 1981 -2010 longterm mean were widespread across western, central, eastern Europe, all the way to Siberia.‘  Moreover, there were many regions in North and South America where it was very cold. … the cold in Germany was no single isolated case here.”
I never knew global warming could cause such widespread cold.  I thought it was supposed to make things warmer.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOttmar Edenhofer can hardly contain his glee – like a mad scientist thinking this time it’ll really end with a huge, spectacular result! That’s what he thinks his data show.
Face it, what we have in Germany are a group of out-of-control, dangerous academics, a group of elitist, unelected scientists, totally drunk on towering arrogance, given license to perform an experiment on an entire nation, and itching to perform it on the rest of the world. H/t: a reader by e-mail.

Prof. Ottmar Edenhofer wants to use Germany as an experimental economic guinea pig. (Photo: Marco Urban, PIK)
Just look at the PIK’s own words:
‘The energy transformation is one of the greatest experiments that an industrial society ever performed,’ Edenhofer said. ‘An experiment of this dimension needs to be supported by scientific policy advice.’ This should be organized as a social learning process, he pointed out. ‘Science is mapping possible pathways, but it is up to politics to decide which way to go,’ Edenhofer said.”

He calls it himself an “experiment”. They act like they can just gamble with an entire society. Do they think they’re in a casino! This is very close to madness. Read it all here.
The probloem with Edenhofer’s arrangement is that the citizenry is moved to the sidelines, stripped of having a say, and are expected to just accept whatever the scientists and leaders hand down. They no longer have the competence to decide it for themselves. Germany is entering a dictatorship by a scientific elite.
It doesn’t matter what data you present to them, or that other experts are already calling it “a capital destroyer of historical dimensions“, or that Germany’s entire solar manufacturing industry has already been wiped out despite 100 billion euros in subsidies. Oh no, just put the pedal to the metal – just drive right over the edge…don’t worry about the landing.
They are hell bent on pushing an entire nation over the precipice, once again, for the fourth time in the last 100 years.
The territory isn’t really uncharted; central planning has been tried many times before with the result being failure every single time. But the PIK, the WBGU, the drugged up on green leaders are convinced this time it’ll work – they made models that tell them so.
Maybe it’s time to cash in the chips and to move on to a saner place.

I have to admit that I never took the time to sit down and undertake this because I thought it was something difficult to do and I’d likely screw everything up. I’m not a very patient person. But Hajo made it sound easy and gave me a couple pointers on where to begin. It turned out to be really easy – just a matter of using a simple plug-in.
To take me by the hand and lead me through it, I found this Youtube video:

This is something I should have looked at long ago.
Anyway, now you can share NTZ posts with the social media share buttons at the end of the article or at the right side bar. I still have to play around a little bit to get it just the way I want.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother tasteless, shock-effect promotion video has been released, this one produced by one of Germany’s most prominent environmental groups BUND – for fund-raising!
The video, dubbed “Pesticides – manufactured to kill“, shows hundreds of beautiful babies in an agricultural field who end up getting gassed with pesticides sprayed by a passing airplane.

Hat/tip: Reader DirkH
This is what passes as “protest” by environmental groups nowadays. The more shocking and remote from the truth, the better. Stop at nothing in the pursuit of donations. Scream as loud as you can, shock as much as you can.
This reminds us of the infamous and explosive 10:10 No Pressure video released in 2010 where climate skeptics were blown to bits and pieces for complacency in energy saving. The text at the end of the clip reads as follows:
Pesticides manufactured to kill.
 Take action now.
 For a future without poison.

I have nothing against challenging the use of pesticides, but this is way over the top and lacks all sense of decency. And it has nothing to do with the truth.
Criminalizing agriculture
The BUND’s target of course is to emotionally incite using methods from the bottom drawer. Today anyone who disagrees with these zealot environmentalist gets labeled a murderer, or accused of killing.
Emotionalization is always what desperate debaters wind up using when they lack the facts to convince. And if these planet rescuers are so concerned about babies, then why don’t we ever see them lift a finger to protest abortion? These scammers are only concerned about money, power and attention.
As was the case with the 10:10 No Pressure video, the BUND Baby-Gassing video is going to backfire as well.
Already reaction has been harsh. Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes:
On the BUND’s new campaign against pesticides, business associations and trade groups have sharply criticized the environmental organization on Thursday. The German Federation of Agriculture accuses the BUND of ‘incitement’, ‘a virtual crusade’ and ‘false propaganda’.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online German daily Die Welt here looks back at the month of October 2013 in an interview with meteorologist Dominik Jung, who is often widely quoted in the media and runs the German weather site Wetter.net.

Overall this year’s October was warmer and wetter than normal, and featured “surprising” snowfall early in the month, followed by warm temperatures, and then punctuated by the fall’s first severe storm at the end of the month.
Die Welt wonders if all that variability, particularly the severe storm, was really normal.
Jung replies that an evaluation indeed shows that “there has been no real increase in storms over the past years. More the contrary is the case.”
Jung then reminds readers that central Europe saw a number of warmer-than-normal and stormier winters during the 1990s and 2000s, but that this trend now seems to be over. Die Welt quotes Jung:

Climate experts leaned far out the windows and declaring that winters with snow and ice in Germany were over. To that I can only say: All complete nonsense! The last five winters compared to the 1961-1990 reference period were normal or even a bit too cold! And at times they were plentiful with snow.”
Die Welt at the end of the interview poses the question of whether 2013 will be “an extreme year”. Jung replies

No, it is an entirely normal year. […] Up to now the weather in 2013 has not been really extreme.”

Model shows nightmare euro-winter
Meanwhile a new seasonal forecast has been put out by Italian weather service Meteo Dolomiti and shows a nightmare shock-freeze winter gripping heavily populated central Europe: If that forecast turned out to be true, then Central Europe would find itself in a big heap trouble.
Fortunately long-term forecasts are not accurate and are highly speculative at best. Let’s hope that Europe’s winter turns out differently.

"Finland is heading towards a broad but potentially fragile left-right coalition government after the Social Democrats came top for the first time in 20 years. The centre-left SDP looks set to keep out the nationalist Finns party, which it beat by just 6,800 votes, and is likely instead to try to form a government with parties of the left and centre-right.  The SDP, led by Antti Rinne, a 56-year-old former trade union leader, will have 40 MPs in a fragmented 200-seat Eduskunta (parliament) after winning 17.7% of the vote after a fierce anti-austerity campaign. Nevertheless, the far-right, anti-immigration and increasingly radical Finns party did better than expected, winning 17.5% and 39 seats – almost exactly the same as its total in elections in 2011 and 2015, but significantly more than it might have hoped for earlier this year. On a good night generally for the left, the SDP finished with six more MPs than in the previous parliament, while the Greens gained five and the more radical Left Alliance four. Voters chose between 2,500 candidates from 19 political parties and movements. The result was further evidence of a modest social democratic fightback in Nordic countries, with left-leaning prime ministers now in power in Sweden and Iceland, and the Social Democrats leading in the polls in Denmark, where elections are due this summer. The biggest loser was the Centre party of the outgoing prime minister Juha Sipilä, who blamed the slump in its support – to 13.8% of the vote and fourth place – on the “difficult economic decisions” his government had had to make. Ninety-two of the 200 MPs in the new parliament are women, the second highest proportion in Europe after Iceland. Although the SDP’s victory is its first in 20 years, with no party winning more than 20% of the vote and deep divisions within all mainstream parties over the future of Finland’s widely admired welfare system – which the left want to preserve by increasing taxes, and the right to streamline because of rising costs – the centre-left party may find it hard to build a sustainable coalition. Final results will be published on Wednesday, with formal coalition talks likely to start on 25 April. The leader of the party with the most seats traditionally has the first stab at forming a government. Political analysts expect a coalition led by the Social Democrats, possibly including the conservative National Coalition, a junior member of the outgoing coalition, which won 38 seats, the Greens and the Swedish People’s party. The more radical Left Alliance might also seek to join the cabinet, but the Centre party’s heavy defeat is likely to exclude it. All parties have said they would find it difficult, if not impossible, to share power with the Finns party and its hardline leader, Jussi Halla-aho, who has shifted the party firmly to the right since a 2017 split that saw half its MPs leave. Rinne said his party disagreed with the Finns party on immigration, the EU, and economic policy, as well as, most importantly, in their core values. “I don’t think we can work with the Finns because of those differences,” he told Agence France-Presse, adding that he expected to be able to instead strike a deal with either the conservative National Coalition or the Centre party. “It’s very hard to see that the other parties would say no to the Social Democrats, because then we would be in a situation with Halla-aho trying to form a government and I just don’t see that happening,” said a political commentator, Sini Korpinen. Markku Jokisipilä, professor of political history at the University of Turku, said other parties were “at present rejecting the possibility of being in the same government with the Finns party. But it remains to be seen, because Finnish politics is rather pragmatic.” Halla-aho told the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that although he could be interested in the job of interior minister, he would not repeat the mistakes his party made in 2015 when it haemorrhaged support after entering government and had to compromise on immigration and EU bailouts. “I don’t see it as possible that the Finns party would take part in a government which doesn’t clearly commit to reducing humanitarian migration,” he said. The strong finish by the Finns party, which was in fifth place in the polls less than six months ago, echoed similar recent performances by hard-right, anti-immigration parties across Europe. Halla-aho, who has transformed the party from being a populist Eurosceptic movement to a far more explicitly nationalist, far-right organisation that aims to cut immigration to “almost zero” and questions the need for tough action on climate change, ended up winning the most votes of any candidate in the election. Halla-aho, 47, who was fined by the supreme court in 2012 for blog comments linking Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft, has said the next government should not speed up cutting carbon emissions but instead pursue a “more moderate climate policy that does not chase industries away from Finland to countries like China”. The Finns party is among a number of populist far-right parties, including Germany’s far-right AfD, Italy’s League and the Danish People’s party, to announce plans to join forces after the European parliamentary elections on 23-26 May in an attempt to transform EU policies on migration, families and the environment."

"Environmental campaigners are hoping to mobilise thousands of people to block the streets of central London around the clock next week, in their latest attempt to raise public awareness and provoke action over the destruction of the biosphere. About 2,300 volunteers have signed up with Extinction Rebellion to obstruct some of the capital’s busiest roads for at least three days.  The disruption is to be the UK element of what organisers hope will be an international movement to protest against environmental and ecological destruction.  XR, which cites the civil rights movement and suffragettes as inspirations and is backed by senior scientists and academics, including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, claims to have 331 groups in 49 countries, with 222 activists arrested worldwide for acts of non-violent civil disobedience since last autumn. Eighty-five people were arrested in London in November when thousands of protesters, including families and pensioners, occupied five bridges. The group is demanding immediate action over environmental destruction, after dire predictions that humans face an existential threat if climate change and the loss of biodiversity continues. It is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war. “We don’t want to disrupt people, but our government’s failure over the last 30 years leaves us no choice,” an XR spokesperson said. “Governments prioritise the short-term interests of the economic elites so, to get their attention, we have to disrupt the economy.” On Monday at 11am, protesters in London plan to block traffic at Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Piccadilly Circus. Roadblocks will continue night and day at each site, reminiscent of the Occupy London protest camp outside St Paul’s Cathedral in 2011-12. Participants are being warned they will be invited to take part in non-violent civil disobedience, and might be arrested. Organisers have circulated legal advice to anyone planning to attend, requested they refrain from using drugs and alcohol during the protest, and asked that they treat passersby and the environment with respect. A Metropolitan police spokesperson declined to comment other than to say an appropriate policing plan will be in place. Tiana Jacout, an XR coordinator, said the protest’s success relied on recruiting enough people. “It’s literally a numbers game at the moment,” she said. “The more people we have, the easier it is to hold the space.” Organisers have promised a “full-scale festival of collective action and creative resistance”, including talks, workshops, musical and theatrical performances, and a roaming people’s assembly, hosted at each of the locations. “What I have been saying to people is that [the climate crisis] is not an unknown thing any more,” Jacout said. “Polls have shown 70-80% of people want it dealt with. If in the past 10 years you have been sitting at home, thinking this is not right, something needs to happen: come, this is it.” Almost 100 academics declared their support for XR in a letter published in the Guardian in October, which said: “When a government wilfully abrogates its responsibility to protect its citizens from harm and to secure the future for generations to come, it has failed in its most essential duty of stewardship. “The ‘social contract’ has been broken, and it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline CO2 Handel here reports that German news weekly FOCUS recently commissioned a survey on how Germans view climate change: According to the survey of 1004 persons, conducted by Emnid at the end of May:
63% of Germans think that warnings of future global warming are justified.
28% feel they are exaggerated.
8% think that the dangers of warmer climates are not dramatic enough.
By contrast, in the year 2007 FOCUS found that 85% of Germans found global warming to be a “threat”.
Online The Epoch Times also reports on the FOCUS survey, writing that:
Germans are predominantly calm about global warming: In an Emnid-survey for FOCUS news magazine, 35% said that the climate in their region had not gotten warmer over the last 10 years. 46% felt that the climate had been more or less unchanged. 17 percent said they thought that temperatures over the last ten years went up.”
What can we draw from the results? After 10 years of climate catastrophe media bombardment, a vast majority of Germans see no warming or little climate change.
The FOCUS site itself only has a short summary of the survey results. The title: Germans Not Perceiving Climate Warming.
A majority of Germans believe that global warming is taking place, yet most of them are unable to perceive it. It’s strange that a news magazine like FOCUS would pay Germany’s top polling organization for such a survey, and then remain quiet about the results.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that the global temperature has not risen in 15 years, part of the German media is actually beginning to take a serious new look at the possibility of global cooling and are slowly questioning the alarmist assertion that the sun played little or no role in the climate change of the last 100 years.

Yesterday the online FOCUS magazine published a piece called: Scientists fear new little ice age.
What’s a bit surprising is that the article is written by typically warmist journalist Michael Odenwald.
In the FOCUS article Odenwald describes how solar cycle 24 started unusually slowly in 2008 and quotes David Hathaway of NASA: “It is not only the weakest cycle in the modern space age, but also the weakest in the last 100 years.“ Odenwald also tells readers how solar sunspots are driven by the solar dynamo, which also generates the sun’s magnetic field.
In Part 2 of Odenwald’s article, he points out that historical records suggest solar cycle 25 will very likely also be a weak cycle. In the recent past, alarmist climate scientists dismissed, or even scoffed at, the notion that weak solar activity could have a significant impact on the earth’s climate – a dismissal that flies in the face of a mountain of data showing a strong correlation between weak solar activity and cold periods.

Recently a growing number of scientists from the USA, Europe, and Russia have been warning of a potential approaching cooling period because of low solar activity, and the media are now taking more notice than ever. FOCUS quotes Hathaway’s colleague Matthew Penn of the National Solar Observatory (translated from the German):
Should this trend continue, then solar cycle 25 will have hardly any sunspots at all. Then we could reach a new Maunder Minimum.”
The Maunder Minimum, Odenwald writes, was an especially cold period during the Little Ice Age.
Still, Odenwald is hardly ready to give up believing that CO2 a major player in the overall climate scheme, insisting that a new grand solar minimum would not necessarily cool the planet. Odenwald cites that the Little Ice Age may in fact have been precipitated by a “giant volcanic eruption that supposedly occurred in the year 1257 in Indonesia“.
But to his credit, Odenwald concedes that solar activity could very well have a major role on climate:
It’s possible that the reduced solar activity may bring some good, which the scientists gathered at the AAS conference indicated. It could counter the global warming that man is causing with the continuously rising emissions of climate-impacting greenhouse gases.
Good to see responsible German warmist journalists opening their minds to alternatives theories. Give it a few more years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDo you recall Lockwood’s paper?
Central Europeans right now are scratching their heads, wondering how on Earth they are still shoveling snow past Easter. March in Germany, according to the German Weather Service DWD, was the 6th coldest since measurements began in 1881. Britain has just seen it’s coldest March in 100 years. In fact over the last few winters hundreds of cold and snowfall records have been shattered.
Lockwood wasn’t alone in suspecting that climate is profoundly impacted by the sun. Now is a good time to recall these findings from scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research working with Lockwood, from a little less than 3 years ago in 2010. 3Sat television quoted MPI scientist Sami Solanki in 2010:
There hasn’t been sunspots and thus no activity on the sun for three years. Solar activity is on the increase, but it is completely unclear if the sun will reach the same level of activity we saw over the last decades. If it does, then it is improbable we will again have extreme cold winters, if our statistical analysis proves right. If it doesn’t, then everything is open.”
Lockwood and the Max-Planck Institute scientists had examined weather and solar data going back all the way to 1659. Statistically they found a correlation that CO2 proponents could only dream of. When solar activity was low, the climate in Great Britain was 0.5°C cooler. And when solar activity was high, the climate was warmer.
The reason, the scientists explain, is that low solar activity could lead to changes to the winds in the troposphere. The researchers assume that when the stratosphere above it heats up only weakly, the mild strong winds from the Atlantic break off in the troposphere. Great Britain and Central Europe are then exposed to the influence of cold winds from the North East instead. The exact mechanism is still unclear, however.

3Sat (2010) then added:
Whether the coming winter will also be bitter cold, the Max Planck scientists don’t know. Their results are purely statistical. They only indicate a trend.”
Well, three critical winters have since joined the data set: How were these 3 winters?  Not just one bitter cold winter followed, but three more in a row! Right now it’s April and Central Europeans are still shoveling snow!
With 350 years of data, we can safely assume that there is very likely much more behind solar activity and the global climate, and that many CO2 alarmist scientists know it too. That’s why months later they concocted the ludicrous quackery that missing Arctic sea ice in September refrigerates the entire northern hemisphere months later in the wintertime.
Some will claim it’s only a regional phenomenon! Wrong. The link between solar activity and climate has been shown to be profound not just in Europe but at every corner of the globe, and that by dozens, if not hundreds, of peer-reviewed studies.

"In September, the giant German polar research vessel Polarstern will set off from Tromsø in Norway on a remarkable voyage. It will sail across the Arctic Ocean and after a few weeks reach a point off the Siberian coast, around 85 deg N 120 deg E, where it will attach itself to the biggest, strongest-looking ice floe its crew can find. And then, for the next year, the Polarstern will remain moored to this giant slab of frozen water as it slides, with other polar pack ice, round the Arctic Ocean. For a year, teams of researchers from the ship will study conditions on the ice floe – which will be at least 2 sq km in area to satisfy researchers’ requirements. There they will set up instruments to study the atmosphere above them, the seabed below, the chemistry of the water around them, the Arctic Ocean’s sealife, and the behaviour of wildlife on the surface, including the occasional visiting polar bear. This is Mosaic – the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, the biggest international expedition ever launched in the Arctic. Its aim is to transform our knowledge of the north polar region, a place more affected by climate change than any other sector of our planet and which is expected to play a crucial role in determining how global warming impacts on the rest of the Earth. “The Arctic is closely linked to weather in our latitudes,” says expedition leader Markus Rex, of the Alfred Wegener Institut in Germany. “We can already see climate changes in the Arctic that are shaping our weather and climate. However, we won’t succeed in accurately forecasting climate developments if we don’t have reliable prognoses for the Arctic.” Backed by an international consortium led by the institute, Mosaic will cost more than £100m to complete. At any one time, around 50 scientists will be working on its prime vessel or on the ice to which it is moored. Regular visits by icebreakers from China, Russia and Sweden will keep the Polarstern supplied and recrewed so that by late 2020, when the project ends, more than 300 researchers from at least 17 nations will have taken turns to work there. The idea of simply letting a research vessel drift across the polar cap trapped in ice is not new. The Fram expedition, led by the great Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen, lasted from 1893 to 1896, as his boat, gripped in sea ice, drifted across the Arctic Ocean and demonstrated the feasibility of such arduous undertakings. By modern standards, the scientific measurements taken by its crew were limited, however. Mosaic, by contrast, will return reams of data, most of it aimed at helping researchers forecast the likely fate of our planet as it heats up as more and more greenhouse gases are pumped into the atmosphere. “The Arctic is crucial to understanding how climate change will affect the rest of the planet,” says Jeremy Wilkinson, a British physicist working on Mosaic. “We already monitor it constantly from space using satellites and also do a lot of work under the ice using robot submersibles. However, there is still a tremendous amount of research that needs to be done by humans, especially in the biological and the atmospheric sciences.” This point is backed by Markus Frey, a polar explorer based at the British Antarctic Survey. (Britain’s research in the north pole is managed by the Arctic Office at the British Antarctic Survey.) “In the Arctic Ocean – because there is no land on which to build research bases – there is a lack of data about conditions there apart from the information we get from satellites and a few other sources,” tells the Observer. “We need to calibrate the data we get from space with events and the observations we make on the ground, or to be more precise at sea level, in order to get a more accurate picture of what is going on there.” Consider the issue of sea-ice thickness in the Arctic. For more than 40 years satellites have swept over the north pole and charted dramatic declines in sea-ice cover as global warming has inexorably strengthened its grip on Earth. According to Nasa, the area covered by Arctic sea ice in summer has shrunk by about 40% since the 1980s. That represents the loss of several million square kilometres of sea ice – and as it disappears, more solar radiation will reach the dark, heat-absorbing waters of Arctic Ocean that once lurked underneath. As a result, temperatures will rise even further, researchers warn. Photographs from most polar satellites only give a two-dimensional picture of the sea ice, however. They do not reveal the extent to which it may be thinning or thickening. In some places, it may be only wafer-thin and set to disappear with dramatic rapidity. “Recent satellites have been fitted with radar that can measure ice thickness from space,” says Wilkinson. “They have been carefully tuned so they are not confused about levels of snow that have fallen on top of the surface of the ice and apparently altered its thickness.” The European Space Agency’s probe CryoSat-2 and the French-Indian satellite AltiKa are examples of space missions designed to measure Arctic sea-ice thickness using radar. However, scientists have found these devices do not always pinpoint the surface of the sea ice properly. They still get confused by light snow lying on top of ice. “And that means we are getting errors in our measurements of ice thickness,” adds Wilkinson. Mosaic should provide a solution. Radar instruments identical to those fitted to CryoSat and AltiKa will be taken on the Polarstern. “We will mount these on a sled and scientists will drag them across the sea ice,” says Wilkinson. “It will be like bringing the satellites down to the surface of the sea ice. Using them, we will then be able to compare the readings we get on the sea-ice surface with those that we got from space. We should be able to recalibrate the satellites’ instruments to get very much improved, more accurate readings of Arctic sea-ice thickness when measured from Earth orbit.” There will be a perimeter with tripwires and a lookout on the bridge. Bears are a serious issue In fact, he adds, dozens of related programmes will be carried out on Mosaic. “Other researchers are doing work on snow chemistry and snow properties and we can get our radar measurements married to their snow measurements to get this holistic understanding of how snow evolves in the Arctic.”  Another key focus for the researchers will be the unexpected role that salt plays in influencing the Arctic climate. Salt is crucial to the formation of clouds, it transpires, because cloud droplets grow on salt grains, says Frey. This raises a problem in understanding the polar climate, because if an ocean is frozen over, how can salt get from the sea to the sky and help clouds form? Frey’s work has revealed a possible route. “The top of the sea ice actually has this very salty brine on it. Then when sweet, freshwater snow falls on top of it, the mixture is whipped up into the air by the winds and you get a flux of salt flying into the air, even though the ocean is frozen.” Scientists still do not know exactly how this process works, however, and a key feature of Frey’s research will be to unravel the detailed way salt is spread round the Arctic atmosphere. “We need to understand how salt affects the formation of clouds. If you don’t understand that process, you will not get your climate forecasts right. It is a missing link in our meteorological knowledge, so this research is crucial. After all, clouds cut out sunlight and if they do not form for some reason, the region will heat up even more than is currently predicted.” It is all intriguing work, though carrying out these projects is not without risk. For a start, polar bears pose a real danger to researchers who will have to be protected by armed guards when working on the ice floe. “The guards will have night-vision goggles and rifles fitted with infrared scopes,” adds Frey. “There will be a 700-metre perimeter placed around project sites that will be protected with tripwires. There will also be someone on the bridge looking out at what is happening on the ice floe. However that will still be a challenge at night, especially when visibility is bad during storms. We will have to take constant care. Bears are a serious issue.” Nor will wildlife be the only risk. Extreme Arctic weather also poses danger as Frey found out during his last expedition. The N-ICE2015 project, led by the Norwegian Polar Institute, was a forerunner of Mosaic and involved the research vessel Lance getting frozen into the Arctic pack ice in January 2015 to study sea ice for several months. “It was a mini-Mosaic,” says Frey. “Just half a year in a much smaller boat.” A lot of lessons were learned nevertheless. “Four weeks into the expedition, a huge storm shattered the ice floe into pieces,” he says. “Our equipment was thrown everywhere and some became frozen into the ice. It was a horrible mess. People were up to their waists in slushy, ice-cold water and after a while we had to abandon equipment as well. We had to reset our position and start all over again.” What happens in the Arctic does not stay there. It affects the rest of the planet. It touches us all This time, Mosaic’s explorers have got themselves a bigger boat and will have a larger ice floe, so they are hoping they will be no repeat of the hardships their predecessors had to endure four years ago. “This is an extremely important project because it is clear that what happens in the Arctic does not stay there,” says Wilkinson. “The weather there affects the rest of the planet. It touches us all. Just consider the issue of ice. It reflects about 80% of the sunlight that pours down on it. Remove that ice, as we are doing now, and sunlight will shine straight on to the dark ocean. Its dark waters will absorb up to 80% of the radiation that hits it. Further heating is inevitable. “In other words, ice is essential. It controls our weather patterns. But it is changing in nature and amount in the Arctic. And that is one of the driving forces of the Polarstern. It is going to help us re-evaluate our knowledge of the new Arctic that we are creating.” "
"The Bank of England’s powers to tackle climate change risks in the financial system could be given an overhaul to reflect the scale of the “emergency” facing the planet, John McDonnell has said. Speaking after Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, used an article in the Guardian to warn financial firms that they faced an existential risk from global warming, the shadow chancellor said Labour was exploring ways to retool Threadneedle Street.  Welcoming Carney’s intervention in a tweet on Wednesday, McDonnell appeared to suggest that more action was required to meet the challenges of climate change. Mark Carney's intervention is breakthrough moment. In addition to rewriting government spending criteria we’ll now consult on changing the Bank of England's mandate to reflect the climate change emergency highlighted by #ExtinctionRebellion Rebellion demo. https://t.co/n7M7qBnp8j McDonnell has been examining various ways to reshape the Bank’s mandate, which is set by the government, should Labour come to power. He has previously focused on giving Threadneedle Street greater powers to direct the lending of commercial banks into more productive sectors of the economy, and away from property speculation. Labour is also considering ways to funnel more investment into green industries and technologies, which will encompass how the role of government and other agencies, such as the Bank, can be used to tackle climate change. The party has already said it would rewrite the Treasury’s green book, the manual for government spending decisions, and that the Office for Budget Responsibility, the tax and spending watchdog, would be mandated to consider climate risks in its economic forecasts. The Bank said on Wednesday it would disclose an assessment of how it managed climate-related financial risks as part of its 2019-20 annual report, a regular update on its work, which will come out next year. Carney said the central bank would adopt the framework of the taskforce for climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD) – a G20 initiative calling on commercial banks to disclose their lending to companies with carbon-related risks – to publish details of its own risks from climate change. “We need to lead by example and by providing such disclosures, we will be playing our part to secure the transition to sustainable financial system,” he said. Campaigners have argued that the Bank could do more to tackle risks from climate change, including forcing the mandatory disclosure of carbon-related assets, rather than asking banks to consider doing so. Threadneedle Street could also force banks to set aside more money to protect from losses on carbon assets, or encourage them to lend to green projects by reducing the amount of money they are required to set aside. Rob Macquarie, an economist at the lobby group Positive Money, said: “Central banks have a crucial role to play in decarbonising the financial system, but continually present their mandates as a restriction against adopting certain climate-friendly policies. We therefore welcome moves from the Labour party.”"

"Nathan, who was into his second day of protest, was sitting in the road in Piccadilly Circus in front of a large “rebel for life” banner laid across the ground. He was wearing boots stained blue with spray chalk. “We need to do something drastic to have action,” he said. “For the past 40 years we have known about climate change and we have tried to go through governments and peaceful marching through the streets and it hasn’t done anything.” Nathan has been working with Extinction Rebellion as an organiser, which he said had been an incredible experience. “I was able to pick up so many skills … I’ve met some amazing people.” He said he would be surprised if he made it to the end of the week without getting arrested. “I’ve had a couple of warnings from the police already,” he said. “But I’ve had training so I know my rights, I know what to do, so it’s not like this terrifying thing.” Asked what his parents thought, Nathan said they were not particularly pleased. “They were like: ‘We are glad you’re fighting for a cause, but if you get a fine we are going to be mad.’” Spindel had been in London since Sunday and said she was supporting friends who were prepared to be arrested, although she had decided to try not to be arrested herself. “I am just terrified that we will wipe our species out and take many others with us,” she said at Waterloo Bridge. “I feel like our politicians are simply not doing nearly enough. We have been peacefully demonstrating about this issue for so long with no impact that I think this is our last chance to do something in time. “I have discussed this with my family and they are very proud and fully agree with my stance on this, although they are worried about me getting arrested.” Clarke said she hoped the protest would encourage politicians “to engage with the facts and begin to create the space to take meaningful action”. “There is nothing else left to do,” she said at Waterloo Bridge. “We have tried protesting and we have tried making our case to the government calmly but they don’t listen. Now I feel we have to take part in civil disobedience in an attempt to meet the huge challenge we face. But because of Brexit it is very difficult at the moment to get our voice heard. It is frustrating because when you take a step back it is clear Brexit will be nothing if we don’t save the planet. Few people seem to realise that but that is genuinely the scale of what we are talking about here. “I hear some people in government and politics do get this … If ordinary people like me – I am not a hardcore environmentalist or activist – are prepared to take a stand and even get arrested then surely that has to count for something?” Kennedy was handing out Penguin biscuits to protesters as part of her duties as a wellbeing steward at the Extinction Rebellion event in Edinburgh. “I’m here because I’ve got grandchildren and I really think something has to be done,” she said. This was Kennedy’s first environmental protest, although she also marched against the Iraq war, and she commended the “really lovely” atmosphere. It was the significance of the protest that had brought her here, she said. “This is just so important. You have to be here – or be dead.” She said her role was to help maintain the atmosphere, keeping an eye out for anyone who looked like they were becoming upset or angry, and intervening before things escalated. Noting Monday’s protests in London, she said: “It’s not just happening across the UK but across the world and I don’t see it ending any time soon. It’s going to take a lot to make governments wake up to their responsibilities.” “The main reason I am doing this is because our government is lying,” said Griffiths, who was taking part in the blockade of Waterloo Bridge in London. “They are lying about issues on which there is concrete scientific consensus. For me it is totally unacceptable to lie against scientists who have spent their careers painstakingly researching this stuff. “Protests around these environmental issues have been going on for decades and nothing has created meaningful proportionate change. I don’t want to be arrested but I am prepared to do that because what else is there? Write a letter to my MP, join Greenpeace – none of it seems to make much difference, so I feel there is no option but to take a stand.” Finegan, also at Waterloo Bridge, said it was the first time he had been on this sort of protest, and it was “really positive and interesting”. “I am freaking out about the climate, to be honest,” he said. “There have been so many warnings from scientists about what we are facing, it is quite shocking. The government is not facing up to the evidence of what is happening, so I am here to try my best to get them to respond. “My family and friends sort of agree about the climate stuff but don’t really want to face it properly and many of them are not the sort of people to take part in something like this, though I wish they would. But I am terrified. It is quite a terrifying prospect when you look at the facts. That’s why I’m here.”"
"More than 100 people were arrested on Wednesday in the climate protests that have caused major disruption in central London, Scotland Yard said, taking the total number of arrests to almost 400. Activists stepped up the demonstrations on their third day, targeting the capital’s rail network and the home of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Traders in the West End warned that the protests, which have seen protesters block four London landmarks for the past three days, had already cost them tens of millions of pounds. The first estimate of the financial impact of the so-called climate rebellion came as activists targeted London’s rail network. Just after 11am, three people glued themselves to a train at Canary Wharf station, causing delays on the Docklands Light Railway. A few hours later, four protesters glued their hands together and chained themselves to a fence outside Corbyn’s house, saying he was “the best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, adding that they were there to “support him” to go further. Thousands of people, including parents and young children, pensioners, scientists and environmentalists, have taken part in Extinction Rebellion protests. On Wednesday afternoon, the four sites that protesters had occupied in London since Monday – Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus – remained under their control, causing ongoing delays and diversions in the surrounding areas.  Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The Metropolitan police has designated Marble Arch as a legitimate protest site. By early evening, large numbers of police officers had turned out in force at the other three sites announcing they were imposing a section 14 order requiring protesters to leave.  Several hundred officers appeared in Parliament Square, removed sparsely manned roadblocks and took down gazebos, apparently retaking the space without difficulty. However, there were reports that activists had managed to hold the space after the arrival of a samba band, while others tried to set up new barriers around the square. In Oxford Circus, police circulated among the crowd, who had been dancing all day to music from a stage mounted on a pink boat, serving notice on each. Police made a concerted attempt to clear Waterloo Bridge by walking among the crowd and serving section 14 notices on all the people assembled there, telling them they had the right to either to go home or continue their protest in Marble Arch. Anyone who refused to comply was arrested. By 9pm the Guardian had witnessed police carry away at least a dozen protesters, while many others left of their own accord. People who had already been served notice were arrested straight away if they did not leave after a few minutes. There was pandemonium at times as police officers walked through the crowd, picking individuals apparently at random. A large number of police officers arrived as reinforcements at about 8.30pm. However, numbers of protesters remained strong and cheers erupted each time an arrest was made. By 9.15pm they were led in a call and response song and chants of “whose police? our police. Whose hearts? Our hearts. Whose souls? Our souls.” On Tuesday, organisers had warned that they were planning to disrupt London’s rail and tube network, and just after 11am three activists glued themselves to a DLR train at Canary Wharf, unfurling a banner reading, “Climate emergency – act now.” Two people then glued themselves to the top of the train. Another man, who gave his name as Mark, glued himself to the side of the train. The protesters were finally removed from the roof by police at 12.40pm. Cathy Eastburn, 51, was one of those taking part in the transport disruption. She said she decided to make a stand for her teenage daughters. “I don’t want to be here today and I’m really sorry for the disruption, but I feel I have been forced to do this,” she said. “I have two daughters and I can’t sit by while their future is threatened … The government is doing nothing – we have to force them to act.” Gail Bradbrook, one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, who was at the scene, said: “This [Canary Wharf] is the heart of the system that is bringing us to our knees causing huge disruption and chaos around the world … so we want people to pause and reflect.”  A few hours later another group of activists glued themselves together, then chained themselves to the fence of Corbyn’s house. The Labour leader left his home a few hours later saying he never gave interviews, or arranged meetings, outside his house. The activists left shortly after, saying Labour had offered to meet Extinction Rebellion next week. David Lambert, 60, was one of those taking part. “We are here because we are supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and he is the best hope this country has got to get us out of this,” he said. “But we need system change and a transformation of our consumer economy and we know he is a person who has the authority and power to deliver that.” The events in London are part of an international “climate rebellion” organised by the UK-based Extinction Rebellion. Protests had taken place or were planned in 80 cities across 33 countries, from India to Australia, and around Europe and the US. In The Hague , activists occupied the international criminal court building on Tuesday. Twenty-nine arrests were made in Edinburgh on Tuesday night after police cleared remaining activists who who staged a sit-in on North Bridge. By 6am on Wednesday, they had all had been released and charged with breach of the peace, to appear in court at a later date. In London, Extinction Rebellion protesters, activists and legal observers said some of those arrested were being taken to police stations outside of London, lending credence to persistent rumours that the Metropolitan police’s holding cells were reaching capacity. Several people reported cases of people being taken to Luton, Brighton and Essex. The Met would not confirm or deny the claim. On Wednesday, Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of New West End Company which represents Oxford Street and central London retailers, told Sky News the protests were hitting business hard. “We have seen a 25% drop in spend – it was £12m yesterday and obviously we have had disruption today. The impact is customers thinking they are not going to come up over the bank holiday so this could go into the hundreds of millions of pounds if we do not grip this.” "

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman national daily Die Welt here reports on the desolate state of Germany’s renewable energies, particularly solar and biofuel, written by Daniel Wetzel.
Once believed to hold the key to future jobs and prosperity, renewable energies in Germany are now emerging as a complete flop and a national embarrassment.
Coming on the heels of the solar industry collapse, now comes the end of the bio-fuel industry, so reports Die Welt.

For years the transition to renewable energies was sold as an industrial political project: In the sector of renewable energy hundreds of thousands of jobs would be created, they claimed. […] It’s time to put the visionary exuberance under a reality check. The number of jobs in the sector of renewable energy is again shrinking.”

“$130 billion solar flash in the pan”
Germany’s green industry collapse is happening faster than anyone could have ever anticipated, and has caught the media by surprise. Die Welt writes:

The German solar industry is dissolving faster than you can even see. One third of all companies disappeared from the market within one year. Solar power subsidies of more than 100 billion euros [$130 billion] over 20 years have led to only a mere flash in the pan. According to the official numbers, today there are barely 6000 employees in the German solar cell and module production.”

$130 billion for 6000 jobs? That works out to be over $20 million a job!

The cause of the solar energy collapse is in part due to the recent cuts in government subsidies (they’ve realized that it’s too expensive after all) and cheap imports from China.
Such is the miserable state of the solar industry in Germany. Wetzel then writes that also Germany’s highly subsidized bio-fuel industry is on the verge of collapse. In the link, Die Welt writes: “Biofuel production in Germany will likely completely collapse in just a few years.” and that leading German biofuel manufacturer Verbio AG in Saxony Anhalt “is deeply in the red for the first three quarters of its fiscal year” and that the company is reporting “a loss of 143 million euros since July 2012.”
Die Welt now telling readers “to critically question”
What’s especially peculiar is that Die Welt, once (and still is) a big believer of man-made climate change and green energies, seems to have developed sudden amnesia concerning it’s earlier positions on the issue. In the past the leading national daily often wrote highly supportive articles of the green movement, and aimed harsh words at climate science skeptics and green energy critics. Apparently, at least in its latest article, Die Welt now thinks it can lecture readers on the virtues of critical thnking:

The fall of both sectors is a reason to critically question whether it’s possible to usher in high-tech industries and employment miracles by using subsidies.”

My, how profound. Such amazing words of wisdom….and all coming after a mere 20 years and € 100 billion having been squandered.
We all I recall many reports from Die Welt warning of the coming climate apocalypse, and cheerleading for alternative energies like sun and biofuel. Now the once-green conservative daily wants us to “critically question”? Sorry Die Welt but you’re about a decade late, and so you can take a seat in the back.
I’m not blaming Wetzel here, who surely has written some critical pieces. My criticism is aimed at Die Welt’s naive editors. Hopefully they’ve woken up to reality and will soon stop believing the climate fairy tales spread by the PIK and other activist institutes.

"Recently, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, made a private overture to the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, a contact reflecting his view that Shorten, in the absence of “one hell of an upset”, will be prime minister on 18 May. In the event Di Natale’s working supposition is correct, and Shorten goes on to win the campaign, the Greens are Labor’s mostly likely dance partners in the Senate for a range of progressive reforms the ALP is taking to the contest, particularly climate change, which was the focus of the recent overture.  Shorten did not come back to him, but Di Natale says he remains hopeful that two progressive political leaders can find their level. “My hope is Bill Shorten and Labor recognise it’s important to have a constructive relationship with the Greens,” Di Natale says in an interview with Guardian Australia. If Australian voters on 18 May return a parliament where Labor is forced to govern in minority, then the Greens leader has some clear expectations. He wants a seat at the table as Labor implements its climate policy, as happened during the 43rd parliament. “I would hope Shorten would show the maturity that Julia Gillard demonstrated and bring people to the table to negotiate constructively.” In the event it’s not a minority government scenario, if Labor wins outright and the Greens are in balance of power in the Senate, Di Natale also wants it known that his party is prepared to vote against a climate policy it regards as insufficiently ambitious, as the Greens did once before, controversially, in 2009. Ahead of the election, the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, warned the Greens against a repeat of 2009. Butler told Guardian Australia the Greens voting with Tony Abbott against Labor’s first climate policy mechanism during the last period in government was one of the factors in shattering the political consensus at the federal level, which has prevented policy action for the best part of a decade. The Greens leader says it is impossible to be definitive about a post-election decision right now, given Labor’s policy still contains several unknowns, but he says the policy Shorten and Butler are taking to the 2019 election is weaker than the policy of 2016 and “now is the time to base a policy on science”. Di Natale says if Labor’s climate policy, post-election, meets the Greens’ test of ambition, and one of the relevant tests of ambition is “a plan to phase out coal”, then Shorten can expect support. “But if it’s going to lock in failure, then we won’t support it. We will make a decision based on the policy.” The Greens leader is equally clear about his expectations about Labor’s stance on the Adani coal project should it win the election. Di Natale will on Thursday join Bob Brown’s convoy protesting against the proposed mine as it makes its way from Hobart to central Queensland. The Greens leader says he expects a Labor government to block the controversial project. Di Natale says he has zero sympathy with arguments that opposing a project that has already secured major approvals creates a significant sovereign risk problem for a party of government. “If the message we want to send is it’s risky to invest in coal in Australia, then I think that’s the right message,” he says. The Greens go into the contest needing to defend five Senate spots, and the party is ever hopeful of picking up an extra in the ACT. In the lower house, the objective is to return Adam Bandt to Melbourne, and to contest Kooyong, Higgins, McNamara, Wills and Canberra. The party has been plagued by open displays of internal dissent in recent times, and has underperformed in recent electoral contests, although Di Natale says he’s “very encouraged” by the party’s performance in the recent New South Wales election. He insists he’s worked hard to address complaints about the party’s internal culture, and he said the NSW Greens, often at odds with their federal counterparts, now “understood the need to work together”. Asked whether he thought the factional brawling and complaints about party culture had damaged the Greens, Di Natale says “it’s had a very small impact”. Di Natale, who arrived in Canberra presenting as a pragmatic and mild-mannered GP, now has a harder edge to his politicking. He says this reflects frustration that has built up “after spending three years in the parliament with one of the worst governments in Australian history, and I don’t say that lightly”. “It has an impact,” he says. “It has made me determined to throw them out”. Asked whether he has the appetite to remain party leader, given the recent adversity, and given the toxic nature of contemporary politics, Di Natale says party leadership remains the gift of his colleagues. Self-evidently the Greens’ performance in the coming poll will be a critical factor in whether he retains the backing of his party room. But he insists he’s not ground down by the obvious challenges. “I feel very positive about the job at the moment. The party has addressed some challenges and we’ve come through that.”"

It wouldn’t surprise me if the entire climate skeptic movement has already been mapped out and is now being monitored. What’s next? IRS audits? Harassment? We’ve already seen it with the Tea Party.
Warning: German Greens
I agree with much of what is written in the report. But I will warn readers not to trust any German Green. They are no better with the truth than any other historical misfits when it comes to climate science and environmental issues. These people are environmental tyrants dressed in liberty sheepskin.

"On Monday, a day of civil disobedience kicks off around the world. It will be led by climate change activists aiming to bring maximum non-violent disruption to civic life. And among those converging on Parliament Square, London, will be a playwright and a troupe of actors dressed as biblical figures: Noah, a parade of animals (going in two by two, of course), and even God himself. They might, on the face of it, look out of place and maybe even a little comical among the protesters and their placards: Noah’s wife’s dress has a touch of Wag about it, while God will be rocking a sharp white suit with his halo. There will be a crew of townspeople there, all readying themselves for a contemporary enactment of a medieval mystery play.  Mrs Noah is April De Angelis’s riotous retelling of the biblical flood story, starring Ade Adepitan as God and Naomi Paxton as Mrs Noah. But, far from being out of keeping with the day, this Christian tale of rising waves, endangered animals and near extinction of the human race could be the original “climate disaster” warning. “It is about extinction,” she says. “There is no bigger story.” De Angelis is a force of nature, as voluble, witty and rebellious as her work. A seasoned playwright and librettist, her dramas overlap with her activism, from her 80s entry point into theatre when she joined a women-only resistance group called Re-Sister (she chortles at the pun now) to her 1993 drama, Playhouse Creatures, set in the 17th century and exploring the moment when women were allowed to perform on stage.  A desire to place women’s lives at the heart of her stories runs through her work, and Mrs Noah is no exception. In De Angelis’s rebooted mystery play, Noah’s wife is a rebel and upstart, refusing to leave her group of female friends for her place on the ark. De Angelis did not need to invent Mrs Noah’s rebellion: “I had read the Chester Mystery Plays many decades ago and remembered that she refused to get on the ark in that version. It surprised me to reread it and realise that the writer, rather than being in service to the dogma of the church, was really getting inside Mrs Noah’s head.” Paxton feels that her character’s refusal is based as much on her political idealism as her loyalty to her friends. “It won’t solve the problem for Mrs Noah to save herself and her family in the ark. The problem remains, and she would only be moving away from it. She feels it’s an issue for everyone and that she can’t escape it.” It was last autumn that De Angelis had the idea to stage the biblical flood while she was at a meeting with members of Extinction Rebellion, the UK-based climate movement that counts Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry, Philip Pullman, Naomi Klein, and George Monbiot among its supporters. She joined the group after coming across a Facebook post. “I was in a low-level panic,” she says, “and when I read the post it went to high-level panic. I wanted to do something. I was numb and shocked and frightened. I felt ineffectual and without power. Writing this play changed that.” Now that politics appears so broken, she says it may be the case that the arts are becoming “the new politics” for younger generations. It’s certainly a great meeting place for the young to collaborate with other generations: the demographic of Extinction Rebellion ranges from millennials to people of her age. (She is 58.) De Angelis has also written a short duologue – an encounter between two scientists from opposing ideological camps that features bird songs – that will be acted out on street corners as a piece of guerrilla theatre with an eco-message. And, having been commissioned to write a play for the Royal Exchange, Manchester, she is thinking of ways to tell another climate story. The biggest challenge, for her, lies in turning the story of our planet’s destruction into compelling drama. Environmental disaster does not lack the dramatic elements, nor heart-wrenching personal stories. It’s just a case of rendering them in drama effectively. She recalls the divided critical opinions over 2071, a 75-minute talk by the scientist Chris Rapley (co-written with Duncan Macmillan) at the Royal Court, London, in 2014, which some said just wasn’t theatre. “I think he did a good job. There should not be one type of theatre – as long as it engages the audience and as long as it’s not preaching, because people don’t like to be preached to.” Adepitan agrees: “I travel all over the world as part of my job, and I’ve seen the devastating impact climate change is having on communities in Africa whose homes are becoming deserts as a result of global warming. We have to make sure as many people as possible understand how urgent an issue this is, and drama is a powerful and effective way to get to get this message across.” What is striking about Mrs Noah is the humour, song, rhyme and music that has been added to the climate message. God, frustrated by the town’s blindness to ecological danger, says at one point: “Don’t you read page six of the Guardian? The end of the world is coming.” There are plenty of other such moments. De Angelis wanted to insert enough laughs and winking contemporary references to catch the attention of the crowd in Parliament Square. This is essentially street theatre, she says. It must reach out and grab its viewer. • Mrs Noah will be staged at 6pm on 15 April in Parliament Square, London, as part of Extinction Rebellion."
"A report on the state of New Zealand’s environment has painted a bleak picture of catastrophic biodiversity loss, polluted waterways and the destructive rise of the dairy industry and urban sprawl. Environment Aotearoa is the first major environmental report in four years, and was compiled using data from Statistics New Zealand and the environment ministry.  It presents a sobering summary of a country that is starkly different from the pristine landscape promoted in the “Pure New Zealand” marketing campaign that lures millions of tourists every year. It found New Zealand is now considered one of the most invaded countries in the world, with 75 animal and plant species having gone extinct since human settlement. The once-vibrant bird life has fared particularly badly, with 90% of seabirds and 80% of shorebirds threatened with or at risk of extinction. Almost two-thirds of New Zealand’s rare ecosystems are under threat of collapse, and over the last 15 years the extinction risk worsened for 86 species, compared with the conservation status of just 26 species improving in the past 10 years. The scale of what is being lost is impossible to accurately gauge, as only about 20% of New Zealand’s species have been identified and recorded. Kevin Hague from the conservation group Forest and Bird said the report was chilling reading and captured the devastating affects of “decades of procrastination and denial”. “New Zealand is losing species and ecosystems faster than nearly any other country,” he said. “Four thousand of our native species are in trouble … from rampant dairy conversions to destructive seabed trawling – [we] are irreversibly harming our natural world.” The minister for the environment, David Parker, said the report offered “no big surprises” but reinforced the importance of cleaning up the waterways and becoming carbon neutral by 2050. “If, with all our advantages, New Zealand can’t overcome its environmental problems, then the world won’t,” Parker said. A massive rise in the country’s dairy herd over the last 20 years has had a devastating impact on the country’s freshwater quality, a key area being targeted by the government for improvement. During her election campaign, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, pledged to make the country’s rivers and lakes swimmable again for the next generation. That could prove challenging, with the report finding that groundwater failed standards at 59% of wells owing to the presence of E coli, and at 13% of the wells owing to nitrates. Some 57% of monitored lakes registered poor water quality, and 76% of native freshwater fish are at risk of or threatened with extinction. A third of freshwater insects are also in danger of extinction. Forest and Bird said the main culprits for worsening freshwater quality were the intensive use of fertilisers, irrigation and cows. The Green party co-leader James Shaw, who is also the minister for climate change, said the environment was taking a further hammering with the effects of global warming starting to be felt, including sea-level rise, increasing land temperatures and warming ocean temperatures. “All the issues in this report are made worse by climate change and that is why this government is so determined to take strong action,” Shaw said. “The introduction of climate change legislation, establishing an independent climate change commission to guide emissions reductions, and the just transition to a low emissions economy are vital.” Hague said while the findings were sobering, the reality was far worse as the report missed “dangerous marine heatwaves” and the inadequacy of marine protections, with less than half a per cent of New Zealand’s sea area protected by marine reserves. “We must not waste any more time in fundamentally changing the way we interact with nature,” he said. “We need an economy that nurtures and restores our environment, not one that trashes it.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSwiss news magazine Weltwoche (World Week) print edition just published a stinging article about the now disgraced IPCC’s fifth assessment report Summary for Policymakers where it describes the refusal by scientists to acknowledge observations and their obstinate clinging to faulty models and doomsday scenarios.
Figure right: from Weltwoche report, “Faulty Prognoses from Scientists”
The introductory heading of the Weltwoche reports reads:
For a quarter of a century leading climate scientists have been warning of a dangerous global warming due to CO2 emissions. Now under Swiss leadership [Thomas Stocker] they publish a new report. It shows: The scientists were wrong. By Markus Schär.”
Weltwoche writes how IPCC lead scientist Thomas Stocker may have experienced an historic moment when he introduced the IPCC’s AR5 Summary for policymakers, but one he may not wish.
Crumbling consensus
Weltwoche writes that in the days leading up to the report’s release, a dispute prevailed among the delegates who were busy hammering out the final text. The Germans wanted no mention of the 15 years of no warming, the Belgians wanted to keep the year 1998 out of the statistics, the Hungarians advised to hold back facts in order “not to provide climate skeptics with ammunition“.
Weltwoche writes that Dutch delegates, however, insisted on including the natural impacts on climate change which refuted the claims of galloping global warming. One thing is sure, writes Weltwoche, the IPCC must come to terms with: “The consensus among the climate scientists that had been cemented over the last decades, is cracking – or is even crumbling completely.”
“Pitiful” model performance
To explain what is driving this crumbling consensus, Weltwoche looks at the history of global warming, reminding readers of the doomsday prognoses made in the past by experts like NASA’s James Hansen and by the IPCC years ago. For example in 1988 James Hansen “predicted that with an annual increase in CO2 emissions of 1.5%, the temperature would rise by 1.5°C by 2011. But in fact CO2 emissions rose 2.5% annually and the temperature ended only 0.3°C higher – even below the value that scientists had calculated if no CO2 had stopped being added beginning in the year 2000“.
Worse for the IPCC, British meteorologists recently forecasted a cooling ahead for the next few years, Weltwoche writes.
Weltwoche comments as follows on this miserable performance:
Anyone that far off is not a scientist, rather he’s a fortune teller – and one with a pitiful performance.”

IPCC devestated by observed data
Today, the IPCC’s latest report ends up contradicting all the earlier forecasts and warnings it made earlier. Weltwoche writes (my emphasis):
In its new report, the IPCC refutes itself. … They [scientists] tried time and again to defend their theory using tweaked models and honed studies. It gladly made itself vulnerable to attack by making forecasts that it could not live to see. After 25 years many of the forecasts can indeed now be evaluated – the result for the IPCC is devatasting.“
IPCC abandons Mann’s flawed hockey stick
Weltwoche then explains the sorrowful story of Michael Mann’s hockey stick in depth and how it was shown to be flawed by a Canadian statistics expert and how the IPCC eventually abandoned it altogether in that they conceded that the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age were real after all. Weltwoche writes:
The draft of the new IPCC report also admits that the same warm temperatures we have today also prevailed at the peak of the Medieval Warm Period and that people suffered later on during the ‘Little Ice Age’ – the climate Bible of 2001 with its hockey stick chart was obviously wrong.”
Lomborg: 20 trillion euros for 0.05°C
Weltwoche writes that the IPCC has (quietly) reduced CO2 climate sensitivity values, yet continues to insist that the world embark on a crash-course energy supply transformation. Too expensive, says Danish scientist Bjorn Lomborg. Weltwoche quotes Lomborg:
But we also need to recognize that our current climate policy is too expensive. Every year the EU wants to spend 250 billion euros until the year 2100. With this 20 trillion euros, the temperature will drop by 0.05°C by 2100.”
But none of this impresses Stocker and the IPCC, who continue sounding the alarms louder than ever. Weltwoche concludes:
The important thing is alarm, as Stocker continues to maintain what he told Weltwoche in April: ‘The problem is there, and it is one of the biggest ever for mankind, and we have the choice of how big it is going to be.'”
In the models, or in reality?

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote here and here on how the junior partner (the FDP) of Angela Merkel’s coalition government has moved to block the re-appointment of Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber as the Chairman of the WBGU advisory council for another 4-year term.

WBGU advisory committee: Left to right: Nebojsa Nakicenovic, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber (Chairman), Inge Paulini (General Secretary), Claus Leggewie, Sabine Schlacke, Stefan Rahmstorf, Renate Schubert, Jürgen Schmid, Reinhold Leinfelder, Dirk Messner (Vice Chairman). Source: wbgu.de/beirat/.
The WBGU directly advises Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government on matters concerning environment and climate. It has ten members – all of them leading professors from various fields.
The FDP party, coalition partner of Merkel’s government, is growing increasingly dissatisfied with the direction and views of the influential WBGU advisory council, and apparently has decided that a major overhaul is long overdue. As Spiegel wrote yesterday, read here, the WBGU has become only a circle of Schellnhuber’s friends where debate on climate issues is unwelcome. The members of the WBGU are alarmists and are demanding that the government take drastic steps to curb CO2 – advice that the business friendly FDP classic liberal party finds inappropriate and increasingly off the wall. The FDP controls the Ministry of Economics, and it is that very Ministry that refuses to approve the re-appointment of the current board. The FDP party is seeking an overhaul, demanding fresh faces and ideas.
The approaching demise of the Schellnhuber and the current WBGU may have been in the works for a long time. The advisory council seemed to meander off from reality, and advocated naive plans that made no economic or scientific sense.
Over the years, Schellnhuber and his WBGU began showing a clear pattern of activism, dogmatism and a lost sense of reality.
In 2008 Professor Schellnhuber, who is also director of the climate-catastrophe-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in a video with somber tones that the Earth would explode if the world population reached 9 billion, read here. In 2009 he claimed that unless the world heeded his message, “the Earth’s population would be devastated“, adding that “the carrying capacity of the planet is below 1 billion people.”
In Schellhnhuber’s and the WBGU’s mind, the climate science was settled and CO2 was going to warm the planet some 6°C by 2100 unless their plan for drastic reductions was implemented. To curb CO2 emissions, Schellnhuber and the WBGU introduced in April 2011 its “Masterplan” for “The Great Transformation” of global society, read here, which called for a more authoritarian global government, watered-down democracy, and the marginalization of climate science dissidents and skeptics. Prof. Hans von Storch called this sort of arrangement where citizens and society have no say and are expected to just sit there and listen to clever scientists explain how the situation is, and what policy has to be implemented, as “almost a Medieval political understanding”, read here. He even went on to say that some of the PIK scientists seemed to have “taken on the role of prophets“.
Schellnhuber even once repeated in a video the preposterous claim that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035.

Frustrated by the slow progress Germany seemed to be making in leading the world to a carbon-free society, Spiegel wrote that Schellnhuber publicly criticised Angela Merkel, read here. Some may argue that this incident showed the growing rift between Merkel and her climate advisor.
In recent years, it became clear that Germany’s transition to renewable energy was causing severe energy inflation for consumers and hurting German industry. But rather than slowing down the pace to a green energy economy to alleviate the pain consumers were feeling, Schellnhuber and his WBGU insisted that the government defy the laws of economics and push the green agenda even harder – consumers be damned. The advisory council seemed to have lost its sense of reality.
Then, in what for many appeared as totally bizarre, the WBGU recently published a 140-page comic book (for the indoctrination of children) where Schellnhuber and his WBGU colleagues are portrayed as heroes rescuing the planet from greenhouse gases, read here. The comic book even portrayed carbon emitters as villains that had to be stopped.

The WBGU clearly had forgotten its original mission, and lost its reality bearings. The combination of their comic book, their denial of economic reality, and criticism of Merkel last year probably led to the events of the last weeks. Now it appears FDP party chief Philipp Rösler has no problems dealing with the WBGU and giving Schellnhuber the heave ho.
Criticism of Schellnhuber’s brand of science came to head early this year as Professor Hans von Storch published a stingingly critical book that aimed harsh criticism at activist science, particularly at Schellnhuber’s Potsdam Institute. The book carries the subtitle: “The dangerous proximity of politics and climate science“. Hans von Storch accuses them of having oversold the science.
Yesterday Spiegel named a number of former scientists who have also become highly critical of the WBGU, read here.
Reaction to the news of Schellnhuber’s blocked appointment was met by jubilation on the skeptic side, and outrage on the warmist side. Some called the block the move “outrageous“, with one former green minister describing it as a “mass mobbing“. But one Dutch scientist, a longtime critic of the IPCC and the PIK, sent me an e-mail and called the news “sensational”.
Whether Schellnhuber ends up staying or not, expect new faces to join the WBGU, and thus the end of the advisory board as we know it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDepleted of scare stories, the global warming scare industry is desperate and has resorted to the latest scare tactic, claiming that warming leads to violent conflict.
The online Spiegel reports here on a study appearing in the journal Science by Solomon Hsiang et al claiming that global warming causes shortages in resources and thus increases the risk of war and violent conflict. The title of the Spiegel article: Global Warming: Study on Climate Change/War Met With Harsh Criticism.
In a nutshell, Spiegel discovers that the Hsiang study is hardly worth the paper it’s printed on.
The Hsiang study is even too absurd for the leftist Spiegel to swallow. In their study, Hsiang of the University of California in Berkeley and his team of researchers conclude:
We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate’s influence is substantial: for each 1 standard deviation (1σ) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14%.”
Spiegel writes, according to Hsiang’s study, that should the global temperature rise by 2 – 4 sigma by 2050, then the frequency of violent conflicts could rise by 50% in some regions. No region is exempt, the scientists say.
“Gross errors and a distortive selection of data”
Even the left-leaning Spiegel finds that assessment suspicious, and so the renowned news weekly asked a number of top experts (most of them warmists) and discovered that they massively criticize Hsiang’s findings and flat out dismiss the study’s conclusions. Spiegel writes that the:
Experts accuse the authors of gross errors and a distortive selection of data.”
Data was cherry-picked
Jürgen Scheffran, Professor for Climate Change and Security at the University of Hamburg and his colleagues evaluated 27 studies and found that 16 were statistically significant in showing that global warming increased the probability of violent conflict, but that 11 studies said they could actually have the opposite effect, i.e. decrease the likelihood of violent conflict. Eight of these papers were not even considered by Hsiang and his colleagues, Scheffran says.

Moreover, Spiegel then writes that Oslo economist Halvard Buhaug is quoted saying that Hsiang and his team “ignored data”. Worse, Buhang says that the “authors used data that produced the strongest results“.
Alternative explanations were “wiped off the table”
Spiegel writes that Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, was also highly critical of Hsiang’s methodology, saying that alternative explanations were “wiped off the table” in order to give climate fluctuations maximum power as an explanation. Spiegel writes:
All in all, Marotzke says that he is ‘skeptical when it comes to the robustness of the results’.”
Authors confused weather with climate
Spiegel also reports that economics professor Richard Tol of the University of Sussex also has expressed “massive criticism” on the Hsiang paper, saying that the authors confused weather as climate. Spiegel writes:
Most of the Hsiang team’s evaluated studies had to do with weather phenomena, Tol believes. ‘Forecasts on the conflict-enhancing effect of future climate was therefore strongly exaggerated’.”
Hsiang et al ignores man’s ability to adapt
Finally Sociology Professor Nico Stehr and climate scientist Hans von Storch also told Spiegel that the worst error in the Hsiang study was that it ignores man’s ability to adapt to weather and climate events. Hans von Storch says “they falsely assume that man’s reaction to climatic stimulations would be unchanged“. Another expert reminds us that man will be even better equipped in the future to adapt to changes than we are today.
Readers will find a complete debunking of the preposterous notion that warmer climates lead to more violent conflict, read here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s renewable energy feed-in act, the EEG, forces power grid operators to buy up all renewable energy produced in Germany and to feed all of it into the power grid, whether it is needed or not. The aim is to squeeze out the fossil fuel energy that’s fed in. The problem however is that wild, unpredictable fluctuations in the supply of wind and solar energy often lead to huge, uncontrollable grid overloads.
The print edition of the Handelsblatt described in a feature titled “Energy Madness” how the absurd Germany’s energy feed-in act has become. Hat-tip: Hans Labohm here. He quotes the Handelsblatt:  
For the green energy branch, Sunday June 16 was a special day to celebrate. The sun shone for hours and a strong northwest wind blew across Germany. At 2 p.m. solar panels were sizzling with power and the wind turbines up north were turning strongly. Green energy was being fed into the power grid to the tune of 29,600 megawatts, and so provided 61% of the power demand. Never before had Germany’s power supply been so green.
However, the employees of the power grid operators were far less inclined to celebrate. As is the case every Sunday, the demand for power was relatively small. And as mandated by the renewable energy feed-in act, they were required to somehow get all the solar and wind power to the consumers. After all, green power has the right of way in the power grid. This meant gas-fired power plants had to be shut down, and Holland, Czech Republic and Poland had to accept, against their will, the excess German solar and wind power.
Power customers in the industry were delighted with all the green power on June 16: They could consume as much power as they wanted – and were credited with cash for doing so. One chemical concern that was able to take in more power between 2 – 3 p.m. than thought, did not have to pay the usual 30 to 60 euros per megawatt-hour. No, instead the company got more than 100 euros. The important thing was to somehow get the power out of the grid.
This is a story from Absurdistan, from the land of the Energiewende.”
Large companies with energy gobbling equipment are paid 100 euros for every megawatt they can burn. I guess they switch on as many of their huge furnaces, kilns or whatever and run them empty at full blast. Just burn off as much power as you can! – and get paid to do it.

Just the opposite is demanded in the dead of winter when there is no sun and when the wind dies down. During the week, energy demand soars and their is often not enough supply to meet the demand. And because many power companies are finding it unprofitable to run conventional systems part-time, many are simply mothballing such plants completely, thus making supply even rarer. As a result, the risk of blackouts is becoming a real increasing threat in Germany with each coming winter.
The chart that follows shows German power supply and consumption over the last 30 days. Solar energy is shown in yellow and wind in blue. Gray represents the conventional supply and the red line is the total demand. Often wind and sun spike and excess power needs to get dumped quickly…somehow, somewhere.

Chart source: www.agora-energiewende.de/
Note all the wild fluctuations, and so it is necessary to always have conventional power on stand by for calm sunless days.
Little wonder that the Handelsblatt, once a huge proponent of alternative energies, now calls it “energy madness”. Climate activists and greens, however, claim it’s a model for the world.

"Thousands of students and activists have taken to the streets of more than 50 British towns and cities demanding urgent action on climate change for the third time in as many months. The organisers of the Youth Strike 4 Climate movement said “sizeable events” took place in London, Sheffield, Manchester and Brighton, among other towns and cities. They mirrored events around the world, as protesters from cities as far apart as Helsinki and Delhi took to the streets.  In London, protesters walked across Westminster Bridge waving banners demanding a “Green New Deal”, before bringing Oxford Street to a halt by sitting down in the middle of the famous shopping thoroughfare. Drivers looked out of their car windows, irked as young people banged on their doors, telling them to turn their engines off. Bus drivers sat in traffic on gridlocked streets, their vehicles devoid of passengers. George Bond, 16, one of the organisers of the youth climate strike said that they decided to disrupt London’s busy shopping district because of the link between consumerist culture and climate change. “It’s a stark reminder that in the western world we enjoy a culture of convenience, while people in the global south are working in bad conditions and suffering the most from climate change,” he said. The Metropolitan police said there had been no arrests, though one student was taken into a police van for refusing to move. Earlier, between 400 and 800 students joined a range of youth and leftwing activist groups in Parliament Square. Theo Sharieff, 23, a Socialist Students organiser from Birmingham, said: “To fight climate change we need socialist change.” Creative banners abounded. One youngster held a poster with teenage actor Timothee Chalamet which read “the Earth is getting hotter than Timothee Chalamet”. An eight-year-old, Agnes Freij from St Aidan’s primary school held a banner with a painting of Dr Zeus’ Lorax reading: “I am the Lorax and I speak for the trees.” She told the Guardian: “The Lorax speaks for the trees because they don’t have mouths. Right now I think the trees would be saying, stop this climate crisis.” In the Highlands, Holly Gillibrand, who has gained national prominence for her activism, was on strike for the 14th week in a row, in her usual spot outside her school in Fort William with friends. Gillibrand, 13, was not missing school because the Easter break is under way in Scotland. She said: “I think it’s important to strike during the holidays because people were saying that we were on strike because we got to miss school. This shows were are dedicated and willing to give up our free time for this crisis.” Gillibrand has met Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and wants to see politicians take more action. “We’re a rich, developed country so we need to be reducing our emissions more quickly,” she said. In Sheffield, the former Green party leader Natalie Bennett was among the speakers at a city centre rally. At the end of the London march, a selection of letters were read out by activists at Oxford Circus, including submissions from Yoko Ono, Kate Tempest and Rebecca Solnit. More than 15,000 students took part in the first Youth Strike 4 Climate event in February, which organisers said was prompted by the alarming inaction of the government. Precise figures for Friday’s turnout were not immediately available – but some found it easier to attend as some schools are already on their Easter break. Jake Woodier, of the UK Student Climate Network, said: “Thousands upon thousands of young people across the UK have shown their resolve by continuing to demonstrate for climate justice for the third month in a row, while also demanding a Green New Deal for the UK. “This idea is by the people, for the people and puts people and the planet on an equal footing. The time for action is now.” The youth climate movement was inspired by the Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, 16, who has gone on strike every Friday since August 2018. Thunberg is currently in her 34th week of striking outside the Riksdag parliament building in Stockholm. The latest strikes come after a UN report warned that limiting temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – the point beyond which climate impacts become irreversibly severe – needs new levels of action. On Thursday, the environmentalist and broadcaster David Attenborough told the IMF spring meeting that humans have at most 20 years to prevent the complete destruction of the environment. The Norwich South MP Clive Lewis signalled the Labour party’s support for the movement, writing: “The time for incrementalism has passed. The young people striking today recognise this.” The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has expressed support for the strikes, saying collective action can make a “profound difference”."
"A heavenly green spectacle is spreading northwards across the country as trees open their new leaves. The delicate green of tree leaves in spring is remarkable and perhaps the greatest spectacle is the flush of new beech leaves that are so translucent they cast a green glow across woodland floors. This green colour comes from the chlorophyll pigment in the leaf chloroplasts, the tiny cell bodies that perform photosynthesis. As the young leaves are still developing their chloroplasts, the leaves tend to be a lighter green. The new leaves are also thinner, with fewer waxy or tough layers, making them more translucent. What’s more, the leaves look brighter because they tend to have fewer additional pigments other than chlorophyll, so the green colour can shine through more clearly. But this is only a passing phase before the leaves turn darker green as their chloroplasts mature and the leaves grow thicker and more opaque.  Another striking feature is how the trees in springtime have been tending to come into leaf earlier over recent decades, and that reflects how average spring temperatures across the UK have risen by about 1C over the last few decades. Spring even moves up the country faster for many plants and animals, averaging 1.2mph between 1891 and 1947, and 1.8mph between 1998 and 2014."
"In the manner of a droid desperately seeking a docking station, I am constantly searching for a leader who can offer me some direction and energy in the battle for the biosphere. Until now, there’s been something of a leadership void. Anyone who so much as uttered the words “climate change” might find me looking up at them, awaiting instruction. Now I feel like I can pick and choose. Perhaps it’s because people are competing with Greta Thunberg, the teenage agitator behind the climate strikes, but good adults are stepping into the limelight.  My latest climate crush is Dr Mae Jemison. Despite being famous for spending time in space – she became the first African American female in space in 1992, serving as a mission specialist on the space shuttle Endeavour – she is all about tackling climate change, on Earth and doing it now. The funny thing about astronauts is that they are rare in everyday life but abundant on the climate circuit. Even I’ve met five. They are particularly prized for their “blue marble” moment, the point at which they glimpse the Earth from space. Their macro-perspective gives us some indication of where our micro-actions can help. But what I particularly rate about Jemison (and she is not one of those I’ve met) is the fact that her main message is essentially “get over yourself, human”. The Earth will carry on without you, so get focused on making sure you’re not ejected. Last week, as part of a panel at Women in the World in New York, alongside Oprah Winfrey, she also kicked into touch the idea that we might up sticks and move our chaos to space when our tenancy here ends due to bad behaviour. “We must not use Mars as our Plan B,” she said. Similar climate perspective was shown by Peruvian farmer and mountain guide Saul Luciano Lliuya (another of my personal climate leaders) when he filed a lawsuit against RWE, the German energy giant, alleging that its immense emissions threatened his family, his property and his home city of Huaraz, 6,500 miles away. The case recently entered the evidentiary phase before the higher regional court in Hamburg. That might sound like a boring bit of process, but it’s of fundamental significance. The Lliuya case shows that everyday people can take on big emitters. It’s the David and Goliath showdown of our time. At the last count, 1,302 climate lawsuits were progressing through legal systems across the world. Some of them will win and change the stakes. I’m wary of raising false hopes, but I think we may have found the purpose of Instagram. @ PreachersNSneakers takes a forensic look at the apparel choices of a clique of celebrity preachers that has coalesced around Justin Bieber. Since Bieber embraced evangelical Christianity a few years ago, celebrity-connected pastors have entered the mainstream. These include Chad Veach, sometimes referred to as “Bieber’s pastor”; Carl Lentz, who apparently baptised Bieber in an NBA player’s bath; and one Rich Wilkerson Jr, who officiated at the wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. They amass huge audiences and Instagram followings and rock Bieber-inspired wardrobes. Scrutinising the pictures of pastors at work has reaped rich rewards. Rather literally, the most expensive spot being a pair of Air Yeezy 2 “Red Octobers” worn by pastor John Gray, with a resale value of $5,611. This has raised questions over what the good lord might make of such materialism and whether a megachurch pastor should be a hype-beast. Under fire over his $1,980 Gucci backpack and $794 Traxedos track pants, Chad Veach is the only man of (expensive) cloth to attempt a comeback so far, posting that he didn’t pay for his outfit. He quickly thought better of it and deleted it. As with all trends propagated by social media, we should be wary of contagion. I recommend UK clergy restrict themselves to modestly priced Hush Puppies, with typical orthopaedic support. The last thing we need now is Rev Alan from The Archers attempting to hide his Yeezys under his cassock. Hey, Jude Law, how does it feel to get a 100% approval rating? That’s what I’d ask at the end of the week when images of the actor filming (The New Pope) in white budgie smugglers generated meltdown. It goes deeper than the prurient. Timing was important: Brexit day 9,000 or trunks? But the images also delivered meme heaven and played into a weird trend for objectifying priests (thanks, Fleabag). But the unexpected element was how we felt about Jude. He’s been in our lives for many years. He’s had bad times and indeed bad films. But we’ve always rooted for him. “Has anyone in the history of humankind reacted to losing his hair better than Jude Law?” asked writer Joe Reid as we gloried in Jude’s buff pontiff snaps. It’s not all sunlit uplands. Jude’s briefs have launched a hundred beach-body-ready guides increasing body image pressure on men. They will generate beachwear angst. “Holiday get-up for men is tricky territory,” advised the Telegraph, which is understatement of the year if you’re proposing tight white trunks. My advice – do not go there. But Jude did, and he gave us a day off and broke the internet, so well done."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat Are We Doing To The Biosphere?
By Ed Caryl
There have been many worried papers and articles on tropical rainforest destruction (including by this author), and this destruction’s effect on CO2 sequestration. There are countervailing forces in play, however. Tropical forests cut for “slash and burn” farming are typically allowed to return to the forest state as the soil is depleted after a few years of harvesting crops, unless the ground is reserved for permanent pasture. The crops themselves replace part of the biosphere. In temperate forests, clear-cuts are replanted. Forest regeneration typically takes from 40 to over a hundred years, but the average is probably about 80 years. An evergreen forest destroyed by forest fire that I helped replant as a Boy Scout 60 years ago was recently harvested and replanted again. Another plot in the same area that was clear-cut 90 years ago, was naturally re-seeded and harvested again three years ago. Most of that carbon was sequestered into homes.
CO2 fertilization improves biosphere growth. Present CO2 levels are more than 100 ppm over pre-industrial levels, and are allowing about 15% increased primary biosphere production. The problem is that both forest destruction and CO2 fertilization are not known very accurately for the biome as a whole. The guesses in the literature range from 1.5 Gigatons to 4 Gigatons carbon annually released to the atmosphere from forest destruction, and 10 to 20% CO2 fertilization. In the following figures, 2 Gigatons forest destruction to date and 1 Gigaton future destruction have been used, and 15% CO2 fertilization for 100 ppm CO2 increase.

Figure 1 is a plot of total biosphere assuming 2 Gigatons forest annually burned to date and 1 Gigaton burned annually in the future, along with 15% fertilization for each 100 ppm CO2 increase, plus a 1.25% annual regrowth of tropical forests.

The result is a declining biosphere where destruction exceeds growth until about 1966. But then there is an increasing growth rate since as the CO2 level increases, where growth exceeds destruction.
The amount of carbon taken up by the oceans is another factor that is not known very accurately. The current “consensus” guess is that the ocean takes up half of the carbon that is emitted by man’s activities. Here is my attempt to chart land and ocean CO2 flux over time from 1946 to the present and projecting into the future to 2075. The resulting atmospheric CO2 is also plotted. The historical fossil carbon emissions are plotted, with a future increase to 10 Gigatons annually. The land numbers are based on the data used in notrickszone.com/ and the above 15% figure for CO2 fertilization. The ocean CO2 uptake numbers are based on this paper and are linearly projected into the future.

Figure 2 is a plot of CO2 (blue curve, left scale), biosphere carbon uptake with CO2 fertilization (red curve, right scale), and ocean carbon uptake (green line, right scale).
If the world holds fossil carbon emissions to less than 10 Gigatons per year, CO2 should never exceed 430 ppm, and will begin falling after mid-century. If we put modest effort into tropical forest preservation, and replanting temperate forests, along with other biome improvements, we might stop the increase at an even lower figure. We don’t need to reduce carbon emissions. We will never see CO2 doubling. No one has projected the impact of CO2 biosphere fertilization on the CO2 increase in the atmosphere. NASA has projected that CO2 will be 550 to 800 ppm by the end of the century. This could only be true if the biosphere is severely damaged by forest destruction.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace is back in the media, right where it likes to be. This is what brings in the donations. But this time they are not finding the headlines quite to their liking as 30 of its members are now being accused of piracy by Russian authorities. Piracy? You mean the peaceful and angelic Greenpeace activists may have criminally behaved like pirates?
Greenpeace is arguing that the piracy charge is nonsense. Piracy, after all, “involves weapons and taking control of another vessel” and that isn’t what the activists were trying to do, at least that’s what the mother of a detained Greenpeace activist is claiming.
Al Jazeera writes: “Several activists scaled the oil platform in the Barents Sea to denounce Russia’s plans to drill in the pristine Arctic.”
Unfortunately for the activists, Greenpeace has a long history of taking the law into its own hands and putting other people’s lives in real danger. Many of their actions do involve real violence. Today Ottawa Citizen.com quotes the mother of one of the protesters: “Nicole Paul said her son has travelled the globe the last seven years to defend his ideals and that he once spent a night in prison in Scotland before being released without charge.” No doubt from that the kid probably learned he can get away with mischief simply by fancying himself as a hero who’s rescuing the world.
Russia throws the book at world-saving activists
I have my doubts about the Greenpeace activists being peaceful. My guess is that plenty of video footage was taken during the whole publicity-seeking stunt. And now that the Russian authorities have reviewed all the material, they’ve decided to throw the book at the Greenpeace out-of-control brats. One of the protesters was a Russian free-lance photographer, according to news reports.
Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said the charges are being laid against those “whose only crime is to be possessed of a conscience.” The media also portray the activists as innocent and peaceful protesters, obviously relying solely on Greenpeace statements and not bothering to really check the story.
About three years ago I wrote a piece on Greenpeace violence. What happened in the Arctic waters just seems to fit an all-too-familiar pattern. This time they picked the wrong people to mess with.
Greenpeace has a history of seeking violent confrontation
What follows are some examples and videos of “peaceful” Greenpeace action. Now imagine if the Tea Party or climate skeptics behaved like that.
First let’s recall how a leading Greenpeace official made threats directed at global warming skeptics. Prison Planet writes (my emphasis):
An article carried by the official Greenpeace website written by a Greenpeace member urges climate activists to resort to criminal activity in an effort to reinvigorate momentum for their stalling global warming agenda, while ominously threatening climate skeptics, ‘we know where you live.'”
Next is a video of a Greenpeace ship “peacefully” ramming a Japanese vessel:

Next is an angry and threatening Greenpeace-brainwashed kid, trained to hate those who have a different opinion:

Poor kid will probably have to spend a lifetime in therapy.
Next is Greenpeace resisting arrest in Rotterdam:

Here’s Greenpeace trying to breach security at a G8 meeting. In this fracas some “peaceful” activists were injured:

Also here’s another “peaceful” activist injured by French fishermen, who obviously had become fed up with being harassed:

Just some examples. There are many more out there for sure.
Sure people have the right to protest, but not to put yourself above the law and illegally, and at times dangerously, violate other people’s space.  There are civilized ways of protest.
Greenpeace activists do behave very much like pirates at times, and they do put other people’s lives in very real danger.
Of course their target is not to capture and steal property, rather it is to capture attention – lots of it. The real cash flows in once their on-board filmmakers cut and edit all the raw footage and get it out to the media and television for cash-generating publicity.
What was Greenpeace management thinking sending a group of young, naïve protesters up to the Russian Arctic? Are they using them as pawns for generating cash and publicity? Seems to me that Greenpeace has lots of questions to answer.
If you have a link to a clip of “peaceful” Greenpeace planet rescuers, do post it!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days ago I wrote about an article published in the print copy of Swiss magazine Weltwoche.
That same article also had a side feature story on the myth of climate science consensus titled: Skeptics On The Rise – by Alex Reichmuth.
Reichmuth writes that the claim of a scientific consensus in climate science is nothing but an illusion and that attempts to assert it has become a “ritual“. Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Ban Ki Moon and Naomi Oreskes have all tried to declare the climate science debate as ended. Yet, Weltwoche writes, the skeptics and dissidents are refusing to go away and that their ranks are swelling. Reichmuth cites almost a half a dozen petitions signed by scientists over the years refuting that the science is settled.
And skepticism is not isolated to Europe and USA, but is also found in Japan, Russia. Website Popular Technology.net lists 1100 peer-reviewed publications that support the arguments of skeptics.
Weltwoche also quotes German physicist Horst-Joachim Lüdecke, who wrote in his book Energie und Klima:
Climate skeptics outnumber climate alarmists and have much greater credibility”.
Reichmuth then focuses on John Cook’s survey, calling it one-sided” and that it uses a “trick” to produce the appearance of consensus. Stefan Rahmstorf used the same tactic in a recent interview with the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung:



<!--

That our greenhouse gases are leading to global warming belongs to the foundation of climate science.”
Reichmuth then adds that ‘climate scientists’ use the trick of trying to make skeptics appear as incompetent by claiming they aren’t real climate scientists who can be trusted. Yet Reichmuth points out that experts from other fields are indeed very well equipped to expose errors in climate science.
Even academics who have never researched climate are able to make valuable contributions. This is illustrated by Canadian mining specialist Stephen McIntyre. He showed that the hockey stick curve from leading IPCC scientists was based on a false statistical approach.”
Another example is the duo of Prof Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s IPCC critical book, Die kalte Sonne, which reignited the climate debate in Germany last year.
Reichmuth concludes:
‘The science is settled,’ Al Gore has been claiming for years. Yet there is absolutely no trace of consensus in climate science.”
Weltwoche’s report not only tells us that climate science consensus is a myth, but it also shows that the media in Europe are beginning to add to the dissent.

At Klimazwiebel Dennis Bray reacts to a poorly thought-out attack by Lewandowsky.

Lewandowsky, in reference to the 2003 Survey of Climate Scientists, accuses me of violating ‘all internet survey methodological standards by not recording dates, times, and IP numbers of respondents’.  [….] So please, for all of the conspiracy theory (of any persuasion) critics of the surveys of climate scientists, try to know a little of what you speak before you speak. Apparently Lewandowsky complained that there was ‘no way to check or verify the integrity of the data’ and therefore the data was probably ‘useless’. Lewandowsky said that the study should not have been published ‘without the authors demonstrating the integrity of their data’.  Steve McIntrye goes on to point out that the work of Lewandowsky is not without blemish.”
Lewandowsky and his kind must be more desperate than we thought. When you finally stoop to going after fellow scientists in the way that Lewandowsky has, it represents a “push-comes-to-shove” mode – a last, desperate Hail Mary attempt to salvage the endeavor. Seems Lewandowsky has reached that phase.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Bundesnachrichtendienst (Federal Intelligence Service) BND is Germany’s version of the CIA, and it has just released a report on the threat posed by climate change and CO2 emissions. It claims that the conflicts of the future will be over CO2 emission allowances!

First, readers need to be cautioned that such reports issued by intelligence agencies (always eagerly released to the public) often times have very little to do with reality, and most are designed to manipulate public sentiment. Those familiar with climate science will quickly put the report on par with reports of Martians preparing to attack the planet. In simple terms: it’s a lot of BS.
Germany’s leading political daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) wrote yesterday a piece titled: Bundesnachrichtendienst sounds the alarm on climate change.
The good news: “Energy supply security no longer an issue”
Before getting into the scary CO2 climate conflict details from the BND report, there are some very good news – news we’ve suspected all along – especially amid all the reports on the discoveries of huge shale gas and crude oil reserves popping up almost daily. The BND report writes (my emphasis):
The conflicts of the future now revolve around carbon dioxide. Energy supply security is no longer an issue.”
The bad news however, so projects the BND, is that future conflicts will be about “who will be able to emit how much CO2.” Countries will be fighting over CO2 emission rights, BND scenarios suggest.
Now that there are no longer any natural developments left to fight over like water, oil, food, living space, natural resources, etc., the German government seems to be creating an artificial global conflict by designating CO2 as a pollutant that mustn’t be emitted. Too bad the BND never bothered reading the latest scientific literature on global temperatures and CO2 climate sensitivity. Expect the German government to eagerly use the BND report to justify more intervention into private lives.
Wikipedia writes that the “BND acts as an early warning system to alert the German government to threats to German interests from abroad. It depends heavily on wiretapping and electronic surveillance of international communications.” Somehow from these activities the BND has concluded that climate is the worst threat.

Green Party officials immediately seized on the report. The FAZ quotes Green Party chief Simone Peter: “Whoever keeps using fossil energies such as coal and oil, accelerates climate change, exacerbates international conflicts, and is messing with the coming generations of the future.“
The BND writes that the problem is that emerging countries will emit increasing amounts of CO2 as they develop, thus quickly exhausting the world’s emission allowances, which in turn will lead to international conflict.
Another problem is America’s booming shale gas revolution, which will act to depress prices worldwide. Consequently renewable sources will have no chance to compete. Cheap US coal is already being exported by the USA to Germany, throwing sand into the gears of the country’s renewable energy transition. The FAZ adds:
And the earlier worries of oil and gas reserves running out are gone. [..] The reason for this is new technologies that have made it possible to exploit previously in accessible reserves.”
Again the historical pattern of false doomsday scenarios is once again clear and confirmed…developing, unexpected technology repeatedly canceling earlier seemingly certain projections of disaster. Five years ago few people believed the world had enough reserves of fossil fuels to last 50 years. That was one of the argumentation pillars used by green energy proponents. Today we find ourselves practically drowning in fossil fuels. Prices are in a free fall.
Any journalist investing 30 minutes time researching earlier projections made by intelligence services globally will find most of them at one time or another issued doomsday reports of “fossil fuels running out and global conflict erupting as a result.”
Expert: CO2 conflict claims are “pure comedy”
These earlier doomsday projections probably were legitimate at the time, as it did appear reserves were in decline: The data suggested this to some extent. But the latest projections that CO2 will lead to conflict are not even based on data and observations, but on bogus computer scenarios. They are utterly baseless.
In an email, geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning called the BND’s latest CO2 conflict claims “pure comedy” and “brain-washing”.
The BND also states that in the future there is going to be a “CO2 disposal problem” because CO2 concentrations are expected to reach the critical 450 ppm level, a level that activist scientists say may cause the climate “to tip”.

"Richard Di Natale has warned Bill Shorten should ignore the Greens at his peril when it comes to climate change action. The Greens leader committed to hold Labor to account in the Senate on its pledge to legislate the coalition’s national energy guarantee.  Di Natale said he had reached out to the Labor leader, after the opposition committed to the Neg as a way to end the climate wars. Asked if he was genuine about cooperation or would stick to pure positions, Di Natale said the ball was in Shorten’s court. “I have reached out to Bill Shorten. It is up to him to decide whether he wants to continue to ignore the Greens. He does that at his peril,” Di Natale told ABC TV on Sunday. “At the moment, what he’s doing is adopting a weaker policy on climate than the policy he took in 2016, which is weaker again than the 2013 policy.” Earlier this week, the Greens MP Adam Bandt wouldn’t say whether the minor party will torpedo Labor’s policy if it is viewed as insufficiently ambitious, as the party did in 2009 when it rejected Kevin Rudd’s carbon pollution reduction scheme. “The Greens in the Senate will work hard, cooperatively, pushing Labor, holding them to account and making sure we do what needs to be done,” Di Natale said. The Victorian senator seized on a report in the Age newspaper revealing the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority believes limiting the average global temperature increase to 1.5C or below “is critical to maintain the ecological function of the Great Barrier Reef”. “We’re on track to exceed that,” Di Natale said. “The scientists are saying that the Great Barrier Reef is gone if we continue to burn coal and ship it off overseas.” While the major parties have flagged they may pause electioneering over Easter, Di Natale said he’ll be part of an anti-Adani coal mine convoy across the country. “We won’t be doing anything on Anzac Day. We will be campaigning hard through the Easter period,” Di Natale said. Di Natale believes the Melbourne blue ribbon Liberal seats of Higgins and Kooyong are “winnable for the Greens”. “What stronger message can the people of Higgins and Kooyong send to the Liberal party than to elect Greens in those seats and say: ‘We are sick of the climate denialism of the Liberal party’,” he said. He said bullying problems within the Victorian Greens ranks have been sorted. “We’ve reformed some of our conflict resolution processes, our candidate management processes, and we’re in good shape,” Di Natale said."
"Bea Ruiz, a veteran progressive coordinator, has been telling scores of first-time climate change protesters they face being harassed and beaten by police next week. Most seem happy with the deal. “I told a 72-year-old volunteer that he will probably be targeted by police,” said Ruiz, who is based in Eureka, California and is helping organize the first US rollout of Extinction Rebellion, a group founded in the UK that has grabbed attention through disruptive protests leading to mass arrests.  “He paused and then said: ‘OK, yes.’” Following a foray into New York in January, several thousand protestors will aim to cause similar mischief in dozens of US cities next week. “This is a coordinated rebellion that targets industry and government indefinitely, to shut the country down,” Ruiz said. “In my 30 years plus of activism I’ve never seen so many everyday people worried in such a visceral way, for themselves, their children, their grandchildren. It’s unprecedented.” Some activists hope the arrival of Extinction Rebellion will be a watershed moment for the US environmental movement, shifting it from what they see as a tepid response to the cavalcade of disasters threatening the livability of the planet. Extinction Rebellion is aimed at spurring a muscular, punkish outpouring of civil disobedience, snarling cities and frogmarching politicians towards meaningful action. In the UK, Extinction Rebellion members have caused uproar by halting traffic on bridges in central London, stripping naked in parliament and blockading the BBC. Last week, protestors glued themselves to the entrance of a fracking conference. “Troublemakers change the world,” said Roger Hallam, one the group’s founders. Elsewhere in Europe, Swedish teen Greta Thunberg sparked a series of walkout strikes by schoolchildren over the sclerotic response by adults to climate change. Such sustained protest, in countries where planet-warming emissions are sharply falling and gasoline-powered cars are increasingly banned from city streets, is unusual in the US, where the Trump administration has promoted fossil fuels, dismantled climate regulations and overseen a rise in emissions. American protesters have shown willingness to chain themselves to oil drills or, in the case of the Keystone XL pipeline, be rounded up outside the White House. Native Americans, regularly subject to the collateral damage of extractive industry, rose up in the face of savage policing during the Standing Rock protests of 2017. But some activists feel forceful confrontation needs to become the norm. “The mainstream environmental movement has been asking so little of people here, whereas we are saying, ‘We are in danger and we are asking you to act accordingly, to put your lives on the line,’” said Ruiz. “Very commonly, the big environmental groups will send emails saying, ‘Donate $5 today, call your congressman’ and then ask for very symbolic action where people won’t be held for long. “We want to remind people that people in civil resistance in the past have been willing to risk their lives. The Freedom Riders [of the 1960s civil rights movement] signed their wills before they got on the buses. We have no time left, we have no time for incrementalism.” Differences in policing approaches could be a factor in the varying intensity of protests. Extinction Rebellion, which cites nonviolent disobedience in the mold of Mahatma Gandhi, triggered dozens of arrests but no fights when activists shut down five London bridges in November. By contrast, police in North Dakota deployed water cannon and rubber bullets against protestors at Standing Rock. “We are incredibly lucky in England to have a police force that isn’t perfect but is honourable and maintains peaceful protests,” said Tiana Jacout, a UK-based Extinction Rebellion organizer. “You can be willing to martyr yourself by going to prison here but it’s a different ball game in America. “It’s easier to protest when you’re not being brutally beaten. I just hope they can get the revolutionary bug again.” Some experienced climate campaigners reject the idea that their actions have not matched the fervor shown by their European counterparts, pointing to a raft of marches and other actions to decry Trump’s disdain for climate science and its dire implications for millions of Americans who risk being upended by flooding, wildfires, extreme heat and water insecurity. Trump’s term has also seen cities such as San Francisco declare a “climate emergency” and the emergence of the Green New Deal, a Democrat resolution urging a second world war-level effort to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Activists are nagged by the timed nature of the challenge, however: according to a landmark United Nations report the world has little more than a decade to avert disastrous ravages from climate change. “I think it’s crazy that we have to do this in order to get politicians to act on the greatest crisis we face but manifestly we do,” said Bill McKibben, the co-founder of climate group 350.org and a Guardian contributor who estimates he has been put in handcuffs “seven or eight times”. “Nonviolent direct action is never an end in itself, but carefully used it underlines the moral urgency of the moment. I think it mostly needs to become bigger, everywhere. And dramatic action – conducted with care, so that people aren’t turned off – has a serious role to play in that.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I bring an assortment of short, unrelated stories.
1) Hans von Storch at Klimazwiebel comments of the WBGU.
Hans is known for his direct speech and speaking his mind. Yet, I found a comment he left at his blog even more direct than usual – about the German FDP party blocking the re-assignment of the WBGU, the advisory board of alarmist “experts” who are tasked to advise the German government of matters concerning the environment and climate.
For me the WBGU is essentially a club of alarmists that is suffering from planet-rescue fantasies and a chronic overstepping of competence. Actually it is a good thing that a political group is for once requesting a reining in.”
Unfortunately the latest news is that the FDP party has ended its resistance to the re-appointment of the WBGU members. So they will still be there, yet no one says they will have to be listened to.
2. Stefan Rahmstorf concedes natural factors (at least when it cools).
At the German RealClimate sister-blog klimalounge, bedwetter in-chief Stefan Rahmstorf boasts about the Klimalounge site getting a million hits since coming online 5 years ago (NTZ reached that mark after just a year, and WUWT gets three times that every month). Anyway, while boasting about that, Rahmstorf brings up the global temperature stagnation, telling readers not to worry, the climate catastrophe is coming. For those who question this:

The answer is still the same as in 2008: no, global warming is unfortunately not over and has not slowed down significantly, the deviations from a steady, continuous warming trend are part of the usual short-term fluctuations, which are caused by, among other things, El Niño, ocean circulation fluctuations and solar activity.”
(My emphasis) At least he finally admits natural factors, though only for the short-term. So you see how simple it is for them.  When it cools, it’s because of natural factors. But when it warms it’s all because of CO2. Not surprisingly, this is how they’ve rigged their models. And so you warmists can all go on wetting your beds without worry.
3. Joe Bastardi on climate science at his Saturday Summary of the 4th of May (see video, right side bar). The warmists he says are only making excuses when they start changing the terminology:
You folks have to understand that it’s been getting cold in a lot of places and that it hasn’t been reported on. And of course, the value, if you want to call it that, in this climate fight that is going on, the value is that it’s waking some people up in America. They’re saying, ‘Where in the heck did this come from?’ And again, I don’t think you can change the playing field from global warming to climate change. You know, you just change the terminology – you know you’re wrong about what is going on, and you’re giving us excuses. So that’s what I think. Get used to it because that’s what nature does.”
4. Neil Cavuto in a Fox News interview with Joe Bastardi on Al Gore’s latest unhinged performance in Hollywood, at the end of the clip:
He’s nuts, by the way. I just think he’s nuts. But that’s just me.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn the second half of June, global warming catastrophe worshippers were already salivating worse than Pavlov’s dogs when Arctic sea ice melt accelerated at a dizzying rate (see 2nd chart down below).

Some datasets even show a refreeze occurring in late July! Source: http://arctic-roos.org/cearea.png
But in mid July, something happened unexpectedly: the North Pole saw one of its coolest summers since instrumental records have been kept, and sea ice melt also slowed down markedly, proceeding at a rate we normally only see only in the second half of August, see chart that follows:

As the slope lines show, the rate of melting in the second half of July is something we normally see an entire month later, in late August.Source: http://ocean.dmi.dk/icecover_current.png.

Suddenly all the salivating among the alarmists has turned to gloom – no Arctic meltdown on which to feast upon this year.
But hope is still holding out among the alarmists as there is a chance some freak storm or something will scatter the sea ice and send the 2013 curve downwards to a near record low. But if 2013’s current course continues, then it will wind up closer 2005-2006 levels. That of course would be a major setback for the alarmists, who then would have to search elsewhere for disaster stories this fall. The next 10 – 14 days will be decisive.
Already we are getting close to being a solid 1 million sq. km over last year, as to most datasets. The DMI even shows us approaching 1.5 million sq. km over last year. If that keeps up, it’s going to be painful for the alarmists.
As far as Antarctica is concerned, record highs are being recorded daily. Here we have absolute dead silence from the media and purveyors of gloom.
As the chances for an Arctic sea ice melt disaster fade with each passing day, expect the focus of the alarmists to increasingly shift to the hurricane season.

"European lorry makers face having to cut the carbon dioxide emissions for new trucks by almost a third by 2030, while a UK government body has called for a total ban on new petrol and diesel heavy goods vehicles by 2040. Lorries are the latest target of attempts to radically reduce vehicle emissions and force the automotive industry to move away from fossil fuels amid increased concern over global warming and air pollution.  The European parliament on Thursday will vote on laws that would force lorry makers to cut carbon emissions from new trucks by 15% by 2025 and by 30% by 2030. Lorries, buses and coaches produce more than a quarter of the EU’s CO2 emissions from road transport and about 6% of total CO2 emissions, according to EU data. It is thought to be highly likely that the proposals will pass the parliamentary vote. The new rules would apply to the UK after Brexit, as the government is committed to emissions standards that are at least as ambitious as current arrangements governed by the EU. Separately, the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), which is appointed by the Treasury, on Wednesday said British ministers should ban the sale of new petrol and diesel heavy goods vehicles no later than 2040, matching a similar ban on internal combustion engine cars. The vast majority of goods vehicles on British roads run on diesel because of its higher fuel efficiency. However, the NIC said that the industry would be able to move to hydrogen fuel cell and battery lorries in the early 2020s. The haulage industry and business groups have strongly objected to the NIC’s proposals. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, described the proposed ban as “simplistic”, not realistic and not credible given the lack of alternative fuel sources for long-haul heavy goods vehicles. The tougher attitude towards lorries comes amid a crackdown on carbon emissions across the road transport sector. From 2021, EU carmakers will have to meet an average CO2 emissions target for new cars of 95g per kilometre. The looming deadline has raised the prospect of carmakers paying billions in fines for failing to improve their carbon footprint. Only Tesla and Smart already meet the target out of 50 major brands, according to analysis by Jato Dynamics, a data company. Jato suggested the car industry could pay as much as €33.6bn (£29bn) in fines from 2021 if it remained at 2018 emissions levels. However, Transport & Environment (T&E), a Brussels-based campaign group, has raised multiple concerns that carmakers are using loopholes to game the system, avoiding the penalties. T&E highlighted the potential for carmakers to sell “fake” electric cars, hybrids that mainly rely on petrol power alongside a little-used, low-range electric motor. Selling more electric vehicles means carmakers are allowed to meet less stringent carbon-reduction measures. Fiat Chrysler is planning to use another loophole to avoid a big fine for producing dirty cars, reportedly paying Tesla hundreds of millions of euros so that the US carmaker’s electric vehicles – with zero direct carbon emissions – are included in its fleet. Pooling emissions in this way is legal but means that the carmaker’s overall carbon emissions will likely fall more slowly than if it stopped producing cars that run on fossil fuels. An Fiat Chrysler spokesman said: “The purchase pool provides flexibility to deliver products our customers are willing to buy while managing compliance with the lowest-cost approach.” Julia Poliscanova, T&E’s manager of clean vehicles and emobility, said: “Fiat bet excessively on diesel technology and now is paying the cost of declining diesel sales due to the air pollution crisis in our cities. “They could have followed other paths to make cleaner cars and thus meet the CO2 targets, like accelerating sales of electric cars or converting some of their heavy-polluting SUVs as plug-in hybrids. At one point, bad business choices come back to haunt you.” Miriam Dalli, a Maltese Labour MEP who was part of the negotiations on the EU carbon limits, told the Guardian the rules had faced fierce opposition from the industry and some member states, including industry-backed studies with “unrealistic assumptions that led to totally misleading results”. She added that the European commission would also test cars under real-world conditions to avoid a repeat of the “dieselgate” emissions cheating scandal, in which Volkswagen installed software to trick emissions tests."

"The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has chided EU leaders for holding three emergency summits on Brexit and none on the threat posed by climate change. In a clarion call to Europe’s political leaders ahead of European parliament elections in May, the founder of the school strike movement said if politicians were serious about tackling climate change they would not spend all their time “talking about taxes or Brexit”. In a typically blunt speech, she said politicians were failing to take enough action on climate change and the threats to the natural world. “Our house is falling apart and our leaders need to start acting accordingly because at the moment they are not,” the 16-year old schoolgirl from Sweden told a standing room-only meeting of MEPs and EU officials in Strasbourg. “If our house was falling apart our leaders wouldn’t go on like we do today,” she said. “If our house was falling apart, you wouldn’t hold three emergency Brexit summits and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and the environment.” While climate change is sometimes discussed at the EU’s regular summits, the issue has never dominated because Brexit, migration or the eurozone crisis have monopolised the attention of Europe’s top leaders. In August 2018 Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden when aged 15. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings. Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. Greta’s 10-minute speech was interrupted by frequent applause and ended with a 30-second standing ovation. Before she began speaking, many in the room rose to their feet to applaud and take photos of her as she sat on the podium surrounded by cameras. As the young climate activist spoke of a “sixth mass extinction”, her voice faltered. “The extinction rate is up to 10,000 times faster than what is considered normal, with up to 200 species becoming extinct every single day,” she said. “Erosion of fertile topsoil, deforestation of the rainforest, toxic air pollution, loss of insects and wildlife, acidification of our oceans – these are all disastrous trends.” She was applauded after getting to the end of the passage and continued the speech without faltering again. Greta had previously addressed the UN climate change summit in Poland and the World Economic Forum in Davos since her lone protest outside the Swedish parliament last August triggered a worldwide school strike movement to raise the alarm about climate change.Neither was it the first time Greta had taken her uncompromising message to the EU institutions. In February, she told an audience including the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU needed to double the ambition of its climate targets. At that time, the parliament’s senior leaders, led by the European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, decided against inviting Greta to address MEPs in the parliament’s debating chamber. Centre-right and liberal groups argued against the invitation, which had been proposed by the Greens. Objections ranged from the potential vulnerability of a child exposed to the chamber to a desire to reserve the plenary address for politicians or senior officials. The meeting took place in the more low-key setting of a special meeting of the European parliament’s environment committee. Noting the imminent European elections and the fact that her generation could not vote, Greta urged MEPs to listen to scientists and millions of children who had taken part in school strikes. “In this election, you vote for the future living conditions of humankind,” she said. Referring to Monday’s fire at Notre Dame in Paris in her speech, Greta called for “cathedral thinking” to tackle climate change. “It is still not too late to act. It will take a far-reaching vision, it will take courage, it will take fierce, fierce determination to act now, to lay the foundations where we may not know all the details about how to shape the ceiling,” she said. “In other words it will take cathedral thinking. I ask you to please wake up and make changes required possible.” • This article was amended on 17 April 2019 because an earlier version misquoted Greta Thunberg as saying: “The extinction rate is up to six times faster than what is considered normal”. Thunberg said “up to 10,000 times faster”. This has been corrected."

It’s late, and so hopefully there won’t be too many misspellings. It seems the global warming regime is imploding in Germany.
A short time ago a report at the online Spiegel, authored by Axel Bojanowski, appeared concerning the blocked Schellnhuber-appointment as director of the WBGU. More details are surfacing. The once influential WBGU council appears to be in for a major overhaul. A major shake-up would spell the end.
The WBGU is the advisory council for the German government on environmental issues, and it is one of the oldest councils in Germany, existing since 1992.
Spiegel writes that “an ominous dispute has obstructed the start of the advisory council” and that “it has been reshuffled. The situation is curious“. The legislative period for the WBGU actually ended in late October last year, and it is now awaiting approval by the government in order to resume its work. However, the German Ministry of Economics, headed by FDP chief Philipp Rösler, refuses to give its stamp of approval.
Bojanowski writes:

According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, four of the council members are to be replaced; the nine WBGU-members are all considered to be environmentally oriented professors.”

It appears Merkel’s junior coalition partner the FDP is pushing to replace some members with others who have economic expertise – in order to create a council that is more balanced and to give it a completely new orientation. The four professors that are aimed to be replaced are: Ellen Matthies, environmental psychologist; Frauke Kraas, geographer; Uwe Schneidewind, economist; Peter Lemke, polar/ocean scientist.
Spiegel adds:

Especially in the Ministry of Economics there are reservations against Schellnhuber, the WBGU Chairman. He would be ‘retired professor in the middle of his term and by then will have been a member of the WBGU for a quarter of a century’ – this is the stated reason given to SPIEGEL ONLINE from circles within the Ministry. In order ‘to revitalise the debate’, they have proposed two economists as alternatives.”

The FDP part of the government is obviously fed up with the climate dogmatism that has blinded the WBGU and the general arrogance that has taken over.

Clearly Merkel, and especially the opposition Greens and environmental activists, want to keep a lid on the turmoil that has erupted. The last thing the environmentalists want is a public debate to erupt and to rage on for weeks. Now with Spiegel focusing on the issue, keeping the lid on will be increasingly difficult to do.
Spiegel writes that over the years the WBGU has become a circle of Schellnhuber’s friends.

‘The voice of economic reason’ is missing says a council member from the 1990s. The WBGU has become a sort of a circle of friends of the years-long Chairman, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber.”

Spiegel writes that the WBGU’s latest report drew harsh criticism. “The council renewed its demand for a ‘Great Transformation’ of civilization.” Critics even labelled the council an “eco-dictatorship”.

The ‘ideological pamphlet’ damaged the WBGU, former colleagues of Schellnhuber griped. It confirmed the fear that Schellnhuber lacked counterparts in the council. In the 1990s the WBGU was occupied completely by ‘neo-liberal economic scientists”, the old colleagues disparagingly call them today.

As Spiegel online describes it, the WBGU is due for a major overhaul. The target is to produce a council of debate, and not one filled with people who nod yes every time Pope Schellnhuber says something.
According to political scientist Susanne Cassel of the “Econwatch”, Spiegel writes, “councils like the WBGU always kept their discussions confidential in order to be able to present only their consensus.” Openness was only on the surface.
Near the end of its article Spiegel tells us that the WBGU’s influence was not that great after all.
Also former Saxony President Kurt Biedenkopf regards the impact of the assessment reports as very limited: ‘Ongoing councils are for the most part ineffective,’ he said. Sometimes the assessments gave the politicians a bad conscience. However, only very few proposals were ever implemented.”
It looks more and more like Germany’s FDP Party is about to knock down a major domino. This may be the tipping point we’ve been waiting for.

"The catastrophic effects of climate change are already visible around the world. From blistering heatwaves in North America to typhoons in south-east Asia and droughts in Africa and Australia, no country or community is immune. These events damage infrastructure and private property, negatively affect health, decrease productivity and destroy wealth. And they are extremely costly: insured losses have risen five-fold in the past three decades. The enormous human and financial costs of climate change are having a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing. The impact of climate change has compelled governments to act. Catalysed by the Paris agreement, governments around the world are putting policies in place to limit the global rise in temperatures to 2C, and preferably as close to 1.5C as possible. The actions undertaken by individual countries will deliver a collective transition to a low-carbon economy. But this transition brings its own risks. Carbon emissions have to decline by 45% from 2010 levels over the next decade in order to reach net zero by 2050. This requires a massive reallocation of capital. If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist.  The prime responsibility for climate policy will continue to sit with governments. And the private sector will determine the success of the adjustment. But as financial policymakers and prudential supervisors, we cannot ignore the obvious risks before our eyes. That is why 34 central banks and supervisors – representing five continents, half of global greenhouse gas emissions and the supervision of two-thirds of the global systemically important banks and insurers – joined forces in 2017 to create a coalition of the willing: the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). On Wednesday, this coalition’s first comprehensive report seeks to translate commitments to act on climate-related financial risks into concrete action. The four recommendations in the report provide all central banks, supervisors and the financial community with deliverable goals that will help to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. We therefore call on policymakers and the financial sector to do the following. First, integrate the monitoring of climate-related financial risks into day-to-day supervisory work, financial stability monitoring and board risk management. Supervisors are encouraged to set expectations to ensure financial firms are adequately addressing the financial risks from climate change, including by conducting scenario analysis to assess their strategic resilience to climate change policy. Firms are encouraged to take a long-term, strategic approach to the consideration of these risks, and to embed them into their business-as-usual governance and risk-management frameworks. Second, lead by example, specifically central banks are encouraged to integrate sustainability into their own portfolio management. Third, collaborate to bridge the data gaps to enhance the assessment of climate-related risks. Public authorities should share and if possible make publicly available any climate-risk data. Fourth, build in-house capacity and share knowledge with other stakeholders on management of climate-related financial risks. An important element to achieving effective consideration of climate risks across the financial system is to support internal and external collaboration. The success of these recommendations relies on two important factors, which lead to two broader calls to action on disclosure and classification of climate-related financial risks. First, to support the market and regulators in adequately assessing the risks and opportunities from climate change, robust and internationally consistent disclosure is vital. The market and policymakers must continue to work together to determine the most decision-useful metrics for climate-related financial disclosures. Second, the NGFS encourages regulators to develop an adequate classification system to identify which economic activities contribute to the transition to a green and low-carbon economy. This will be particularly valuable in supporting financial actors to make sustainable investment and lending decisions. If the financial community acts on these recommendations we will be two big steps closer to ensuring an orderly transition to a low-carbon economy. We recognise that the challenges we face are unprecedented, urgent and analytically difficult. The stakes are undoubtedly high, but the commitment of all actors in the financial system to act on these recommendations will help avoid a climate-driven “Minsky moment” – the term we use to refer to a sudden collapse in asset prices. As long as temperatures and sea levels continue to rise and with them climate-related financial risks, central banks, supervisors and financial institutions will continue to raise the bar to address these climate-related risks and to “green” the financial system. We need collective leadership and action across countries and we need to be ambitious. The NGFS is the core of the response of central banks and supervisors. But climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a crucial role to play. • Mark Carney is governor of the Bank of England.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week in Potsdam, Germany, the First World Conference on Climate Impact took place.
No matter how many studies come out contradicting the models of catastrophic climate change, the Potsdam and IPCC scientists insist catastrophic warming is a fact and can only be averted by implementing drastic CO2 reduction measures, i.e. transforming society. The catastrophe is just postponed a bit.

In the press conference video above at the 7:19 mark, Connie Hedegaard tells the press concerning the Otto et al paper:
“I was in my home city of Copenhagen last weekend, and there last week some knowledge came out that maaaaybe things are slowing down a bit because, yes, we have past the 400 parts per million mark, but did the temperature really follow suit? And I think the interesting things is that there is something in the nature of man that makes us grasp this so that you immediately find the headlines: “Climate Change is Postponed” or we can wait to do something, you know that sort of headlines. Although if you sort of came down to the details you could see that no,l it just meant that maaaaybe we have a bit more time… .
In other words she is telling everyone not to believe any news suggesting that climate warming has slowed down. Don’t believe the observations, just believe the models.
Schellnhuber was hardly able to hide that he too is puzzled by the 15 years of no warming and the claims of the Otto et al paper. At the 34:08 mark of the video above, a journalist asks Schellnhuber about the temperature stagnation we’ve seen over the last 15 years and the Otto et al paper:
First of all, this was a sort of a Leserbrief, a correspondence to Nature Geoscience, which was done actually by former members of the Potsdam Institute who work at Oxford University. And if you read it carefully, it tells you 2 different things: The first one is the long-term projections of the climate models are confirmed actually. So it means the big picture is intact. The second is, just taking into account what you said, what happened over the last 15 years, since the big El Nino event in 1998 actually. There has been a slowing of global warming at the Earth’s surface, yes, which is very important. Taking that into account, simply the projections, again projections, for the next two, three decades have been revised a little bit to the lower side, actually. So we see no surprise because everybody can see that we didn’t have a steeper rise in global temperature in the last decade as we had in the previous decade. But if you now analyze this, why does it happen? And there has been a number of important scientific papers on that recently, which did not make it to the media, is people had analyzed where does the heat go to? Because if you look at satellite data at the top of the atmosphere, you clearly see we have an excess of energy, more energy going into our planetary system then what is going out. This is the first law of thermodynamics: energy is conserved. So it has to go somewhere. So now obviously most of it is now going into the deeper layers of the ocean. And you have to appreciate that the top three meters of the ocean globally contain as much heat as the entire atmosphere. So things are going deeper down. Then of course you will have a certain slowing down of what is happening at the surface. So what we probably see now is a sort of saturation of deeper ocean layers, …but once the job is done, the surface will warm once again, and even faster actually later on. This is by the way accompanied by, if you look at the data as I did this morning, you had many more La Nina events, that is the cool phase in the Pacific, in the last decade then you had in the previous decade. This is in a sense precisely in a La Nina event the oceans more or less take up heat while in an El Nino event they release heat. So just wait for the next big El Nino and we will have again a boost in global temperature. So again, what does this tell us? It simply tells us that global warming does not happen in a linear way where every year the same amount of warming happens. Nobody was actually expecting that, we always talk about natural variability. So I’m as a physicist not at all surprised and there’s no reason, unfortunately, there’s no reason to call off global warming.”

Unbelievably, Schellnhuber says nobody was really expecting a steady rise (er, except 44 modellers and lots of other scientists), and so is indirectly saying that nobody really expected the models to get the short-term (first 20 years) right.
What Schellnhuber is saying can be summed up as follows: We are not surprised that the short-term (up to 2025) models have been wrong, but we are sure the long-term models are right.

Schellnhuber claims he is not at all surpised by the 15-year absence of warming. Chart source: www.drroyspencer.com.
The only conclusion that one can draw is: If the models up to 2025 are completely wrong, then the long-term models (2100 or 2200) are complete rubbish.
Looking at Roy Spencer’s chart above, the models expected a 0.5° rise from 1998 to 2013 – but we’ve gotten nothing. And the models expect another 0.5°C rise from 2017 to 2022. That too no longer looks tenable given the current ocean and solar cycles.
Schellnhuber’s only option now is to act like he is not surprised about the models getting the first 15 years completely wrong, and to insist the heat will come later, but with more strength.
Haven’t we heard that kind of talk before from slippery investment bankers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterSebastian Lüning’s and Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne site today writes about a new peer-reviewed study that shows that the Arctic is not warming quickly after all. For years alarmist scientists have told us that nowhere is warming happening faster than in the Arctic. Wrong again!

A study by an international team of scientists led by Germany’s Potsdam-based Alfred Wegener Institute was published in September in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. It’s a temperature reconstruction from the Siberian Arctic. By examining pollen, the scientists were able to determine the July temperatures for the transition zone between tundra and taiga over the last 12,000, i.e. the Holocene.
Now here’s the surprising result (quoted from the study’s abstract) my emphasis:
A climate reconstruction based on fossil pollen spectra from a Siberian Arctic lake sediment core spanning the Holocene yielded cold conditions for the Late Glacial (1–2 °C below present T-July). Warm and moist conditions were reconstructed for the early to mid Holocene (2 °C higher T-July than present), and climate conditions similar to modern ones were reconstructed for the last 4000 years. In conclusion, our modern pollen data set fills the gap of existing regional calibration sets with regard to the underrepresented Siberian tundra–taiga transition zone. The Holocene climate reconstruction indicates that the temperature deviation from modern values was only moderate despite the assumed Arctic sensitivity to present climate change.”
Die kalte Sonne site’s reaction:
One exciting result: Today’s summer temperatures are hardly different from the values of the last several thousand years and are even below those for much of the post ice-age time. The otherwise publicity hungry AWI unfortunately failed to even publish a press release on this remarkable new study.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s good to see that there are a few journalists who actually take journalism seriously and question what they are being told. One publication that has been doing a good job on this is Switzerland-based Weltwoche, which has written two pieces about the latest IPCC report. See here and here.
Photo: Alex Reichmuth, Weltwoche.
 Hat tip: Reader Kurt Arner
Now Weltwoche follows up with a commentary by veteran journalist Alex Reichmuth, titled: “The Perspiration of Fear” and Climate appearing in the print edition. In it he writes that the alarmist warnings of the IPCC have become a worn-out ritual, having little more than a bounce of a dead cat. Moreover, like all other environmental predictions of doom and gloom made in the past, man-made climate change will also be relegated to the dustbin of history.
IPCC has confused the public
Reichmuth writes that if anything, the climate scientists and the IPCC, in their desperate scramble to explain the unexpected changes in climate science, have been only successful in confusing the public. Last winter renowned climate institutes admitted the “climate pause” and the IPCC came under pressure to come up with an explanation for it. Climate change was no longer happening, the public was told, thus contradicting all the earlier claims of run-away warming that the IPCC had consistently preached for years and years. The science had been settled, but then it was not.  So what was the IPCC to do? Reichmuth:
Ultimately the IPCC decided that the pause could be explained as being unimportant.”
As Reichmuth describes it, the move by the IPCC resembled more a last-ditch effort to salvage the global warming scare. He writes:
Indeed only with great difficulty is the IPCC able to hide that it has a serious problem. […] If the thermometer remains stuck at its current level for a few more years, then all IPCC models calculations will become irrelevant and the basis for justifying CO2 reductions would be gone. So the IPCC decides to ignore the warming pause and claims that global warming continues and that man is responsible.”

And so the media and public get their cue to resume their panic. Few, however, are listening anymore.
In the 1980s dying forests refused to die
The call to resume the climate panic reminds Reichmuth of the 1980s forest die-off scare. Soon, because of man-made acid rain, the globe would become a barren wasteland, it was claimed – unless of course mankind stopped industry immediately. But the forests defied projections and refused to die. And as is the case today with CO2, authorities refused to acknowledge that reality and relentlessly insisted that the forest was indeed dying. Reichmuth writes, “It didn’t help. Just a few years later it become clear that the forests weren’t dying.”
Reichmuth writes that the IPCC is now threatened with the very same fate of irrelevance. Even worse the public is losing interest and few are heeding their cries of “wolf” anymore. Reichmuth points out that today only 39% of Germans (who for years had been relentlessly bombarded by dire predictions of a climate catastrophe and shielded from real dissenting views) are afraid of climate change  – that figure was 62% just seven years ago. The same trend holds for Switzerland. Reichmuth:
In 2007 the Swiss media databank reported 5200 articles that contained the word “climate change”. In 2009 the figure was down to 3700. This year at the end of September it was just over 1500. With the other environmental ‘hype stories’ a phase of declining interest was always followed by forgetting altogether”.
Scare goes from acid rains…to acid oceans
The environmentalists are on the move again to the next scare story. They went from population explosion in the 1960s, to global cooling in the 1970s, then to acid rain in the 1980s before moving on to global warming in the 1990s, and today they are gearing up to retrofit their freak show over to acid oceans.

"The president of the Seychelles has made a plea for stronger protection of the “beating blue heart of our planet”, in a speech delivered from deep below the ocean’s surface. Danny Faure’s call for action, billed as the first live speech from a submersible, came during a visit to an ambitious British-led science expedition exploring the Indian Ocean depths.  “Oceans cover over two-thirds of the world’s surface but remain, for the most part, uncharted. We have better maps of Mars than we do of the ocean floor,” Faure said. “This issue is bigger than all of us, and we cannot wait for the next generation to solve it. We are running out of excuses to not take action, and running out of time.” The president was speaking from a manned submersible 120 metres (400ft) below the waves, on the seabed off the outer islands of the African nation. Wearing a Seychelles T-shirt and shorts, Faure said after his speech that the experience was “so, so cool”. It had made him more determined than ever to speak out for marine protection, he said. “We just need to do what needs to be done. The scientists have spoken.” The oceans’ role in regulating the climate and the threats they face are underestimated by many, even though, as Faure pointed out, they generate “half of the oxygen we breathe”. Scientific missions are crucial in taking stock of underwater ecosystems’ health. Small island nations are among the most vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. Land erosion, dying coral reefs and the increased frequency of extreme weather events threaten their existence. During the expedition, marine scientists from the University of Oxford have surveyed underwater life, mapped large areas of the sea floor and explored the depths with manned submersibles and underwater drones. Little is known about the oceans below depths of 30 metres, the limit to which a normal scuba diver can go. Operating down to 500 metres, the scientists were the first to explore areas of great diversity where sunlight weakens and the deep ocean begins. By the end of the mission, researchers expect to have conducted more than 300 deployments, collected about 1,400 samples and 16 terabytes of data and surveyed about 25,000 sq metres (269,100 sq ft) of seabed using high-resolution multi-beam sonar equipment. The data will be used to help the Seychelles expand its policy of protecting almost a third of its national waters by 2020. The initiative is important for the country’s “blue economy”, an attempt to balance development needs with those of the environment. “From this depth, I can see the incredible wildlife that needs our protection and the consequences of damaging this huge ecosystem that has existed for millennia,” Faure said in his speech. “Over the years we have created these problems. We can solve them.” About 5% of the world’s oceans are protected. Countries have agreed to increase the area to 10% by 2020. But experts and environmental campaigners say between 30% and 50% of the oceans outside nations’ territorial waters should get protected status to ensure marine biodiversity."
"James Cook University is considering its legal options after the federal circuit court ruled it had unlawfully sacked a professor who had criticised scientific research about the climate change impact on the Great Barrier Reef. Peter Ridd, who was the head of the physics department at the institution from 2009 until 2016, took legal action against his dismissal.  Judge Salvatore Vasta ruled on Tuesday the 17 findings made by the university, the two speech directions, the five confidentiality directions, the no satire direction, the censure, the final censure and the termination of Ridd’s employment were all unlawful. “Some have thought that this trial was about freedom of speech and intellectual freedom. Media reports have considered that this trial was about silencing persons with controversial or unpopular views,” Vasta said in his judgement. “Rather, this trial was purely and simply about the proper construction of a clause in an enterprise agreement.” The judgement noted Ridd had been in trouble with university management for contacting a News Corp journalist and making media appearances on Sky News after dark claiming he had breached a code of conduct. Ridd had started a GoFundMe page asking for donations to fund his legal expenses and he also published material from the internal disciplinary process on a blog. A number of media articles were also published where it was obvious that Prof Ridd had spoken to the journalist involved, the judgment said. “Professionally, Professor Ridd had been concerned with the quality of the scientific research that had been published about the state of health of the Great Barrier Reef,” the judgment said. “He had published a number of papers on the need for better quality assurance. In his opinion, the health of the Great Barrier Reef had been frequently misrepresented.” Judge Vasta said the university has not understood the whole concept of intellectual freedom. “[The] university has ‘played the man and not the ball’,” he said. “Intellectual freedom is so important. It allows academics to express their opinions without fear of reprisals. It allows a Charles Darwin to break free of the constraints of creationism. It allows an Albert Einstein to break free of the constraints of Newtonian physics. It allows the human race to question conventional wisdom in the never-ending search for knowledge and truth.” The Townsville-based university’s provost professor, Chris Cocklin, noted the judgment does not refer to any case law. “We disagree with the judgment and we maintain we have not taken issue with Dr Ridd’s nor any other employee’s rights to academic freedom,” Cocklin said in a statement. “Dr Ridd was not sacked because of his scientific views. Dr Ridd was never gagged or silenced about his scientific views, a matter which was admitted during the court hearing.” The case has been adjourned for a further hearing to award a penalty. Comment was sought from Ridd."

The American long-term model remains true to a cold winter when compared to the 1961 – 1990 reference period. The two charts show the expected mean temperature in Central Europe in the months of December and January.”
Jung writes that there’s been a shift over the years to colder winters in Europe. After the last, at times, really cold winters, this is no longer a surprise. “The mild westerly wind pattern of the 1990s that provided us with mild and stormy years have gotten markedly less. Increasingly the icy high pressure weather patterns are dominating,“ explains Jung.
Though these long-term forecasts entail a lot of uncertainty, they do tell us what has already become clear: Europe has entered a period of cold winters – like those experienced in the 1970s. It tells us that the chances for a cold one are greater. This winter the dice is loaded in favor of a cold one.
To know for sure, we’ll just have to wait until April.

"If this were a film about humanity’s last hope before climate change wiped us out, Hollywood would be accused of flagrant typecasting. That’s because Dr Joanne Chory is too perfect for the role to be believable. The esteemed scientist – who has long banged the climate drum and now leads a project that could lower the Earth’s temperature – is perhaps the world’s leading botanist and is on the cusp of something so big that it could truly change our planet.  She’s also a woman in her 60s who is fighting a disease sapping her very life. In 2004, Chory was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, which makes the timetable for success all the more tenuous. “We’re trying to do something that’s a huge, complicated thing even though it sounds so simple,” Chory says. “Plants evolved to suck up CO2 and they’re really good at it. And they concentrate it, which no machine can do, and they make it into useful materials, like sugar. They suck up all the CO2, they fix it, then it goes back up into the atmosphere.” She is now working to design plants capable of storing even more carbon dioxide in their roots. Her Ideal Plant project uses gene editing – via traditional horticulture and Crispr – to do so. On a large scale, this could suck enough carbon out of the atmosphere to slow down climate change. This concept basically splices the genes of regular crops and everyday plants like beans, corn and cotton, with a new compound that makes them absorb more carbon. Their roots then transfer it to the soil to keep it there.  This approach essentially supercharges what nature already does. “I get worked up when I talk about the project,” Chory tells me in an office at the Salk Institute, a revered bio research campus at the edge of the Pacific Ocean in southern California. Her desk is full of posies, awards, family photos and framed magazine covers from science journals. “We have to find a way to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and I think plants are the only way to do that affordably,” Chory says. “I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders,” she says, letting out a laugh. “It is a lot of pressure.” Born in Boston to Lebanese parents, the third of six children, Chory received a PhD studying photosynthetic bacteria at the University of Illinois. She spent her postdoctoral years as a Harvard Medical School researcher, then joined the institute in 1988. Along the way, she’s discovered how plants respond to everything from light and environment to how they regulate size and growth. “It’s a philosophical issue, too,” she says, explaining why so many kick the can of global warming. “If I take pain now, maybe my great-grandchildren might see a benefit. People choose no pain now, that’s why we’ve done nothing about climate change.” Every now and then as we speak, Chory’s symptoms pop up like an uninvited guest, another stark reminder of time. Struggling to maintain control and ever aware of the implied humor in her movements, she doesn’t shy from the elephant in the room. “When I get excited I really get moving,” she mock-apologizes, letting out a coy chuckle. “I’m a lot better on Saturdays.” She pauses, collects her thoughts. “That’s why I want to do something that won’t cause pain to people. You never know when you’re making a global change. I don’t know if we can do it, but we have to try.” Temperatures are already at alarming levels even if we reach the Paris agreement of curbing a rise of 2C. The world is headed for major upheaval, it’s merely a question of the scale. If we have any chance as a species, Salk contends, it’s with big ideas like this. Right now, the institute is negotiating with seed companies and prepping tests on nine agricultural crops to introduce Ideal Plants on farms around the world. Field-testing begins later this year with wheat, soybeans, corn and cotton. Developing these Ideal Plants is step one in the Harnessing Plants Initiative, which amplifies root systems and production of suberin – which is essentially cork, or the rind on your cantaloupe, the magic key to plants holding more of that carbon – before transferring these genetic traits to row and cover crops. Given the right resources, and funding, prototypes of each crop are expected to be ready in the next five years. A $2m gift by Howard Newman, a Salk board member and private equity veteran who has invested in oil and gas, jump-started the project last June. In April, Salk received a TED Audacious grant totaling $35m to support the plan. Chory says these new plants will have deeper and stronger root systems that will also stop erosion, another byproduct of warming temperatures, which will make soil more healthy and boost production. When normal plants die, they release large amounts of CO2 back into the air; when Ideal Plants die, significantly less CO2 will be re-released due to more carbon being stored in deeper roots and soil for longer periods, and suberin’s natural ability as a carbon polymer to resist short-term decomposition. The first two meters of the Earth’s soil holds over three times the amount of carbon as the atmosphere, and can hold even more. Fossil fuel use was predicted to rise nearly 2% last year. Each year, we produce 18 more gigatons of CO2 than the Earth can currently handle; Salk believes their solution can achieve as much as a 46% annual reduction in excess CO2 emissions produced by humans. It’s an extremely ambitious idea full of so many unknowns – how to get global buy-in from farmers, how many years will it take for plants to reach maturity and will it then be too late, how will mother nature react to such genetic modification and how will these crops taste – that none of Salk’s brains have the answers to. The institute was founded in 1960 by Jonas Salk, a biologist who discovered the cure for polio in 1955, two years before my own father’s identical twin died of the disease in communist Romania, a place where politics kept science at bay. Standing at the edge of the seaside campus designed by Louis Kahn, a sprawl of ominous cement towers and dramatic ocean views, it all feels straight out of the mind of Philip K Dick. Part Gattaca, part Logan’s Run, it’s easy to see why numerous films have been shot here. But there’s also an optimism in these labs that feels so far from the stark structures and climate narrative I’m used to. Many scientists have told me their role is something akin to historian, documenting the last days of a species or system. Not so here. “There is hope in dreams, in imagination and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality,” Jonas Salk once said. Inside these modernist blocks, they’re dreamers too, but rooted in reality. The biological research center, funded by government grants and private donors, has spent decades inching towards cures for everything from cancer to Alzheimer’s. In 1968, Robert W Holley, Salk Cancer Center’s founding director, won a Nobel prize; in 1975, Institute staff won another Nobel, and again in 1977 and 2002. More recently, Chory was awarded a $3m breakthrough prize for discovering how plants optimize their growth, development and cellular structure to transform sunlight into chemical energy. I see the optimism on a tour with Dr Joseph Noel, a biochemist focused on harnessing suberin, the project’s linchpin. He shows me seed-planting robots, which can bang out a day’s work in the time it would take a human weeks; state-of-the-art grow rooms capable of simulating almost any environmental condition; greenhouses sitting atop dramatic bluffs. All the while he breaks down the importance of cork. “It’s a spongy barrier that helps a plant regulate water coming in and out, gas exchange coming in and out. Think of it like a protective plastic around certain cells in the plant.” The institute’s founder, Jonas, once said “our greatest responsibility is to be good ancestors,” and I think about the quote’s relevance as Noel shows me rows of simulation rooms full of cattails, marsh grasses, Lotus japonicus legumes and weed-like Arabidopsis thaliana, all in various states of growth as LEDs shine and humid air blasts while I take notes. “Instead of just growing in a greenhouse or artificial lights in a lab, we wanted to have the ability to simulate a particular climactic zone: quality of light, seasonal changes, cloud cover, temperatures,” Noel says. Since Arabidopsis “can go from seed to seed in six weeks” and its genome is entirely sequenced and resembles so many other species, the little mustard flower has become the project’s veritable Rosetta Stone. “It’s very easy to change the genetics of it on a massive scale,” he continues. “If we change a particular gene, we can find out if the roots get deeper, do they get more extensive, does the suberin content change. Their early ancestors have been doing photosynthesis for about 2.8bn years.” Without plants, life as we know it wouldn’t exist. The question is whether these ones will become our saviors. There’s a growing field of carbon dioxide removal projects which include machines pulling C02 out of the sky, known as direct air capture. There’s Bill Gates-backed Carbon Engineering and the Zurich startup Climeworks, and about 20 commercial carbon capture and storage facilities worldwide, but they’re price prohibitive.  There have been notable failures: Sir Richard Branson tried a $25m prize for carbon removal but never found a solution. Carbon removal initiatives are also criticized for preserving the status quo and big energy business models. “Ultimately, we all know that humanity’s response to climate change will, as the Ideal Plant project states, make or break our future,” says David Stern, the president and CEO of the Boyce Thompson Institute, a leading plant research facility in New York, who calls Chory a fearless, creative and open-minded scientist. “Given the complexities and scale of the problem, many types of solutions will be needed. Sequestration is undoubtedly one of them.” One big problem, Stern notes, is winning hearts and minds. Genetically modifying organisms saving the planet might be a tough sell in an era when GMO has become the antithesis for the green, organic movement. “While they are not proposing traditional transgenic lines nor are they proposing to do their work in food crops, the issue will still come up,” Stern adds. Chory maintains that plants have been modified for millennia – selecting the best strains to cultivate and taking a hand in their development is a form of genetic modification, after all – and the nutritional and yield values of such tweaked products still outweigh the drawbacks. Salk doesn’t introduce foreign genetic material in its plants, unlike many GMO products. The European Union outlawing modified organisms, plus crops with Crispr traits (as a result, the plants might not make it to the EU). Another issue is seed pricing and getting it to farmers around the world, so the wide-scale use is in question. “As with any GMO crop the big question is how do the changes affect nutritional quality and whether small farmers in developing countries would be able to buy the seeds on a large enough scale to make a difference?” wonders Dan Wenny, a senior biologist who studies land-bird seed dispersal at the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory. Right now, the Mississippi delta in Louisiana is a test zone for a first batch of Ideal Plants in the wild, a major step to see if improved root systems can mitigate sea level rise. Still, Salk researchers are sober to the odds. “Any restoration effort, unlike our Arabidopsis that can grow from seed to seed in six weeks, these systems you plant them and then you wait. You wait a long time,” Noel laments. “We can’t afford to have these experiments not work.” Are we past the point of no return? “The world’s not going to be the world we live in right now,” Chory says. “I don’t know if we’re going to eliminate the whole human species, but I think if we don’t do something soon we will go that route. The misery index of humidity plus the heat will get so high mammals can’t live.” The Union of Concerned Scientists says the tipping point is here. “I don’t think it’s here yet,” Chory counters. Still, she concedes that “migration is already happening. Canada is going to make out well in this. The United States is not. We’re going to have a lot of changes in our agriculture.” She adds: “The farmers are the ones we really have to convince. We can’t continue to farm the way we farm any more. It can feed 8 to 10 billion people but 50 years from now, there won’t be any good soil left so you’re just putting the disaster off.” Chory glances at a picture of her daughter, Katie. “Look at me, I’m 64 years old. I’m not going to be around to see this project go to fruition, I’m not going to be working at Salk, probably. That urgency is there. The climate urgency is there. Every week there’s a new climate disaster. How can we get there? We can’t really get there any faster. I don’t know if we can do it, but I want to be part of the solution. I don’t just want to sit around and complain.” Adam Popescu is a Los Angeles writer. His debut novel, Nima, will be published on 21 May"

"On a recent Saturday in Brooklyn, against the unlikely backdrop of a huge blue-and-white Ikea outlet, several dozen volunteers hand-churned compost. Decomposing food scraps emit considerable heat, and the 6ft-tall compost heaps were warm to the touch. As shovels and pitchforks pierced the compost, gusts of steam rolled off like fog. A three-acre lot-turned-urban farm, the Red Hook Community Farms contains the largest compost site in America powered entirely by sustainable sources. During an orientation for new volunteers, one of the site managers explained that the operation was the brainchild of a lawyer and environmentalist named David Buckel, who supervised it until his death last year. He designed the site’s processes so it would run like clockwork, even in his absence. A woman asked, hesitantly: “Is he the one who … self-immolated?” “Yes,” the manager said. He didn’t elaborate but said he considered the site Buckel’s legacy, and that he and the other two managers felt honored to carry on its work. As the manager talked, a small wind turbine whizzed overhead. Energy from the turbine, plus several solar panels, fed into a generator that pumped air into the compost heaps not being churned by hand. On the other side of the lot grew rows of spinach, kale, tomatoes and other crops, which the farm sells or donates to food pantries. Terry Kaelber, Buckel’s husband and companion of 34 years, often volunteers at the compost site. When I asked him about the site, he thought carefully, then said: “There is something very simple and pure in coming together, in giving up your time, to take people’s food scraps and do the work that will enable those scraps to be turned back, over time, into food.” The site was a microcosm, he said, of the kind of self-sustaining, harmonious society Buckel wanted to build – the kind “I think in some ways we all subconsciously long for”. “I only wish,” he said, “that David had stuck it out.” Early on the morning of 14 April 2018, Buckel – a 60-year-old retired gay rights attorney – left his cozy, garden-surrounded Brooklyn house and walked to nearby Prospect Park. He made his way to a stretch of grass, where he emailed media outlets a statement decrying humanity’s passivity in the face of pollution and global warming. A few minutes later, he doused himself in gasoline and set himself on fire. “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result,” his statement said. “[M]y early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.” With characteristic care, he also left a short note at the scene for emergency personnel. “I am David Buckel and I just killed myself by fire as a protest suicide,” he wrote. “I apologize to you for the mess.” None of Buckel’s family or friends were aware of his intent, and we will never know for certain whether pre-existing mental distress may have contributed to his decision to take his life. But his writing made it clear he viewed his death in political terms and hoped it would galvanize mass action. His statement referred to the Buddhist monks who have burned themselves to death to protest against the occupation of Tibet. As someone who came of age during the Vietnam war, he was also surely familiar with the iconic photograph of Thich Quang Duc, a Saigon monk who self-immolated to protest against South Vietnamese persecution of Buddhists. He may have also known of Norman Morrison, a Quaker who killed himself in front of the Pentagon to protest against the Vietnam war. Around the same period, Jan Palach, a university student in Prague, self-immolated in an attempt to rally Czechoslovaks against Soviet occupation. Before he died of his burns, Palach said his target was less the Soviet regime itself than the fatalism and despair he feared had overcome his fellow citizens. Despite the risk of copycats, most people who have committed political self-immolation have indicated that they hoped to inspire mass mobilization, not further death. Sometimes mobilization does come: when Mohamed Bouazizi, an impoverished fruit vendor in Tunisia, set himself on fire in 2011 to protest government corruption, it catalyzed a mass protest that toppled the country’s dictatorship and inspired similar movements across the Arab world. It is difficult to say why some incidents of self-immolation are perceived as mental health tragedies and others as considered political acts; why some became enduring political iconography and others are relegated to obscurity; and why some catalyze change and others don’t. Buckel had led a distinguished legal career, and worked on famous cases including the Nebraska hate crime that inspired the film Boys Don’t Cry; for that reason, as well as the shocking circumstances of his death, his death received national news coverage. But in a reactive 24-hour news cycle, the story was rapidly buried by the ongoing drama of the Mueller investigation and airstrikes on Syria. The mass action Buckel had hoped for did not come. There was no Prague spring or Tunisian revolution for the planet. Writing in the New York Times less than a week later, the novelist Nathan Englander asked why Buckel’s death received so little attention compared with the “AR-15-level attention that we give the very worst among us”, mass killers. The muted response was probably, in part, an understandable reluctance to glorify suicide. A profile of Buckel in the Times, investigating what might have driven a seemingly healthy man to set himself on fire, acknowledged that the question was mostly impossible to answer. But perhaps there were even more fundamental, unresolvable questions making otherwise sympathetic people uneasy: was Buckel’s death an act of optimism, or surrender? And what is individual responsibility, when confronted by the seemingly insurmountable crisis of a rapidly changing planet? Buckel grew up in upstate New York, one of five children; his father was an agricultural consultant and his mother a florist. As a child he spent some time working on his relatives’ farm, but he was troubled by the slaughter of animals and later became a pescatarian. He met Kaelber while living in Rochester, and they later moved to New York, where they eventually settled near Prospect Park. They shared their home with a lesbian couple with whom they were co-raising a college-aged daughter. Buckel loved the natural world and had a lifelong commitment to environmental issues. His work as a lawyer, however, focused on poverty law and LGBT rights. He spent the bulk of his career at Lambda Legal, an LGBT rights organization based in New York. In the 1990s, when Buckel joined Lambda, LGBT rights were on shaky and sometimes non-existent legal footing. Homosexuality was banned in the military; some states still enforced sodomy laws; and most LGBT rights organizations were focused on securing basic employment and housing protections for gay people and fighting HIV/Aids discrimination. Marriage was far, far away. The legal arm of the gay rights movement was a long-shot insurgency, and attorneys working on LGBT issues sometimes felt as if they were in a jurisprudential wild west. “At the time it felt like, ‘There is no law here, there is no opening for this – so we’re just going to make one,’” Beatrice Dohrn, a former Lambda colleague of Buckel’s, told me. “Once gay rights had more legal footing the landscape changed. But at the time we really were kind of outlaws.” It would be easy, and not totally incorrect, to describe Buckel – fastidious in his habits and devoted to his work – as a strait-laced but formidable lawyer who excelled at working within the system to change it. In one sense, Dohrn said, he was. But that image would obscure his anti-establishment streak. “That suit he always wore?” she said. “That wasn’t David. That was something he forced himself into.” “David was a funny person with a wry, and sharp, wit,” Suzanne Goldberg, another former Lambda colleague, told me. In a parody of the conventions of legal correspondence, he sometimes signed his documents “DB/afq” – “David Buckel/another fucking queer”. He never lost sight of the fact that we were representing real people, often with serious difficulties in their lives But he was also “a careful and deeply committed lawyer”, Goldberg said – a “meticulous” person who brought intense sense of purpose to his work. “He never lost sight of the fact that we were representing real people, often with serious difficulties in their lives as a result of discrimination or harassment.” Although a private person, he radiated sincere interest in others. When you were in conversation with him, Dohrn said, you felt as if you were “the only person in the room”, so intense was his attention. He would ask question after question about your life and interests, listening carefully to the answers, then asking more. You could talk for ages, and only later realize that you never learned anything about him. Advocating for LGBT rights often meant navigating a legal framework in which anti-gay logics were “baked in”, Dohrn said. Lawyers and activists were sometimes forced to accept homophobic premises in order to achieve tactical wins. “A lot of lawyers would look for loopholes in the law, but we were like, ‘No, I don’t want to win that way.’” Buckel exemplified the second attitude. He believed in the righteousness of the cause, and seemed buoyed by faith in human nature. His refusal to compromise and his tendency to embrace uphill battles sometimes vexed his more pragmatic colleagues. Evan Wolfson, a former colleague, praised Buckel’s work but said he sometimes tended to “categorical” or “rigid” thinking. He could be “very black-and-white, very un-nuanced in his initial appraisals of things, and because he was also very methodical and very serious, we would have to kind of reel him back in, or open up a gradation, or try to persuade him to see a more flexible alternative”. His support for pursuing cases in conservative states – Utah, Iowa, Nebraska – considered poor soil for gay rights activism did, however, lead to several landmark victories. And he was also ahead of the curve in embracing issues – such as rights and protections for LGBT youth – regarded at the time as tangential or tactically risky. “The right wing was still very fixated on this idea that we – gay people – were trying to indoctrinate young people”, Dohrn said. To avoid encouraging that trope, gay groups tended to steer clear of issues involving youth. Buckel, however, urged Lambda to take more cases defending young people. They included Nabozny v Podlesny (1996), which determined that schools have a duty to protect students from bullying because of their sexuality; and East High Gay Straight Alliance v Board of Education of Salt Lake City (1999), which overturned the school district’s “unwritten policy” against gay-friendly student groups. He also worked on Dale v Boy Scouts of America (2000), an unsuccessful attempt to force the organization to end its then ban on gay members. He was also an early advocate for transgender rights, which Wolfson said he views as Buckel’s signature achievement at Lambda. In 1993, in Nebraska, two men raped Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old trans man. Teena reported the crime to the local sheriff’s department. The sheriff not only failed to take the allegation seriously, but tipped off the rapists, who murdered Teena and two witnesses. The events inspired a 1998 documentary, The Brandon Teena Story, and the 1999 film Boys Don’t Cry, for which Hilary Swank, portraying Teena, won an Academy award for best actress. With the support of Lambda and other organizations, Teena’s mother, JoAnn Brandon, sued the sheriff’s office and county government. In 2001, the Nebraska supreme court ruled that the sheriff had violated a duty to protect Teena. On the Teena case and others, Buckel’s talent for listening was crucial to earning clients’ trust, Dohrn said; his most powerful weapon was often his empathy. Buckel had always been a conservationist and he had “a revulsion for excess consumption”, Dohrn said. He brought his lunch to work every day in the blue plastic bag in which his morning paper was delivered. When he was looking for a home in Brooklyn, he was determined to find one near a park. He loved gardening and gave plants as gifts. When he retired from Lambda in 2008, it seemed like a good time to devote himself to the environment. While working on grant applications, he became interested in the Red Hook Community Farms. The lot had a small compost site that he believed was underused. With the aid of a grant from the sanitation department, he began expanding the operation into one that could process several tons of compost a week. He was determined to run the compost site, now supported by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the city government, using only human power and sustainable electricity. At the time it was generally considered difficult, if not impossible, to run a large-scale composting operation without significant help from machines. He threw himself at the challenge of proving that thinking wrong, and succeeded. “David often said that if he hadn’t become a lawyer he would have become an engineer,” Kaelber said. “He loved puzzles. In this case the puzzle was how to create a community composting site that didn’t have rats and vermin, that didn’t smell, that didn’t have the negative things people associate with composting. He believed it could be done.” Domingo Morales, now one of the site’s managers, considers Buckel his mentor. “He was the most intelligent person I’ve ever known,” he said. His meticulousness was key to the site’s sustainability and scalability. “Whenever David sent an email to someone it was always a page long. He would answer all these questions that you might have.” Buckel was always upbeat when talking to volunteers, but privately he expressed more doubt. “He was realistic, in the sense that he knew we were barely scratching the surface,” Morales said. “There were times we would get into these discussions on the environment,” Morales said, “and they would get very dark. I got the sense from David that he didn’t really blame other people, but that he kind of considered himself to blame. Any environmental injustice, anything going wrong with the world – he didn’t just get mad at other people, he was mad at himself.” He walked a mile to work every day, to avoid using fossil fuels. He was painstakingly frugal in his habits. He tinkered with the compost processes for ever-greater efficiency. He seemed almost embarrassed of his own life on earth – the space he occupied; the resources he expended – and constantly sought new ways to offset what he viewed as his cost. But it never felt like enough. “I think some of David’s distress was just all that was going on,” Kaelber said. “The gutting of the [Environmental Protection Agency] since the election of Trump; the complete denial of climate change and the science behind it; the fact that they want to open more and more land to oil and gas drilling, instead of focusing on sustainable solutions.” During a conversation about two years before he died, Buckel asked Morales what he thought of the self-immolating Tibetan monks. They argued about the ethics of killing oneself as protest. Morales felt it was a foolish method of protest, especially if someone is a parent or spouse with obligations to living people, but Buckel felt it was an honorable act, maybe the most honorable act one can do. None of his friends or family noticed anything unusual in the days leading up to his death, but Kaelber said he was upset by news that Scott Pruitt, then head of the EPA, was rolling back numerous environmental regulations. Saturday 14 April was a mild day, good weather for composting, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Early in the morning, Morales remembers, “he texted me: ‘Hey, Domingo, I’m going to be out sick today.’ The past couple months he had been training me to run the site without him, but I thought nothing of it. So I said: ‘OK, cool, hope you’re all right, feel better.’ Then a few minutes later he emailed me the letter he sent the news outlets, with an additional note at the top to me. He apologized for leaving the way he did, and leaving me with this responsibility. He told me he was proud of me, personally and successfully, and he ended with a little joke, saying I should hire some temps. He was basically saying ‘the site must go on.’” Those who knew and loved Buckel wrestle with how to talk about his death. At his memorial service, one of the women with whom he and Kaelber were co-raising their daughter articulated the dilemma: they didn’t want to ignore the deep personal desperation they believe influenced his decision, but they also didn’t want to detract from his dedication to causes that meant a lot to him. His statement explaining his death is not a tightly argued, lawyerly brief, peppered with dire statistics about global warming; although it mentions pollution, the actual words “climate change” or “global warming” do not appear. The letter often feels more like a statement of frustration with human nature than about climate change, and reading it buttresses the sense, expressed by some who knew him, that he might have been using his political anxieties to rationalize a decision he had already made. “[My] privilege,” he wrote, is “feeling heavier than responsibility met.” But his concerns about the planet are clear; and, whether or not one agrees with the decision, so was his explanation for his self-immolation. “You know, it was a very conscious, deliberate choice he made,” Kaelber told me. “Not that I was aware of it beforehand. But he never did anything that wasn’t deliberate.” Dohrn, his former colleague, said: “I don’t think we can treat his death like it was a valiant, valid decision unaffected by things that hopefully people will get care for.” But “if his death is going to garner attention outside the immediate circle of people who are grieving – if it is going to have a public component – then I think that public component should reflect the issue he connected his death to”. During her eulogy, Buckel’s niece, Carrie Bryant, said: “David, I promise you – we promise you – that we will give voice to those who have been silenced; we will give love to those who need it; we will tend to this, our beloved great Earth; and we will honor you,” through “simple, individual acts, as you so courageously did to make this world a more loving and just place”. She added: “This much we owe to you.” Buckel hoped his death would catalyze immediate action. It didn’t. By apparent coincidence, however, the anniversary of his death, however, will overlap with what could be the largest-ever direct action over climate change. Extinction Rebellion, an international activist group, is planning a global wave of civil disobedience the week of 14 April. Extinction Rebellion, and similar groups such as the Sunrise Movement, believe mass civil disobedience is the most effective way to break through passivity and pressure governments to take concrete action on the climate. As a dry run of sorts, members of Extinction Rebellion were recently arrested in New York for blocking Fifth Avenue. In London, members stripped partly naked in parliament. Eve Mosher, a spokewoman, told me that the group hopes for hundreds of headline-grabbing arrests this month. The climate movement may be gaining momentum after all, even if Buckel didn’t live to see it. Yesterday, at the site where he died, Extinction Rebellion held a “funeral” for the species that have gone extinct because of climate change. He understood that humans are deeply flawed. I think what drove him was how to inspire people to be their best selves From everything we understand, climate change is a tragedy of the commons on a vast scale. Addressing it will require human beings do a lot of things they aren’t naturally inclined to do, like make short-term sacrifices for the sake of long-term common good: the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that as early as 2030 the earth may warm 1.5C (2.7F) over pre-industrial levels – and that 1.5C is the highest level the planet can sustain without entering the realm of the catastrophic. Just limiting warming to that level will require, the IPCC said, mobilization of a scale with “no documented historic precedent”. It’s a sobering thought, and it invites the kind of fatalism that Buckel hoped to fight against. “I don’t think you can say he was either ‘pessimistic’ or ‘optimistic’” about human nature, Kaelber said. “He was more complicated than that. He understood that humans are deeply flawed. I think what drove him was how to inspire people to be their best selves.” He added: “If people want to honor David’s life they should look at how they can get involved, politically and in their own personal lives, in combating climate change.” His voice cracked with emotion. “In the thing that David wrote, the most meaningful part, to me, was: in the aggregated acts of millions of individuals, that is how change is going to occur.” Guests of the memorial service received tree saplings. Perhaps in 10 years, Kaelber told me, he will go visit them all and see what they have become. Buckel’s friends and family are also building a grove of trees on the space where he died. They have planted some dogwoods, staggered to bloom at different times. Kaelber hopes it will become a gathering place for contemplation, but also a place where people might hold community meetings to organize against global warming. “He always loved trees,” Kaelber said. He hopes the site will become known as David’s Grove. Beatrice Dohrn also told me a story about Buckel’s love of plants. “You know, in 1997 I had a breakup that I grieved very hard, and David, as if to cheer me up, gave me a jade plant. I’ve kept it for many, many years, and at some point it almost died,” she said. “It was down to a stump. But for some reason I didn’t give up on it.” • In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

In 2012 former President of the Maldive Islands Mohamed Nasheed said: “If carbon emissions continue at the rate they are climbing today, my country will be underwater in seven years.”
With such a prediction and recalling how the latest UN IPCC report boosted its estimate of sea level rise, and taking into account that CO2 emissions show no signs of abating, you would think the Maldives would be the last place developers would build anything. The Maldives are barely more than a meter above sea level on average.
But according to veteran Die Welt journalist Ulli Kulke at his Die Welt blog here in a piece titled Tourist industry does not believe in the downfall of the Maldives, this is not at all the case. Kulke writes:

30 additional new luxury class hotel complexes are planned for the next 6 to 10 years, never mind the countless smaller homes. Tourism is currently increasing 20% annually.”
Whatever is really behind all the rising sea level scare stories, huge commercial investors are obviously dismissing them. If anything, these scare stories are providing lots of publicity for the islands’ tourism industry. Already more than 1 million tourists are flocking to the islands every year and, Kulke writes, Nasheed says the islands can handle many more.
Kulke writes, “Environmental protection in the Maldives is practically non-existent.”
Moreover he suggests that the climate change issue is being used by Nasheed to generate lots of cash:
At the big climate conferences – and supposedly also in Warsaw in two weeks – Nasheed meets regularly to milk cash compensation from climate-sinning countries on behalf of his country and other island nations (on which environmental protection plays a subordinate role). Almost the entire supply of energy on the island for the millions of tourists flowing in, by the way, is produced by diesel generators, this while Nasheed continues to press for foreign countries to switch over to renewable energies.”

"Compared with similar countries Australia is performing poorly when it comes to tackling homelessness and keeping cost of living down, and its electricity supply is more polluting, less reliable and more expensive. These are some of the findings from the Grattan Institute’s Orange Book published on Tuesday night, which sets policy reform priorities for the next government and rates Australia’s performance in areas such as health, housing, education, and energy.  There is also a crisis of trust in politicians, the report says, which over time risked undermining representative democracy. “Australian cynicism is now at an all time high ... Widespread loss of trust can make legislating policy change more complex, because it is harder for governments without political capital to enact ‘difficult but necessary’ reforms,” the report says. “While there are many causes of falling trust and exasperation with the political establishment, one is the growing sense that people in government look after their own interests, or those of powerful groups, rather than the public interest.” Grattan chief executive and lead author of the report John Daly said there were some positives, with retirement incomes generally sufficient [except for renters], and affordable health and education. But on many social issues, Australia rated poorly. “These are evidence-based policy recommendations designed to serve the interests of all Australians rather than sectional interests,” Daly said. The report says the next federal government should focus on tax reform, with some current tax arrangements “a big drag on economic growth”. Income tax should be reduced, while welfare and childcare means tests should be modified to remove barriers and increase incentives for women and older people to participate in the workforce. The report says that to pay for these changes and avoid other tax increases, the capital gains tax discount should be cut from 50% to 25%, while negative gearing should be wound back through quarantining wage and salary income so that passive investment losses can only be written off against other investment income. The GST should also be increased or broadened. To increase workforce participation of older Australians, the report suggests investigating the costs and benefits of raising the pension age to 70. Despite a push from various politicians for people to look beyond major cities and move to regional and rural areas, the Grattan Institute says the federal government should instead be lobbying the states to change planning laws to allow more medium-density housing in established suburbs. “It is not that people will not move to the regions: they did so in large numbers when the mining investment boom presented attractive job opportunities. However, it seems that the living and employment conditions currently on offer in some regional areas are not attractive enough to Australians to induce more internal or overseas migrants.” Carolyn Whitzman. a professor of urban planning at the university of Melbourne, said people would always prefer to live where jobs and opportunities were. “The strong preference is always going to be for the central city and there is a certain lock-the-gate aspect, with lots of people moving into the cities and then saying ‘there’s no more room’. “This issue isn’t a failure of immigration policy; it’s a failure of planning.” The Orange Book calls for a universal dental care scheme, and a comprehensive review of the private health sector, including private health insurance. It says rates of complications and questionable care in hospitals should be made public, a move also being called for by the Consumers Health Forum. The report said pharmacists should be able to provide repeat prescriptions with the agreement of doctors and patients, and work with doctors to help patients manage chronic conditions. But it said overall, the health system was affordable and resulting in Australians living longer. A health policy analyst with the Centre for Policy Development, Jennifer Doggett, said the Grattan report needed to be stronger on health equity. “Yes, our health system performs well overall but the gap between those of us who get the best outcomes and those who miss out is huge. The gap between the life expectancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and non-Indigenous people means that Indigenous Australians have a life expectancy less than that of people in North Korea,” she said. “This is not just a health system problem but part of the solution needs to involve an explicit focus within the health system on addressing inequity.” She said though the health system worked well “on paper” this was partly due to the uncounted time and resources that consumers and their carers were forced to contribute to coordinating and managing their care. Doggett welcomed the call for powerful lobby groups to be held to account but said that would involve the government of the day taking on these groups. “It is not clear that either side of politics is prepared to do this,” she said. The government must “finish the job” on school funding by reintroducing the demand-driven higher education system, and control costs by increasing repayment of HELP debt. It also says entry into teaching should be made more prestigious, partly by pushing for prospective teachers to have an Atar (Australian tertiary admission rank) of about 80 or above. Prospective students should also be given more information about their chances of course completion, the report says. “Dis-enrol students who are not engaged with their studies so they don’t incur HELP debt.” The deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek has said if universities did not move to lift standards, a Labor government would move to make Atar caps mandatory. New school reform initiatives should be avoided unless evidence shows they are a good idea, and any government intervention should help and not hinder, the report said. A co-author of the Grattan report, Dr Peter Goss, said over the course of decades the academic backgrounds of teachers had weakened. “As a result of feminism women had more career choices so bright women were no longer pushed into teaching, which is great, but not good for schools,” Goss said. “We’re concerned less about how do you cut off the lowest-ranked teachers, and much more concerned about how to send a signal to young people that education is a course for high achievers and career opportunities.” The report calls for a code of conduct to be introduced for all parliamentarians on conflicts of interest. A Commonwealth Integrity Commission should be established to investigate corrupt and high-risk misconduct in the public sector, and investigate tip-offs. “Cap expenditure on political advertising during election campaigns, and lower the donations disclosure threshold to $5,000,” the report says. “Require political parties to aggregate donations below the threshold, and introduce ‘real time’ disclosure of donations. Publish ministerial diaries.” All lobbyists who enter parliament house should be subject to the Lobbying Code of Conduct, which should be enforced by criminal penalties, the report says. The report urges the incoming government to develop a credible climate change policy. “Our political leaders must be honest with voters: Australia needs to move to a low-emissions economy, and that transition will cost money,” the report says. “A raft of reforms to electricity generation, distribution and retailing are also required to push down energy costs.” While economy-wide carbon price would be the best way to reduce emissions, in the absence of the political consensus needed to implement the best policy, “we should work with what we have,” it says. “The work of the past two years means the incoming federal government, whether Coalition or Labor, will have the content and should have the political opportunity to introduce a stable and credible emissions reduction policy for the electricity sector. Reverting to subsidies and direct government funding would almost certainly be less effective and less efficient.” The report did not examine Indigenous affairs, foreign affairs and trade, most immigration issues, defence and security, law and order, industrial relations, communications, agriculture, many welfare payments, or human services because they have not been part of Grattan’s research."
