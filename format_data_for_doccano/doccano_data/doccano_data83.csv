"Stretching for half a kilometre or so, Loomis Reef is the place where the alarm bells started going off. Prof Justin Marshall has been diving this reef, about 270km north of Cairns, for 30 years. Right now he is, to say the least, angry. “My veil is down,” he says, no longer bothering with the kind of polite niceties common among academics. “I have cried. I have broken down in front of cameras. This is the most devastating, gut-wrenching fuck up,” says Marshall, of the University of Queensland. Back in November, researchers and staff on the Australian Museum’s Lizard Island Research Station started to see the early signs of coral bleaching – faded colours, odd fluorescent hues and chunks of white. The Great Barrier Reef, of which Loomis is just one of 3,000 reefs, is in the death throes of its worst ever coral bleaching event – part of the third global mass bleaching since 1998. Latest figures show that 93% of the reef has been impacted by bleaching. The worst affected areas are in the reef’s north. “Loomis Reef was an amazingly diverse, beautiful little reef about 500 metres long – covered in lots of different coral. Now it’s going to be a big ball of slime,” Marshall says. The past tense, it seems, is deliberate. “It’s in an area that tourists use – you can pretty much snorkel there right from the shore. You don’t need a boat. “At the closer end on Loomis there is a nice Porites coral – they can be thousands of years old. The one on Loomis would be maybe hundreds.” “You get a lot of large fish coming through – there’s a big nurse shark about eight foot long that lives there – beautiful, totally harmless.” Loomis Reef has a history almost as colourful as the corals that have attracted tourists and scientists for decades. The reef is named after the late American Henry Loomis and his family, who stumped up $110,000 in the early 1970s to help establish the Australian Museum’s Lizard Island research station. Henry, who had a background in physics, was a former director of the US government’s Voice of America. His dad, Alfred, was a former Wall Street tycoon and science patron who built his own laboratory so grand it attracted the likes of Albert Einstein.  Images from Loomis and its neighbouring reefs have been featured around the globe. In particular, there was a spectacular but haunting photograph of a bright orange “Nemo” fish nestling among a bleached sea anemone. “Any of these animals trying to hide themselves in the coral now stand out against the reef like dogs’ balls,” Marshall says. A large part of Marshall’s area of expertise is in understanding how ocean animals see underwater – research known as visual ecology (he is best known for studying the amazing vision of the mantis shrimp and its oversupply of photoreceptors). “But it’s not just the corals but the animals and the fish that live on them,” he says.  “I have six students on Lizard right now and they have been asking me where all the fish are. Well, they have either moved on, died … I don’t know. But you lose the small fish, then the bigger ones … then it all collapses.” The mass coral bleaching event started in Hawaii last year before sweeping quickly and mercilessly across reefs around the world. What is happening on Loomis, is mirrored across the northern parts of the Great Barrier Reef and in coral ecosystems around the globe. This is Australia’s biggest ever environmental disaster Corals get their colour and their nutrients from the zooxanthellae algae they live with. When corals sit for too long in unusually warm temperature, the algae and the coral skeleton separates leaving a “bleached” animal behind. The link between fossil fuel burning, coral bleaching and a long-term trend in rising ocean temperatures is clear, scientists say. Water temperatures over the Great Barrier Reef’s corals in February and March were the hottest on a record going back to 1900, according to figures cited by the government’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Authority. Marshall, the chief investigator for citizen science project CoralWatch, expects that “well over 50%” of the corals that have bleached on Loomis are dying or are already dead. Recent photographs show corals covered in algae. While the global mass bleaching event means Australia loses corals, Marshall points out that for other communities around the world bleaching means “that they can’t feed their kids”. There are hundreds of millions of people who depend on healthy coral reefs to sustain the populations of fish that make up their diets. As news of the bleaching spread around the globe, the Australian government granted more approvals for what could be Australia’s largest ever coalmine in Queensland’s Galilee basin. To Marshall, the timing of the announcement was galling. “This is not just about little Australia. This is a global event. When we mine coal and sell it, that is killing all reefs – not just ours,” he says. Marshall remembers the 2014 speech that the US president, Barack Obama, made at the University of Queensland. Obama told the crowd, much to the annoyance of several Australian government ministers, that the reef was in danger and that he wanted it to be there for his children and grandchildren to visit in the future. “But now we can see it’s not about our grandchildren – it’s our kids. It’s us,” Marshall says. “It’s happening right now – not in some future where we’re dead. Kids are saying ‘grown ups, what are you doing? You are stealing our future, our livelihood, our wonderment’. “I have taken my kids to Loomis for the last 15 years. I would not take them there now. This is Australia’s biggest ever environmental disaster.” "
"At a historic ceremony on 22 April, more than 130 countries will formally commit to the Paris climate agreement to keep global warming below 2C. But in order for policymakers to take decisive steps, the general public in countries around the world need to be fully behind taking action to stop climate change. Article 12 of the Paris Agreement specifically requires governments to “enhance climate change education, training, public awareness, public participation and public access to information”.  Science has convinced us it’s happening, but now filmmakers, artists, TV producers, advertisers and other creative industries are needed to communicate what’s at stake. The power of one image to say more than thousands of words was demonstrated when a photograph from Spanish artist Isaac Cordell’s Follow the Leaders series went viral with the caption “politicians discussing global warming”.  Public awareness about climate change varies around the world. “Overall, people in countries with high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita tend to express less anxiety about climate change than those in nations with lower per-capita emissions,” reports Pew Global.  However in some developing countries public awareness is low. According to Pew, less than 35% of people believe that climate change is harming people around the world now in Indonesia, Pakistan, Ethiopia and South Africa.  So how can creative industries be effectively engaged to raise public awareness of climate change in countries around in the world? How can they reach those who are most resistant to accepting the reality of the situation? And how can they use creativity to challenge potential public fatigue with the subject?

"The EU abandoned or weakened key proposals for new environmental protections after receiving a letter from a top BP executive which warned of an exodus of the oil industry from Europe if the proposals went ahead. In the 10-page letter, the company predicted in 2013 that a mass industry flight would result if laws to regulate tar sands, cut power plant pollution and accelerate the uptake of renewable energy were passed, because of the extra costs and red tape they allegedly entailed. The measures “threaten to drive energy-intensive industries, such as refining and petrochemicals, to relocate outside the EU with a correspondingly detrimental impact on security of supply, jobs [and] growth,” said the letter, which was obtained by the Guardian under access to documents laws. The missive to the EU’s energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, was dated 9 August 2013, partly hand-written, and signed by a senior BP representative whose name has been redacted. It references a series of “interactions” between the two men – and between BP and an unnamed third party in Washington DC – and welcomes opportunities to further discuss energy issues in an “informal manner”. BP’s warning of a fossil fuel pull-out from Europe was repeated three times in the letter, most stridently over plans to mandate new pollution cuts and clean technologies, under the industrial emissions directive. This reform “has the potential to have a massively adverse economic impact on the costs and competitiveness of European refining and petrochemical industries, and trigger a further exodus outside the EU,” the letter said. The plant regulations eventually advanced by the commission would leave Europe under a weaker pollution regime than China’s, according to research by Greenpeace.  BP said any clampdown would cost industry many billions of euros and so pollution curbs “should also be carefully accessed with close co-operation with the industrial sectors”. Last year the EU’s environment department moved to limit the coal lobby’s influence on pollution standards, after revelations by the Guardian and Greenpeace about the scale of industry involvement.  The commission had previously allowed hundreds of energy industry lobbyists to aggressively push for weaker pollution limits as part of the official negotiating teams of EU member states. The Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said that the UK’s robust advocacy of BP’s positions was a cause of deep shame, and illustrated how Brexit would increase the power of fossil fuel firms. She said: “It reveals how the arm-twisting tactics of big oil seek to undermine the EU’s progressive energy and climate policies. BP’s covert lobbying, combined with threats of an exodus of the petrochemicals industry from the EU, are nothing short of blackmail. “This document paints a disturbing picture of the degree to which global corporations subvert the democratic process, influence the commission and threaten the vital transition to a cleaner, greener Europe.”   A BP spokesman said that the letter was intended to “highlight the risk of ‘carbon leakage’, where EU policy to reduce carbon emissions may result in industry relocating outside the EU, rather than achieving any actual reduction in emissions. Avoiding this perverse outcome is of critical importance to climate policy.” In his reply to BP, Oettinger said that his department was finalising an energy prices report and “your thoughts are very valuable in this context”. Before the report’s publication, Oettinger’s team removed figures from an earlier draft which revealed that EU states spent €40bn (£32bn) a year on subsidies for fossil fuels, compared to €35bn for nuclear energy, and just €30bn for renewables. The commissioner’s office argues that the numbers were inconsistent and “not comparable”   Early in his tenure, Oettinger had been forced to back down on plans for a moratorium on deepwater offshore oil drills in the wake of the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. Within two years, he had become an industry champion, arguing that Europe was competitively disadvantaged by a reluctance to take offshore drilling risks. Oettinger regularly hosts alpine retreats for government ministers, bankers and captains of industry. In 2013, these included executives from Shell, Statoil, GDF Suez, EDF, Alstom, Enel and ENI, although not BP.  A spokeswoman for Oettinger said: “When the Commission prepares formal legislative proposals, there is a full public consultation exercise in which all stakeholders can participate. With the majority of the EU legislation referred to, Commissioner Oettinger was not the Commissioner in the lead.” An alignment between the commission’s eventual climate proposals and BP’s positions was “unfound,” the official added.  In his reply to BP, Oettinger said that he shared the firm’s views on a guarantee for unlimited crude oil and gas exports being included in a TTIP free trade deal and welcomed more “thoughts” from the company. Along with Shell, BP began lobbying for an end to the EU’s renewables and energy efficiency targets in 2011, but the scope of its lobby intervention went further. In its letter, BP strongly opposed renewable energy subsidies, particularly in Germany, and a planned cap on certain biofuels which studies have shown to be highly-polluting. Over the year that followed, an EU state aid decision on renewables went against Germany, while a cap on the amount of first generation biofuels that could be counted towards EU targets was also weakened.    Europe’s efforts to cut carbon emissions should be built upon market-based tools such as its flagship emissions trading scheme, BP said in its letter. But EU proposals to label tar sands oil as more polluting than other oil – which could lead to additional taxes – risked companies “being penalised subjectively on the basis of adverse perceptions”, according to BP. The tar sands proposal was vehemently opposed by the UK and the Netherlands, and the plan was eventually dropped in 2014. Jos Dings, the director of the sustainable transport thinktank Transport and Environment said: “In case anyone doubted why Europe chose to treat all oil – regular and high polluting – the same, here’s the answer: Big Oil telling the commission that really its impossible to tell them apart.” Lisa Nandy, the Labour’s shadow energy and climate secretary, called for the EU’s climate policies to be strengthened. “By working together with like-minded governments across Europe we can ensure that big companies cannot water down environmental safeguards,” she said. BP recently topped a survey of the most obstructive company on climate change, and is increasingly a target for fossil fuels divestment campaigns."
"The Times newspaper has been criticised for “poor quality” and “distorted coverage” of global warming by a group including some of the UK’s most eminent scientists, the chair of the government’s official advisers on climate change and a former chair of oil giant Shell.  “If you lose trust, you lose everything; and on this issue, you are losing trust,” said the group, in a letter to the Times editor, John Witherow, seen by the Guardian.  The group says the Times’s coverage: “appears designed systematically to undermine the credibility of climate science and the institutions that carry it out, and the validity of programmes aimed at reducing emissions.” “Climate science has proven remarkably robust to repeated scrutiny, and multiple lines of evidence indicate that climate change and ocean acidification pose serious and increasing risks for the future,” the group says. “There is abundant evidence also that decarbonised energy systems can provide energy security at reasonable cost if they are properly planned.” The group say they find two aspects of the Times’s coverage “particularly concerning”.  According to the signatories: “The first is that neither the quality bar that broadsheet newspapers regularly apply to scientific evidence, nor the simple concept of balance, appear to exist in all of your paper’s reporting on climate change. The second concern is that many of the sub-standard news stories and opinion pieces appear to concern, in some way, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF).” The GWPF is a thinktank led by former chancellor and climate sceptic Lord Lawson, and regular Times columnist Viscount Matt Ridley is a member of its academic advisory council. “It would be deeply perturbing to find that a paper as eminent as the Times could allow a small NGO, particularly one whose sources of financing are unknown, a high degree of influence,” says the letter to Witherow. The signatories of the letter, all members of the House of Lords, include Lord Deben, current chair of the government’s official advisers on global warming, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), as well as Lord Krebs, who chairs the CCC’s adaptation committee and is a former president of the British Science Association. Seven of the signatories are Fellows of the Royal Society (FRS), the UK’s elite science academy, including two past presidents, Lord Rees and Lord May. The latter is a former government chief scientific adviser. Among the other FRS are Lord Hunt, former head of the Met Office, Lord Oxburgh, former chair of Shell UK, and Lord Stern, author of a landmark analysis of the economics of climate change and a former chief economist at the World Bank. Lord Turner, a former chair of the CCC, and the Bishop of London, also signed the letter. The letter to Witherow, dated 20 April, takes issue with some of the paper’s recent coverage and cites two recent examples of what the peers consider “poor quality and/or distorted coverage”.  The writers first single out an article headlined: Planet is not overheating, says professor, in which the Times reported on a study which concluded the global average temperature is likely to remain unchanged by the end of the century.  “That a paper of the Times’ standing chose to report on this study at all is astonishing, given its poor quality,” the group writes. “Since your article appeared, scientists have commented, for example, that the method used involves ignoring everything that science has discovered about atmospheric physics since the discovery of greenhouse warming by John Tyndall more than 150 years ago … [The study] was not peer-reviewed, and was commissioned and paid for by the GWPF. On social media it has, literally, been a laughing stock.” The second article was headlined Scientists ‘are exaggerating carbon threat to marine life. The peers write that “the researcher on whose work it was based, Dr Howard Browman, has criticised [the Times] article using terms such as ‘cherry-picking’, ‘sensational’ and ‘disappointing’.” “Please do not mistake our comments as an attack on press freedom,” the peers tell Witherow. “Nothing could be further from the truth. A healthy, vibrant, inquisitive press is a vital component of a mature democracy, and neither science nor ‘green’ business should be exempt from proper scrutiny. But trust is also essential for any newspaper, particularly one as distinguished as The Times. If you lose trust, you lose everything; and on this issue, you are losing trust.” The peers said not all Times articles on climate change lacked balance: “Your coverage at the close of the Paris climate summit was both balanced and comprehensive.” A Times spokeswoman said: “The Times regularly reports on energy and climate change from across the scientific spectrum of debate and, as the peers’ letter acknowledges, our coverage at the close of the Paris climate summit was ‘both balanced and comprehensive’.” Dr Benny Peiser, director of the GWPF said: “We note that in the Lords this week Lord Krebs was rightly arguing against suppression of scientists giving dissenting advice to government so we are surprised to see him writing to the editor of the Times demanding that it censors its balanced reporting of climate issues. GWPF is an independent thinktank which does not accept any funding from the energy industry, and publishes work by distinguished academics and others, so there is no reason the Times should not cite its work.”"
"Scientists from around the world will contribute to a major UN report on how global temperatures can be held to a rise of 1.5C and what the impact might be on sea level rises, the bleaching of corals and biodiversity. The special report, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), will assess all the available peer-reviewed science along with other special reports on how land and oceans are being affected by climate change. These will look at the melting of ice in polar and mountain regions, as well as the impact of climate change on cities and food supplies. “We now have a roadmap for the next comprehensive assessment which will be published in 2022, in good time for the global stocktake by governments in 2023,” said Hoesung Lee, chair of the panel, in Nairobi. The 1.5C report was requested by governments meeting at the Paris climate talks in December where countries unexpectedly agreed to “pursue efforts” to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. 1.5C marks the point, say many scientists, where there is a real danger of serious “tipping points” in the world’s climate. Temperatures have already risen 1C and show little sign of slowing.  “Before the Paris meeting governments were focussing on [a rise of ] 2C. The latest assessment by the IPCC showed that some serious risks to corals and sea-level rise emerge at 1.5C. But there was not much available [science] on these topics. There is a lot we need to find out about 1.5C. We are ready to embark on this,” said Lee. “Limiting warming to 1.5C will be a significant challenge,” said Myles Allen, Professor of Geosystem Science at Oxford university’s Environmental Change Institute (ECI).  “In a nutshell, it means we have to reduce emissions twice as fast as we would have done to limit warming to 2C – and that was already looking challenging. Inevitably, people are already starting to ask if it is worth it. These are big tough questions, and we haven’t much time to answer them, so the academic community needs to step up.” The University of Oxford will host a major 1.5C conference later this year to bring together climate experts, researchers, policymakers, businesses and members of civil society from around the world.  The IPCC meeting in Nairobi comes ahead of next week’s UN meeting in New York when 130 countries will sign the Paris agreement. “It will be the biggest number of countries ever to have signed an international agreement. It will be ratified when countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions countries have signed,” said a spokesman for the IPCC.  The IPCC is responsible for providing governments with authoritative overviews of the latest climate science. Every seven years it produces a “synthesis” report which sums up the scientific knowledge on climate change – the most recent one warned global warming would have “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts”.

"More than 170 governments declared an end to the fossil fuel era on Friday, using the signing ceremony for the landmark Paris agreement as an occasion to renew their vows to fight climate change.  The outpouring of support – the largest ever single-day turn-out for a signing ceremony – underscored strong international commitment to deliver on the promises made in Paris last December to avoid a climate catastrophe, the leaders said.  “There is no turning back,” François Hollande, the French president, told the United Nations assembly. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said signatories to the deal were embracing “a new covenant of the future”. Leonardo DiCaprio, a UN climate ambassador, likened efforts against climate change to the campaign to end slavery.  Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, an indigenous women’s leader from Chad, called on countries to following through on their promises. Temperatures in her country were already a blistering 48C (118F), she said, and climate change threatened to obliterate billions spent on development aid over recent decades.  “Climate change is adding to poverty every day,” she said. Friday’s gathering was entirely ceremonial, with schoolchildren and brass bands filling out the UN hall, and John Kerry, the secretary of state, toting his granddaughter in his arms when it came his turn to sign the agreement.  But the turnout – including the presence of about 60 presidents and prime ministers – and stirring rhetoric were seen as an important measure of the momentum behind efforts to bring the Paris agreement into force earlier than originally thought, possibly even this year. Leaders also reaffirmed previous commitments to help poor countries protect their people from climate change. Early implementation would prevent the drift that set in with the Kyoto protocol in the 1990s and – crucially with Donald Trump’s ascendancy in the Republican presidential primaries – impose a four-year delay on any future leaders seeking to exit the agreement. But as the leaders noted, events on the ground are moving fast. Last year was the hottest year on record – and so were the first three months of this year. Temperatures at the North Pole rose above freezing last December, the depths of the polar night; and temperatures there were 30C (54F) above normal.  “Today is a day to mark and to celebrate the hard work done by so many to win the battle of securing the Paris agreement,” Kerry said. “But knowing what we know, this is also a day to recommit ourselves to actually win this war.” On Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, some 93% of coral showed evidence of bleaching, because of long-term ocean warming due to carbon emissions, and the El Niño weather phenomenon.  If countries do not make deep emissions cuts by 2020, they will miss their chance to hit the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5-2C (2.7-3.6F), leaders and campaign groups warned. Campaign groups called on governments and businesses to follow through on the rhetoric by ramping up emissions cuts, and protecting vulnerable populations from rising seas, extreme temperatures and other effects of climate change.   “The decisions in the Paris agreement now need to be incorporated into government and corporate decisions by breaking free from fossil fuels,” Jennifer Morgan, the director of Greenpeace, said. “Nature is telling us that time is running out, and running out fast.” The first hurdle was making the agreement operational by winning approval from 55 countries representing 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. That critical threshold moved closer into reach after the world’s biggest climate polluters reiterated their promises to approve the deal – with some committing to a specific time line. China, the world’s biggest climate polluter, said it would formally approve the agreement before the G20 meeting in September. The US and India, the second and third biggest emitters, also reaffirmed their intention to approve the deal this year. Canada’s Justin Trudeau said he would present the agreement to approval by parliament next month.  Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, engulfed in a fight for her political survival after being impeached earlier this week, made a personal promise to help bring the agreement into force.  “I take on the commitment to ensure the prompt entering into effect of this agreement in Brazil,” she told the UN. However, the European Union is unlikely to be in a position to join the agreement at an early date. Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU climate commissioner, admitted that internal processes, under which the individual countries must first sign off on proposals to achieve the common goal for 2030 of a 40% emissions cut measured against 1990 levels, would make it difficult to keep pace.  More climate-concerned governments such as France and Germany are thought likely to move quickly. But there are still concerns about the response that can be expected in Poland and some other central and eastern European countries. “This will take some time,” he said in a statement, “but it will ensure that when we act, we will act on a solid legal basis. And let me assure you: it will be done as soon as possible.”  In a pointer to battles ahead, Arias Cañete said that his office was preparing new legislation on renewable energy, electricity markets, energy efficiency and a mid-century low greenhouse gas emissions strategy to be unveiled in 2020. Fifteen countries – mainly small islands such as Fiji and the Maldives but also Palestine and Somalia – formally joined the agreement on Friday. The next phase is even more challenging as governments and businesses move to phase out carbon emissions from the global economy – first by targeting economic sectors that were left out of the Paris agreement. Jonathan Pershing, the State Department climate envoy, told reporters that the US and other countries would now focus on cutting emissions from shipping and aviation, as well as the climate super pollutants, known as HFCs, used in cooling.  “From now we have to ensure that we have a green economic model, one that is no longer based on carbon emissions,” Hollande said."
"Reducing food waste around the world would help curb emissions of planet-warming gases, lessening some of the impacts of climate change such as more extreme weather and rising seas, scientists said on Thursday.  Up to 14% of emissions from agriculture in 2050 could be avoided by managing food use and distribution better, according to a new study from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).   “Agriculture is a major driver of climate change, accounting for more than 20% of overall global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010,” said co-author Prajal Pradhan.  “Avoiding food loss and waste would therefore avoid unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change.”  Between 30 and 40% of food produced around the world is never eaten, because it is spoiled after harvest and during transportation, or thrown away by shops and consumers.  The share of food wasted is expected to increase drastically if emerging economies like China and India adopt western food habits, including a shift to eating more meat, the researchers warned.  Richer countries tend to consume more food than is healthy or simply waste it, they noted.  As poorer countries develop and the world’s population grows, emissions associated with food waste could soar from 0.5 gigatonnes (GT) of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to between 1.9 and 2.5 GT annually by mid-century, showed the study published in the Environmental Science & Technology journal.  It is widely argued that cutting food waste and distributing the world’s surplus food where it is needed could help tackle hunger in places that do not have enough - especially given that land to expand farming is limited.  But Jürgen Kropp, another of the study’s co-authors and PIK’s head of climate change and development, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the potential for food waste curbs to reduce emissions should be given more attention.  “It is not a strategy of governments at the moment,” he said. The researchers analysed food requirements in the past and for different future scenarios.  They found that while global average food demand per person remains almost constant, in the last five decades food availability has rapidly increased - hiking the emissions related to growing surplus food by more than 300%.  The paper did not look at how food waste could be shrunk, but initiatives to tackle the problem are already on the rise in both developed and developing countries.  In January, for example, 30 company heads, government ministers, and executives with foundations, research groups and charities launched a coalition to work towards cutting food waste by half and reducing food loss significantly by 2030.  The aims are in line with the new global development goals that took effect this year.  “Champions 12.3” - named after the food-waste goal number - includes the bosses of Tesco, Nestle, Rabobank, Unilever, Oxfam America, WWF International and the Rockefeller Foundation.  Andrew Steer, another coalition member who heads the World Resources Institute, noted then that if food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world.  “Food loss and waste hurts people, costs money and harms the planet,” he said in a statement. “Cutting (it) is a no-brainer.” "
"A difference of half a degree centigrade may be barely noticeable day to day, but the difference between 1.5C and 2C of global warming is a shift into a new, more dangerous climate regime, according to the first comprehensive analysis of the issue. The scientists found the additional 0.5C would lead to longer heatwaves, greater droughts and, in the tropics, reduced crop yield and all coral reefs being put in grave danger. The global climate change deal agreed in Paris in December pledged to “hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C.” Vulnerable countries, such as low-lying islands, have warned that 2C of climate change would wipe their nations from the map. Understanding the different impacts from 1.5C or 2C of warming has been made more urgent by the recent run of record temperatures, with 2014 and 2015 breaking long-term records and recent months smashing previous highs. In February, the global temperature was 1.34C above the average from 1951-1980, according to Nasa data.  The new research was published in the journal Earth System Dynamics, and lead author Carl Schleussner, a scientific adviser at Climate Analytics in Germany, said: “We analysed the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [and] considered 11 different indicators including extreme weather events, water availability, crop yields, coral reef degradation and sea-level rise. We found significant differences [between 1.5C and 2C] for all the impacts we considered.” The researchers found: “For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5C marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions.” The analysis found that regional dry spells increased by 7% with 1.5C of warming but by 11% with 2C, while sea level rises by 10cm more in the hotter scenario. Some regions would be more affected than others with, for example, water availability in the Mediterranean falling by 9% under 1.5C of warming but 17% under 2C. The research found crop yields might rise in some high-latitude regions, but “tropical regions like west Africa, south-east Asia, as well as central and northern South America are projected to face substantial local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize.” Coral reefs, which provide vital nurseries for many fish on which people rely on for food, would be particularly affected by an additional 0.5C of warming. “In a [2C] scenario, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards.” This is reduced to 70% by 2100 for the 1.5C scenario, the scientists found. Jacob Schewe, one of the research team and at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said: “Some researchers have argued that there is little difference in climate change impacts between 1.5C and 2C. Indeed, it is necessary to account for natural variability, model uncertainties, and other factors that can obscure the picture. We did that in our study, and by focusing on key indicators at the regional level, we clearly show that there are significant differences in impacts.” Prof Nigel Arnell, at the University of Reading, UK, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the new study: “This study demonstrates that the impacts in 2100 are lower under a 1.5C world than under a 2C world and that the difference is greater for some sectors than for others. Impacts on heat extremes are most affected.  “The study also shows that the rate of change over time is really important for future impacts, so in order to really understand the differences between a 1.5C and a 2C world we need to run more comprehensive global climate models with lower rates of [warming] than used so far to see how the climate system responds.”"
"Can’t we all just get along. Play nicely? Share? Such laments could be applied to many economic, political and social problems today. Perhaps the thorniest of them all is, climate change. Despite the relative success of the Paris COP21 in November, we are still far from effectively controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Could game theory help us rein in our impacts on the climate?  Game theory is the mathematical study of conflict and cooperation between actors or groups: animals, people, businesses, countries or even computer algorithms. It became a formal topic of study in the 1950s and has since made significant impact on economics, political science and evolutionary biology and ecology.   The fundamentals of the climate change are simple: the Earth’s finite capacity to absorb additional CO2 produced by burning fossil fuels, and the self-centred motivations of governments, businesses, and people which leads them to try and use as much of this capacity as possible. Simply put, more CO2 produces more wealth. Consequently, what is best for the individual is not best for the group. Somehow these two incentives need to align. One way would be for all 197 nations to cooperate in working out how to allocate carbon emissions. Presumably they would then move onto world peace. In game theory speak, man-made climate change can be cast as an iterated game over a common-pool resource that no one owns and everyone has access to. For example, fish in a fishery, trees in a wood, or pasture land grazed by cattle. They regenerate and if sustainably managed, can provide valuable resources for many. Take too much however, and they can collapse. Such collapses cause the ‘tragedy of the commons’, a concept that was popularised by Garret Harding’s 1968 article, in which we find a prescient summary of climate change “… the rational man finds that his share of the cost of the waste he discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying his wastes before releasing them”. Everyone would benefit if everyone played ball and cleaned up their mess. But that takes resources and money so the temptation to pollute is often too strong.  It is possible to avoid a tragedy of the commons if the incentives are setup right – reward cooperation, and limit the benefits of temptation to free ride on others’ contributions. Such temptations can be reduced by punishing free riders. But how can you administer such rules within the largely lawless landscape of international relations? There is no single government that can demand inspections and impose fines. Climate change seems to require a game to facilitate cooperation, but there is nothing to stop any individual nation picking up the board and scattering all the pieces if things aren’t going their way. One approach is a bootstrapping process. Thinking global while acting local recognises that local interactions are important. It has been shown that cooperation can be enhanced if people repeatedly play the same game with the same set of people. When they do, systems of reciprocity and trust can evolve. This will also allow effective punishment of defection. People trying to free ride either get penalised or thrown out of the group. A classic example of the emergence of such cooperation is the live-and-let-live system that operated in the British and German trenches during the first world war. This involved a number of behaviours that sought to minimise casualties on the opposing side. Soldiers would deliberately shoot high to miss the enemy, or shell the same spot with artillery at the same time of day. In essence, this is a simple and robust strategy. Along with tit-for-tat. Play nice with someone and they return the favour. Upset or hurt them and expect consequences. Social scientist Robert Axelrod discovered tit-for-tat as an effective strategy in repeated social games in the 1980s. It’s not the best strategy for all interactions, but it’s robust and lends itself to modification.  With regards to climate change, the hope is that if likeminded people within a group can agree to limit greenhouse gas emissions, then a group can make similar agreements with other groups. Regional agreements can help scaffold international agreements. It’s a bottom up approach. Finally a tipping point is reached in which limiting emissions becomes a social norm that is widely recognised. Think of the rapid changes in people’s attitudes to drink-driving, smoking in public places, or smacking children.  If cooperation can emerge in the midst of the horrors of war, then surely we can find the right incentives to combat climate change. Unfortunately, there appears to be a crucial difference. What drove cooperation in the trenches was a realisation that while the uniforms may differ, all the soldiers were in it together. We are not all in this together with respect to climate change. The impacts on the climate and vulnerabilities to climate change vary considerably.  In fact, the rules of the game appear to operate exactly in opposition to what’s required. Those that have the greatest impacts on the climate – the most industrialised nations – are those nations that will be least affected. It’s some of the poorest people living in some of the least developed nations that are going to bear the brunt of climate change. This doesn’t mean the climate change game can’t be beaten. But we would do well to remember just who has most to lose if we collectively fail."

"An abandoned government programme to insulate UK homes cost taxpayers nearly £400m and did not deliver energy or carbon savings, a report by official auditors has found. The green deal scheme was launched in January 2013 with the intention of handing out loans to improve domestic energy efficiency. It folded in July 2015 despite claims by David Cameron that his would be “the greenest government ever”.  The National Audit Office has examined the scheme for the first time and found that the Department for Energy and Climate Change spent £240m on the scheme. Another £154m has been spent on the green deal home improvement fund which was set up to provide subsidies for efficiency measures, auditors found.  They said 1.4 million homes benefited from measures ranging from new boilers to insulation by the end of last year under government schemes, but just 1% of households took out “green deal” loans. Around 14,000 households opted for the loan scheme but the numbers fell far below expectations, the report said.  Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the public accounts committee, said the report shows ministers and officials had little idea how to implement the scheme. “The Department of Energy and Climate Change has been flying blind when it comes to implementing the green deal and energy company obligation (ECO),” she said. “The schemes have cost over £3bn to date, but the department has achieved little energy savings compared to previous schemes,” she said. Improving energy efficiency in the UK’s 27 million homes, which are responsible for more than a quarter of the country’s energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, is seen as key to tackling climate change, energy security and fuel poverty.  Under the scheme, householders could avoid the upfront costs of insulation, efficient heating systems, draught proofing, double glazing and renewable energy generation such as solar panels, paying back the cost of their installation with savings on bills. But the loans were too expensive, the scheme was frequently changed and householders did not take up the finance plans at the expected rate, according to its critics. The scheme’s failure to persuade households that energy efficiency measures were worth paying for meant it cost the taxpayer £17,000 per loan plan, the report said.  Auditors concluded the green deal did not achieve value for money and delivered “negligible” carbon savings.  The design of the ECO, which requires suppliers to install energy saving measures in homes to cut carbon emissions, was also examined by auditors. The £3bn ECO scheme, whose costs are passed on to consumer bills, saved only around 30% of the carbon emissions of previous programmes, partly because of an initial focus on “harder to treat” homes which cost more to make efficient. Taken together, the government’s various energy efficiency schemes have cost £94 for each tonne of carbon they saved, significantly more than the £34 per tonne of carbon dioxide of the schemes they replaced.  Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: “The Department of Energy and Climate Change’s ambitious aim to encourage households to pay for measures looked good on paper.  “But in practice, its green deal design not only failed to deliver any meaningful benefit, it increased suppliers’ costs – and therefore energy bills – in meeting their obligations through the ECO scheme. The department now needs to be more realistic about consumers’ and suppliers’ motivations when designing schemes in future to ensure it achieves its aims.”  Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, said: “This damning report shows it isn’t just the energy companies who are short-changing their customers, it’s the Tories too. Investment in energy saving should be a national priority but these schemes are so badly designed they are ripping people off and failing to target those families who need help the most.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “The government is clear about the need to have firm financial controls in place to protect consumers, which is why we took action last July to address the issues in this report – stopping funding to the Green Deal Finance Company and setting up an independent review of the energy efficiency sector.  “We are now designing a new scheme that will help make even more homes warmer and bring people’s bills down.”"
"The World Bank has made a “fundamental shift” in its role of alleviating global poverty, by refocusing its financing efforts towards tackling climate change, the group said on Thursday. The world’s biggest provider of public finance to developing countries said it would spend 28% of its investments directly on climate change projects, and that all of its future spending would take account of global warming.  At last year’s landmark conference on climate change in Paris, the World Bank and its fellow development banks were made the linchpins of providing financial assistance to the poor world, to enable countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of global warming. “Following the Paris climate agreement, we must now take bold action to protect our planet for future generations,” said Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank Group. “We are moving urgently to help countries make major transitions to increase sources of renewable energy, decrease high-carbon energy sources, develop green transport systems and build sustainable, livable cities for growing urban populations. Developing countries want our help to implement their national climate plans, and we’ll do all we can to help them.” John Roome, senior director for climate change at the World Bank, told journalists: “This is a fundamental shift for the World Bank. We are putting climate change into our DNA. Climate change will drive 100 million more people into poverty in the next 15 years [unless action is taken].” At least $16bn a year, from across the World Bank group, which includes other development and finance institutions, will be directed to climate change projects, including renewable energy and energy efficiency. The group will aim to mobilise $13bn in extra funding from the private sector within four years, for instance through joint funding programmes. By 2020, these efforts should amount to about $29bn a year, nearly a third of the $100bn a year in climate finance promised by rich countries to the poor as part of global climate change agreements. As part of the institution’s new strategy, it will help to fund the construction of enough renewable energy to power 150m homes in developing countries, and build early warning systems of climate-related disasters – such as storms and floods – for 100 million people. The bank will also target “smart” agriculture systems, which use less water and energy and retain soil fertility, and will help countries develop their transport and urban infrastructure to produce much less carbon. All projects considered for funding – including health, education and other development priorities – will be screened for their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. The World Bank has attracted strong criticism in the past for backing the construction of high-emissions infrastructure, chiefly coal-fired power stations, and had already made moves away from such investments. Roome refused to rule out fossil fuel investments in the future, but said they would be subject to strict criteria, to do with their necessity, ensuring the most efficient technology was used, and investigation of alternatives. For instance, he said, gas could provide a “transition” away from high-carbon fuels for countries struggling to build new renewable energy capacity."
"Combating climate change successfully will require massive investments in technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide, new research has found. Myles Allen, professor of climate dynamics at Oxford University, said carbon disposal technologies would be needed as “backstop” options because they would be the only way to reduce net carbon emissions into the atmosphere to zero, and thus stop temperatures from continuing to rise.  Carbon disposal consists chiefly of the burial of carbon dioxide in underground caverns, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), but also includes possible methods of dissolving carbon dioxide in the oceans and other means of eliminating carbon from the air. The UK government last year scrapped its promised £1bn funding from one of the longest-running schemes to pioneer CCS technology. The decision, taken as part of George Osborne’s autumn spending review, was condemned by the industry and by green campaigners. Prof Allen said that reducing greenhouse gas emissions by other means, such as renewable energy generation, was important but would not get the world to its target of releasing no excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. That goal of ‘net zero emissions’ was enshrined in last December’s Paris climate deal. He added that sacrificing economic growth in the short term in order to pay for incremental emissions reduction could be counter-productive, if it prevented economies from growing to the extent needed for them to invest large amounts in CCS.  Prof Allen pointed to the UK, where current emissions reductions are slow, at an average of a few per cent a year, while economic growth measured by GDP is also averaging a few per cent a year at most, on long-term averages. He contrasted this with countries such as India, where economic growth is much higher, but emissions measured per capita remain low.  By this reckoning, the UK would do better to invest in the expensive “backstop” option of carbon disposal rather than incremental reductions in emissions rates, which were puny compared with the growth in emissions from rapidly developing nations. His paper, “Drivers of peak warming in a consumption-maximising world”, was published on Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Allen warned that this could not be taken as a signal that economies could stop investing in emissions reduction and wait for CCS technology to develop. If emissions continue to rise at current rates, that would mean much more carbon must be disposed of, and make CCS correspondingly much more expensive when it is needed, meaning measures to reduce emissions now would also be necessary. “Saying that we should not [invest in this technology] because it is expensive and hard, when we know we are going to need it, is just daft,” said Prof Allen.  He said the UK government must not have understood the issues when it made the decision to cancel CCS funding, and contrasted the decision with the tens of billions promised in support of new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C, which is now under question. The Department of Energy and Climate Change said it was still interested in CCS, and that the choice to close funding for the long-running competition had been a “fiscal” one, usually code for a decision imposed by the Treasury.  “We haven’t closed the door to CCS in the UK, but as part of our ongoing work to get Britain’s finances back on track, we have had to take difficult decisions to control government spending,” the department told the Guardian. “CCS should come down in cost and we are considering the role it could play in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK. We are committed to meeting our climate change targets in a way that is affordable and provides secure energy to our families and businesses.” Lisa Nandy, Labour’s energy and climate change shadow, slammed the government’s decision: “Without CCS it will be extraordinarily difficult to make the deep cuts that all countries agreed at the Paris summit. Britain should be at the forefront of pioneering expertise in this area to create jobs and build a new North Sea industry. The chancellor’s short-sighted decision to axe all support for these technologies could raise the cost of going green, and mean we miss out on investment.” Indira Mann, of the Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage trade association, said the technologies involved in CCS were more mature than many critics said, and would open up new economic opportunities for the UK. She told the Guardian: “CCS is a chain of proven technologies that can deliver emissions reductions as part of action to limit global warmiong. CCS remains the only path to deep cuts in emissions from [some] industries such as the production of cement, steel and fertiliser.”"

"The government’s job is to ensure our families and businesses have energy supplies they can rely on. And we are doing it by taking the long-term decisions to ensure secure, clean, affordable supplies now and in the decades ahead. That’s the key role for the Department of Energy and Climate Change and we’ve never said otherwise, despite the very strange claims in your article (Minister: Hinkley no risk to power supply, 20 April). The reason we are backing the construction of Hinkley Point C is that new nuclear is the only proven low-carbon technology that can provide continuous power, irrespective of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. We are tackling a legacy of underinvestment and need to replace our ageing power stations. Hinkley will power close to 6m homes for 60 years. But we’re only paying for 35. It will also bring billions of pounds of investment into the UK and create 25,000 jobs during construction. We need electricity that’s safe, clean and reliable at any time of the day or night. New nuclear is one of the best ways of providing this. That’s why we back Hinkley, and I have never said it’s for any other reason.Amber Rudd MPEnergy and climate change secretary   • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"Australia’s emissions from electricity generation continue to rise and are now 5.5% higher than when the carbon price was repealed, new data reveals. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, claimed recently that Australia’s total greenhouse emissions had “peaked” in 2005. Declining electricity demand has been dampening electricity emissions and reducing the total increase in greenhouse emissions despite increases in emissions from land clearing and mining. But the latest data from Pitt and Sherry for the year to March 2016 shows total demand in the east coast electricity market increased for the 13th successive month and demand increased for the seventh successive month in the west. “There can be little doubt that the period of falling demand for electricity across Australia has now ended,” said Pitt and Sherry analyst Hugh Saddler. That increasing demand and an increase in generation using black coal, after the removal of the carbon price, saw annual emissions increase 5.5% in the year to March 2016, compared with the year to June 2014, when the carbon price was scrapped. Total coal generation was 76.1%, compared with a minimum of 72.3% in the year to July 2014. Total renewable generation was 13.2%. Coal generation in Queensland is rising particularly quickly to fuel the booming liquefied natural gas export market. Those emissions will soon comprise an extra 8m tonnes of CO2 a year. Brown coal emissions fell slightly in the year to March 2016, almost entirely because Victoria’s brown coal generators stopped exporting power to Tasmania. But Saddler says Tasmania’s energy crisis – caused by low rainfall and the fact that the undersea cable linking the island state to the mainland broke in December – means “large volumes of brown coal electricity are certain to flow south through the Basslink cable as soon as it has been repaired, so as to allow hydro storage levels to recover”. The revelation that electricity emissions are trending steadily upwards comes as the Turnbull government begins consultations on setting “baselines” for its “safeguard” mechanism, which is supposed to ensure that rising electricity and industrial emissions don’t undo the greenhouse abatement bought through the government’s emissions reduction fund. The baselines will apply after 2020 for new facilities or significant expansions. The electricity industry will have a sector-wide baseline, with individual company baselines only kicking in if the sector-wide baseline is exceeded. But the electricity sectoral baseline will be set at the high point of sectoral emissions over the period 2009-10 to 2013-14 and individual baselines will also be set at each facility’s highest annual emissions between 2009-10 and 2013-14."
"There aren’t a lot of certainties left in the US presidential race, but here’s one thing about which we can be absolutely sure: the Clinton camp really doesn’t like talking about fossil-fuel money. Last week, when a young Greenpeace campaigner challenged Hillary Clinton about taking money from fossil-fuel companies, the candidate accused the Bernie Sanders campaign of “lying” and declared herself “so sick” of it. As the exchange went viral, a succession of high-powered Clinton supporters pronounced that there was nothing to see here and that everyone should move along.  The very suggestion that taking this money could impact Clinton’s actions is “baseless and should stop,” according to California senator Barbara Boxer. It’s “flat-out false,” “inappropriate,” and doesn’t “hold water,” declared New York mayor Bill de Blasio. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman went so far as to issue “guidelines for good and bad behaviour” for the Sanders camp. The first guideline? Cut out the “innuendo suggesting, without evidence, that Clinton is corrupt.” That’s a whole lot of firepower to slap down a non-issue. So is it an issue or not? First, some facts. Clinton’s campaign, including her Super Pac, has received a lot of money from the employees and registered lobbyists of fossil-fuel companies. There’s the much-cited $4.5m that Greenpeace calculated, which includes bundling by lobbyists. But that’s not all. There is also a lot more money from sources not included in those calculations. For instance, one of Clinton’s most prominent and active financial backers is Warren Buffett. While he owns a large mix of assets, Buffett is up to his eyeballs in coal, including coal transportation and some of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants in the country. Then there’s all the cash that fossil-fuel companies have directly pumped into the Clinton Foundation. In recent years,Exxon, Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron have all contributed to the foundation. An investigation in the International Business Times just revealed that at least two of these oil companies were part of an effort to lobby Clinton’s State Department about the Alberta tar sands, a massive deposit of extra-dirty oil. Leading climate scientists like James Hansen have explained that if we don’t keep the vast majority of that carbon in the ground, we will unleash catastrophic levels of warming. Did these donations have anything to do with the investigation found, Clinton’s State Department approving the Alberta Clipper, a controversial pipeline carrying large amounts of tar-sands bitumen from Alberta to Wisconsin? “According to federal lobbying records reviewed by the IBT,” write David Sirota and Ned Resnikoff, “Chevron and ConocoPhillips both lobbied the State Department specifically on the issue of ‘oil sands’ in the immediate months prior to the department’s approval, as did a trade association funded by ExxonMobil.” Did they make Hillary Clinton more disposed to seeing tar-sands pipelines as environmentally benign, as early State Department reviews of Keystone XL seemed to conclude, despite the many scientific warnings? There is no proof – no smoking gun, as Clinton defenders like to say. Just as there is no proof that the money her campaign took from gas lobbyists and fracking financiers has shaped Clinton’s current (and dangerous) view that fracking can be made safe. It’s important to recognise that Clinton’s campaign platform includes some very good climate policies that surely do not please these donors – which is why the fossil-fuel sector gives so much more to climate change-denying Republicans. Still, the whole funding mess stinks, and it seems to get worse by the day. So it’s very good that the Sanders camp isn’t abiding by Krugman’s “guidelines for good behaviour” and shutting up about the money in a year when climate change has contributed to the hottest temperatures since records began. This primary isn’t over, and Democratic voters need and deserve to know all they can before they make a choice we will all have to live with for a very long time. Eva Resnick-Day, the 26-year-old Greenpeace activist who elicited the “so sick” response from Clinton last week, has a very lucid and moving perspective on just how fateful this election is, how much hangs in the balance. Responding to Clinton’s claim that young people “don’t do their own research,” Resnick-Day told Democracy Now!: As a youth movement, we have done our own research, and that is why we are so terrified for the future…. Scientists are saying that we have half the amount of time that we thought we did to tackle climate change before we go over the tipping point. And because of that, youth—the people that are going to have to inherit and deal with this problem—are incredibly worried. What happens in the next four or eight years could determine the future of our planet and the human species. And that’s why we’re out there…asking the tough questions to all candidates: to make sure that whoever is in office isn’t going to continue things as they’ve been, but take a real stand to tackle climate change in a meaningful and deep way for the future of our planet. Resnick-Day’s words cut to the heart of why this is not just another election cycle, and why Clinton’s web of corporate entanglements is deeply alarming with or without a “smoking gun.” Whoever wins in November, the next president will come into office with their back up against the climate wall. Put simply, we are just plain out of time. Everything is moving faster than the scientific modelling has prepared us for. The ice is melting faster. The oceans are rising faster. And that means that governments must move much faster too. The latest peer-reviewed science tells us that if we want a good shot at protecting coastal cities this century – including New York, the place where Bernie and Hillary are currently having it out – then we need to get off fossil fuels with superhuman speed. A new paper from Oxford University, published in the journal Applied Energy, concludes that for humanity to have a 50-50 chance of meeting the temperature targets set in Paris, every new power plant has to be zero-carbon, starting next year. That is hard. Really hard. At a bare minimum, it requires a willingness to go head-to-head with the two most powerful industries on the planet – fossil-fuel companies and the banks that finance them. Hillary Clinton is uniquely unsuited to this epic task. While Clinton is great at warring with Republicans, taking on powerful corporations goes against her entire worldview, against everything she’s built, and everything she stands for. The real issue, in other words, isn’t Clinton’s corporate cash, it’s her deeply pro-corporate ideology: one that makes taking money from lobbyists and accepting exorbitant speech fees from banks seem so natural that the candidate is openly struggling to see why any of this has blown up at all. To understand this worldview, one need look no further than the foundation where Hillary Clinton works and that bears her family name. Its mission can be distilled as follows: There is so much private wealth sloshing around our planet (thanks in very large part to the deregulation and privatisation frenzy that Bill Clinton unleashed on the world while president) that every single problem on earth, no matter how large, can be solved by convincing the ultra-rich to do the right things with their loose change. Naturally, the people to convince them to do these fine things are the Clintons, the ultimate relationship brokers and dealmakers, with the help of an entourage of A-list celebrities. The problem with Clinton World is structural. It’s the way in which these profoundly enmeshed relationships – lubricated by the exchange of money, favours, status and media attention – shape what gets proposed as policy in the first place. For instance, under the Clintons’ guidance, drug companies work with the foundation to knock down their prices in Africa (conveniently avoiding the real solution: changing the system of patenting that allows them to charge such grotesque prices to the poor in the first place). The Dow Chemical Company finances water projects in India. (Just don’t mention their connection to the ongoing human health disaster in Bhopal, for which the company still refuses to take responsibility.). And it was at the Clinton Global Initiative that the airline mogul Richard Branson made his flashy pledge to spend billions solving climate change (almost a decade later, we’re still waiting, while Virgin Airlines keeps expanding). In Clinton World it’s always win-win-win: the governments look effective, the corporations look righteous, and the celebrities look serious. Oh, and another win too: the Clintons grow ever more powerful. At the centre of it all is the canonical belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy and powerful but by partnering with them. Viewed from within the logic of what Thomas Frank recently termed “the land of money”, all of Hillary Clinton’s most controversial actions make sense. Why not take money from fossil-fuel lobbyists? Why not get paid hundreds of thousands for speeches to Goldman Sachs? It’s not a conflict of interest; it’s a mutually beneficial partnership – part of a never-ending merry-go-round of corporate-political give and take. Books have been filled with the failures of Clinton-style philanthrocapitalism. When it comes to climate change, we have all the evidence we need to know that this model is a disaster on a planetary scale. This is the logic that gave the world fraud-infested carbon markets and dodgy carbon offsets instead of tough regulation of polluters – because, we were told, emission reductions needed to be “win-win” and “market-friendly.” If the next president wastes any more time with these schemes, the climate clock will run out, plain and simple. If we’re to have any hope of avoiding catastrophe, action needs to be unprecedented in its speed and scope. If designed properly, the transition to a post-carbon economy can deliver a great many “wins”: not just a safer future, but huge numbers of well-paying jobs; improved and affordable public transit; more liveable cities; as well as racial and environmental justice for the communities on the frontlines of dirty extraction. Bernie Sanders’ campaign is built around precisely this logic: not the rich being stroked for a little more noblesse oblige, but ordinary citizens banding together to challenge them, winning tough regulations, and creating a much fairer system as a result. Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: it won’t all be win-win. For any of this to happen, fossil-fuel companies, which have made obscene profits for decades, will have to start losing. And losing more than just the tax breaks and subsidies that Clinton is promising to cut. They will also have to lose the new drilling and mining leases they want; they’ll have to be denied permits for the pipelines and export terminals they very much want to build. They will have to leave trillions of dollars’ worth of proven fossil-fuel reserves in the ground. Meanwhile, if solar panels proliferate on rooftops, big power utilities will lose a significant portion of their profits, since their former customers will be in the energy-generation business. This would create opportunities for a more level economy and, ultimately, for lower utility bills – but once again, some powerful interests will have to lose (which is why Warren Buffett’s coal-fired utility in Nevada has gone to war against solar). A president willing to inflict these losses on fossil-fuel companies and their allies needs to be more than just not actively corrupt. That president needs to be up for the fight of the century – and absolutely clear about which side must win. Looking at the Democratic primary, there can be no doubt about who is best suited to rise to this historic moment. The good news? He just won Wisconsin. And he isn’t following anyone’s guidelines for good behaviour. A version of this article was first published by the Nation • This article was first published by the Nation"
"Diesel cars are producing many times more health-damaging pollutants than claimed by laboratory tests, with some emitting up to 12 times the EU maximum when tested on the road, according to a government investigation undertaken following the Volkswagen scandal. A Department for Transport (DfT) study of cars made by manufacturers such as Ford, Renault and Vauxhall found there was a vast difference in nitrogen oxide emissions measured in the laboratory and under normal driving conditions. Not a single car among 37 models tested against the two most recent nitrogen oxide emissions standards met the EU lab limit in real-world testing, with the average emissions being more than five times as high. However, the DfT said it had found no vehicles outside the VW group with systems in place to deliberately rig emissions figures. Robert Goodwill, the junior transport minister, said: “Unlike the Volkswagen situation, there have been no laws broken. This has been done within the rules.” The minister denied that the findings meant the current emissions testing regime was a farce. “But certainly I am disappointed that the cars that we are driving on our roads are not as clean as we thought they might be. It’s up to manufacturers now to rise to the real-world tests and the tough standards we’re introducing,” he said. The DfT exercise was ordered after it emerged that Volkswagen had allegedly used technology to cheat emissions tests. It measured NOx, or nitrogen oxide emissions. Nitrogen oxide helps to form ozone smog that can badly affect people with chest conditions such as asthma. The tests were carried out by a team led by Ricardo Martinez-Botas, professor of mechanical engineering at Imperial College London. Among the vehicles tested were 19 models that meet the latest Euro 6 limit of 80mg/km NOx emissions in laboratory tests. Euro 6 was introduced for all new cars sold after September last year.  When driven in a real-world simulation of urban, rural and motorway travel, the average was nearer to 500mg/km, with some cars getting close to 1,100mg/km. Among the new models tested that are meant to comply with the Euro 6 standard were the Ford Focus, which had a real-world emission about eight times above the EU limit, the Renault Megane, whose emissions were more than 10 times higher, and the Vauxhall Insignia, almost 10 times higher. Officials stressed that comparisons directly between models was unfair as they were all tested on different days, with varying temperatures and road conditions. The study also revealed that none of the 37 top-selling vehicles that were claimed to have met the previous Euro 5 limit of 180 mg/km, in place from 2009 until last year, stayed within that legal level when driven on the road. The models tested represented 50% of all diesel cars on the roads sold from 2010 to 2015, the report said. The results do not mean any of the manufacturers other than Volkswagen have potentially broken any laws, because the only legal standard currently is to meet the lab requirement. In the US it emerged that the of nearly 600,000 Volkswagen vehicles rigged to cheat on diesel emissions tests will have the option to have their cars fixed or bought back by Volkswagen, a federal judge said on Thursday.  VW may have to spend more than $10bn to comply with the agreement it has struck with the US Justice Department, according to analysts and sources briefed on the deal. The German carmaker admitted in September using sophisticated secret software to cheat exhaust emissions tests. Industry experts said the car industry faced a crisis similar to recent banking scandals. David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, said the government, manufacturers and regulators needed to act on the results of the study.  “I liken this to the Libor crisis in banking. There is a fundamental question of confidence in the industry,” Bailey said. “Clearly the testing regime needs to more accurately reflect the real world. That is not happening at the moment, not just in terms of nitrogen oxide but fuel efficiency. There is also an issue of accountability and openness for manufacturers in terms of what they put into public domain.” In the wake of the tests, the government has promised to introduce new “real driving emissions tests” from next year. Initially, manufacturers will be able to sell cars that produce slightly over double the 80mg/km limit on the roads, but from 2020 this will fall to the actual limit. The report found big variations depending on outside temperatures, with engines producing more emissions when it was cold. Manufacturers told the DfT that devices to reduce emissions, called exhaust gas recirculation, tended to switch off when it was cold to protect the engine. This partly explained the lower lab emission readings, as these were taken at temperatures of about 20C. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said car manufacturers needed to take action. “Following the Volkswagen emissions scandal, the whole of the automotive industry must work hard to restore public trust by being transparent about the systems they employ and advancing plans for introducing cleaner engine technology.” He added: “I’m disappointed the results are as bad as they are. We expected them to be different by a factor of maybe 0.5 or two on the road compared to the lab, but the levels are disappointingly high – industry needs to raise its game.” The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which represents the auto industry, said it backed the new real-world tests. A spokesman said: “The differences between the results from official laboratory tests and those performed in the real world are well known, and industry acknowledges the need for fundamental reform of the current official test regime, which does it no favours. “SMMT and industry support the introduction of the proposed new and more onerous test, which will help to reflect better real-world driving.” Friends of the Earth said properly stringent standards would take too long to come into force, with tens of thousands of people a year dying early because of poor air quality. “This confirms what experts have been saying for years: deadly emissions are far higher in the real world than in controlled tests in the lab,” said Oliver Hayes, from the group. Jaguar Land Rover said its customers should be confident that its cars were “fully compliant with all current emissions legislations”. It added: “The results demonstrate that Jaguar Land Rover does not use any cheat devices or software. Jaguar Land Rover recognises that there is a difference between lab and real-world test results. We fully support the move towards real-world testing and the greater clarity this will bring for our customer.” Mercedes said its vehicles had been “certified and licensed in accordance with the applicable legal requirements”. Vauxhall said it “welcomes the clarity provided by the report from the UK government”. A Vauxhall spokesman added: “Vauxhall is actively engaged in the discussion on RDE (real driving emissions). We strongly believe that the industry has to regain trust by increasing the transparency with customers and authorities, and we have taken definitive steps in this direction.”"
"With the Victorian Labor government’s announcement on a renewable energy target imminent, environment, union and business groups are urging the premier, Daniel Andrews, to be ambitious, saying it would send a national message on clean energy.  Friends of the Earth has produced a report saying a 30% target by 2020 is practical and achievable in Victoria and would maximise the state’s share of clean energy investment and jobs. South Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory already have targets designed to give them an advantage. The Victorian government has promised a 2020 and 2025 target and has held consultations on what the figure should be. It has suggested a baseline that at least 20% of electricity generation should be produced by renewable sources by 2020 and is due to release its plan within weeks. A Friends of the Earth spokesman, Leigh Ewbank, said modelling by the group, reviewed by the Melbourne Energy Institute’s Dylan McConnell, found that a 30% target could be achieved if rooftop solar growth continued at current rates and already approved or almost approved wind farms went ahead. It would also require that existing permits for wind farms allow upgraded turbines. Wind projects had stalled, Ewbank said, because of investor uncertainty over the federal government’s commitment to the national renewable energy target, which the Abbott government reviewed. Last year, the target was cut and is now set at 23% by 2020. At the same time, state and territory governments are aggressively pursing opportunities in renewable energy, with some setting their own targets. Most ambitious is the ACT, which is aiming for 90% of its energy needs produced by clean energy by the end of the decade. Victoria’s peak union organisation, the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the Municipal Association of Victoria and the City of Melbourne have all called for Victoria to set an ambitious target. “Our analysis shows what’s technically possible looking at the wind projects that are already on the books and maintaining a moderate solar growth,” Ewbank said. “Given the attacks that the industry has withstood under the Tony Abbott era it’s ambitious because we have to rebuild [the industry].”  The group would like a 50% target by 2025, similar to Queensland’s goal by 2030. The federal opposition has proposed that 50% of energy needs should be from renewables by 2030, but has released few details. The vast majority of Victoria’s energy needs are supplied by ageing brown coal-fired power stations, which are especially polluting. About 14% is supplied by renewable energy, up from 6% in 2009. The Victorian opposition has appointed its first spokesman for renewable energy, David Southwick, who told a rally earlier this year that “Victoria and Australia are experiencing a renewables revolution. It is led by the people because the people want it, voters want it and the community wants it”. It has yet to specify a target."

"When Brent Constantz, CEO of carbon capture company Blue Planet, was looking for a way to process carbon dioxide emissions, he found inspiration in nature. “Coral reefs and rainforests, the largest natural structures on the planet, are made of carbon,” he says. Reefs, in fact, not only sequester carbon, but also reuse their own waste byproducts. “When they produce calcium carbonate, they release carbon dioxide,” he explains. “This feeds the symbiotic algae that help support them.” This circular process of reusing waste materials lies at the heart of a new generation of design and innovation. Tapping Into Nature, a recent report from environmental consultancy Terrapin Bright Green, explores several companies that are imitating nature to address some of humanity’s most dire problems.  Blue Planet is one of these companies. Beginning in 2011, it has worked with DeepWater Desal, a combined desalination plant, power plant and data storage facility in Moss Landing, California, to mix waste carbon dioxide released by its natural gas power plant with the calcium produced from water desalination. The result is calcium carbonate – limestone – a building material that California’s construction industry needs. And, not incidentally, the same material that coral reefs are made from. “Rather than mimicking a beak or a chemical or a process at the organism level, we’re looking at mimicry at the system level,” says Constantz. “Ecosystems are, by definition, structured around efficiency and balance.” According to Terrapin Bright Green, Blue Planet could sequester up to 10bn tons of carbon dioxide over the next decade. While only a fraction of the more than 360bn tons that humanity is likely to produce in that period, it is still a significant step forward – and it hints at a process that could potentially transform the way industry views its waste carbon. As an added plus, the DeepWater project also produces fresh water and data storage, two more things that California desperately needs. DeepWater Desal’s desalination highlights another major global problem: a scarcity of water that threatens an estimated 4 billion people. But, while humanity often finds itself with insufficient water to fulfill its needs, nature usually finds ways to get or adapt to the available water supply, even in the most arid of regions. For example, in the Namib desert, where temperatures can top 45C (113F) during the day, the Namibian desert beetle still finds a way to hydrate. “It positions itself on a sand dune to catch humid air coming off the sea,” explains Charlie Paton, managing director of UK-based Seawater Greenhouse. “Water condenses on its shell – much like on a cold beer can – and runs into its mouth, giving it all the liquid it needs for the day.” Paton’s company – which has projects in Australia, Somaliland, Abu Dhabi and other arid countries – builds greenhouses that condense water vapor from seawater to produce fresh water, which they then use for agriculture. Their inspiration is the water cycle, the combination of evaporation and condensation, that organisms such as camels or the Namibian desert beetle use to keep themselves hydrated. But even an apparently simple process, like the daily water routine of the Namibian desert beetle, can be deceptively complex. To imitate nature’s water cycle, Seawater Greenhouse mathematically analyzes a variety of climate data, including humidity, wind patterns and air temperatures. It then adapts its solution to each individual area.  “In Somaliland, we’re developing a family-size unit,” says Paton. “It’s nominally one hectare, with a 1/10th hectare greenhouse in the middle. The greenhouse provides shelter and water for the rest of the farm. We expect it to be both very low cost and extremely profitable.” Seawater Greenhouse also imitates nature’s use of water vapor. Mainstream agriculture generally focuses on liquid water, but Paton claims that water vapor is actually a more effective, and more flexible form of humidity. Viewed this way, he says, it’s easier to see how water can be reused multiple times in an ecosystem. “A molecule of water can evaporate and rain six times in the time it takes to work its way through the Amazon from the Atlantic to the Andes,” he says. Also, humid environments use water more efficiently and improve photosynthesis. “Raising a kg of tomatoes in a hot, arid climate, can take 300 liters of water or more, but in a humid environment, that drops to 20-30 liters,” he explains. With that in mind, Seawater Greenhouse focuses more on creating humid environments than on generating water. According to John Warner, CEO of the Warner-Babcock Institute for Green Chemistry, one of the biggest shortcomings of human manufacturing is its obsession with purity. “Everything we do in manufacturing is unnatural,” he says. “Our manufacturing processes are based on the idea that our materials need to be 100% pure. But in nature, everything is a mixture of materials. Natures embraces that, for resilience.” Ecovative, a New York-based manufacturing company, has adopted this use of mixed materials by using mycelium, the thread-like branching produced by fungi, often found on soil, to replace styrofoam, plastic, plywood and fiberboard. The fungus, which founder Eben Bayer calls “nature’s glue”, naturally binds together other ingredients and can grow to fill any form. “The old industrial mindset would look at mycelium and say ‘what can we extract?’” says Bayer. “Instead, we say ‘Let’s keep it as close to nature as possible.’” To produce its fiberboard, Ecovative adds mycelium to wood fiber, then lets the fungus consume the fiber, binding it together. The slabs of mycelium then go to wood presses, where they are condensed into a medium density fiberboard. This process eliminates the need for formaldehyde, a hazardous chemical that is often used in industrial glues, and can reduce costs by up to 30%, Bayer says. Admittedly, mycelium fiberboard takes longer to produce than conventional products, but Bayer says that with sufficient advanced planning, Ecovative can maintain a steady flow of material. A larger problem, some critics argue, is that bio-inspired imitation largely focuses on imitating single organisms, rather than ecosystems. Beth Rattner, the executive of the nonprofit Biomimicry Institute, says that this can limit the scope of innovation. “Sometimes people criticize bio-inspired innovation by saying that it’s a lot of compelling stories about one-off improvements, but we’re still far from a man-made world that functions as elegantly as nature,” she says. “Ultimately, we need to approach the system as a whole, rather than focusing on individual problems as separate issues.” One solution, she says, is to address system-wide problems with system-wide partnerships. No single company can replace formaldehyde, for example – doing so will take the efforts of several stakeholders.  “We will begin to see exponential changes when we change the building blocks of industry – say from petroleum-based plastic, with its relatively limited functional capacity, to something like chitin, which has different molecular structures to create the waterproof, lightweight, flexible, porous and iridescent shell of a beetle,” says Rattner."
"Doing science in the cryosphere, especially in the Arctic and the Antarctic, is pretty demanding, even risky. The fact that lives have been lost in polar waters should dissuade us from naming the new NERC boat Boaty McBoatface, whose temporary jocularity would quickly fade from memory, while investigators carry on with their long-term work, essential at a time when ice-mass throughout the world is under multiple threats, especially by warming of the climate (Report, 18 April). A better choice would be the name of a young female researcher, Katherine Giles, certainly known to all aboard the new vessel. She was both a highly skilled ice analyst at University College London and a feet-on-the-ice investigator of Antarctica itself. Three years ago, clearly choosing a mode of transport in accordance with her environmentally focused professional practice, she lost her life while cycling in London traffic.

"The government has appointed six new directors to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) board, to be headed by a new chairman, Martijn Wilder, an environmental markets lawyer. The appointments of Arena’s former board members expired in January, leaving it governed by the environment department secretary, Gordon de Brouwer.  On Wednesday the environment minister, Greg Hunt, announced six directors who have been appointed for a two-year term. Wilder was appointed both a director and chairman of the Arena board. He is the head of Baker & McKenzie’s global environmental markets practice, an adjunct professor at the Australian National University, and board director of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). The other five directors are Susan Jeanes, Meg McDonald, Katherine Woodthorpe, Maria Atkinson and Jonathan Jutsen. The appointments follow the government’s decision in March to restructure Arena and the CEFC by setting up a clean energy innovation fund. The fund will in time take over Arena’s role of providing grants to help commercialise emerging technologies. The government said Arena would “continue to manage its existing portfolio of grants and deliver the announced $100m in large-scale solar projects”. Arena would then move from a grant-based role to predominantly a debt and equity basis under the new CEFC. Jeanes was a Howard government MP, a climate change adviser to the then environment minister, Robert Hill, and chief executive of Renewable Energy Generators of Australia and the Australian Geothermal Energy Association. McDonald is a former Australian government ambassador for the environment and chief operating officer of the CEFC. Woodthorpe is an experienced non-executive director, serving on boards ranging from ASX-listed companies to research institutions and government entities for nearly 20 years. Atkinson is a director of her sustainability consultancy, the Maria Atkinson Consultancy. Jonathan Jutsen founded Energetics, an energy, carbon and sustainability consultancy. De Brouwer, who is already a director, remains on the board. Hunt said the new board members have the experience and skills to help Arena improve the competitiveness of renewable energy technologies and increase the supply of renewable energy in Australia. “The new board will also, in collaboration with the CEFC, jointly manage the $1bn clean energy innovation fund to support emerging technologies make the leap from demonstration to commercial deployment,” he said."
"Justin Trudeau will lobby governments to approve the Paris climate agreement and bring it into force as soon as possible, reversing Canada’s past reputation as a “carbon bully”. The Canadian prime minister will join 155 other countries at the United Nations on Friday for a symbolic signing ceremony.  Trudeau is determined to bring the deal into force - possibly as early as this year - and will lobby other governments to that end, according to Catherine McKenna, the environment and climate minister. “We are going to do whatever we can to encourage countries to ratify,” she said. Some 55 countries covering 55% of global emissions must formally approve or ratify the agreement before it comes into force. Trudeau is hoping to bring the climate deal to the Canadian parliament for formal approval by the end of the year, McKenna told the Guardian.   “We are going to ratify this year,” she said in an interview. “I think it’s important to get Canadians on board, but the timeline is certainly this year.” Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has built the 22 April signing ceremony into a key event, calculating that - once a deal had been forged in Paris last December - governments’ engagement with climate change might wane. That strategy appeared to have paid off, with campaign groups reporting more mobilisation around the Paris deal.  Obama is sending John Kerry, the secretary of state, to represent the US at the ceremony. Negotiators feared a long time lag would compromise efforts to hold warming 2C below pre-industrial levels, the goal of the agreement. There has already been about 1C of warming.  “We had 195 countries come together so we want to make sure those 195 countries are staying engaged and staying committed,” McKenna said. That sentiment is widespread. Ahead of the signing ceremony, religious leaders and institutional investors called on governments to follow through on their pledges from Paris.  On Monday, about 250 religious leaders called on countries to revisit their pledges - and take more ambitious cuts, such as the phase out of fossil fuel subsidies and the transition to 100% renewable energy.  “The planet has already passed safe levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,” the statement from the religious leaders said. “Unless these levels are rapidly reduced, we risk creating irreversible impacts putting hundreds of millions of lives, of all species, at severe risk.” On Tuesday, institutional investors managing $24tn in assets called on leaders to move swiftly to bring the Paris agreement into force. “Maintaining strong momentum is particularly important in the lead up to the G20 meeting in China,” Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate change for Australia, said in a statement. Since his election last year, Trudeau has shown increasing interest in the role of a global climate leader.   After coming to power last year, he moved to break with the pro-oil policies of his conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper. His government is in the midst of a six-month review of climate and energy policy.  In a visit to the White House last month, Trudeau and Barack Obama agreed to work together on a host of climate initiatives. One of the biggest was a commitment to reduce emissions of methane, a powerful climate pollutant, from the oil and gas industry. That meeting of minds between Trudeau and Obama has raised expectations of a North American climate alliance between the US, Canada and Mexico. “If you can mobilise Canada and the US and Mexico, that sends a strong signal to the world,” McKenna said.  On a domestic front, however, she acknowledged that Canada faced challenges. A carbon price was a “no-brainer”, McKenna said. However, it was difficult reconciling the economic pressures on energy-producing provinces such as Alberta and Newfoundland and provinces such as Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia, which already have strong climate policies."
"A record number of more than 130 countries will sign the landmark agreement to tackle climate change at a ceremony at UN headquarters on 22 April, the United Nations said on Thursday.  Secretary general Ban Ki-moon is hosting the signing ceremony on the first day that the agreement reached in Paris in December opens for signature.   The UN chief, French President Francois Hollande, and environment minister Segolene Royal, who is in charge of global climate negotiations, have invited leaders from all 193 UN member states to the event.  The UN said signatures from over 130 countries, including more than 60 heads of state and government, would surpass the previous record of 119 signatures on the opening day for signing an international agreement. That record is held by the opening day signing of the Law of the Sea treaty in 1994.  The UN stressed that the signing ceremony is the first step in ensuring that the agreement enters into force as soon as possible. It will take effect 30 days after at least 55 countries, accounting for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions, deposit their instruments of ratification or acceptance with the secretary general.  A number of countries have indicated that they will deposit their instruments of ratification immediately after signing the agreement, the UN said.  “Paris was historic,” Ban said in a statement. “But it’s only the beginning. We must urgently accelerate our efforts to tackle climate change.”  The agreement sets a collective goal of keeping global warming below 2C compared to pre-industrial times, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C. It requires all countries to submit plans for climate action and to update them every five years, though such plans are not legally binding."

"“Do we really care so little about the Earth on which we live that we don’t wish to protect one of its greatest wonders from the consequences of our behaviour?”  At the very end of Sir David Attenborough’s three-part documentary on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the 89-year-old asks this simple question, in his polite way, not pointing fingers at anyone in particular, just wondering. It is all that has gone before that gives his question such force. We have seen the remarkable, beautiful and wondrous reef in a way that makes political spinning over its health and future seem hollow. We have seen the reef, but we have also felt it. The wonder of the once-a-year synchronised coral spawning, millions of sperm and eggs shooting into the ocean. The extraordinary sight of coral polyps battling each other in territorial wars. We have felt the effort of 100kg green turtles hauling themselves onto the sands of Raine Island in north Queensland after 40 years at sea, there to lay eggs in the same place they hatched themselves. We can sense how every creature – every polyp, crab, fish, manta ray and shark – depends on every other. At the end of this series, whether you’re a fan of nature documentaries or not, you will have learnt things, sure, but you will have witnessed and felt magical things. Attenborough’s Great Barrier Reef has already been broadcast in the UK, but the first episode screened in Australia on Sunday on the ABC. There is a special poignancy watching it here, because Australia is the reef’s home and we are its guardians. The opening episode is about the reef itself, how the 2,300km chain of coral reefs and islands formed between 10,000 and 14,000 years ago towards the end of the ice age. Water flooded the continental shelf and what remained was shallow and warm enough to be perfect for coral, the heart of this underwater city.  The local Indigenous people living near Cairns have told through music and dance a similar story about how the reef was born for thousands of years. Attenborough is an old man now, and one of his themes is time and change. Sixty years ago, dressed in little more than swimming shorts, flippers and a snorkel, he first explored the reef, and maintains that the “unforgettable beauty” of that experience remains the most magical moment in his career.  The black and white footage of that adventure is nostalgic, even innocent. Nobody imagined in those days that the reef could be degraded, even disappear, in one man’s lifetime.  Time has brought technological advances that allow Attenborough and his crew to explore the reef, as he tells us often, like never before. Down he goes in an explorer submarine – a Triton submersible – to remote corners of the reef rarely, if ever, filmed. The footage is as beautiful as you will ever see, the narration very Attenborough with its mix of information and drama. After laying “one of nature’s great wonders” before us, Attenborough uses the third episode to outline the threats to the reef. Some of these, like cyclones, are natural events and the reef has proven extraordinarily resilient to many periods of exposure and regeneration over thousands of years.  That’s the critical difference this time. Climate change is wreaking havoc because about 30% of the carbon dioxide we pour into the atmosphere is absorbed in the oceans. The rising temperatures and increased acidity it causes is happening too fast for the reef to cope. In the last 30 years, almost half the coral has disappeared.  “The greatest concern now is that we might lose the reef altogether,” Attenborough says.  The scientists he meets are passionate and committed, doing all they can to protect and reef and its inhabitants. It has got to this: scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science in north-east Queensland are desperately trying to selectively breed a new kind of coral they hope might be able to withstand the worst effects of climate change. Perhaps we could place this laboratory coral created on the reef to regenerate areas that have died. There’s something so sad about this well-intentioned scramble. As one scientist says: “This is really a last resort option.” Attenborough doesn’t get into the politics of climate change, either global or local. He doesn’t analyse the Australian government’s support for coalmines, especially the Indian company Adani’s enormous Carmichael mine in Queensland, and its potential threat to the reef. He doesn’t get into the need for ambitious renewable energy targets or which is best method of reducing carbon emissions. And his series came too late to capture the latest severe coral bleaching in the north of the barrier reef marine park, a result of warming temperatures.  Attenborough’s gift is to take us beyond politics, to what matters. It is an especially loud message for Australians, who have the privilege and duty to look after this “eco-system like no other”.  “The Great Barrier Reef is in grave danger,” Attenborough says. If temperatures continue to rise at the present rate it will be gone with in decades. What was once unthinkable is now happening on our watch. At the end of this series – perhaps Attenborough’s last big on-the-road documentary – he says without hyperbole, “That would be a global catastrophe.”"

"Climate change could cut the value of the world’s financial assets by $2.5tn (£1.7tn), according to the first estimate from economic modelling.  In the worst case scenarios, often used by regulators to check the financial health of companies and economies, the losses could soar to $24tn, or 17% of the world’s assets, and wreck the global economy.  The research also showed the financial sense in taking action to keep climate change under the 2C danger limit agreed by the world’s nations. In this scenario, the value of financial assets would fall by $315bn less, even when the costs of cutting emissions are included. “Our work suggests to long-term investors that we would be better off in a low-carbon world,” said Prof Simon Dietz of the London School of Economics, the lead author of the study. “Pension funds should be getting on top of this issue, and many of them are.” He said, however, that awareness in the financial sector was low. Mark Campanale of the thinktank Carbon Tracker Initiative said the actual financial losses from unchecked global warming could be higher than estimated by the financial model behind the new study. “It could be a lot worse. The loss of financial capital can be a lot higher and faster than the GDP losses [used to model the costs of climate change in the study]. Just look at value of coal giant Peabody Energy. It was worth billions just a few years ago and now it is worth nothing.” The Bank of England and World Bank have warned of the risks to the global economy of climate change and the G20 has asked the international Financial Stability Board to investigate the issue. In January, the World Economic Forum said a catastrophe caused by climate change was the biggest potential threat to the global economy in 2016. “Physical climate change impacts are a systemic risk on a massive scale,” said Ben Caldecott, the director of the sustainable finance programme at the University of Oxford. “Investors can do much more to differentiate between companies more or less exposed and they can help reduce the risk to the global economy by supporting ambitious action on climate change.” The new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change, used economic modelling to estimate the impact of unchecked climate change. It found that in that scenario, the assets were effectively overvalued today by $2.5tn, but that there was a 1% chance that the overvaluation could be as high as $24tn. The losses would be caused by the direct destruction of assets by increasingly extreme weather events and also by a reduction in earnings for those affected by high temperatures, drought and other climate change impacts. If action is taken to tackle climate change, the study found the financial losses would be reduced overall, but that other assets such as fossil fuel companies would lose value. Scientists have shown that most of the coal, oil and gas reserves such companies own will have stay in the ground if the global rise in temperature is to be kept under 2C. The total stock market capitalisation of fossil fuel companies today is about $5tn. “There is no scenario in which the risk to financial assets are unaffected by climate change. That is just a fiction,” said Dietz. “There will be winners and losers.” Major investors such as Norway’s sovereign wealth fund – the world’s biggest – have already begun selling off high-carbon stocks such as coal companies. Investors have also been warned about investing in new coal and gas fired power stations after 2017 by a second new study. The research shows that, to meet the 2C target, no new carbon-emitting power stations can be built anywhere in the world unless they are later closed down or retrofitted with carbon capture and storage technology. “Investors putting money into new carbon-emitting infrastructure need to ask hard questions about how long those assets will operate for, and assess the risk of future shut-downs and write-offs,” said Prof Cameron Hepburn of the University of Oxford."
"New Zealand’s biggest urban bus company will soon be running its vehicles on electric engines after signing a deal with Wrightspeed, a company founded by Ian Wright, a Kiwi and co-founder of Tesla. NZBus runs more than 1,000 buses across New Zealand, carrying more than 50m passengers each year. The US$30m deal will result in a “significant number” of those buses having their combustion motors removed, and replaced with two powerful electric motors, a battery pack, and a gas turbine generator, that will charge the batteries when needed.  Wrightspeed previously retrofitted garbage trucks and FedEx delivery vans with similar technology in the US. But the New Zealand deal is the first move for the company outside the US and the first roll-out of the technology for public transport. NZBus wouldn’t say how many buses would be converted, but chief executive Zane Fulljames told Guardian Australia the first step would be to convert 60 trolleybuses in Wellington – electric buses that run on overhead wires – to the technology, before moving on to their diesel buses. “It will be a significant proportion of our fleet,” he said. Fulljames said the first converted buses should be on the road by October. Wright said that with most countries relying heavily on coal for electricity generation, the on-board gas generator was a cleaner way to charge the batteries than using electricity from the grid. However, the batteries can also be charged from the grid, which in New Zealand is supplied by an unusually high amount of renewable energy – about 80%. “In New Zealand it’s unusual in that regard and it’s about the one place you can say it’s cleaner to get it from the grid,” said Wright. “The turbine is about 10 times cleaner than a piston engine,” he said. By carrying a generator, the buses can carry an order of magnitude less battery power. “If we tried to make one of these buses without the range-extender, it would have to carry about 500kwh of battery packs. We carry less than a 10th of that – about 40kwh.” Wright said the technology could provide unusually high torque, with two separate motors and four gears. That allowed the buses to go up steep hills, but also gave them very efficient regenerative braking, using the powerful motors to stop the bus, and charging the batteries in the process. By saving money on fuel and maintenance, Wright said garbage trucks in the US were able to make back the cost of the conversion in just three years. Last year an Australian company ran a demonstration electric bus, travelling the 1,018km from Melbourne to Sydney without a charge and without an on-board generator. Thousands of all-electric buses with batteries are on the road in China. Fulljames said NZBus looked at all-electric options but they weren’t powerful enough to climb some of the steep hills in New Zealand and diesel-hybrid buses had significantly higher emissions. They calculated an ordinary diesel bus would emit 207kg of CO2 per day, but the new converted buses would emit about 23kg of CO2, not including emissions associated with charging the buses from the grid. “Wrightspeed’s powertrains outperformed the competition on nearly every metric,” Fulljames said. Fulljames said that as battery prices dropped, NZBus would look at replacing the range-extender with more battery storage, converting the buses to all-electric."

But the 42-year-old, a Nascar racing driver, insists she isn’t the walking contradiction you might imagine. She’s a pragmatist. “I am making the biggest difference when I am at a race track and not when I am at an environmental event, preaching to the converted,” she says from her home in North Carolina. There are 75 million racing fans in the US, and Münter has the platform to reach them all. “If I was just a biology graduate running around telling people to buy electric cars and give up eating meat and dairy, not many people would listen to me.” Driving a racing car was on Münter’s bucket-list as a teen. “I was born with a lead-foot,” she says. After graduating from her degree in biology she funded her way through racing school by working as a stunt double for Catherine Zeta-Jones in the films Traffic and America’s Sweethearts.  It was in 2001 that Münter ran her first race, and the usual announcement, “Gentleman, start your engines”, had to be changed to accommodate her. “I felt like I had already won the race,” she remembers. But receiving trophies from scantily clad grid girls can be quite a weird experience.  “It’s good for little girls watching to see me standing alongside [the girls giving out trophies] in a racing suit; hopefully it plants a little seed in their head.” But finding sponsors who don’t compromise her ethics can be tough: she refuses to work with companies associated with fossil fuels, animal testing, meat or diary products, fur or leather.  Instead, she works with environmentally-friendly companies and advocacy groups fighting for clean energy and animal rights, and nine years ago committed to adopting an acre of rainforest for every race she runs to offset her carbon footprint. And off the track she drives a Tesla car powered by the solar panels on the roof of her house. “I have walked away from big sponsor deals, and in some ways it has hurt my racing career because I haven’t been in a car as much as I could have,” she admits. Getting on the track might have its challenges, but being an environmental activist who can make a quick getaway proved a valuable asset to the team behind the documentary Racing Extinction. Directed by Oscar-winning Louie Psihoyos, famous for The Cove, the documentary draws attention to mankind’s role in a potential loss of at least half of the world’s species. It follows the scientists, activists and journalists who are documenting it all over the world, and fighting to stave off mass extinction.  Münter was dispatched in a customised electric Tesla car to beam rogue projections of endangered species across New York City. Passers by were astounded to see giant tigers stalk along buildings and a blue whale swim up the Empire State. She also incriminated corporations by lighting them up and highlighting their CO2 and methane emissions, with a filter that made the gases visible to the human eye.  “With 7.3 billion people on the planet, we have to change the way we’re living and I think people are waking up to that – it’s something we have to confront,” she says. “A few times when the cops or security were called, I could speed away and, because the car’s camouflage paint job could be turned off, I’d hide in plain sight.”  Shell, McDonald’s and Seaworld have all come under Münter’s fire, and not everybody is pleased about her taking a bolshie stand with her racing car.  “I have had a few death threats and in one race I was given a security team because someone making threats was thought to be there in the crowd.”  Quick to shrug it off, she is not afraid to ruffle feathers. In 2014 she raced in a Blackfish-themed car and handed out a thousand DVDs of the film, about killer whales in captivity. She did the same in 2012 with the dolphin-hunting film The Cove and hopes to get behind the wheel of a Racing Extinction-themed car soon too.  Veganism is another movement close to her heart. She is planning to drive a vegan-themed race car and give away vegan food to racing fans at the finish line. She has already converted a few of her pit crew to eat vegan meat substitute, and that’s proof that US racing fans are just the sort of audience the environmental community should be speaking to, she insists.  “If you really want to have an impact you have to have the uncomfortable conversations with the people who may not be on our side yet.” She recently received a message from a man whom she’d inspired to adopt an acre of rainforest for his wife’s birthday.  He looked like the stereotypical Nascar fan that people picture, she says. “He had the big beer belly, the Budweiser in his hand, and I know that a lot of environmentalists would just write someone like that off and think there was no sense in reaching out to him, but that’s just not true.” Ultimately, Münter would like to see Nascar move towards either using 100% renewable fuel or electric racing cars. “Innovation often comes from the racetrack and the sport could really help move us forward,” she says. “They have all these brilliant engineers who could also be working on making the sport more sustainable and environmentally friendly.”  Münter is going to continue to fight from behind the wheel – beating men to the finishing line while she’s at it.

"First the good news. Greg Hunt is about to join 60 heads of state and representatives from more than 150 countries at the United Nations signing ceremony for last year’s Paris climate agreement, and has said Australia will move to ratify it by the end of the year. That eagerness, in itself, is a step forward. The Howard government refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol for a decade.  Now the bad news. Neither major party has yet advanced a detailed and credible policy to achieve what Australia is solemnly promising. Bruised by the brutal politics of the barren, wasted years of climate policy war, the major parties are circling and wary – the government trying to manage its sizeable internal climate sceptic faction by saying as little as possible on the subject in the lead-up to the election, Labor making promises and sending signals it is prepared to do much more but hesitating with the detail lest it once again feel the barrage of a full-bore axe-the-tax scare campaign. Many of the groups hanging on the outcome – climate lobbyists, energy companies, business – are treading carefully too, knowing Australia has delayed sensible policy for so long the situation is now critical, close to an emergency. Elevating hope over experience, they have made the judgement that giving the major parties at least a little bit of breathing space is the best way to return to some semblance of policy common sense. But the Paris agreement – imperfect and incomplete in parts – does put considerable pressure on Australia (as on all countries) to toughen the targets the Turnbull government has pledged (they have been rated inadequate by the Climate Tracker thinktank and other analysts) and to actually meet them.  The government insists its “Direct Action” climate policy can meet its Paris pledge – to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2030, through buying emission reductions with its $2.5b fund as well as other measures. But data shows Australia’s emissions from electricity generation – around one third of our total emissions – continue to rise and are now 5.5% higher than when the carbon price was repealed. And analysis by Reputex shows Australia’s overall emissions are on track to keep rising through until 2030. “At a time when almost all developed economies have begun to cut their emissions, including China and the United States, Australia’s national emissions are projected to remain on a growth pathway, with analysis indicating Australia is on track to exceed its historic 2005-06 high, with no peak in emissions expected to occur before 2030,” a Reputex analysis of the government’s emissions figures concluded. The government has said it will review its policies after the election and change them if necessary. It is widely expected that review will have to toughen the so-called “safeguards” mechanism on industrial polluters, which at the moment is not even trying to reduce emissions, but just aiming to make sure they don’t go up so much that they undo all the emission reductions the government fund is buying. But that would take the Coalition towards a form of baseline and credit emissions trading scheme. For its part, Labor has said it would make sure 50% of energy came from renewable sources by 2030 and would adopt a target to reduce overall emissions by 45% by 2030 and that one of the policies to get to those aims will be an emissions trading scheme. Given the experience of the Rudd and Gillard years, that’s a significant pledge.  But it has, as yet, released no specific details, and is likely to announce in the lead-up to the election that an ETS would be phased in, as part of a range of policies to gradually retire older coal-fired power stations and encourage renewables. Recent analysis found that whichever party wins government, it will need to impose some form of relatively low carbon price, as well as regulations and subsidies to force a change to clean electricity generation and meet Australia’s climate pledges. It also found that this has to happen quickly to avoid a massive economic shock and a huge disruption in the market and economic activity in 2030 to suddenly accelerate emission reductions enough to reach the Paris goals. And that’s the importance of what Greg Hunt will pledge at the United Nations. The Paris agreement is the benchmark to measure the yawning gap between scientific and international reality and Australia’s unedifying period of climate policy paralysis. "
"A switch to low-carbon transport such as electric cars would save countries including the UK billions of pounds a year, a report has suggested. Global policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector would reduce demand for oil, driving down prices and cutting global spending on the fossil fuel by £232bn a year worldwide between 2020 and 2030. Cheaper oil for importing countries could free up billions of pounds which could be spent in other parts of the economy, the analysis led by Cambridge Econometrics said. The report also warns that the era of ultra-cheap oil – with prices currently around $40 (£27) a barrel – will be limited, and without action to address climate change prices could rise to $130 a barrel by 2050. If governments implement policies to cut carbon emissions from transport, which could see a significant uptake in hybrid and electric vehicles as the costs of battery technology falls rapidly, the reduction in demand in oil could keep prices lower. Uptake of low-carbon transport could reduce prices by 15% in 2020 and 29% in 2040, and could see prices limited to $83-87 a barrel by mid-century. Research by Cambridge Econometrics has also suggested that moving to low-carbon transport would be good for oil importing countries such as the UK. In 2014, the UK imported 38% of its oil, which could translate to a £13bn a year saving by 2030 with a switch to clean transport, the research found, although imports dropped to 28% in 2015 as domestic production grew. Increased spending on domestically-produced electricity or hydrogen fuel to power low-carbon vehicles and on innovative technology could boost the UK economy to the tune of between £2.4bn and £5bn and create thousands of jobs. The report is being released ahead of the official opening for signing of the Paris agreement, the international climate deal agreed at the end of last year, which aims to shift countries on to a low-carbon path to curb rising temperatures. Philip Summerton, director at Cambridge Econometrics and lead author of the report, said: “Without any further policy changes, oil prices are likely to recover in the long-term, driven by global economic growth and increasing demand for mobility. “In a world where climate policies are being implemented to drive investment in low-carbon technologies - as governments agreed in Paris - demand for oil will be curbed, and ultimately reduced, leading to lower oil prices than would otherwise be the case. “Through policy support and technological innovation, we can expect the global economy to be using 11m fewer barrels of oil per day by 2030 than we would without significant changes to transport technologies. “Lower oil prices would benefit oil-importing regions such as Europe by reducing inflationary pressures on consumers, increasing real incomes, and shifting spending towards other goods and services that deliver more value for Europe.”"
"Average carbon dioxide emissions from new cars sold in the European Union fell 3% last year, meeting EU targets for 2015 as part of efforts to slow climate change, the European Environment Agency (EEA) said on Thursday.  The agency’s research guides EU policymakers, who are reviewing proposals by the European commission to tighten laws on air quality, emission limits and new vehicle authorisations following the Volkswagen emissions scandal.   Pollution from new vehicles slipped to 119.6 grams of CO2 per kilometre, beating by 8% the EU goal of 130 grams, the Copenhagen-based EEA said in a report.  The data mapped a steady decrease, mainly due to more energy-efficient vehicles and increasing sales of electric and hybrid vehicles.  From 2021, the EU official emissions goals will drop to 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre.  “If current trends continue, we will reach the target of 95 grams,” Cinzia Pastorello of the EEA said.  She cautioned, however, that the data was based on outdated official tests that recorded emissions around 30 to 40% lower than those in real-world driving conditions. The European commission is in the process of trying to enforce stricter testing. Greg Archer, at Transport & Environment, said: “Official figures on new car CO2 emissions are hot air. Most of the measured improvement is being delivered through manipulating tests, not real-world reductions. The chasm between the reported data and reality makes today’s announcement worthless. Without a new test conducted by genuinely independent testing bodies, drivers will continue to be misled while the planet warms.”  New cars sold in the 28-nation bloc rose 9% last year to 13.7m, in the second year of more positive figures for carmakers following a slump in sales during the recession from a peak of 15.5m in 2007.  Although hybrid and electric vehicles account for just 1.3% of all new EU car sales, EEA data shows, the number of pure battery-electric vehicles registered last year increased by 50% to 57,000, compared to a year earlier.  The defeat device software Volkswagen used to cheat on emissions test was to conceal toxic nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel vehicles, which continue to account for more than half of all cars sold in the EU, according to the EEA.  Although not illegal, altering CO2 emissions in cars can be achieved via a variety of engineering techniques to reduce fuel consumption such as switching off air conditioning, pumping up tyre pressure or improving aerodynamics by removing mirrors and taping up doors.

"For the first time, Australians can see on a map how rising sea levels will affect their house just by typing their address into a website. And they’ll soon be able to get an estimate of how much climate change will affect their property prices and insurance premiums, too. Launched on Friday, the website Coastal Risk Australia takes Google Maps and combines it with detailed tide and elevation data, as well as future sea level rise projections, allowing users to see whether their house or suburb will be inundated.  Coinciding with that is the launch of a beta version of Climate Valuation, a website that gives users an estimate of how much climate change will impact their property value and insurance premiums over the life of their mortgage. Coastal Risk Australia uses median sea level rises projected for 2100 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change under low, medium and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. On the high emissions scenario – which is the path the world is currently on – the IPCC says sea levels will likely rise by a median of 0.74m by 2100. But a rise of almost 1m is within the “likely” range of levels that could be reached by 2100. In every state and territory except the ACT, the website shows that houses and famous landmarks will be underwater by 2100. Beaches like Manly, Byron and Coogee in New South Wales would lose significant amounts of sand, as will Bell’s Beach in Victoria and Noosa in Queensland.   Many coastal suburbs and cities are shown to be subject to severe inundation, including Cairns, Ballina and Hindmarsh Island.     James Hansen, a former Nasa scientist who is considered the father of modern climate change awareness, recently produced research suggesting that sea levels could rise “several metres over a timescale of 50 to 150 years”. The website also lets users see how any sea-level rise will affect an area. If sea levels rose 5m, then large parts of most coastal cities would be inundated, according to the website’s calculations. “We don’t want to create hysteria but we don’t want people burying their heads in the sand ether,” said Nathan Eaton, one of the creators of the website from the company NGIS Australia. The tool was adapted from work NGIS did when it created a similar tool for the Pacific Island nations of Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea, in collaboration with the Australian Department of Environment and the Collaborative Research Centre for Spatial Information. Climate Valuation, also launched on Friday, will, for a fee, tell users the probability of a property being flooded by rising sea levels; the projected increases in insurance premium from coastal inundation risk; and the projected percentage reduction in value of the property at the end of a mortgage. It is being launched for use by researchers initially and will soon be available as part of a Kickstarter campaign, which the developers say will raise money to include more climate change-associated risks like bushfires and river flooding. People who pledge to contribute will get early access to it. The developers say the site uses risk engines that are already used to assess billions of dollars of critical infrastructure in Australia and the new site will give the general public access to that data for the first time. “We’re hoping this helps people make informed decisions about their safety and on what is often the most significant investment they will ever make – their home,” said Karl Mallon, head of the Climate Valuation Project."
"Polar researchers thought their models were broken when they first saw the results. Almost 12% of Greenland’s ice sheet was melting on Monday, according to data crunched by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI).  It beat, by almost a month, the previous record for a melt of more than 10%, on 5 May 2010. “We had to check that our models were still working properly,” Peter Langen, climate scientist at DMI, told blog Polar Portal. Temperature readings on the ice were in line with the numbers, however, exceeding 10C in some places. Even a weather station 1,840 metres above sea level recorded a maximum of 3.1C, which data analysts said would be warm for July, let alone April. Greenland’s usual melt season runs from early June to September. “Too much. Too early,” tweeted the World Meteorological Organisation."
"The attorney general, George Brandis, has mounted a bizarre defence of the Turnbull government’s funding cuts to the CSIRO, saying there is no need to keep funding climate science if the science of climate change is settled – but adding that he personally doesn’t believe it is settled. Brandis said the science body’s decision to cut funding for its scientists, who have produced vital climate science research – in response to the former Abbott government’s cuts to the CSIRO in 2014 – is what it ought to do if it believes climate change is real. He said Labor senators who think the science of climate change is settled should support the cuts, not oppose them. “If the science is settled, why do we need research scientists to continue inquiring into the settled science?” Brandis said on Tuesday.  “Wouldn’t it be a much more useful allocation of taxpayers’ money and research capacity within CSIRO to allocate its resources to an area where the science isn’t settled?” The attorney general’s argument is similar to that used by the CSIRO chief executive, Larry Marshall, who said in an email to staff in February that further work on climate change would be reduced because climate change had been established. The CSIRO is currently cutting hundreds of jobs in its oceans and atmosphere division, and its land and water division, according to according to reports. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Marshall have been heavily criticised by global climate scientists for allowing those cuts to go ahead. Brandis – who spent more than $15,000 of taxpayer’s money to build a new bookshelf in his parliament house office in 2014 – said he did not believe that the science of climate change was settled but he knew how to follow a logical argument. He said it would be a better use of taxpayers’ money to divert climate science funding elsewhere. “It doesn’t seem to me that the science is settled at all but I’m not a scientist,” he said. “I’m agnostic, really, on that question. But I can follow a logical argument. “I am simply challenging the illogic of the proposition being advanced by the Labor party who say, on the one hand, that the science is settled but, on the other hand, say it is a disgraceful thing that we should make adjustments to our premier public sector scientific research agency that would reflect the fact that the science is settled.” The CSIRO has had budget cuts from successive governments, including $110m in the Abbott government’s first budget in 2014. Late last year, the heads of its divisions were told to find millions in savings to support its funding shortfall."
"Last month the government made a landmark decision to reduce the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions to zero sometime this century. This makes Britain the first country to commit to one of the key pledges in the Paris climate agreement reached last December. This decision was prompted by a tireless, non-partisan campaign led by former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the UK’s first ever secretary of state for energy and climate change. Securing this commitment is an important new climate milestone for Miliband, who played a key role in establishing the UK Climate Change Act when he was in government.   The decision is also a testament to the ongoing cross-party commitment to tackle climate change which originally allowed the Climate Change Act to be adopted. But while we should take a moment to welcome the symbolic advance that has been made, a major issue with the UK’s flagship climate policy still remains unresolved and it is much more pressing. The Climate Change Act was rightly held up as a groundbreaking piece of environmental legislation, the poster-child policy for global climate leadership. The act set an ambitious long-term target to cut UK emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050, introduced an independent Climate Change Committee to chart an affordable course to that 2050 target, and established a system of five-year carbon budgets to ratchet national emissions down progressively over time. But at some point shortly after this historic environmental victory – when the streamers had all been popped and the champagne had all been drunk – the lawyers and the accountants were called in to write the rules for our carbon budgets and somewhere along the way they decided to get a little creative. The result of that creative accounting is something worthy of the Panama Papers.  Our world-leading carbon budgets have been given feet of clay. While they pretend to limit emissions from the whole British economy, they only actually police half of them. The other half has been offloaded to the EU Emissions Trading scheme, which acts as a kind of offshore carbon haven. While the European carbon market is supposed to drive emissions reductions on the UK’s behalf, it is notoriously broken, and is still struggling to maintain a carbon price above a meagre €5 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted – and this despite numerous political interventions to fix it over the past decade. With the stroke of a pen the technocrats quietly absolved government of all responsibility to reduce emissions from some of the most obvious and most tractable sources of pollution in the land: the fossil-fuel devouring power stations and factories whose smokestacks belch millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year – not to mention huge amounts of other pollutants which damage our health more directly than CO2. It’s incredible to think that the carbon budgets established under the Climate Change Act have not prompted the installation of a single solar panel or wind turbine and haven’t required a single coal-fired power station to close. But by virtue of their design they could not drive this change. These specific carbon abatement measures have either been driven by European directives or by completely independent domestic political pressures and rules.  We are obliged, then, to pose a new question. As the government prepares to adopt the fifth carbon budget in June – the budget that will control emissions from the year 2028 to 2032 – we need to ask not only what level that budget will be set at, but how it will be measured. Will it be an honest budget that does what it says on the tin, or will it be a budget that can be met through loopholes and accounting tricks? We should soon find out. As the energy bill returns to the House of Lords on Tuesday, and both houses negotiate the final legislation, a key amendment to fix the accounting rules is still up for grabs. This is our opportunity to straighten out the books and change the rules so the government is accountable for keeping all national emissions within the UK carbon budgets.  This proposal to close the reporting loopholes is backed by the Labour party, the Lib Dems, the Scottish National party, the Greens and others. It also has the support of NGOs including the RSPB, Sandbag, Greenpeace, Client Earth and WWF.  The Conservative party’s manifesto says they will “continue to support the UK Climate Change Act”. The question right now is, will they help to fix it?"
"On rare occasions, the townsfolk of Amherst, Massachusetts, would catch a glimpse of a ghostly figure dressed in white, leaning over to tend her flowers by flickering lantern light. The mysterious recluse, who was better known to neighbors for her exquisite garden than for her lyric poems that revealed a passionate love of nature, differed from fellow 19th-century American writers whose thinking became the bedrock of modern environmentalism. While Thoreau famously declared wild places to be “the preservation of the world,” Emily Dickinson was finding nature’s truth and power in an ordinary dandelion.  Among the plants that survive on the family property where Dickinson confined herself for much of her adult life are picturesque old trees called umbrella magnolias (Magnolia tripetala) — so named because their leaves, which can reach two feet long, radiate out from the ends of branches like the spokes of an umbrella.  The trees, believed to have been planted by Emily’s brother Austin, have jumped the garden gate in recent decades and established wild populations not far from the poet’s home. This new location is a couple of hundred miles north of the tree’s native range, centered in the sheltered woods and ravines of the Appalachian Mountains, and is the first evidence that native plant horticulture in the United States “is giving some species a head-start on climate change,” according to Smith College biologist Jesse Bellemare. Ironically, the denizen of the Dickinson homestead is also challenging basic precepts of conservation practice, such as what is the definition of “native”? Are climate refugees that hitchhike north via horticulture less worthy of protection than plants that arrive on their own? Do they pose a threat to existing native species? Should native plant gardening, the domestic form of assisted migration, be used to help plants stranded in inhospitable habitat?  The standard definition of native, says Bellemare, was based on a view of nature as unchanging, and of what constitutes “native” as absolute and enduring. But “this very local definition breaks down,” he says, as climate change makes many plants unsuited to habitats they historically have occupied. The definition of native needs to shift, he adds, as the boundaries of entire biogeographic regions, like the eastern deciduous forest, shift with changing conditions.  A few years ago, Bellemare began to notice umbrella magnolias “peeking out from roadside vegetation” in western Massachusetts.  Most of the naturalized plants, he observed, were “close to, or within sight of, horticultural specimens.” Intrigued, he set out to determine the age of the garden escapees. Although some of the landscaped trees, like those on the Dickinson homestead, were planted more than a century-and-a half-ago, core samples from a number of the largest naturalized individuals revealed that the species started escaping profusely only in the last 20 to 30 years.  As Bellemare and coauthor Claudia Deeg pointed out in a paper last July in Rhodora, this is also when the climate began warming quickly in the region. In a presentation at the Ecological Society of America conference last year, Bellemare and a group of collaborators concluded, “It is unlikely that natural dispersal from the South would have allowed Magnolia tripetala to reach this region anytime soon.”  For years, scientists have predicted that natives planted well north of their historic geographic limits inevitably would not only survive, but thrive and naturalize outside of horticulture in habitat made increasingly hospitable by global warming. In a 2008 paper in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, biologists found that 73 percent of the 357 native European species they investigated were being sold hundreds of miles north of the plants’ natural geographic ranges.  “While debate continues about whether humans should actively assist the migration of species in the face of climate change, it is clear that the horticulture industry has already done so for hundreds of species,” they wrote.  Natural range shifts of birds and other mobile species have been documented in the past decade, but new studies suggest that many native plants are also struggling to keep up with climate change by migrating to higher elevations or towards the poles. In an analysis of the flora of Worcester County in central Massachusetts in 2013, biologist Robert Bertin found that the ranges of native plants appear to be contracting.  “Northern” species most widely distributed in upper New England, he wrote, are declining faster than the region’s “southern” plants, primarily from New England’s lower reaches, which are expanding their ranges northward. In a paper published earlier this year, biologists detected significantly fewer shifts in elevation by plants in California than by other organisms such as birds and mammals. They also found that the migration upward in elevation of non-native invasive plant species was nearly five times greater than that of the flora overall, and even more when compared to localized endemic plants.  Endemic plants with small ranges, scientists believe, are among the species at greatest risk as their preferred climate shifts far beyond their ability to disperse. Bellemare and University of Minnesota biologist David Moeller have analyzed the likely impact of climate change on one of the most celebrated clusters of endemic plants — herbaceous wildflowers of the Southeast, from bleedinghearts to trilliums — which produce a flamboyant explosion of blooms that carpet the forest floor in spring.  These endemic wildflowers have been unable to disperse northward in the 15,000 years since the last ice sheet began receding. While they would probably be well positioned to survive the climatic cooling of another ice age, the breakneck speed of current warming seems to place many of these plants “on the wrong side of climate history,” Bellemare has written.  Horticulture has helped the umbrella magnolia disperse beyond its former range limit south of the glacial boundary. Naturalized populations have been discovered throughout the Northeast, including on Long Island, where the trees were planted widely in the 1920s, and perhaps earlier. The population located a stone’s throw from the Dickinson homestead, consisting of several hundred trees spread over six or seven acres, is believed to be one of the largest clusters in the Northeast. Not all biologists are toasting the plant’s arrival in the northeastern U.S., however. Because the umbrella magnolia arrived via horticulture, Bill Brumback, director of conservation at the New England Wild Flower Society, says he would not consider it native — the basic prerequisite for a plant worth preserving.  “I really don’t know” if southeastern species that have escaped from cultivation should be considered native in New England, says Brown University biologist Dov Sax, who is collaborating with Bellemare and other scientists on a nationwide study of what shifting ranges portend for the survival of native plants in the face of rapid warming. “A new, more nuanced set of terms than ‘native’ or ‘non-native’ is needed,” Sax says.  The debate over how to characterize plants colonizing new areas as the climate changes is based in large part on concern over their potential to hijack the habitat of existing native species. This same worry has made assisted migration of species threatened by climate change one of the most controversial topics in contemporary conservation science and has fueled concern among some scientists over gardeners moving native plants well beyond their current boundaries.  “Native plant horticulture is giving us some fascinating insights into what is likely to happen with climate change,” says Bellemare. “But we’re not at a point where most botanists and ecologists would feel comfortable advocating” that gardeners help protect plants by moving them to cooler climes, he adds. Indeed, given their rampant spread, Brumback worries that the naturalized magnolias may be in the early stages of biological invasion. “If I saw them taking over a woodland, I’d recommend removing them,” he says.  Brown University’s Sax suspects that this is unlikely, noting that studies indicate a species’ risk of becoming invasive increases with the distance of its historic native range from the region it is colonizing. Although he is concerned that a small percentage of plants introduced from other continents “will likely become problematic,” he believes that a nearby native like the umbrella magnolia, which has outlier populations in southern Pennsylvania, “poses little risk” in New England. Both Sax and Bellemare have pointed out that the threat of negative ecological consequences is likely lessened by the fact that the umbrella magnolia and other forest plants from the Southeast and mid-Atlantic share a biogeographic history with those in New England. Researchers are only beginning to understand the complexities of the microbes in the earth’s soil and the role they play in fostering healthy ecosystems. Now, climate change is threatening to disrupt these microbes and the key functions they provide. According to paleoecologists, as the climate cooled and glaciers expanded during the Pleistocene era, forest plants of the Northeast survived by migrating to so-called refugia in the South. When the climate warmed and the most recent ice sheet receded, some species were able to recolonize the habitat they had lost. But others, Sax suspects, were impeded by the human-driven extinction, about 12,000 years ago, of the mastodons, giant ground-sloths, and other megafauna that had dispersed their seeds for millennia.  “If we still had those big mammals,” says Sax, it’s likely that “many species that are currently restricted to the Southeast or mid-Atlantic would now be in New England.” One of these species may be the umbrella magnolia, which has no apparent modern seed disperser, biologists and horticulturists say, with the notable exception of humans.  While scientists grapple with the implications of escaped magnolias, there is poetic justice that a plant from the Dickinson homestead has sparked the discussion. Although the view of enduring wilderness championed by Thoreau and John Muir came to dominate conservation thinking, Emily Dickinson, who perceived the beauty and destructive capacity of nature all around her, may be the more appropriate literary icon for an age of climate disruption.

"Climbing sea levels bedevil low-lying islands.  But a hotter planet brings a less obvious menace: drought. Three-quarters of the world’s small islands, home to 16 million people, are set to get more arid by mid-century, according to a study published in journal Nature Climate Change on Monday. Warmer temperatures will evaporate more water than they replenish in rainfall, the survey of 80 island groups found. Among the most severely affected are the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean including St Lucia and Grenada, French Polynesia – the subject of paintings by impressionist Paul Gauguin – and the Robinson Crusoe Islands in the south Pacific. Islands in the tropics like the Marshall Islands and Kiribati will experience more rainfall this century, however. Many islands already face acute water scarcity due to limited catchment areas and demand from growing populations. But precise forecasts for these small archipelago and atoll nations are in short supply, as they do not typically register in global climate models. “Up until now if you lived in the middle of the ocean on a small island, you were without the information that rest of us on big land masses have of what to expect in the future,” said Kristopher Karnauskas at the University of Colorado-Boulder and author of the study. The study calculates future levels of evaporation and combines them with precipitation forecasts. Karnauskas said that would help planners adapt infrastructure and agriculture to future imbalances in water. Without both sets of information, “it’s like the score of a ball game with just one team’s score. You need to know the other to know who’s won,” he told Climate Home."
"Climate change poses a serious danger to public health – worse than polio in some respects – and will strike especially hard at pregnant women, children, low-income people and communities of color, an authoritative US government report warned on Monday. The report, The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment, formally unveiled at the White House, warned of sweeping risks to public health from rising temperatures in the coming decades – with increased deaths and illnesses from heat stroke, respiratory failure and diseases such as West Nile virus.  “Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change,” John Holdren, the White House science adviser, told reporters on Monday. “Some are more vulnerable than others,” he went on. These included pregnant women, children, the elderly, outdoor workers, low-income people, immigrants, communities of color and those with disabilities or pre-existing medical conditions. The diversity of risks – and vulnerable populations – made climate change a far more challenging threat to public health than even the polio epidemics in the past in some regards, said Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general.  “I don’t think we have seen something like this before where we have a force that has such a multitude of impacts,” Murthy said.  Polio was eradicated with a specific vaccine, but there was no such quick fix for climate change, he said. “Climate change is not like that. There is not one single source that we can target,” he went on. “As far as history is concerned this is a new kind of threat that we are facing.”  The grim, climate-inflected scenarios in the report – including projections of an additional 11,000 heat-related deaths by 2030 – intensify the efforts by the White House to rally public support for the Paris climate agreement and the clean power plant rules, which face a legal challenge on 2 June. Governments will gather in New York on 22 April to formally sign on to the agreement reached in Paris. The Obama administration is leading a push by the United Nations to get the agreement signed and into force by the end of this year – a process that requires the support of 55 countries representing 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The White House, Democrats in Congress and campaign groups are also working to gin up public support for the clean power plant rules ahead of the 2 June hearing into a legal challenge brought by a coalition of states and industries. The findings in the report were broadly in line with a draft released by the White House in April last year.  The research – conducted by 100 scientists working across eight government agencies – represents the most exhaustive look to date at the health impacts of climate change within the US, officials claimed on Monday.  Earlier researchers have called attention to the risks of heatwaves, air pollution and illnesses borne by insects such as mosquitoes under climate change as well as the declining nutritional value of food staples such as wheat and rice. Last year, scientists warned that extreme heat could make outdoor work perilous and parts of the Middle East uninhabitable. The officials made it clear they hoped the findings would broaden public support for cutting the carbon emissions that cause climate change.  “Climate change is already under way and no matter what we do it can’t be stopped overnight,” Holdren told reporters. “But there is a huge difference in magnitude of impacts if we fail to act and the much smaller magnitude we expect if we take aggressive action set out in the president’s climate action plan.” The urgency of the warning reflects growing understanding among scientists of the widespread impacts of climate change.  It also lays to rest the false claim by those obstructing efforts to cut emissions that there are more positives than negatives in warmer temperature conditions. Hot, sunny days cook more smog which makes breathing conditions worse for sufferers of asthma, emphysema and other respiratory conditions. Warming temperatures also extend the allergy season and fuel the risk of wildfires – whose smoke also worsens air quality. “By the end of the century we are looking at an increase of tens of thousands of illnesses and death episodes because of climate change,” the surgeon general told reporters.  Higher temperatures were also encouraging the spread of illnesses carried by ticks and mosquitoes such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus, Murthy went on. The report did not look at Zika. The public health threats laid out in the report were on the cards for future generations of Americans even with the emissions commitments contained in the Paris climate agreement, the officials said. Governments have been clear from the outset that the agreement reached in Paris last December was only a preliminary step towards limiting warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels.  Under the agreement, governments committed to make even deeper cuts in emissions in the coming decades. “We will need a big encore after 2030 in terms of further deep cuts in order to avoid the bulk of the deeper impacts described in this report,” Holdren said."

"More than a thousand diesel cars have been caught without an essential pollution filter that traps deadly particles, according to government figures. But experts warn the rogue practice of removing the filters, which contributes to air pollution-related deaths, could be far more widespread. Almost 29,000 people die prematurely each year in the UK owing to particle pollution, causing £15bn in health costs. Since 2009 diesel particulate filters (DPFs) have been compulsory in new diesel cars. But, particularly for cars driven in cities, the DPFs can become clogged and cause breakdowns.  Replacing DPFs usually costs more than a £1,000 and, as a result, many garages across the country offer to remove the filter completely for a few hundred pounds. Removing the filter is not illegal, but driving a car without a DPF is an offence and particle emissions from the exhaust pipe are likely to soar fivefold as a result. In 2014, ministers said the “unacceptable” practice was “clearly detrimental to people’s health” and introduced a visual check into the MOT. This has caught 1,188 vehicles so far, according to figures given to the Guardian by the Department for Transport (DfT).  However, many garages offer to circumvent the visual check by, for example, by “discreetly cutting a small window in the top of the chamber, removing the internal filter before rewelding the window and refitting to the vehicle. This way the vehicle still appears to have a DPF fitted and … will have no affect on your MOT.” Garages also claim removing the DPF will increase power and fuel efficiency, with one promising “your engine will breathe again”.  Simon Birkett, director of Clean Air in London (CAL), said: “The thought of raw and carcinogenic diesel exhaust being spewed on to our high streets is terrifying. The diesel catastrophe, worsened by DPF removal, will affect the health of everyone in the UK.” He added: “CAL estimates that tens of thousands and more likely hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles have been tampered with in this way. As more and more vehicles come out of warranty and parts wear out, this problem will grow.” Dave Garratt, chief executive at the Garage Equipment Association, said: “[DPF removal] has been going on for a long time and it is probably getting progressively worse. The biggest hole in the MOT is that they don’t really check it. [Visual inspection] does not actually tell you if there is a core in the canister. I’d guess there are a lot more out there.” One garage owner, who has now stopped removing DPFs and did not want to be named, said: “We were inundated with vehicles with DPF problems. Removal was the quick fix.” The roads minister, Andrew Jones, said: “We are fully committed to improving air quality and the new figures are proof that our common-sense changes to the MOT test are helping get hundreds of polluting vehicles off the road. We continue to tackle harmful vehicle emissions and are investigating ways to use the latest technology to further improve detection methods.” The DfT has commissioned research on how existing or new technology can be used to detect DPF removal by measuring exhaust fumes. One possibility is adapting the use of the equipment that performs the current MOT smoke test to make it more sensitive. The findings may be implemented as part of changes to the Roadworthiness Directive, which sets the framework for MOT testing, and is scheduled to be introduced in the UK in 2017-18. However, ministers face calls for more urgent action. “It is such a clear cut issue,” said Patrick Streeter, an elected councillor in the City of London Corporation, who has taken up the issue with the police. “They have to get out there and arrest these people. They need to raid the garages to collect the registration numbers [of the cars that have had DPF removed]. The pollution is absolutely terrible.” Cleaning the DPF is possible and usually costs less than replacement but more than removal. Ceramex is one company offering the service and its managing director, Rob Rule, said DPF removal was undercutting action by politicians and car makers to improve the UK’s poor air quality. “It drives me absolutely bonkers,” he said. “Not only is it immoral and illegal, you are undermining so much cost and effort that is going into cleaning up the environment. It is antisocial.” Rule backed calls for a further crackdown on DPF removal, saying: “If there is one thing that could improve air quality in [cities], it would be to send the police to garages to tell them they are committing a criminal act, then go back if they don’t change their act.” In October, police in Spain raided a string of garages which were allegedly performing DPF removal, while in the US in 2013, a company agreed to pay a $500,000 (£350,000) fine for DPF-related violations. Birkett said: “The UK government must outlaw the removal of DPFs, modernise and mandate the testing of exhaust emissions during the MOT and introduce random on-road testing.” Spot checks used to take place in the UK but were stopped in 2011, with the government saying they had unearthed only two problems in a decade and that anti-pollution funding was better spent elsewhere. DPF removal services are widely advertised across the UK. The Guardian contacted five garages offering the service on their websites. Two claimed their websites were out of date but did not subsequently update them. Two said managers would call back, but they did not. One said the service was offered only to off-road vehicles, though the website made no mention of this caveat. Experts said DPF removal could invalidate car insurance if not declared and that the vehicle inspections offered by motoring organisations to prospective car buyers were visual checks only. The notice issued to MOT testers in 2014 said: “The DPF plays an essential environmental role in enabling reductions in emissions, reducing air pollution and thereby improving health quality.”"

"No other British company has benefited from the EU’s emissions trading scheme as much as Tata Steel, according to a recent report by consultants CTDelft. And it’s not alone — only firms in one country, Germany, received more than the €3bn pocketed by British businesses through the ETS between 2008 and 2014. Yet Tata Steel’s chairman, Theo Henrar, argued that the ETS put its Port Talbot steelworks at “a competitive disadvantage”, because foreign rivals were not burdened by such tough environmental rules.  Enraged environmentalists have countered with studies by independent consultancies and market analysts showing that since 2008, Tata has taken more than £700m from the ETS in free allowances, offsets and windfall profits passed through to consumers. Before the Paris climate agreement put all countries on notice to lower their emissions, the argument for “carbon leakage” measures – compensation to stop companies relocating their businesses elsewhere in the world because of Europe’s climate policies — appeared robust. The notion that cleaner European steel manufacturers could be forced to migrate to compete appeared commonsensical. But one problem the European commission faced in supporting compensation was a lack of evidence that such leakage had ever occurred, according to its own studies. An OECD report last month was the latest to conclude that “tougher environmental laws do not hurt export competitiveness”. In practice, the glut of free carbon allowances under the ETS – which cost the UK £13bn in lost revenues – has worked less as a trade protection, and more as an undeclared subsidy, or tax break. But labour costs in the UK are around 20 times higher than in China and, despite the handouts under the ETS, cheap Chinese steel imports to Britain more than doubled in 2014. Research suggests that subsidies for polluters were, for the most part, not spent on innovation or research. Sharan Burrow, the secretary general of the International Trades Union Confederation and a New Climate Energy commissioner, complained that the handouts also depleted funds that could have enabled a more just energy transition. “Companies must accept [that] industrial transformation is essential to stabilise the planet and stop demanding a free ride,” she said. “Saving billions of dollars that can be used to support a just transition for workers in fossil fuels and invest in renewal for vulnerable communities is worth doing.”  Safeguards for such communities in places like Port Talbot were not high on the agenda of the EU institutions – or environmentalists – when the carbon leakage debate raged in Brussels. But they will probably heave into view again, as the proposed Port Talbot buyout by Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty Group is examined. Gupta reportedly wants to replace the blast oxygen furnace used at Port Talbot with an electric arc furnace. Arc furnaces are secondary steel plants. They recycle scrap steel that has already been made – and use electricity rather than coal or gas to power their production process. Industry sources say that these plants – which make up around 40% of Europe’s capacity – typically produce nearly five times less CO2 than blast furnaces. If Gupta’s plans to power an arc furnace in Port Talbot with renewable energy are realised, its greenhouse gas emissions could be greatly reduced. The Carbon Commentary blog estimates that a switch from blast to electric arc furnaces would save over three tonnes of CO2 for each tonne of steel. For steelworkers, though, this would be a mixed blessing, as arc furnaces employ far fewer people. Profits might be increased by the scything of pensions payments, but communities would also be devastated by mass layoffs. And that brings us back to the “just transition” question of who will pay for the low-carbon-energy revolution.  The closure of Britain’s mining industry may have been a defining moment for “green conservatism”, albeit at a terrible human cost. But the question, when the markets-first model is being extended to steel, is why employers should be shielded from its logic when their workers are not. "
"The city of Miami Beach is slowly disappearing under water. At the big high tides of the year the sea washes over the famous wide beach and floods many of the city streets and magnificent Art Deco buildings. And over the past decade the floods have been striking more frequently. Most of the city sits just a few feet above sea level, built on a foundation of porous limestone, allowing the rising seas to seep into the city’s foundations, surge up through pipes and drains, encroaching on fresh water supplies and saturating infrastructure. The city is now investing in a $500m project to raise roads and a pumping system to hold back the floods.  Miami Beach is one of the world’s most vulnerable cities to sea floods, but much of Florida’s coastline is facing similar problems. The Everglades wetlands is at risk from invading seawater and the Florida Keys are regularly flooded at extreme high tides. Nasa is facing floods from Atlantic storms at the Kennedy Space Centre and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on the Florida coast. But the most urgent threat is to drinking water as saltwater, and the pollution it flushes out, invades underground, and is now moving close to drinking water supplies for 6 million residents. So it’s no surprise that 81% of people in Florida polled recently said they believe that climate change is happening now – an increase on the 63% in 2012. And yet climate change has been drowned out in the US presidential primary elections – apart from political debates in Miami."
"About 170 countries gathered at the United Nations for a ceremonial signing of the landmark Paris agreement on Friday, in a powerful display of global efforts to fight climate change. A dozen countries – mainly the small island states at risk of being drowned by rising seas – said they would take the additional step on Friday of ratifying or granting legal approval to the agreement. The renewed commitments, and the personal appearance at the UN by about 60 heads of state, delivered a sense of momentum to efforts to bring the agreement into force far earlier than had originally been hoped. The agreement reached in Paris by 196 countries still needs formal approval from 55 countries representing 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions to come into force. In some cases, that means a vote in parliament. The US, China and India - the three biggest climate polluters - have all committed to join the agreement, possibly as early as this year. Leaders said the events on Friday were a sign that governments, business leaders and campaign groups were aligned with trying to move swiftly to phase out the use of fossil fuels and move almost entirely to clean sources of energy by the middle of the century. “Today’s signing ceremony reaffirms the commitments made last December and delivers a jolt of energy to international climate efforts,” Felipe Calderón, the former president of Mexico, said. The signature ceremony, kicked off by François Hollande, as host of the Paris climate talks, will be an elaborate affair. Leaders will make their way one-by-one in alphabetical order to a special podium at the General Assembly to sign the single copy of the agreement, translated into six languages. Amid the celebratory atmosphere, with Leonardo DiCaprio scheduled to appear, leaders and scientists agreed: the measures covered by the Paris agreement still fall far short of reaching the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C to 2C above pre-industrial levels, and time is running out. Last year was the hottest year since record keeping began in 1880. Temperatures for the first three months of this year have already demolished that record – confounding scientists by the scale and pace of temperature rise. In the Arctic, there was almost no winter, with temperatures at the North Pole rising above freezing even in December, the depths of the polar night. Temperatures were up to 16C above normal. On Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, some 93% of coral showed evidence of bleaching, because of long term ocean warming due to carbon emissions, and the El Niño weather phenomenon.       "

"China’s offshore oil drilling firm and the country’s largest oil producer with $98.53bn in revenue in 2014, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) inevitably disturbs marine life as it probes seabeds around the world for resources. Like other big oil firms, the company has caused its share of environmental disasters, including a 2011 oil spill that contaminated 840 sq km (324 sq miles) of Bohai Bay, off China’s northeastern shore. CNOOC got in trouble with government regulators for initially concealing the spill and has since been named in a lawsuit.  But the company has also been spending hard to make amends for its environmental sins. From 2008 to the end of 2014, its Southeast Asia subsidiary spent $1m to plant coral reefs and protect mangrove stands in the Thousand Islands archipelago of Indonesia. Some of the money also bought equipment to help local people breed and keep up the sea turtle population, which was dwindling because of illegal trade and habitat loss, in the waters north of Jakarta. In all, CNOOC sank the equivalent of $18m into charity and other social programs in 2014. CNOOC’s spending is unusual among Chinese companies. Only 10% of Chinese firms carry out corporate social and environmental initiatives, typically charity work, according to SynTao, a Beijing-based consulting firm on corporate sustainability. In February, SynTao and European nonprofit Globethics released an online directory of 6,000 sustainability reports from China. They found 1,300 reports filed for 2013 and 666 the following year. Meanwhile, sustainability has been part of the corporate vernacular in the US and Europe for decades; its meaning is starting to expand to include strategies for cutting costs and improving companies’ bottom lines, an approach to build social and environmental initiatives into long term business plans. Sustainability reporting by S&P 500 firms rose from 20% in 2011 to 81% in 2015, according to New York-based consultant G&A Institute. A study by auditing and management consulting firm KPMG in 2011 found that 95% of the world’s 250 largest companies did the same.  To achieve its climate goals, Chinese companies must start putting money into projects that will minimize their environmental impact, which has created air so dirty that it’s among the chief causes for lung cancer. In 2014, the country, which is the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, committed to cap its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The country signed the historic Paris climate deal in a UN ceremony on 22 April, where China also announced it would “finalize domestic procedures” to ratify the agreement before the G-20 summit in China in September.  “Companies (historically) looked at sustainable initiatives from a compliance approach or as a public relations tool,” said Yuan Yuan, senior program coordinator with the Global Reporting Initiative, an Amsterdam-based organization that designs corporate responsibility reporting standards. “Chinese companies are gradually becoming more and more proactive.” Even before China committed to capping emissions, it had begun to address the environmental impact of its growing economy. In 2008, the government started to require state-owned firms to regularly review and change their practices to save energy, manage resources more efficiently and cut pollution. Since then, about half of China’s state-owned companies – generally the largest and oldest ones – carried out sustainability projects, said SynTao’s co-founder Guo Peiyuan. In 2011, state-owned China Petrochemical Corp, the country’s chief petroleum and petrochemical producer, began reporting its sustainability efforts, which have included water conservation, wildlife protection and carbon footprint reduction. The government-backed Industrial and Commercial Bank of China began its efforts in 2007, launching projects that reduce poverty and help startup businesses grow. China Vanke Co, a major property developer, puts money into habitat preservation in the cities where it does business. In recent years, the Chinese government has begun to toughen environmental regulations that apply across state-owned and private businesses as severe air and water pollution, a result of the country’s fast-growing economy in recent decades, is being linked to an increase in cases of cancer and other serious health problems, and costing its economy billions of dollars. “China’s interaction with the environment will be very much driven by government policy and they are really serious about this,” said Tim Clissold, author of Mr. China: A Memoir. “There is a genuine effort underway to clear up the mess and, like Western governments before them, I’m sure that over time they will solve this problem. They have no choice.” Even without climate change and the government to contend with, many Chinese companies are facing growing pressure to improve their business ethics in order to attract investments and win contracts. Much of the nudging comes from their overseas customers and partners. One of the most high profile cases began with a string of employee suicides in 2010 at Foxconn, a Chinese manufacturer that makes iPhones and iPads for Apple. Long working hours, paltry pay and other conditions at its sprawling manufacturing compound – and the media attention on these conditions – have forced the company and Apple to make changes in labor practices that included increasing wages. “The increasingly competitive global marketplace and the rise of social media, coupled with more and more conscientious consumers, are drivers for [corporate sustainability] inside or outside China,” said Song Seng Wun, economist in the private banking unit of CIMB in Singapore. In 2014, the Swedish Embassy in Beijing and research firm CSR Asia surveyed 2,944 people, including corporate sustainability officers from Chinese and international companies, academic researchers and non-government groups, to find out more about what was driving sustainability practices in China. Some 46% said demand by international buyers was the second biggest reason (after the government) that they had developed sustainability plans. Other motivators included media coverage, industry peer pressure and demand from the Chinese public. The survey also found that energy and banking are the two business sectors that have done the most in cutting emissions and implementing other sustainability programs. That said, critics still say Chinese companies have a long way to go to do their part in reining in global warming when most of them don’t build sustainability into their long term business plans. “There are quite a number of Chinese companies that are competitive worldwide, acting as role models in sustainable initiatives and their approaches and reports are following international best practice,” Yuan of the Global Reporting Initiative said.  “But there are still thousands of companies that show no real awareness of sustainability issues. The gaps in this market remain, therefore, quite large.” "
"Scientists say they are fed up with Queensland’s biggest newspaper not covering the worst bleaching event to hit the Great Barrier Reef, so have taken out a full page ad to get the message out. The ad comes as a survey revealed 93% of the Great Barrier Reef was affected by the bleaching. That finding motivated the Queensland government to call on the federal government to convene an urgent meeting of the nation’s environment ministers to talk about measures to address climate change in light of bleaching.  Organised by the Climate Council, the full page ad in the Courier Mail on Thursday contains an open letter signed by 56 scientists.  “One of the reasons we placed the ad in the Courier Mail was that we’ve seen very little coverage of the coral bleaching event in that paper and in fact there was a front-page story that said the coral bleaching event had been wildly exaggerated,” said Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland and one of the signatories of the letter. The letter explains that it is the worst bleaching event in its history, and that it is being driven by climate change. “The Great Barrier Reef is at a crisis point,” the scientists say. “Its future depends on how much and how quickly the world, including Australia, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit ocean warming.” It then calls for Australia to rapidly phase out coal-fired power stations and for no new coalmines. “This must be the top priority for Australia if we are to protect what remains of the Great Barrier Reef and other reefs around the world,” they say.  Climate Council member and signatory to the letter Lesley Hughes said: “We are now seeing first-hand the damage that climate change causes, and we have a duty of care to speak out.” On 7 February, the Courier Mail ran a story quoting the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, as saying the reef remained an untouched beauty. His comments were in response to a David Attenborough documentary about the Great Barrier Reef being aired. “The key point that I had from seeing the first of the three parts is that, clearly, the world’s Great Barrier Reef is still the world’s Great Barrier Reef,” Hunt told the Courier Mail. The story included a subheading that read: “Reports of reef’s death greatly exaggerated: Attenborough”. A News Corp Australia spokesman said on Wednesday that the claim there had been very little coverage of coral bleaching in the Courier Mail was “frankly baffling”. “A quick Google search shows numerous stories have been published including, to highlight just a few, on March 1st, 21st and 30th. And today the paper has covered the issue extensively once again,” he said. “Equally importantly the paper also exposed Greenpeace’s dishonesty in using deceptive imagery on two separate occasions. Such scare campaigns only serve to undermine the efforts to secure the reef’s future.”  A story about the 93% bleaching appeared in Thursday’s paper on page 13. The Queensland environment minister, Steven Miles, called for an urgent meeting with Hunt, and said “we have to move quickly on climate change,” and bemoaned the “lack of a coherent effective national policy.” “The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, has been downplaying the seriousness of the coral bleaching because he knows the major cause is global warming and we still haven’t seen any meaningful climate change policy from the federal level,” Miles said. The Queensland government itself has been criticised for approving Adani’s Carmichael mine, which would be Australia’s largest coalmine. Federal approval of the mine will be challenged in court this month, on the basis that emissions released when the coal is burned will threaten the Great Barrier Reef."

"There is an overwhelming expert scientific consensus on human-caused global warming.  Authors of seven previous climate consensus studies — including Naomi Oreskes, Peter Doran, William Anderegg, Bart Verheggen, Ed Maibach, J. Stuart Carlton, John Cook, myself, and six of our colleagues — have co-authored a new paper that should settle this question once and for all. The two key conclusions from the paper are:  1) Depending on exactly how you measure the expert consensus, it’s somewhere between 90% and 100% that agree humans are responsible for climate change, with most of our studies finding 97% consensus among publishing climate scientists. 2) The greater the climate expertise among those surveyed, the higher the consensus on human-caused global warming. Expert consensus is a powerful thing. People know we don’t have the time or capacity to learn about everything, and so we frequently defer to the conclusions of experts. It’s why we visit doctors when we’re ill. The same is true of climate change: most people defer to the expert consensus of climate scientists. Crucially, as we note in our paper: Public perception of the scientific consensus has been found to be a gateway belief, affecting other climate beliefs and attitudes including policy support. That’s why those who oppose taking action to curb climate change have engaged in a misinformation campaign to deny the existence of the expert consensus. They’ve been largely successful, as the public badly underestimate the expert consensus, in what we call the “consensus gap.” Only 12% of Americans realize that the consensus is above 90%. Our latest paper was written in response to a critique published by Richard Tol in Environmental Research Letters, commenting on the 2013 paper published in the same journal by John Cook, myself, and colleagues finding a 97% consensus on human-caused global warming in the peer-reviewed literature.  Tol argues that when considering results from previous consensus studies, the Cook 97% figure is an outlier, which he claims is much higher than most other climate consensus estimates. He makes this argument by looking at sub-samples from previous surveys. For example, Doran’s 2009 study broke down the survey data by profession – the consensus was 47% among economic geologists, 64% among meteorologists, 82% among all Earth scientists, and 97% among publishing climate scientists. The lower the climate expertise in each group, the lower the consensus. Like several of these consensus surveys, Doran cast a wide net and included responses from many non-experts, but among the experts, the consensus is consistently between 90% and 100%. However, by including the non-expert samples, it’s possible to find low “consensus” values. The flaw in this approach is especially clear when we consider the most ridiculous sub-sample included in Tol’s critique: Verheggen’s 2015 study included a grouping of predominantly non-experts who were “unconvinced” by human-caused global warming, among whom the consensus was 7%. The only surprising thing about this number is that more than zero of those “unconvinced” by human-caused global warming agree that humans are the main cause of global warming. In his paper, Tol included this 7% “unconvinced,” non-expert sub-sample as a data point in his argument that the 97% consensus result is unusually high. By breaking out all of these sub-samples of non-experts, the critique thus misrepresented a number of previous consensus studies in an effort to paint our 97% result as an outlier. The authors of those misrepresented studies were not impressed with this approach, denouncing the misrepresentations of their work in no uncertain terms.  We subsequently collaborated with those authors in this newly-published scholarly response, bringing together an all-star lineup of climate consensus experts. The following quote from the paper sums up our feelings about the critique’s treatment of our research: Tol’s (2016) conflation of unrepresentative non-expert sub-samples and samples of climate experts is a misrepresentation of the results of previous studies, including those published by a number of coauthors of this paper. In our paper, we show that including non-experts is the only way to argue for a consensus below 90–100%. The greater the climate expertise among those included in the survey sample, the higher the consensus on human-caused global warming. Similarly, if you want to know if you need open heart surgery, you’ll get much more consistent answers (higher consensus) if you only ask cardiologists than if you also survey podiatrists, neurologists, and dentists. That’s because, as we all know, expertise matters. It’s easy to manufacture a smaller non-expert “consensus” number and argue that it contradicts the 97% figure. As our new paper shows, when you ask the climate experts, the consensus on human-caused global warming is between 90% and 100%, with several studies finding 97% consensus among publishing climate scientists. There’s some variation in the percentage, depending on exactly how the survey is done and how the question is worded, but ultimately it’s still true that there’s a 97% consensus in the peer-reviewed scientific literature on human-caused global warming. In fact, even Richard Tol has agreed: The consensus is of course in the high nineties. In fact, some believe our 97% consensus estimate was too low. These claims are usually based on an analysis done by James Powell, and the difference simply boils down to how “consensus” is defined. Powell evaluated the percentage of papers that don’t explicitly reject human-caused global warming in their abstracts. That includes 99.83% of papers published between 1991 and 2012, and 99.96% of papers published in 2013. In short, 97% of peer-reviewed climate research that states a position on human-caused warming endorses the consensus, and about 99.9% of the total climate research doesn’t explicitly reject human-caused global warming. Our two analyses simply answer different questions. The percentage of experts and their research that endorse the theory is a better description of “consensus.” However, Powell’s analysis is useful in showing how few peer-reviewed scientific papers explicitly reject human-caused global warming. In any case, there’s really no question that humans are the driving force causing global warming. The experts are almost universally convinced because the scientific evidence is overwhelming. Denying the consensus by misrepresenting the research won’t change that reality.  With all of the consensus authors teaming up to show the 90–100% expert consensus on human-caused global warming, and most finding 97% consensus among publishing climate scientists, this paper should be the final word on the subject. • This footnote was appended on 22 April 2016: Professor Richard Tol disputes a number of assertions made in this article, in particular the claims that he makes his argument by looking at sub-samples from previous surveys (he says his argument is based on whole samples) and that his critique misrepresents previous consensus studies (as earlier results are reproduced exactly). He has also asked us to clarify that the sub-sample referred to above as “ridiculous” is from Verheggen’s 2015 study; it was not created by Tol, though it was used in his critique. He writes more about this on his blog here and here, and his comment in Environmental Research Letters, published in the same edition as the paper described above, can be read here."
"Ocean temperatures off the coast of Tasmania have risen to 4.5C above average – twice the temperature rise that led to the mass coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef – in a marine heatwave that has lasted more than 130 days. The above-average temperatures were first recorded in December and have continued into April, affecting the oyster, salmon and abalone industries, as well as stressing already declining kelp forests.  Dr Alistair Hobday, a senior principal research scientist with the CSIRO in Tasmania, said the heatwave could be attributed to El Niño, which extends the southern tip of the East Australian Current down to Tasmania, bringing warmer waters with it, and the effects of climate change. “Part of the warming we just can’t explain as being down to something other than global warming,” Hobday told Guardian Australia. “In about four months – we are doing that work now – we will be able to say that 60% of it is due to climate change and 40% is due to El Niño.” While the heatwave’s visual impacts were “not as dramatic as the bleaching of the coral reef”, Hobday said it had contributed to the mass death of oysters from Pacific Oyster mortality syndrome (Poms), which had never been reported in the state before devastating Tasmanian oyster farms this summer.  The higher temperatures were also linked to abalone deaths and a decline in the salmon harvest.  The effect of the heatwave on local marine species is still being studied, but Hobday said some species, such as the giant kelp forests on the east coast, which have declined by more than 90% in the past 40 years, were already suffering the effects of longer-term warming. Other species have been slowly shifting south. “It’s the same as when Tasmanian people go to Queensland for a holiday: they can’t stand the heat and humidity, yet Queenslanders who have lived there for some time cope with it fine,” Hobday said. Ocean temperatures off Tasmania have increased by 2C in the past 100 years, three times the global average ocean temperature rise, and the island sits within a recognised global warming hot spot. Hobday said the heatwave provided scientists and aquaculture businesses with “a glimpse of the future”. “People who are involved in ocean businesses are going to have to say, ‘look, if this is what it’s going to be like, we should learn about how to adapt’,” he said. “You just should not ignore a look in the crystal ball.” Data collected through public reports on RedMap.org.au, a project led by the University of Tasmania’s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), have shown an increase in species such as snapper and yellowtail kingfish, which were previously seen in very low numbers in Tasmanian waters. The yellow-bellied sea snake, from the south coast of New South Wales, and jimble jellyfish, usually found only on the north coast of Australia, from Western Australia to Southern Queensland, have also been sighted. “We are seeing species move – the problem is that different species can do that at different rates,” the University of Tasmania’s associate professor Gretta Pecl, who helps run the project, told Guardian Australia. “It’s causing these large differences in our ecosystems. The clearest example of that in Tasmania is the long-spined sea urchin, which is moving down the east coast... eating all the kelp forests and leaving behind these rocky urchin barrens that rock lobsters and other organisms don’t like to live in,” she said. “The larvae can survive at 12 degrees, so as our winter temperatures hit that 12 degree threshold now, it’s allowing more and more of them to survive.” Professor Philip Boyd, with IMAS, said species that preferred cooler waters were at risk of extinction if they could not migrate or adapt in time, or, as the higher temperatures extended south, were left with nowhere to go. “As you get to the southern extremity of Tasmania, you can’t just keep having these kelp forests, because you run out of coastline and end up in deeper water,” Boyd said. “It’s already undermining the whole ecosystem that’s there.”"
"Forty-four years ago, the size of the global economy was £20tn in today’s prices. In 2014 it was £55.18tn. It’s certainly been a rocky road at times, but the trend of economic growth has been robust. Only four years over this period have shown a contraction of economic output. Consequently, one should feel foolish for suggesting that there are not only limits to growth, but that such limits are already affecting the global economy. That’s one evaluation of the book Limits to Growth, which was published in 1972 and contained the central, controversial conclusion that the seemingly never-ending increase in population, industrial output, food production, and resource use would rapidly unravel at some point around the middle of the 21st century.   It painted a picture of our over-inflated global industrialised civilisation going bang. We are still here and growth continues, so it must be wrong, right? Perhaps not. The Limits to Growth study was commissioned by the global thinktank Club of Rome and was based on the output of computer simulations that represented a simple global economy and its interactions with environmental processes. Nowadays you could happily run this model on your phone. In the early 1970s it required a mainframe computer and cutting-edge numerical techniques. Two studies have evaluated how well the 1972 results of the Limits to Growth model have fared compared to what has actually happened in the intervening period. Their main findings are that it did pretty well actually. That doesn’t mean collapse is inevitable, but that despite its simplicity, Limits to Growth captured some important features of our civilisation. It concluded that there are two drivers of a possible collapse. First, non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels should become harder to extract. This makes them more expensive with costs feeding into, among other things, higher food prices and so the global food production system fails to keep up with demand. Second, pollution produced by industry swamps the Earth’s capacity to absorb them, with the spillover affecting both food production and human health. It was possible to avoid collapse, but that proved very hard to do. In fact, the only reliable way to avoid overshoot was not just by increasing rates of technological innovation, but by reducing growth rates. Not just population growth rates, but economic and industrial. Many begged to differ, and argued that above all, growth must be maintained. Growth has delivered increased living standards and poverty alleviation. Reduced growth threatens stagnation. Worse, recession. If one resource begins to run out, then we will find another. Necessity is the mother of invention. Just look at fossil fuels. In the early 1970s, Opec was flexing its economic muscles and constricting oil supply. The price rocketed. At the same time some oil wells in the US were running dry. But since then, enhanced oil recovery techniques such as fracking have been developed to gain access to even more fossil fuels. The threat of “peak oil” is now very last century. Over this same period, agricultural productivity increased significantly as the green revolution was rolled out across the world. So, rather than running out of resources, we live in a world of plenty. However, this fails to address the other half of the limits equation - pollution. In 1972, global annual emissions of greenhouse gasses was equivalent to approximately 16bn tons of CO2. In 2014 it was 36bn tons. Pollution from burning fossil fuels is rapidly changing the Earth’s climate.  There is a growing body of evidence that this climate change will have significant economic costs in the near future, not to mention its impacts on human health and biodiversity. Some scenarios of dangerous climate change are just as apocalyptic as any depicted by Limits to Growth.  Today, vastly more complex integrated assessment models grapple with the myriad interactions between civilisation and the Earth system. But Limits to Growth continues to be of interest because it critically examines what is perhaps the most fundamental assumption in our current economic system: that growth will ultimately fix all of humanity’s problems, even those produced by growth itself. • On Tuesday the all-party parliamentary group on Limits to Growth launches at the House of Commons."

"The statistic is startling. In the past two years, the global economy has grown by 6.5 percent, but carbon dioxide emissions from energy generation and transport have not grown at all, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported last month. CO2 emissions in Europe, the United States, and — most stunningly — China have been falling. What is going on? These numbers raise a key question of huge importance if nations are to avoid the worst effects of climate change: Is the world on a path toward “decoupling” economic activity from carbon dioxide emissions?   Put another way: Is the idea of a future of “green growth,” with prosperity rising and emissions falling, real? Or as some fear, is it a dangerous myth?  When the United Nations holds an official signing ceremony for the Paris climate agreement on April 22, the hope is this high-profile event will ensure political momentum for meeting the Paris pledge to halt global warming at “well below” two degrees Celsius. But even climate scientists elated by the Paris agreement agree that, even with political will, the task will be extremely tough. Many are unsure whether to be optimists, keen to show the job can be done, or pessimists, determined to ensure nobody thinks it will be easy.  In its analysis last month, the IEA, a body linked with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), reported that global CO2 emissions from energy-related activities have not risen since 2013, staying at 32.1 billion tons even as the global economy grew.  This surprising “decoupling” of emissions from economic activity was led by the two largest emitters, China and the U.S., which both registered declines in emissions of about 1.5 percent.  The IEA finding followed a similar conclusion about global emissions from an international team of climate scientists, headed by Corinne le Quere of the University of East Anglia in England, reported during the Paris climate conference last December.  A good part of the decoupling, both studies agree, is attributable to China. Its turnaround has been “quite remarkable,” says Fergus Green, an analyst of China’s energy policy at the London School of Economics. The country’s coal use grew annually by more than 8 percent between 2000 and 2013, and that growth was the biggest single cause of rising global CO2 emissions. As recently as 2011, China got 80 percent of its electricity from coal.  But growing concern about killer smogs has triggered new controls that mean many coal-burning power plants in China have now been mothballed. Coal burning fell by 3 percent in 2015, by which time the percentage of China’s electricity produced by coal had fallen to 70 percent, according to the IEA.  Chinese emissions from oil and gas burning continue to grow, Green says. But that is more than counterbalanced by a combination of declining use of coal and reductions in energy demand from structural changes in the Chinese economy, with energy-guzzling heavy industries like cement and steel production both now declining.  Per head of population, Chinese emissions exceed those of Europe, even though average income is less than a half that of citizens of the European Union. But China seems set on the road to climate redemption. In Paris, Beijing pledged to peak emissions by 2030. In fact, it may already have done so, says Green. And even if not, he foresees only small increases from now on.  China is following a road already taken by more economically developed nations. The carbon intensity of high-income OECD countries has more than halved since 1970, meaning half as much CO2 is now emitted for every dollar of GDP.  Lately, things have gone further. U.S. emissions have been falling for more than half a decade now, as coal burning is replaced by fracked natural gas and wind power. The United States has become 28 percent richer, but 6 percent cleaner since 2000, says Nate Aden of the World Resources Institute, who reported that, since 2000, 21 countries — all in Europe, except the U.S. and Uzbekistan — have reduced their carbon emissions while growing GDP.  Britain, for instance, grew its economy by 27 percent while cutting emissions by 20 percent between 2000 and 2014.  Part of this national decoupling is a result of advanced economies offshoring heavy industry to places like China, says Aden, with most of the “decouplers” having reduced the industrial share of their economic activity. But this is a minor element, he believes. These 21 nations show an average emissions reduction of 15 percent, but cuts in the industrial share of GDP are just 3 percent. That said, clearly not all countries are decoupling. Emissions continue to rise in much of Asia and the Middle East. From Turkey to India, enthusiasm for coal remains strong. India has plans to double its already large coal production, which the Delhi government justifies by pointing out that its per-capita emissions remain only one-tenth of those of the U.S. But optimists note that, despite the bluster, India also has big plans for expanding solar energy production.  It is far from clear, says the University of East Anglia’s le Quere, that the world has yet reached peak emissions of CO2 from energy sources — still less that this translates into a peak in greenhouse gas emissions overall. But with the three largest emitters — China, the U.S., and the European Union — all showing evidence of decoupling, the signs are suddenly rather encouraging.  The first hint that decoupling was under way came four years ago, when a report from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and the European Commission’s Joint Research Center (JRC) found that in 2012,CO2 emissions rose just 1.1 percent globally, while GDP rose 3.5 percent. Greet Janssens-Maenhout of the JRC says now: “There has been continuous and increasing decoupling over the past four years.” There is no modern precedent. Global CO2 emissions growth briefly faltered in the early 1980s, in 1992, and again in 2009; but in each case this was due to a decline in economic activity.  The biggest cause of decoupling is the dramatic growth of renewable energy. Last year, more than twice as much money was put into new capacity for renewables such as solar and wind power than into new power stations burning fossil fuels, according to a new analysis by the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. For the first time, the majority of this investment was in developing countries, with China responsible for 36 percent of the total.  The reason has as much to do with price as climate policies. The cost of photovoltaic equipment, much of it manufactured in China, has fallen by 80 percent in the past decade. As a result, auctions for solar power in Texashave recently seen prices as low as 4 cents per kilowatt hour, which is below the price of most coal-generated energy.  Renewables still only deliver about 10 percent of the total electricity generated worldwide. Even so, Ulf Moslener, a coauthor of the Frankfurt report, said recent investment in green energy has cut annual CO2 emissions from all energy sources, including transport, by about 1.5 billion tons, or 5 percent, from where they would otherwise be.  The growth of renewables is being accompanied by a sharp decline in coal burning, not only in China, but in the U.S. and elsewhere. Canadian climate blogger Kyla Mandel recently noted that a quarter of European Union countries no longer burn any coal for power generation.  This process is being amplified by a flight of capital, as investors fear that expensive coal mines and coal-burning power plants may become “stranded assets,” with no markets, as renewables ramp up and limits on CO2 emissions begin to bite. The coal industry has been hit hard, with the largest U.S. coal company, Peabody Energy, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection just this week. This concern is likely to spread to other fossil fuels, says British energy analyst and former Greenpeace science director Jeremy Leggett. Current low oil prices may encourage oil burning and could postpone the market penetration of, for instance, electric cars. But low prices also discourage investment in new oil fields. As Leggett put it in a recent blog: “Most fossil fuel companies face a future in which they might not have the capital to expand even if they still want to.”  But there are countervailing trends. The IEA’s emissions audit does not cover all CO2 emissions. Deforestation for the past half century has been a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, although that too now appears to be declining. More worrying — because they are still increasing fast but were left out of the Paris agreement — are emissions from international aviation and shipping.  Expansion plans for the aviation industry could lead to emissions from this source tripling by 2040, says Annie Petsonk of the Environmental Defense Fund. Once these are taken into account, “the decoupling claimed for many nations disappears altogether,” says Kevin Anderson of the University of Manchester in England.  The aviation industry may reach agreement later this year on plans to offset its emissions by investing in United Nations schemes for forest conservation. But some environmentalists are concerned that the industry will simply be funding projects already promised by governments as part of their plans to meet their Paris pledges. If so, there will be no additional benefit to the planet. There are growing concerns too about trends for some other greenhouse gases — in particular, the second most-important man-made planet warmer, methane, the main constituent of natural gas. When burned, natural gas produces energy with fewer CO2 emissions than coal. But if distribution systems leak significant amounts of gas, the warming effect of that methane could negate the benefit of switching off coal.  “Methane numbers may undermine the basic thesis [of decoupling],” says climate activist Bill McKibben, who recently wrote in The Nation that U.S. emissions of methane — “CO2’s nasty little brother” — have increased by more than 30 percent. In the article, McKibben pinpointed leakage from fracking as the likely cause.  This is a damaging failure of regulation, but at least it is fixable, at relatively low cost, according to studies by the United Nations Environment Programme. And while methane is a potent greenhouse gas, its lifetime in the atmosphere is roughly a decade, so we won’t be living with the consequences for nearly as long as those from CO2 emissions.  Even if global emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases can be curbed, however, this won’t fix climate change, say critics of the decoupling narrative. The big problem is that warming is driven not by annual emissions but by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And while methane may disappear relatively quickly, CO2 hangs around for centuries.  Last year, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time. According to the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, keeping global warming below two degrees probably requires keeping this figure below about 450 ppm. That means emitting in total no more than about 800 billion tons of CO2 from all sources — or less than 20 years worth at current rates. In practice, emissions have to be brought down to zero by mid-century. “Set against the small and rapidly dwindling carbon [emissions] budgets associated with the Paris Agreement… the tentative signs of decoupling are of little relevance,” says Anderson, of Manchester University, an avowed pessimist. “The concept of green growth is very misleading.” Others are more optimistic. Even if decoupling cannot limit warming to two degrees, it could deliver three or four degrees, after which the world might find ways to draw down CO2 from the atmosphere. But all agree the bottom line is that, as le Quere puts it, “we need to bring emissions down to zero. The faster we decrease the emissions, the less risk we take.” Decoupling is real, but it is just the start. "

"Sir Ed Davey has today added his voice to the ranks of energy and climate change experts warning ‘Brexit’ would undermine the UK’s energy security, its ability to combat climate change threats, and its burgeoning green economy. Writing on BusinessGreen today ahead of a roundtable event on the implications of Brexit for energy and climate policy this morning at MHP Communications, where Davey now holds a senior adviser role, the former energy and climate change secretary warned a vote for Brexit can “only be bad for Britain’s green businesses”.  “Perhaps a greener government than the current Conservative majority could offset the damage - but who’s to say a Brexit vote won’t unleash even stronger anti-green forces in the Tory Party and across the right of British politics?” he warned. “But you don’t have to take a party political position as I do. You only have to contemplate the years of uncertainty that would follow a Brexit vote. Energy investment thrives on political certainty because of the huge amounts of cash involved and because the financial returns come over a long period.” He added that if Britain does vote to leave on 23 June, green businesses “better have a good export strategy”. Drawing on his experience during his stint as energy and climate change secretary, Davey warned that giving up the UK’s involvement in Brussels’ negotiations would undermine both its energy security and its ability to help shape international climate policies. Specifically, he detailed how the UK helped lead the EU response to the energy security threat posed by Russia’s annexing of Crimea in 2014, pushing for a new energy security strategy which was subsequently adopted. “With energy security the ultimate in ‘soft power’ - a force for peace perhaps better than military spend - this experience shows we are more secure, at a lower cost, because we’re at the EU table,” Davey said. He also warned the UK’s role at ongoing international climate change talks would be compromised if it left the EU, arguing that it was the UK-backed Green Growth Group of ministers that helped push the bloc towards a more ambitious negotiating position ahead of the successful Paris Summit. “On climate change, it would frankly be environmental madness for the UK to leave the EU,” Davey warned. “It’s of course logically impossible for Britain to solve climate change alone - we only produce two percent or less of global greenhouse emissions: we have to work with other countries to achieve our own domestic goals on climate. By exercising influence at the EU, we can force others to do their share; and with the EU, we exercise much more influence on the global stage of the United Nations.” Davey’s analysis follows similar warnings from his successor as energy and climate change secretary, Amber Rudd, who last month warned Brexit would jeopardise much-needed new investment in energy infrastructure and push up bills for households and businesses. It also comes in the same week as a major new report from the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) revealed the green sector’s strong support for EU membership. The analysis, based on the committee’s extensive evidence sessions with ministers, EU officials, businesses, and NGOs over recent months, underlines the role the trading bloc has played in strengthening Britain’s domestic environmental legislation, spurring green business innovation and boosting the UK’s influence in international climate negotiations. The report also warned there remains “significant unanswered questions” over the fate of Britain’s environmental policies if it left the EU, with EAC chair and Labour MP Mary Creagh highlighting to BusinessGreen the risk of core green legislation being overturned by eurosceptics intent on deregulation. “Most politicians who support Britain’s exit would like to see a deregulatory agenda, and in areas like air and water and waste it opens the door for future governments to quietly drop beneficial legislation,” she said."
"The air pollution scandal that hit front pages around the world last year with VW’s admission it had been cheating emissions tests has got much bigger. A UK government-sponsored trial launched in the wake of the VW revelations has found that every single one of the diesel-fuelled vehicles tested had higher emissions of nitrogen oxide pollutants than permitted under EU laws. For some models emissions were 12 times the legal limit.  None of the 56 vehicles tested in Germany and 37 in the UK was found to have a defeat device aimed at artificially lowering its emissions under test conditions, such as those used by VW. But all were found to exceed the EU-set standards on air quality and pollution when driven in real-world situations. Clearly there are important questions for manufacturers. So what is happening? Crucially, the higher emissions were found to be the result of engine management systems that are routinely used by manufacturers to improve the performance of their vehicles. One by-product is more polluting emissions. Environmentalists say the result is not unexpected. “This confirms what experts have been saying for years: deadly emissions are far higher in the real world than in controlled tests in the lab,” said Oliver Hayes of Friends of the Earth. “Governments say they are championing ‘real driving emissions’ but this is a smokescreen. These standards are far weaker than those that currently exist.” This points to the inadequacy of current testing regimes, but it also reveals a much more alarming truth: that manufacturers are tuning their vehicles’ engines in a way that hurts all of us. Engine management systems have become standard across the industry, and these new tests make it clear that they are there for one purpose: to improve the performance of the car, even if that comes at the expense of those breathing in the air from their exhausts. Diesel engines produce much higher levels of air pollutants than petrol-driven engines, although they produce less carbon dioxide. This has led EU member states to encourage drivers into diesel cars, reducing the impact of driving on climate change but vastly increasing the problem of air pollution. The UK is one of the few EU countries that tax diesel at the same rate as petrol, as most countries skew their taxation levels to favour diesel (although tax parity still favours diesels because they do more miles per gallon).  It is ironic that the push for lower carbon dioxide emissions to combat climate change has led to higher air pollution. And the European commission has been slow to get to grips with the problem. A major announcement on air pollution in late 2013 failed to even mention diesel cars.  But the problem is now pressing, as new research is revealing the extent of the damage being done routinely to our health, particularly the majority of the world’s population who live in cities. About 7% of deaths are caused or contributed to by air pollution, according to the World Health Organisation, and the effects on people’s quality of life is even greater. Long a silent killer, air pollution is now being recognised for its devastating effects, particularly on small children and older people. The question those breathing the pollution will be asking is whether governments are prepared to act."
"Britain has shown great diplomatic leadership on climate change and successive governments have had a major influence on action to decarbonise the world’s economy. We believe that the UK’s standing as an international climate leader could recede within months if we were to leave the EU. Membership of the EU has enabled the UK to punch above its weight. It has given us a platform to influence not only the climate commitments of our European neighbours, but also those of the US and China. In the last European parliament, all countries agreed to follow the carbon reduction trajectory set by the UK for the next 15 years.  It was a British diplomat who led the European negotiating bloc at the UN climate conference in Paris last year, persuading the EU to champion a long-term goal and a commitment to raise the world’s ambition on carbon emissions reduction every five years. This was agreed by all 194 countries in the final Paris agreement. The UK could not have exerted this influence acting alone. Brexit would damage our national interest by reducing our diplomatic leverage. Never again would a British official be able to play such a pivotal role in climate negotiations. Never again would we be in a position to persuade 27 other European nations to follow our lead. As last winter’s floods have demonstrated, climate change is a real and present threat to the UK. Our experience of the past 20 years leads us to conclude that we are stronger, safer and greener in the European Union.Craig Bennett Executive director, Friends of the EarthTom Burke Chairman, E3GAmy Cameron Director, 10:10John Gummer Chair, Committee on Climate ChangeChris Huhne Former secretary of state for energy and climate changeMichael Jacobs Visiting professor, Grantham Research Institute, LSEJohn Sauven Executive director, Greenpeace UKMatthew Spencer Director, Green AllianceJames Thornton Chief executive, ClientEarthCrispin Tickell Former British ambassador to the United NationsAdair Turner Former chair of the Committee on Climate Change• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"

"A previous Jonny & the Baptists show set out to Stop Ukip – a noble aim, if a soft target comedically. That can’t be said of their new subject, climate change: Armageddon seldom reduces audiences to stitches. Happy to report, then, that The End Is Nigh is the musical comedy duo’s most satisfying offering yet. Its songs are linked, for the first time, by a narrative, as Jonny Donahoe and Paddy Gervers relate what happened when the former recklessly promised his four-year-old niece that he’d save the world. It’s as broad, daft and punchy as all of their work, but here a lightly worn moral seriousness brings ballast to the gags and gigglesome wordplay. That’s a welcome development, given that, hitherto, the duo’s self-mockery has tended to draw their political sting. Of course there are jokes here about the impotence of “two comedians from Reading” in the face of the climate apocalypse. But there’s something stirring in their refusal to submit to it. And I was oddly moved by their climactic rallying call, which proposes that acts of resistance, however childish, to the status quo are worth more than any grownup justification for inaction: “We’ll all stay alive / If we act like we’re five.”   There are hiccups along the way: a somewhat sour song about ugly babies; an obvious gag conflating Donahoe’s memories of two TV series from his youth. More often, I found myself enjoying the show’s detouring but fluid transitions between song and story, as the pair experiment with foraging, pee in the shower and heckle a former minister for climate change about his use of private jets. The Rt Hon offender shrugs them off; those in charge, says Donahoe, “don’t give a damn”. For those who do, here’s a spirited comedy show that never soft-soaps the grim outlook, but insists that fatalism and scepticism aren’t the only options available."
"The Environment Agency’s (EA) advice service, which helped councils and businesses prepare for flooding and other climate change impacts, has closed. Climate Ready shut in March, just before the Easter break, and no replacement service appears to be planned.  The service helped many small businesses that had been flooded last winter. Climate Ready also supported the Local Government Association’s (LGA) Climate Local programme which supported and encouraged local authorities to make a formal commitment to take action on climate change and to report on their progress. Since its launch in 2012, 96 English councils have signed up. It was coordinated by an EA employee, seconded to the LGA, but this person has now returned to the EA. Mike Peverill, director of the NGO Climate UK which worked with the EA on Climate Local, said it was very disappointed to see the service come to an end. “These voluntary commitments and support programmes have been a really important mechanism over the last decade for enlightened local authorities to demonstrate public community leadership,” he said. The EA told ENDS that Climate Ready was designed to deliver objectives in the National Adaptation Programme and was supposed to last for three years, but had been extended for a further year until March 2016. An EA spokesperson said: “The Environment Agency remains committed to the need to adapt to a changing climate and will continue to drive resilience and action. Climate Ready was always designed as a time limited programme to enable organisations to understand their climate risk and take action to reduce it.” Defra said it would continue to ensure that it had the best possible plans in place for flood prevention and protection across the whole country. “The first National Adaptation Programme sets out more than 370 actions to help the UK better prepare for climate change - we continue to deliver on these actions and make sure adaptation is integrated across government policy making,” it said. The service cost approximately £6m over four years. The EA said that no jobs would be lost as a result of the closure. The EA has also had to shoulder cuts to vital flood defence research."
"If betting really is a mug’s game, then betting against global warming is starting to look like an activity for the grandest of mugs. A game for the sort of mug who could, right now, be looking forward to receipt of a squidrillion dollars in return for handing over their bank details to someone they just met over email.   Earlier this week, it turned out one of America’s most prominent and active deniers of the dangers of climate change was no mug when it came to putting some money on the table. Marc Morano, of the conservative think tank the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), had turned down two bets on global warming worth $20,000. The bets were an offering from TV science pundit and commentator Bill Nye, whose name is rarely written without his rhyming epithet “the science guy”. Nye offered to bet Morano that the current year, 2016, would be among the ten hottest ever recorded using conventional observations. The second was that the current decade would be the warmest on record.  Morano said the bets were “silly” and that it was “obvious” he would lose.  In an email to me, Morano further said the hottest year on record, 2015, was “barely a tenth of a degree” above the previous record (which happens to have been 2014). He also suggested that official figures from US government agencies had been “adjusted”.  Morano is busy promoting a new “sceptical” film called Climate Hustle, which he “premiered” in Paris while global climate talks were taking place across the city.  Morano’s CFACT is part of the network of conservative think tanks in the U.S that work to manufacture doubt and scorn over the science of human-caused climate change. On a panel on Capitol Hill this week, Morano will show parts of his interview with Nye and hold a panel discussion with other “sceptics”, including former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin who once said “climate change is to this century what Eugenics was to the last century.” But anyway, back to that mug’s game of betting against global warming. Back in October, a research paper was published in the Royal Society’s 350-year-old journal, Philosophical Transactions A, that looked at the prospects of bets on global warming.  In the paper, Australian climate scientist Dr James Risbey, of the CSIRO, and colleagues looked back at global temperatures from the late 19th century to present day.  They wanted to find out what would have happened to bets made each year that the next 15 years would be warmer than the previous 15 years. They found that from about 1970 onwards, the person betting on the world getting warmer would have won.  As the paper noted: The fact that so few bets have actually been taken against greenhouse warming implies that the level of actual resistance to greenhouse theory by climate contrarians is not as strong as claimed.  The analysis of betting strategies here shows that contrarians are rational insofar as they are not betting against greenhouse warming…. Bets against greenhouse warming are largely hopeless now and that is widely understood.  In January this year, British climate science sceptic/denier/contrarian Sir Alan Rudge admitted he’d been a “mug” for betting Cambridge University’s Dr Chris Hope £1000 that 2015 would be at least 0.1C cooler than 2008.  So what about the bets offered by Nye to Marc Morano?  Risbey explained that bets on single years were more open to chance, because of the natural short-term variations in the climate system.  But in the same way that climate change is best measured using longer-term records, the same goes for a bet.  Risbey says as you get out to a decade or longer, the warming driven by the added greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will generally overwhelm any natural changes.  That means a bet that the next decade is warmer than the previous decade is a pretty likely bet, and that is because of the role of greenhouse forcing of climate. That doesn’t mean that it can’t happen, but it is much less likely to happen in the current greenhouse era.  Morano was wise to reject the decadal bet as he would be pretty likely to lose in betting against it. Risbey’s paper mainly covered bets of 15-year periods, rather than just ten. So what about bets over a decade? Is it still a mug’s game? Professor Stephan Lewandowsky, of the University of Bristol, and a co-author on the paper, has re-run the data to show how safe bets like Nye’s really are. The chart below shows the outcome of bets placed each year from 1860 onwards that the 10-year period at the time of the bet would be warmer than the previous one. Red dots show betting on warming wins, empty circles show bets too close to call. Blues lose. So anytime from about 1970 onwards, if you had placed a bet against the world warming in the following decade, then you’d have lost your cash. Lewandowsky concludes: Bets are far from a triviality or merely a form of entertainment over a pint in the pub. On the contrary, bets have been used for centuries to reveal people’s actual preferences in arenas such as economics or cognitive science. Anyone unwilling to take a financial risk on their position probably does not hold that position very strongly. It is therefore quite notable that people who deny the science of climate change are unwilling to back their position with money. The widespread reluctance to engage in bets by people who deny climate science suggests that their public rhetoric differs from their actual knowledge, and that they know full well that any such bet would be hopeless.  See. I said Marc Morano was no mug."
"The harbour at Stonehaven, on Scotland’s east coast, is normally tranquil but, at 7.30pm on 1 July 2015, the sea did something strange. “The water suddenly started to rush out for about five minutes, dropping by about 1.25 metres, then after a couple of minutes returned with some force,” reported the harbourmaster. This tsunami-like event damaged boats and resulted in a serious head injury to one crewman. Analysis suggests that this mini-tsunami was brought on by the thundery weather. At the Met Office, Andrew Sibley and his colleagues have analysed weather observations and radar images. Their results show a sharp spike in air pressure racing along in front of the thunderstorms. It seems the upwards convection associated with the storm, was balanced by powerful downdrafts in front of the storm system. This high pressure spike was enough to push the level of the North Sea down as much as 5cm and, with resonance in relatively shallow water, set up a tsunami-like wave. Tidal gauges along the east coast of Scotland confirm the existence of this wave, which probably wasn’t a freak event. “They seem to occur as frequently as every three to ten years around the UK, and are relatively common globally too,” says Sibley, whose findings are published in the journal Weather. Indeed a similar event was seen in the Channel in June 2011. Greater understanding of these meteotsunamis should enable meteorologists to forecast them in future, giving people more time to get out of harm’s way."

"Greens senators have labelled the CSIRO chief executive’s performance before a Senate committee as “evasive”, claiming he has not adequately explained why the agency cut the jobs of climate scientists. The CSIRO chief executive, Dr Larry Marshall, told a senate committee hearing he would handle the restructure announcement differently, but attributed stress to staff to “misreporting” that 350 job cuts would all be to climate scientists.  Marshall said the 100 job cuts in the oceans and atmosphere division announced in February was an “upper limit” but the agency was trying to minimise cuts. The chief financial officer, Hazel Bennett, said of the current planned cuts only 75 pertain to climate scientists. Marshall said cuts were made to the oceans and atmosphere division to achieve a strategic shift to mitigation and adaptation to the effects of climate change and because the agency was “not in a financial position to make up a shortfall in external funding”. He said the cuts were not made due to any formal or informal instruction from the government but were “made by CSIRO executive team with input by the leadership teams and endorsed by our board”. Bennett said the board had been advised of the restructure before Christmas, in January, and finally on 2 February, just two days before cuts were confirmed. She said consultation with stakeholders was limited because the CSIRO did not want to pre-empt its notification to staff on 4 February. Marshall was questioned on conversations with the innovation and science minister, and a meeting with then-communications minister Malcolm Turnbull over a salmon meal in early 2015. He refused to detail the content of the conversations.  Marshall said there was no direction to institute climate program cuts, but the CSIRO was guided by the ministerial statement of expectations  for the agency, as it is required to do. After the committee hearing, the Greens senator, Peter Whish-Wilson, said “normally when an organisation goes through a significant restructuring there would be an open process, a transparent process and a full consultation with staff and stakeholders. It’s been secretive, there’s been no transparency and it’s blown up.” Another Greens senator, Janet Rice, said “there’s so much we still don’t know, there is a whole period of time when decisions were made between mid-December and mid-January, and no email documentation for it”. “Larry Marshall was completely evasive about who he consulted in that period of time. So we need to get to the bottom of this.” Whish-Wilson said “we cannot as a committee get a decent answer about who instigated this, and why, and what evidence it was based on. So far we’ve only got spin.” After the hearing, shadow research, industry and innovation minister Kim Carr said “I’m disgusted ... I’ve never seen anything like it”.  “There’s no doubt in my mind this new management of the CSIRO is responding to government priorities. They’ve taken it far too literally they need to find money from other sources. “One of the biggest consequences of $140m budget cuts to CSIRO was that there were job losses. “It’s time we looked at not just the structure of the CSIRO but the way decisions are made, whether they are consistent with the objects of the Act and whether or not they’re meeting Australia’s national interest in terms of the future direction of the CSIRO,” Carr said. Marshall refuted claims CSIRO was moving away from public good scientific research, labelling it disturbing and untrue.  “Our people believe what they do is for the benefit of the Australian public – and that’s true whether research is purely government funded, is helping industry be more productive or helping national priorities.”"
"More than 1,000 species have had to be relocated because of climate change, poaching and humans taking their habitat, according to a top conservationist. Dr Axel Moehrenschlager said cases of “translocation”, such as India’s plan to relocate tigers to Cambodia or South Africa’s scheme to airlift rhinos to Australia, have increased exponentially in recent decades and will become more common due to human pressures driving species closer to extinction.  Translocation is the practice of intentionally moving plants and animals from one area and releasing them in another to improve their survival chances and combat biodiversity loss.    It is usually considered a “last resort” method, but conservationists warn that intensive and sometimes controversial forms of intervention may now be needed.  “Species are under increasing threat around the world, but the science is maturing about how to bring them back,” said Moehrenschlager, director of conservation and science at the Calgary zoo and chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reintroduction specialist group.  “This is not a new tool - it’s gone on for more than 100 years - but it’s definitely escalating in terms of frequency and geographical spread, not just for an individual species but for entire ecosystems.” Traditional conservation has focused on maintaining species in protected areas, but Moehrenschlager said this approach would no longer be relevant as temperatures rise and species are unable to exist in their native range. “The impact that people have on the planet is ever-increasing,” he said. “The times when we could simply hope that we could set areas aside for species are increasingly disappearing. We are in a situation of emerging threats due to climate change that we need to more actively manage species otherwise we will lose them.” The most recent assessment from the UN’s climate change body warned in 2014 that global warming was causing “widespread and consequential” harm to animals and plants, many of which had moved their range, changed numbers or shifted their seasonal activities as a result of warmer temperatures. In 2013, an IUCN report found that 6-9% of endangered bird species, 11-15% of amphibians and 6-9% of corals were considered highly vulnerable to climate change and would be threatened with a greater risk of extinction if current climate trends continued. Moehrenschlager, who will deliver a lecture on the topic on Wednesday night at the St Andrews prize for the environment ceremony in Scotland, reached the figure of an estimated 1,300 translocations from his work on two papers due to be published this month and case studies from the IUCN. The German-born scientist has worked for 25 years in conservation and is based at Calgary zoo, one of the world’s leading zoos for conservation research. His work on swift foxes, once Canada’s most endangered carnivore, was so successful that its conservation status was “downgraded” in 2012 from endangered to threatened - a rare occurrence. Moehrenschlager said it was impossible to pinpoint which the 1,000th species would have been as so many projects were ongoing, but that the first known translocation would have been attempts to reintroduce the bison to the US in the early 1900s. Translocation is considered controversial by some scientists because of the risk that relocated species could overpopulate a new area and cause local organisms to become extinct. The obvious benefit is saving a species from extinction, but this must be balanced against any risks, Moehrenschlager said. Animals or plants could die or suffer excessive stress during relocation, and the impact of animals within an ecosystem receiving the new species must also be considered. There are also socioeconomic implications, if a relocated species were to cause damage to land or pose a threat to humans. “To me this is not controversial as long as the correct process is followed. Success is not guaranteed, but the alternative of not acting is guaranteed - and that is extinction. We have to remember the reason this is done is primarily because one is trying to avoid extinction, but also because one isn’t able to restore species within their indigenous range because the threats in those zones are so pervasive and can’t be avoided.” The IUCN released 2013 guidelines on conservation translocations, which Moehrenschlager helped to draft. At the moment, there is no formal worldwide regulation or enforcement. “We encourage a very close planning process that looks at the goals, with evaluation of potential benefits and risks,” he said.  The process can mean reinforcing and reintroducing a species within its range - the area it is traditionally found - for example, grey wolves in Yellowstone national park in the US - or introducing a species outside its native range to boost numbers or replace a function in an ecosystem that has been lost through extinction.  Perhaps an underestimated benefit of the method was hope, he said. “In the space where nature is under increasing threat, restoration of species through conservation translocation can motivate us that the recovery of species is possible and that conservation truly can work.” Californian condor – in 1982 only 23 birds survived. In 1987 all wild condors were placed in captive breeding programmes. Since 1992, when they were re-released into the wild, the population has grown to 410 birds. Groups of golden lion tamarins in Brazil were moved from small threatened forests to larger uninhabited and protected forests as logging, agriculture and industry encroached on their habitat.  The Arabian oryx became extinct in the wild in 1972. Reintroductions from captive breeding herds have taken place in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, and its conservation status has been upgraded to “endangered”. The Vancouver Island marmot is endemic to one island in Canada. In 2004 it was down to less than 40 individuals in the wild. There was a real risk of extinction in the wild by 2010 - the same year that it was the symbol of the Winter Olympics. Now numbers have reached 350. Swift foxes had been lost from Canada since 1938 due to habitat loss and hunting but were reintroduced in 1983. Their conservation status is now of “least concern”. Short-haired bumblebee - Declared extinct in the UK in 2000 as wildflower-rich grassland was lost to intensively farmed land. After a failed attempt to reintroduce bees from New Zealand, queens from Sweden nested and bred successfully in 2013. European mink were taken to two Estonian islands free from the threat of their predatory competitor, the American mink. Corals in India that had become locally extinct due to reef degradations were reintroduced to the Gulf of Kutch and grown on artificial reefs. Known as assisted colonisation.  The Aldabra giant tortoise was introduced to one of the Mauritian islands, which replaced the grazing and seed-dispersal roles of the original tortoises that had become extinct. This is known as ecological replacement translocation. "

"The US and China are leading a push to bring the Paris climate accord into force much faster than even the most optimistic projections – aided by a typographical glitch in the text of the agreement. More than 150 governments, including 40 heads of state, are expected at a symbolic signing ceremony for the agreement at the United Nations on 22 April, which is Earth Day. It’s the largest one-day signing of any international agreement, according to the UN. But leaders will really be looking to see which countries go beyond mere ceremony and legally join the agreement, which would bind them to the promises made in Paris last December to keep warming below the agreed target of 2C. So far, the US, China, Canada and a host of other countries have promised to join this year - boosting the hopes of bringing the Paris deal into force before the initial target date of 2020 – possibly as early as 2016 or 2017, according to officials and analysts. That is well before the timeline originally envisaged at Paris. Environment ministers attending the World Bank spring meetings this week said the faster pace indicated serious commitment to dealing with the global challenge. The accelerated timeline would have one obvious advantage for Barack Obama. The standard withdrawal clause on any such agreement would force a future Republican president to wait four years before quitting Paris, according to legal experts. An earlier start date could also turbo-charge the agreement, providing momentum for deeper emissions cuts.  It could also help efforts to attain the more ambitious goal of limiting warming to 1.5C – which would give a better chance of survival to small islands and other countries on the frontlines of climate change. Christiana Figueres, who heads the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, has said global emissions need to peak by 2020 to have any chance of limiting warming to 1.5C. There has already been about 1C warming above pre-industrial levels. “Early entry into force – we are very committed to making that happen,” Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment and climate change minister, told a panel at the World Bank last week. “We can’t just now rest on our laurels and have a nice signing on Earth Day, and then we all go home.” She told The Guardian Canada was committed to signing the agreement this year. The push to bring the climate agreement into force quickly is in sharp contrast to the earlier international efforts to fight climate change through the Kyoto Protocol, which did not take effect for four years.  Eliza Northrop, an analyst at the World Resources Institute, said there was growing momentum behind an early approval of the agreement. “It’s likely it could come into effect in 2017. It could even happen this year,” she said.  Governments at the Paris climate meeting had initially set the start date of the agreement in 2020 – with intense discussion over whether that start date should be at the start or end of the year, according to diplomats.   The 2020 date remained in the negotiating drafts almost until the very end, the diplomats said. But unaccountably the final draft prepared by France left out the entire clause. By that point, after a few late-night negotiating sessions, a number of countries did not notice the omission.   The agreement, the first time all countries agreed to emissions cuts and other actions to fight climate change, aims to limit warming to below 2C and move towards a zero-carbon economy by the end of the century. But it’s a tall order. The agreement needs to be approved by 55 countries accounting for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions to come into force. The US and China committed to join the agreement this year – but that still leaves a gap of more than 15% of global emissions. A number of countries, including India and Japan, require their parliaments to approve the Paris agreement – a process which could take time. The European Union will need agreement from its 28 member states before it can join the agreement – which makes it highly unlikely to be in a position to join early on. “The assumption is that you have to do this without the EU to get to that 55% hurdle, if you want to see that in the next year or so,” said Alden Meyer, strategy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. That will force governments to cobble together a coalition of smaller countries if they hope to reach the 55% emissions threshold. Possible contenders include India, Mexico, the Philippines and Australia.  So far, about 10 countries have said they would join the agreement this year.  On Wednesday, Román Macaya, Costa Rica’s ambassador to Washington, said his country would join the agreement in 2016. Palau, Switzerland, Fiji and the Marshall Islands have also said they will approve the agreement this year."

"Ministers have exempted thousands of scientists from a controversial “gagging clause” that would have prevented the academics from trying to influence government on public policy matters. The move follows intense pressure from the scientific community to amend proposals drawn up by the Cabinet Office to stop organisations, mostly charities, from using taxpayer-funded grants to lobby the government or parliament.  The ban, which comes into effect on 1 May, threatened to silence academics and exclude them from public debates as diverse as energy, climate change and transport policies. But speaking in the House of Lords on Tuesday, Lord Bridges of Headley, the parliamentary secretary for the Cabinet Office, announced exemptions for major government-backed funding bodies, including the research councils, the national academies and the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Martin Rees, the astronomer royal, welcomed the move but criticised ministers for taking so long to clarify the proposals after they were first made public in February. “This clarification is welcome but should have come sooner. It’s regrettable that it was preceded by months of confusion and ambiguity that generated needless anxiety, ill-feeling and time-wasting,” he said. Nearly 20,000 academics signed a petition calling for scientists to be exempt from the ban. Sarah Main, the director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering, said the announcement was good news and a “huge step” in the right direction. “Scientists felt embroiled in a debate about lobbying which did not appear to apply to them,” she said. “We now need to get the detail right to make sure this solution works for all of government and all of science.” But some in the community criticised the exemption for not going far enough. Imprecisely worded, it does not exclude scientists directly funded by government through departments such as health, business and defence. Mark Maslin, a climatologist at University College London, said the independence of a country’s scientific expertise was central to the freedoms demanded by a modern democracy. “If government or commerce, whether inadvertent or knowingly, put people at risk then scientists must be free to sound the warning bells without the risk of censure or legal proceedings. By rights the government should be granting a full exemption to all scientists sending a clear message that scientific knowledge is above petty party politics and is there for the betterment of all citizens,” he said. “What we have is a mess with an imprecise exemption which does not ensure that all scientists can criticise the government with impunity.”"

"The oil industry’s knowledge of dangerous climate change stretches back to the 1960s, with unearthed documents showing that it was warned of “serious worldwide environmental changes” more than 45 years ago. The Stanford Research Institute presented a report to the American Petroleum Institute (API) in 1968 that warned the release of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels could carry an array of harmful consequences for the planet.  The emergence of this stark advice follows a series of revelations that the fossil fuel industry was aware of climate change for decades, only to publicly deny its scientific basis. “Significant temperature changes are almost certain to occur by the year 2000 and these could bring about climatic change,” the 1968 Stanford report, found and republished by the Center for International Environmental Law, states. “If the Earth’s temperature increases significantly, a number of events might be expected to occur including the melting of the Antarctic ice cap, a rise in sea levels, warming of the oceans and an increase in photosynthesis. “It is clear that we are unsure as to what our long-lived pollutants are doing to our environment; however, there seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe.” The study, written by scientists Elmer Robinson and RC Robbins, adds that accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere could cause “serious worldwide environmental changes”. The scientists estimated that CO2 in the atmosphere could reach 400 parts per million by 2000. In fact, CO2 levels broke that milestone last year, recording their largest leap on record.  This huge increase in CO2, the primary driver of the greenhouse effect, has helped global temperatures rise by 1C over the past century. It is estimated that about three-quarters of the world’s known fossil fuel reserves, including oil, coal and gas, will have to remain unburned if civilisation is to avoid the worst ravages of climate change, such as droughts, floods, food insecurity and inundation from rising seas. API, the peak body for the oil industry in the US, knew about the dangers of climate change at least 20 years before the issue was brought into mainstream public discourse via the former Nasa scientist James Hansen. Former US president Lyndon Johnson also received an early warning about climate change, with scientists explaining the mechanism of the greenhouse effect in 1965. Last year, it was revealed that ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company, knew of climate change as early as 1981, only to spend millions of dollars over the following 27 years to promote climate denial. The exposure of this prior knowledge has been led by Inside Climate News.  Exxon had a dedicated in-house team that established the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, but the company still spent years refusing to acknowledge the issue and funding climate denial activities. Exxon now insists it accepts climate science and doesn’t promote denial of the changes to the planet already under way.  The Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) said hundreds of documents show oil and gas executives met in 1946 to agree that they should fund research into air pollution issues. The subsequent findings were then covered up to protect company profits, according to the environmental law group.  Carroll Muffett, president of CIEL, said the latest documents from 1968 “add to the growing body of evidence that the oil industry worked to actively undermine public confidence in climate science and in the need for climate action even as its own knowledge of climate risks was growing.  “These documents are the tip of an evidentiary iceberg that demands further investigation,” Muffett said. “Oil companies had an early opportunity to acknowledge climate science and climate risks, and to enable consumers to make informed choices. They chose a different path. The public deserves to know why.” The prominent climate scientist Michael Mann, of Pennsylvania State University, said it was “disgraceful that industry groups like API knowingly hid the dangers of their project decades ago when they first learned of them, much as the tobacco industry hid the dangers of their product”.  API was contacted for comment on the documents."

"As the fossil fuel industry appears increasingly shaky, the cost to the federal budget of stopping all new coal and gas projects in Australia has plummeted – costing less than 20% of what it was estimated to just 2.5 years ago, according to official parliamentary costings seen by Guardian Australia. The Greens have a policy of approving no new thermal coal or unconventional gas projects in Australia. That includes new mines, as well as expansions to existing mines.  In 2013 the party obtained costings from the parliamentary budget office detailing their estimate of how much revenue the federal budget would lose as a result of reduced tax and any other costs, if the policy was implemented. It was then estimated the policy would result in the government missing out on $1.5bn over the forward estimates – the four years to July 2017. The Greens asked for the same advice again this year and that figure dropped dramatically to just $290m over the forward estimates – the four years to July 2019. With coal and gas prices dropping around the world, the number of new fossil fuel projects expected to be developed is now fewer than it was in 2013. In addition, the profits those companies would make – and the tax the government would therefore miss out on if they were banned – has reduced over the period. The costings fit with several other developments in recent months. Of the $1.2bn wiped from the tax revenue the government would expect to get from new coal and gas projects, just $70m was a result of the minerals resource rent tax being scrapped. The vast majority was due to fewer and less profitable projects. At the time of writing, the latest report used by the Parliamentary Budget Office to examine the number of future coal and gas projects was not available. But comparing the report used in the 2013 costing and the most recently available report (from October 2015) reveals a sharp decline in proposed coal and gas projects. In April 2013, there were 19 coal mines that had been publicly announced – a number that had dropped to just 10 by October 2015. Similarly, publicly announced liquefied natural gas, gas and oil projects had dropped from 12 to three over the period. Coal projects that had reached “feasibility stage” – where more detailed planning work had been done – dropped from 57 to 39 over the period while those at the “committed” stage dropped from 16 to six. The Greens senator and environment spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, said the figures show their policy was sensible. “As the world transitions to clean energy, the taxes collected by the federal government from the fossil fuel sector are rapidly diminishing,” she told Guardian Australia. “We have everything to gain from embracing the job-rich clean energy industry and ending approvals of new coal or gas mines. “Ultimately, the fossil fuel sector is a burden on our federal budget due to the subsidies it receives and the economic costs it adds through global warming and destruction of land and water.” Waters said it also showed that, regardless of any policies that hasten the decline of the industry, the government needed a plan to create new jobs for those in the industry. “The thousands of Australian workers the fossil fuel industry is sacking as it declines must not be left in the lurch.” She said those jobs should come from the work needed to rehabilitate mine sites and in the new clean energy industry. The executive director of coal at the Minerals Council of Australia, Greg Evans, said the coal industry had contributed more than $37bn in both company tax and royalty payments between 2007-08 and 2013-14. “It is an enduring industry and confining any analysis to just the forward estimates period misses the mark about the positive long-term demand outlook,” he said.  “The industry makes a substantial economic contribution and will continue to do so underpinning both base load energy provision in Australia and providing competitive and high-quality coal for Asia’s energy and steel making requirements.”"
"A new study published in Climate Dynamics has found that humans are responsible for virtually all of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century. It’s not a novel result – in fact, most global warming attribution studies have arrived at the same general result – but this study uses a new approach.  Studies attempting to figure out the global warming contributions of various human and natural sources usually use a statistical approach known as ‘linear regression’. This approach assumes we know the pattern of warming that each source (forcing) will cause, but we don’t know how big the resulting warming will be. For example, we know that greenhouse gases cause more warming over land than water, the most in the Arctic, and more warming in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.  As an example of this approach, this animated graphic shows what happens when a 2011 study by Foster & Rahmstorf removed the known natural influences from the observed global surface temperature record, leaving behind the human-caused global warming signal. We have an idea how much warming greenhouse gases will cause, but the range is fairly large (1.5 to 4.5°C in response to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide). So, the standard approach uses the known patterns from each forcing (greenhouse gases, other human pollutants, the sun, volcanoes, etc.), and without assuming the effectiveness of each, statistically determines how much each pattern has contributed to the observed temperature changes.  However, some papers have argued that we do have some knowledge about the effectiveness of each forcing, and should use that information in these statistical studies. Conversely, the patterns of some forcings, like human aerosol pollution, are also uncertain and complicate this approach. As the authors describe it, this new study “basically proposes a symmetric treatment of the magnitude and the pattern of the response to each forcing.” Their statistical model assumes that the temperature influence from several individual forcings will add up to the total temperature influence from all the forcings. They then run various tests to check consistency between the observed warming and the Earth’s natural temperature variability, the expected temperature response from all the forcings, or the expected response from subsets of forcings. The study considered temperature changes for the period of 1951–2010. During that time, global surface temperatures warmed about 0.65°C. During that same period, their statistical approach which combines observations and climate models outputs found that humans have caused 0.67 ± 0.12°C warming, while natural factors have had essentially no effect on global temperatures (-0.01 ± 0.02°C). This result is similar to the conclusion in the latest IPCC report: It is extremely likely [95 percent confidence] more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together … The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period ...  The contribution from natural forcings is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C, and from internal variability is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C. It’s also consistent with numerous previous global warming attribution studies, including those using the aforementioned statistical linear regression approach. Lead author Aurélien Ribes told me: The main outcome of this study is to develop a new method that deals with uncertainty in a more comprehensive way. By using this new method, we hope to further narrow the uncertainty in past and future greenhouse gas-induced warming in the near future. In other words, this new paper adds to the mountain of evidence pointing to humans as the dominant cause of global warming since 1950, using a new statistical approach to answer the question. Disentangling how much warming human carbon pollution has caused from the amount of cooling caused by human aerosol pollution remains a challenging task, but rapid global warming is the net result of human activities. This mountain of scientific and statistical evidence is the reason why there is a 90–100% consensus among climate science experts that humans are responsible for global warming. It’s what scientists call a “knowledge-based consensus”, as described in the video below."

"The recent El Niño has been in the news of late because the warm waters in the Pacific have helped lift Earth’s temperatures to new records. Recent research is helping to track energy flows between the ocean waters and the atmosphere as the El Niño builds, then slowly decays and even changes to a La Niña. This new information is an important advancement of our understanding of the Earth’s climate. As a background, a part of the Pacific Ocean flips between cold (La Niña) and warm (El Niño) phases over a few-year-long period. Sometimes the oceans are in neither a cold or warm phase, and we call that neutral.  The flipping back and forth always occurs, but the duration and regularity can change. In general, the cycles occur over 3 to 7 years, sometimes with longer duration, other times shorter. But regardless, this El Niño/La Niña process is really important for the rest of the world. It affects the whole atmosphere through what are termed teleconnections.  Consider for instance a situation when the waters are warm (El Niño), resulting in more evaporation from the ocean waters into the atmosphere. Conversely when the ocean waters are cold, there is often less evaporation. Because evaporation requires a great deal of thermal energy – it cools the ocean while moistening the atmosphere – it’s an engine that moves heat.  Simply put, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO; the latter is in the atmosphere) cycle can supercharge this movement of energy, or it can temporarily sequester the heat. But regardless, once the energy gets into the atmosphere, it changes the atmospheric winds around the globe and affects weather elsewhere. So, a new study, led by Dr. Michael Mayer from the University of Vienna, focused on the energy flows during the ENSO process. The study recalls prior work that has led to a view of ENSO that is a bit like a rechargeable battery. During La Niña, heat builds up in the Pacific and then during El Niño, the heat is dissipated to other regions. The dissipation occurs in both laterally via atmospheric energy transports and vertically via radiation to space. When the warm water moistens the air (through evaporation), it invigorates storms and flow of energy in the atmosphere. As a result of these teleconnections, a substantial fraction of the heat released from the Pacific during El Niño subsequently appears in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.  The authors also looked at climate models, which are computerized representations of actual processes occurring in the real world. They wanted to know how well models reproduce the energy flows associated with ENSO. Traditionally, models have struggled to correctly simulate ENSO. The authors found that models tend to underestimate the ENSO processes in the upper 700 meters of the Pacific. While observations show substantial cooling of the tropical Pacific during El Niño as measured by ocean heat content, most models lack this typical signature.  This is related to biases in simulated low-level clouds, which in turn influence the amount of absorbed solar radiation. In addition, the authors found that models in general struggle to get the winds associated with ENSO correct, which hampers their ability to correctly simulate vertical redistribution of heat within the Pacific. Moreover, the models underestimate the strength of teleconnections to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.  While models continue to get better, their current errors have to be considered when using them, and further improvements are necessary. But practice makes perfect and studies like this advance their capabilities. Such improvements are essential if we are to better understand the intersection of El Niño and climate change, and where and how extreme weather events occur. I communicated with Dr. Mayer and he told me,  First, it is important to distinguish between the different oceans. The buildup and release of oceanic heat during La Niña and El Niño mainly occurs in the tropical Pacific. What is happening in the other basins during warm and cold ENSO events tends to be of opposite sign. This means that oceanic heat is released from the Pacific during El Niño while ocean heat content increases in the tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean at the same time. The opposite tends to be the case during La Niña. This “seesawing” of oceanic energy between the different ocean basins is a result of the atmospheric teleconnections we describe. Besides this energy exchange between the different ocean basins there is also considerable radiative heat loss to space during El Niño. In the paper we checked whether the CMIP models replicate these pathways of anomalous energy flows. We found that the models underestimate the ocean heat content variations in the Pacific associated with ENSO and they also underestimate the strength of teleconnections to the other basins as measured by ocean heat content variations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. One reason of the found deficiencies in modeled ENSO are biases in the climatological mean states of the models, which adversely affects simulated variability of energy flows. Getting ENSO correct is important not only because it impacts society. It is superimposed on a long-term human-caused climate change. As we warm the planet from our emission of heat trapping gases, the ENSO fluctuations occur on top of that warming. Potentially, this can make the next ENSO cycle even more disruptive and costly."
"Developing countries must raise more than $4tn (£2,456bn), or roughly the entire annual budget of the US, to implement their climate change pledges by 2030, according to new research. But much more money will have to be be found by the world’s poorest countries to hold global temperatures enough to avoid catastrophic climate change, say British and Australian researchers who have analysed the financial implications of the pledges made to the UN last December and the money so far offered by rich countries.  As 170 countries meet on Friday in New York to sign the Paris agreement and potentially set the world on a low-carbon development path from 2020, developing country negotiators called for a reality check, saying there was a vast financial gap between the world’s climate change ambition and the reality of funding the emissions reductions needed to avoid catastrophic warming.  To date, rich countries have only agreed to mobilise $100bn a year for developing countries to act on climate after 2020. They have also pledged $10.3bn to the Green Climate Fund, the UN-backed mechanism that will disburse money for climate change adaptation and mitigation. “Mobilising trillions of dollars of climate finance, not hundreds of billions, is the new business as usual,” said Seyni Nafo, chair of the African group of 54 countries. The new analysis, based on earlier work by Carbon Brief, shows that about $4.1tn will be needed to fund the emission cuts of the 70-odd countries that have so far identified how much it will cost them. These countries together emit only about 25% of total developing country emissions.  India has said it will need nearly $1tn to meet its pledge, but China and many other large developing countries have not published their estimates. This, say negotiators, suggests the real cost for poor countries to meet the obligations they signed up to in Paris will be far higher than $4.1tn. For years, developing countries have argued strongly that the financial burden of reducing emissions should fall largely on the rich, industrialised countries responsible for the bulk of historical climate change emissions. To reach agreement in Paris, developing countries softened their stance. But the question of who should pay for climate change still rankles deeply.  How the money will be found to cut developing country emissions is unclear. Nearly $500bn of the $4,000 billion needed has been explicitly requested by developing countries to come from international sources of finance, including public money, private investments and carbon markets. Developing countries have pledged to spend $81bn from their domestic budgets. “Ramping up finance is the most important aspect. It is clear that we are still far from where we need to be. Even the staggering new figures cited in this report may still fall short of where we need to be,” said Thoriq Ibrahim, minister of environment and energy for the Maldives and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, a UN grouping of 43 countries. “The Paris agreement was a resounding success for the multilateralism. But the ambition gap that remains is huge. Countries must now put their money where their mouth is and close the gap,” said Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, chair of the 43-strong least developed country group. According to the UN Environment Programme, the world is on a path for a potentially catastrophic 3-3.5C of warming.  “The $4tn is a wake-up call. [It] dwarfs the figures that the Paris agreement or the Green Climate Fund are talking about. We’ve been saying all along that $100bn is a floor, a target that has to be met by 2020 and scaled up massively thereafter – without using dodgy accounting tricks to make smaller amounts of real money look big”, said Brandon Wu, policy analyst at ActionAid. Alison Woodhead of Oxfam said: “If all of today’s public funding for climate adaptation were to be divided among the world’s 1.5 billion smallholder farmers in developing countries, they would get just over £2 a year to cope with climate change.” Mohamed Adow of Christian Aid said: “Governments are aware their current mitigation and finance pledges fall short of what is required. No one is pretending that climate change and finance is yet solved. The job is not over, in fact, it has just started.”"
"Leaving the EU would threaten the UK’s air and water quality, biodiversity and the countryside, a committee of MPs has warned.  The UK has benefited from an EU-wide environmental cleanup in the past four decades, and giving up membership would lead to a damaging policy vacuum and an end to influence over green regulations, the commons environmental audit select committee has said in a report. Britain was once “the dirty man of Europe”, pouring out toxic pollutants that caused acid rain, industrial pollution, poor air quality, contaminated land and sewage-filled beaches. After taking on EU membership, successive governments had to mend their ways in line with rules on the environment developed over decades. Mary Creagh, chair of the committee, said: “The UK has cleaned up its act: EU laws mean we bathe on cleaner beaches, drive more fuel-efficient cars and can hold the government to account on air pollution. The overwhelming evidence is that EU membership has improved the UK’s approach to the environment and ensured that the UK’s environment has been better protected.” George Eustice, the farming minister, who is part of the Vote Leave campaign, said in response to the report: “Our natural environment is rich in diversity, but is also complex. Imposing centralised policies through clunky EU directives has failed because these act as a straitjacket that stifles innovation in environmental management.  “The UK has also lost its voice and voting rights on many international wildlife conventions. If we vote [to] leave and take control, we will regain our seat at the table at these conventions. We would be able to innovate, to pilot ideas and to really deliver for our natural environment.” Separately, a group of former high-ranking environmental officials have warned that the UK’s influential position in international climate change negotiations would be at risk from a vote to leave. Membership of the EU has enabled the UK to punch above its weight. It has given us a platform to influence not only the climate commitments of our European neighbours, but also those of the US and China. In the last European parliament, all countries agreed to follow the carbon reduction trajectory set by the UK for the next 15 years,” they wrote in a letter to the Guardian. The letter was signed by Lord Turner, former CBI director-general and former chairman of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC); Lord Deben, chairman of the CCC and former environment secretary; Chris Huhne, former environment secretary; Sir Crispin Tickell, former ambassador to the UN; and the leaders of six environmental campaigning organisations. They noted that the UK had played a major role in the success of the climate change talks in Paris last year, which produced a new global agreement on greenhouse gas emissions that will be signed at a special ceremony at the UN later this week. Outside the EU, this “pivotal role” would be impossible, and this would “damage our national interest by reducing our diplomatic leverage”. Environmental issues were largely left out of the prime minister’s negotiations earlier this year in which he sought to reform aspects of the UK’s relationship with the EU. According to the environmental audit committee’s report, the government does not have contingency plans for what would happen to environmental regulations if the UK were to leave the EU. Some regulations would still have to be enforced if the UK were to be treated as a trading partner, similar to Norway or others. But it is not certain which rules those would be, and negotiations would likely be “tortuous”. In addition, the committee said that future UK governments would be unable to influence those rules, or any new regulations, because there would be no British seat at the negotiating table when they were drawn up. MPs also criticised ministers for moving too slowly on implementing some of the EU’s green regulations. Air pollution campaigners have taken the government to court for its failure to adhere to air quality standards. Businesses stood to benefit from a vote to remain, as the single set of environmental standards governing all companies trading in Europe meant a level playing field, said Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, which represents businesses supporting green actions. “[This] has reduced the cost and complexity of complying with different regulations in different member states,” he said. The Vote Leave campaign did not respond to requests for comment. The National Farmers’ Union said it would not campaign on the referendum, but that its stance was in favour of remaining in the EU. The organisation said the decision, announced by the farming body’s council on Monday evening, was made because the Electoral Commission required it to take a view. A previously published report commissioned by the NFU found that Brexit could cost many farmers in lost subsidies. The stance might be controversial for many in the farming community, as pro-Brexit views have been gaining ground. The NFU is not polling its members on the issue, saying such an operation would be too complicated, and that it was “not a political organisation”. The NFU lobbies the government on farming issues."
"Eighty-five sites on the London Underground are at high and rising risk of flooding, according to a report that says it is “only a matter of time” before serious flooding strikes. Most threatened are some of the capital’s busiest stations, including Waterloo, King’s Cross and London Bridge, and the report warns of potential dangers to passengers. “The rapid nature of flooding events often produces high safety consequences,” it reads. The report was funded after Hurricane Sandy swamped the metro in New York City in 2012. The London tube network is one of the busiest in the world, with more than 3.5m passenger journeys a day between 270 stations across the city. As well as the risk to passengers, closures and delays result in multimillion-pound losses for the tube and the wider economy. The report finds the risk of flooding is rising due to climate change, and its findings reflect wider concerns about the UK’s preparedness for the impacts of global warming. Other critical infrastructure including the M25, Immingham container port and major electricity grid sites have all come close to disaster from flooding in recent years, and in March professionals warned that the healthcare system was “unprepared for devastating effects of climate change”. Ian Uttley, a senior drainage engineer at London Underground (LU), said: “You can’t get an asset more vulnerable to flooding than a network of underground tunnels.” The unpublished flood risk review, produced by LU and obtained by the Guardian, says: “London has been fortunate to escape the worst of recent storm events in the UK, but it is only a matter of time before heavy rainfall seriously affects London and the underground network. The risk is generally expected to increase [as] climate change predictions are that storms will become more intense. There is some evidence to show that these have already increased in frequency.” Bob Ward, a member of the London Climate Change Partnership and policy director at the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics at the London School of Economics, said: “This is a shocking report that reveals the massive number of tube stations and sites at high risk of flooding. While it is good that LU is now aware of the scale of the risks, it is worrying that more has not been done to make the tube system more resilient to flooding. London has just been lucky that it has not been struck by a major flash flood recently.” Ward said the mayor of London’s climate change adaptation strategy, published in October 2011, highlighted that the underground was the most vulnerable to flooding of all the city’s transport networks, but he said little had been done to reduce the risk: “It is a shameful legacy from Boris Johnson’s time as mayor.” The LU report is its first on flood risk since 2001 and identifies 85 “high-risk” sites, of which 57 are stations and the rest are shafts and tunnel entrances. The stations in the top 10 of highest risk are spread across the city and include Finsbury Park, Notting Hill Gate, Seven Sisters, Colliers Wood, Stockwell and Marble Arch. Another 68 sites were identified as at “significant risk” by the report, including 23 stations.  The biggest risks are from flash flooding after heavy downpours and from burst water mains. Rainwater flooding regularly causes delays and at times in 2015 closed closed some lines, and in 2007 a train was left stranded. Ruptured water mains affect the tube an average of five times a year and in 2012 one incident sent 3m litres of water down a ventilation shaft between Mile End and Stratford, forcing the Central line to be closed for 26 hours at a cost of £4m. LU has requested £3m over the next three years to analyse the riskiest sites in greater detail and to begin to install protective measures. But if the risk is to be significantly reduced, much more funding will ultimately be needed, said Anthony Fernihough, LU’s head drainage engineer. “£3m is not going to scratch the surface of it,” he said. George McInulty, LU’s programme director for renewals, said: “We are investigating what more we can do to minimise any potential disruption flooding causes to our customers.” Transport for London, which oversees the LU’s budget, is understood to be receptive to the plan but approval will depend on the mayor of London elected in May, who will become the chair of TfL and will appoint its board. In November the government announced it was cutting £700m a year of TfL’s funding. “If the underground goes underwater we might finally see some real action on climate change from Westminster politicians,” said Guy Shrubsole, of Friends of the Earth. “Increasingly torrential rainfall of the sort experienced by people in the north of England this past winter poses a major danger to the tube. It’s clear that the government’s national flood resilience review must prepare the UK’s infrastructure for ever wetter weather, and take radical action to cut the pollution that’s changing our climate.” In 2014 the Guardian revealed that government money spent on preparing the UK for the impacts of global warming had almost halved and the number of staff working on the issue had been slashed from 38 to six."
"The global temperature in March has shattered a century-long record and by the greatest margin yet seen for any month. February was far above the long-term average globally, driven largely by climate change, and was described by scientists as a “shocker” and signalling “a kind of climate emergency”. But data released by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) shows that March was even hotter.  Compared with the 20th-century average, March was 1.07C hotter across the globe, according to the JMA figures, while February was 1.04C higher. The JMA measurements go back to 1891 and show that every one of the past 11 months has been the hottest ever recorded for that month.  Data released released later on Friday by Nasa confirmed last month was the hottest March on record, but the US agency’s data indicated February had seen the biggest margin. The Nasa data recorded March as 1.28C above the average from 1951-1980, while February was 1.34C higher. The World Meteorological Organisation, the UN body for climate and weather, said the March data had “smashed” previous records. JMA: Global temp records smashed (again) in March, 1.07°C above 20th C avg https://t.co/erhOM82T0X #climateaction pic.twitter.com/uR0GpMTd6Q Climate change is usually assessed over years and decades, but even scientists have been struck by the recent unprecedented temperatures. Furthermore, annual heat records have been also tumbling, with 2015 demolishing the record set in 2014 for the hottest year seen, in data stretching back to 1850. The UK Met Office expects 2016 to set a new record, meaning the global temperature record is set to have been broken for three years in a row. Prof Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University in the US, responded to the March data by saying: “Wow. I continue to be shocked by what we are seeing.” He said the world had now been hovering close to the threshold of “dangerous” warming for two months, something not seen before. “The [new data] is a reminder of how perilously close we now are to permanently crossing into dangerous territory,” Mann said. “It underscores the urgency of reducing global carbon emissions.” The Met Office, along with the US agencies Nasa and Noaa, keep the most-used global temperature records and will release their assessment of March temperatures later this month. But the JMA records have shown the same trends as these in the past. The UN climate summit in Paris in December confirmed 2C as the danger limit for global warming which should not be passed. But it also agreed agreed to “pursue efforts” to limit warming to 1.5C, a target now looking highly optimistic. A major El Niño weather event, the biggest since 1998, is boosting global temperatures. But scientists are agreed that global warming driven by humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions is the largest factor in the astonishing run of temperature records. “While the current spike in global temperatures is getting a boost from El Niño, most of this anomalous warmth is a result of the ongoing human-caused global warming trend,” said Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at Potsdam University in Germany. Prof Adam Scaife, at the UK Met Office, said the run of record temperatures was set to continue, but that records would be less likely in 2017 as the impact of El Niño waned.  “While the El Nino is now decaying, it’s impact on global temperature tends to peak a few months later due to a delayed effect on the rest of the world’s oceans. This means that there is a high risk of record global temperatures over the next few months,” Scaife said. “Global temperatures are expected to continue to rise in future decades due to climate change, but El Niño may well [end] later this year, reducing the chance of record temperatures in 2017.” The impact of the heat has been seen around the world and at the end of March scientists announced that the winter peak of the Arctic ice cap was the smallest ever recorded on records going back to 1979. Note: The first version of this story linked to Nasa’s data for land only, which shows March was 1.65C above the average from 1951-1980, while February was 1.71C higher. The current version links to data for land and ocean surface temperatures, a better global average."

"Australia faces significant economic disruption in 2030 to meet the Paris climate goals unless action is quickly taken, according to a new analysis. The analysis, for the Climate Institute, recommends implementing a carbon price and regulations to phase out coal-fired generators, and additional subsidies to encourage clean energy investment. It comes as both major parties are promising post-election reviews to determine the details of their policies in a bid to avoid the kind of bitter battle over power prices that paralysed recent climate policy debates. The analysis finds that whichever party wins government will need to impose some form of relatively low carbon price, as well as regulations and subsidies to force a change to clean electricity generation. A “modest” carbon price of about $17/tonne in 2020, rising to $40/tonne in 2030, would come close to meeting the Turnbull government’s target of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% of 2005 levels by 2030. However, it would do almost nothing to shift to clean electricity generation. There would need to be a huge disruption in the market and economic activity in 2030 to suddenly accelerate emission reductions enough to reach the Paris goal of zero net emissions by mid century. In order to reach that goal using a carbon price alone, the price would need to start at $70/tonne and rise to $100/tonne, which, the report concludes, is politically unlikely. If coal-fired generators were also phased out after a 45-year lifespan and some kind of subsidy offered – like the current renewable energy target to achieve 50% zero emissions generation by 2030 – then the necessary emission reductions could be achieved without a sudden economic shock. Adding energy efficiency policies to the mix would significantly lower the impact on power prices. Labor has promised an emissions trading scheme as part of the climate policy it will take to an election but will not announce the details. It is expected to hold a post-election inquiry into the electricity industry and the phase-out of coal-fired generators if it wins office. The Coalition will review its Direct Action climate policy next year and there is a widespread expectation in the business sector that it will have to tighten the baselines on its so-called safeguards mechanism in a way that could eventually turn it into a baseline and credit-style emissions trading scheme.  The report argues that these reviews are critical because if changes aren’t made now, it becomes almost impossible to reach net zero emissions by mid century – as is necessary to meet the global goal of keeping temperature rises within 2C. “The next 18 months are pivotal to our climate and energy future, whoever wins the election,” said the Climate Institute’s executive director, John Connor. “Our research shows that a policy package that actively supports both clean energy investment and the orderly replacement of our ageing coal-fired power stations can better manage a timely transition to a cleaner energy supply. “A baseline and credit, or emissions trading scheme alone, will not be strong or reliable enough to drive the change.” The report found retail power prices would gradually rise between 2020 and 2030 under the recommended scenarios but there is a high degree of uncertainty around the forecasts. The Climate Institute modelling was commissioned from Jacobs and was part-funded by a cross section of the electricity industry, including GE, AGL and Hydro Tasmania. The independent Climate Change Authority is undertaking similar modelling for the government."
