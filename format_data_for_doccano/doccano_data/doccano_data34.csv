"From lochs and lakes to rivers, ponds and canals, there is a diverse range of freshwater habitats in the UK, which is good news not just for biodiversity but also the economy, where they are collectively valued at £39.5 billion. Rivers in particular are highly biologically diverse environments, home to a wide variety of plants, invertebrates and fish. But linked together within a river catchment, they are prone to invasion by alien species that can spread quickly between these interconnected habitats. Invasive alien plant species are of one of the biggest concerns to river environments. These contribute to the loss of native plants and invertebrates, as well as altering soil chemistry and impeding river flow. It costs the UK government around £1.7 billion to control invasive alien species and an estimated £6m alone to control the well-known troublesome Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica). Read more: Invasive plants have a much bigger impact than we imagine  Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) is an alien plant from the Himalayas introduced to Britain in 1839 by Victorian botanists, and is a prominent and familiar sight along UK waterways. Growing to up to a colossal four metres tall, this annual plant is a serious competitor to native British plants. Himalayan balsam is listed on Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act in England and Wales which makes it an offence to plant or allow the species to grow in the wild. However, Himalayan balsam is so widespread it is increasingly challenging to tackle. Strategies for managing this species involve prevention (such as awareness campaigns and enforcing legislation to prohibit entry or spread), complete removal of the species (generally not feasible within river habitats due to their interconnected nature), and control (such pulling up individual Himalayan balsam plants prior to seeding). The most effective method of control so far, particularly for Japanese knotweed, is herbicide spraying. However, there are collateral risks to water quality and aquatic animals and plants from herbicide run-off when these plants are close to waterways. The classic signs of invasion by Himalayan balsam is a wall of vivid pink flowers and a sickly sweet smell along river banks. Most sites we have studied have been invaded for over ten years, but curiously often neighbour an almost completely green length of the same river bank. What is it about these uninvaded areas along a river that makes them immune to this alien species? If we can understand the conditions which promote or deter the pink wall, the information could be used to manage these Himalayan balsam populations. The local environment, as well as the native plant community, determines whether an invader can establish, and thereafter expand its population. Competition between plant species for resources such as space and light is brutal. It’s a battleground out there, and not all species can win. Common native plants, such as the stinging nettle, butterbur and canary reed grass, can be direct competitors of Himalayan balsam.  A study we conducted aimed to untangle the direct and indirect effects of the environment and competition on the abundance of Himalayan balsam along rivers. We surveyed sites along rivers across Scotland which varied in environmental conditions, such as the number of river flood events per year. These rivers also had areas along the bank that were heavily invaded by Himalayan balsam, close to an area which had more dominant native species and no invasion. Compared to native plants such as common reed grasses  that dominate lowland riverbanks, Himalayan balsam dislikes overly moist conditions. Instead this plant prefers drier, steeper riverbanks where it can compete more effectively with native plants. A river inundated by flood water is therefore not ideal habitat for this invader, but native dominant species accustomed to occasional waterlogging are less negatively affected. This knowledge provides us with vital information to manage Himalayan balsam indirectly, by manipulating conditions on riverbanks, such as making them less steep so that they retain more water, which Himalayan balsam dislikes. Unfortunately, river engineering practices often involve straightening and over deepening rivers. Combined with abstracting water for agriculture, this leads to drier riverbanks during the summer, which benefits Himalayan balsam. In contrast, the restoration of rivers often strives to create gently shelving riverbanks and a more sinuous channel. This means that water is retained, riverbanks are moister and native species are favoured at the expense of Himalayan balsam. In 2018 Britain experienced one of its hottest, driest summers. Changing climate is likely to provide conditions which enable invasive alien plants to thrive along rivers. Hence, managing species in light of their environmental preferences is so important. Our study showed that a large abundance of dominant native plant species are more able to resist invasion by Himalayan balsam. So there has never been a better time to embrace our native species, even a river bank favourite such as the humble stinging nettle."
"Without cooling, the supply of food, medicine and data would simply break down. We consume large amounts of energy and cause a great deal of pollution keeping things cool yet compared to electricity, transport or heat, cold has received very little attention in the energy debate; neither the UK, USA nor the EU yet has an explicit policy on cold.  Global demand is booming – and incremental efficiency improvements are unlikely to contain the resulting environmental damage. We need radically new technology. In rapidly developing nations investment in cooling is starting to boom as rising incomes, urbanisation and population growth boost demand. But the industry remains rudimentary and has enormous headroom to grow: in India, just 4% of fresh produce is transported in refrigerated vehicles currently compared to more than 90% in the UK; China has an estimated 66,000 refrigerated vehicles to serve a population of 1.3 billion, whereas France has 140,000 for 66 million. But these disparities seem unlikely to persist. India projects that it needs to spend more than US$15 billion on the cold chain over the next five years. For industrial use, cold must generally be maintained through a whole supply chain – think of how seafood can remain frozen from trawler to supermarket. We call this the cold chain. Cold chain growth is currently based on diesel-powered technologies that produce grossly disproportionate emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). The fridge you might find on a supermarket home delivery van consumes up to 20% of the vehicle’s diesel, but emits up to six times as much NOx and 29 times as much PM as the engine. It also uses HFC refrigerants harmful to the atmosphere. At the same time, however, vast amounts of cold are wasted, for example when liquid natural gas (LNG) is turned back into gas at import terminals. This cold could potentially be stored as liquid air or liquid nitrogen then recycled to reduce the cost and environmental impact of cooling in buildings and vehicles. This insight has stimulated new thinking aimed at creating business and environmental value from the efficient integration of cold into the wider energy system, now known as the “cold economy”. The cold economy crucially involves the recycling of waste cold and “wrong-time” energy such as excess wind power generated at night when demand is low to provide, through novel forms of energy storage, low-carbon, zero-emission cooling and power. Big changes in the energy market over the next decade will spur the adoption of tidal power, solar power, offshore wind and other novel technologies. This in turn will require far greater integration of different forms of energy generation and consumption – and it is increasingly clear this now means joining up not only heat, power and transport, but also cold. This is an important opportunity: with the right support, the cold economy could develop into a large industry that simultaneously reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality and replaces environmentally destructive refrigerants with benign alternatives – as well as generating thousands of new manufacturing jobs. The cold economy is the subject of a new policy commission entitled Doing Cold Smarter, launched by the University of Birmingham this month. It will assess not only how the growing demand for cooling can be met without causing environmental ruin, but also the potential benefits both in the UK and emerging markets.  What will we come up with? You’ll have to wait until the commission’s final report is published this autumn. But it should be full of thought provoking – even cool – ideas."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite all the talk about the need to transition over to green energies, Germany’s progress — in especially wind energy — has ground to a complete halt.
German news site iwr.de here reports that the expansion of wind energy in Germany has “come the a stop” as the government has scaled back subsidies and enacted stricter permitting laws.
“As in April 2019, only nine new wind turbines went into operation nationwide in May,” IWR reported. “The year 2019 threatens to be a disaster for the wind industry in Germany.”
The IWR reported further: “In the first five months of 2019, only around 60 new onshore wind turbines went into operation nationwide. This is the result of an IWR evaluation of data from the market master data register of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA).”
“A catastrophe” for wind power
At Twitter green energy activist Prof. Volker Quaschning called the collapse a “catastrophe”, tweeting that the expansion of wind power “collapsed completely”. He added that “it will be impossible to meet the CO2 reduction targets” and that 40,000 jobs in the wind industry are “on the brink”.

Wind power in Germany has been met with increasingly fierce protest from citizens, especially from traditional environmentalists, who reject the industrialization of the landscape. Others point to wind energy’s volatile power supply, cost, noise pollution, general ineffciency and danger to birds and ecosystems.

Once predicted to be ice-free by climate “experts”, the Arctic ice has not lost any volume over the current decade.
Using the modelled ice volume data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), we see June 15 volume trend has been flat since 2010:

Data source: DMI
Next we examine the fluctuating ice volume, going back to March 2006:

Data source: DMI
The above plot shows how Arctic ice volume has not gone down in 13 years, i.e. since climate experts began warning in earnest that the Arctic had entered a “death spiral”.

That the Arctic has plateaued at a low level does not surprise a number of climate and weather experts, who say it is natural and in large part connected to the North Atlantic sea surface temperature oscillations:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe weather sensitivity of activists
By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Have you noticed it too?
Over the last years it’s been climate change that is to blame for everything. Whether it’s storming outside or snowing, whether it’s not storming or not snowing, whether it’s thunderstorming with a lot of rain, or if it’s dry: everything is said to be climate change. What kind of weather would not show climate change? Any deviation from the mean is now a sign of climate change?
There are some who oppose this logic.
Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann is a shining example. On Twitter, he recently got peppered with accusations that he’s supplying the “climate deniers” with ammunition.
Carbon has made an immense contribution
This article could show the opposite because we too are convinced that mankind is changing the climate, and the use of coal, gas and oil in the entire value chain of industrial society has brought it about. On the other hand, mankind would not be where it is today without the positive effects of carbon in human nutrition, energy supply, mobility, poverty alleviation, the fight against disease with medicines and many other achievements that we owe to the combined efforts of generations before us.
And it will take some effort to get the effects of our actions under control by about 2100. Any earlier date for an Armageddon is fiction, serious science agrees.
Task for a century, not a legislative period
We would like to refer once again to what we derived in July 2017: How high can the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increase in order not to surpass the 2°C target: around 600 ppm? Assuming current (2017) 407 ppm CO2 and a current average growth of 2.11 ppm per year, the 600 ppm would be reached in 2108. Of course it would be necessary to reduce global CO2 emissions to near zero by the end of this century – a task for three global generations and not for three German legislative periods.
Desperate activists seizing upon every anomaly
Activists don’t see it that way. They announce the checkered flag will be waving for mankind in just 12 years.
But it’s difficult to justify this, so they try to take advantage of any weather. For example, it can get warm in Finland when the wind blows from the south in summer. This shouldn’t be surprising given the high solar radiation, but the activists now hype it up to turn the weather into climate.  It is quite easy to calculate how many days the daily maximum temperature there exceeded 26°C.

The number of days over all of Finland with a maximum temperature of over 26°C. Data source: E-OBS (KNMI)
It’s easy to see that warmth over Finland happens every now and then and that real conclusions cannot be drawn. There is no reason to panic about hot Finnish days.
No evidence of anthropogenic influence on cyclones
Another dubious claim that is often made is that climate change is causing more / stronger tropical storms such as hurricanes (in the Atlantic) and typhoons (in the Pacific). In recent years, we’ve seen a number of articles of this type whenever there’s been a tropical storm. A simple thermodynamic conclusion gets drawn: Warmer water contains more energy and makes storms worse.
Yet, a recent study by world-leading researchers on this topic makes it clear that it is not so easy. They find many uncertainties, and in particular that Atlantic hurricanes are not attributable to climate change, not even the associated extreme precipitation:
To date, there is no convincing evidence of a detectable anthropogenic influence on hurricane precipitation rates,…”
No trend in German precipitation
Since 2019 could be a rather active hurricane season, we have tobe prepared that climate change will be blamed by activists. But this conclusion, according to science, is not justified. It’s simple scaremongering! But we all know Greta Thunberg’s call: We want panic!
Also often reported: Forest fires in this country [Germany] are largely due to the “climate crisis”. Forest fires are the result of drought. Yet, it is not the heat that is to blame, but rather the lack of precipitation. And what about summer in Germany?

The DWD German Weather service notes: no trend has been found.
Why are they lying?
It was unusually dry last year, so yes there were more forest fires. All those who exploit a weather event for their agenda have to ask themselves: What kind of agenda is this for which you have to lie so much?

"Sainsbury’s, Lego and H&M are among the businesses to make a prestigious A-list of companies that are deemed to be at the forefront of the charge to tackle the “existential” climate crisis. The list is compiled by non-profit group CDP which scores companies based on the environmental data they voluntarily disclose on its platform. Just 2% of the 8,000 companies it scores made the A-list, with Nestlé, Unilever, BT and Walmart among the 179 to make the cut. A focus on the climate emergency was not at the expense of business success, CDP said, with companies on the A-list also outperforming peers on the stock market by 5.5% a year. The company also has an F-list for companies that did not submit a response for climate change in 2019 – with Amazon and Facebook among the 9,225. Dexter Galvin, CDP’s global director of corporations and supply chains, said the A-list were “blazing a trail for others to follow”. He said: “Other companies should look to these leaders for inspiration and learn from them.” “The latest science says we need global emissions to urgently peak and start declining by 7.6% a year to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis,” continued Galvin. “Companies can and should become part of the solution rather than part of the problem.” With the financial performance of companies on the A-list better than their rivals, Galvin said this demonstrated that “leading on climate action is good business in today’s economy” and would be “essential business in tomorrow’s economy”. Unilever points to the success of its trophy sustainable brands – a group of 28 that includes Dove, Hellmann’s and Sunsilk – which are growing much faster than the rest of its business. The brands, which accounted for more than half of the group’s €51bn (£46bn) sales last year, are those that are the furthest ahead on meeting the company’s sustainability goals. A-list companies scored highly because of their transparent and comprehensive disclosure of climate data. Examples of best practice include setting science-based targets, shifting to renewable energy and incentivising suppliers to reduce their emissions. Lego, for example, was praised for increasing its use of recycled materials and plant-based plastics; two years ago it started selling Lego pieces made from plant-based plastic sourced from sugar cane. Sainsbury’s, meanwhile, has pledged to halve the amount of plastic packaging it uses over the next six years. H&M, the Swedish group that also owns & Other Stories and Cos brands, is aiming to have 100% recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030. CDP says investors and purchasers are calling for transparency and action from companies on how they are responding to climate change. "
"The BBC is about to screen its first climate change-dedicated documentary in some years. The show, Climate Change by Numbers, is all about the statistics at the heart of the effort to understand the scale and pace of human influence on our climate. Three mathematicians – Hannah Fry, Norman Fenton and David Spiegelhalter – explore the background to three numbers: BBC Four chief Cassian Harrison said the show “puts aside the politics to concentrate on the science”. Nice try, but no: science and politics can’t be separated on this or indeed any other topic where there are wide economic and social consequences, and a good dose of uncertainty.  But everyone involved in the programme is doing us a great service in reminding us that climate science ought to be allowed to be just interesting sometimes. And this kind of approach offers a far more sturdy basis for public conversation than tired insistence upon a monolithic scientific “consensus”. In an exemplary move for a TV show the team includes three academic consultants. Two of them, Tamsin Edwards from The Open University and Doug McNeall from the Met Office Hadley Centre, have long been very active on social media inviting people into an understanding of their work as unfolding and ambitious. Tamsin asks us to learn to love the uncertainty in climate science: We haven’t always sold the idea of uncertainty as not only inevitable but even exciting, and we’ve sometimes over-simplified our communication. That pause in warming of the atmosphere surprised the media and public, even though scientists always expected this kind of thing could happen in the short term. This fits nicely with my own argument that appears in a book of essays Culture and Climate Change: Narratives. As a social scientist and policy researcher with a particular interest and involvement in the media I’ve long been frustrated by the predominant tactics aimed at mobilising public concern. Phrases like “the science is finished” and “the greatest challenge facing humanity” have sought to enrol the public and politicians in a grand cause. But these approaches may alienate as many as they attract. It is far more robust to headline the natural science of climate change as a hugely ambitious risk assessment, the main contours of which have changed little since the early 1990s, and then explain that the rest of the research and policy effort is a big, messy risk management process. It is often forgotten that the IPCC’s First Assessment Report back in 1990 insisted “we are confident that … uncertainties can be reduced by further research. However, the complexity of the system means that we cannot rule out surprises.” Focusing on risk frees the natural science to become a lot more interesting on its own terms, enchanting even. Explaining it as a backroom risk assessment operation, and inviting everyone into that room now and again to follow progress will help to build trust and engagement in some of the most interesting, complex and difficult questions human beings have ever set themselves.  But the natural science is only one, albeit centrally important, part of the climate change story. In cultural terms, climate change is a difficult body of new knowledge that holds significance for all the challenges that humanity has always faced regarding shelter, comfort, food and mobility. In media terms, however, the topic often seems strangely disconnected from mainstream business, politics and everyday life.  Climate change is one of the strongest drivers of innovation in engineering and design, and is spurring radical new thinking in the arts, humanities and social sciences. It is catalysing major advances in lighting, mobility, communications, architecture, food and energy. It is also driving far-reaching and entirely novel conversations about where and how we redraw the boundaries of ethics and politics across time and space.  Not everyone is going to find all of this interesting. But slivers of these themes will be important to pretty much everyone. Giving full rein to the mad diversity of ideas set in motion by this difficult new knowledge helps to engage those people who are bored or alienated by an over-generalised and repetitive chorus of projected woe."
"Last summer, on the Isle of Arran, off the west coast of Scotland, we watched an excited young lad walking down to the water’s edge, fishing rod in hand. Sadly, his chances of catching anything were slim to remote.  Once plentiful stocks of cod, haddock and plaice have almost completely collapsed in the Firth of Clyde, the area of sea in which Arran sits, following a century of poor fisheries management. Nowadays more than 99% of the commercial fisheries landings there are not for fish, but for shellfish such as prawns and scallops, which don’t take a bait. Motivated by this dramatic change in their local marine environment, two Arran residents, Howard Wood and Don McNeish, formed the Community of Arran Seabed Trust back in 1995. They quickly seized on the idea of using marine reserves – areas of sea where fishing and other extractive uses are restricted – as a way to bring back the marine life they had previously enjoyed as scuba divers. Reserves had been used to great success in New Zealand and the Philippines, where the benefits appeared to have spilled over to the areas open to fishing. However marine reserves were non-existent in the UK at the time.  Finally, after over a decade of campaigning and building community and scientific support they got their reserve in Lamlash Bay in October 2008. It was small (only 2.67 km2 in area) but significant, being the first and still the only fully protected marine reserve in Scotland. We’ve looked at the Arran reserve in our research. Our findings, published this year in the journals Marine Biology and Marine Environmental Research indicate marine life is starting to flourish once again.  Complex seabed habitats formed by seaweeds and other plant-like creatures are recovering. These in turn act as a magnet for juvenile scallops, cod and other tasty species.  Adult scallops are benefiting too, growing in size and reproductive capacity. High levels of breeding within the reserve are likely to be seeding surrounding fishing grounds. Marine reserves, such as that on Arran, are the most protected form of Marine Protected Area (MPA).  Due to their perceived benefits for both conservation and fisheries, the use of MPAs has grown spectacularly over the past two decades. They now cover 2.8% of the world’s oceans, and the 2010 Convention on Biological Diversity set an ambitious target for this to grow to at least 10% by 2020. Both the UK and Scottish governments are rolling out further MPAs. There are strong arguments for the conservation value of MPAs. Clearly, if you protect ecosystems from activities which damage them, you expect benefits.  Indeed, global analyses consistently find greater biodiversity and species size and abundance inside MPAs.  Certain habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass are highly sensitive to any kind of human disturbance, and protecting these areas should be a no-brainer given their ecological importance. Atlantic cod, for instance, rely on seagrass for shelter while they’re still growing. However, the added restrictions these MPAs might put on fisheries has been met with strong resistance. In response to this lobbying pressure, it appears likely that UK governments will allow fishing to continue in the majority of the MPAs.  While low impact fisheries such as creeling and line fishing may be compatible with the conservation features in some MPAs, in many cases the most damaging types of fishing such as scallop dredging will be allowed to continue.  There are also no plans for any further highly protected MPAs, such as the one at Arran, to be established. Surely this is a wasted opportunity. Perhaps if the fishing industry could be convinced such MPAs would actually benefit fisheries, they would be met with less resistance. Proving that highly protected MPAs benefit fisheries is difficult, but recent advances in genetics have conclusively demonstrated that disproportionately high amounts of young fish can be exported from marine reserves to neighbouring fishing grounds on tropical coral reefs.   Some scientists claim there is little evidence for them working in the cool temperate seas around the UK. But the Arran marine reserve story adds to the benefits that MPAs have provided to scallops around the Isle of Man and in Lyme Bay, and to lobsters around Lundy Island. Furthermore, recent modelling of the English Channel marine ecosystem concluded that highly protected MPAs were the best bet for both fisheries and conservation.  Crucially, the key to the success of the few MPAs in the UK to date has not just been getting the science right, but involving and getting support from the local community and fishing industries. Zoning arrangements divvying up the Clyde between fishermen and fish replenishment areas have just been proposed. This surely has to be the way forward."

Life thrives when the globe gets tropically warm. Photo credit: NASA, public domain
There’s been a lot of hype and hysteria surrounding the claims that the recent, modest global warming supposedly will have dire impacts on species diversity and survival.
But the wild claims fly in the face of what the earth’s history shows us: Biodiversity and species thrived in warm periods, and struggled during the cooler ones.
Now scientific results published in two recent papers suggest this yet again. What follows are the abstracts from the 2 papers along with links to them:
1. Fujisaki et al., 2019
To constrain the redox conditions and related nitrogen cycles during the Middle Permian (Guadalupian) to latest Late Permian (Lopingian) deep mid-Panthalassa, we determined the abundances of major, trace, and rare earth elements along with the carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in shales interbedded with deep-sea cherts that are well-exposed at the Gujo-Hachiman section in the Mino-Tanba belt, SW Japan. … However, unlike the oxic and nitrate-rich deep-Panthalassa, we speculate that oxygen-depleted (i.e., anoxic/euxinic) and bioavailable nitrogen-poor conditions developed in the deep Tethys immediately before the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary (G-LB). These environmental stresses were potentially driven by a global cooling episode (Kamura event) together with the unique paleogeography, i.e., no contact with polar ice caps in the Tethyan Ocean. Upwelling of the anoxic watermass accumulated in the deep Tethys during the global cooling episode likely triggered oceanic anoxia in the shallow-marine regions around the G-LB [Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary, Mid- to Late Permian], which eventually resulted in the G-LB mass extinction. … In the latest Guadalupian (Capitanian), the appearance of the global cooling episode was proposed based on various lines of evidence; e.g., the lowest sea-level during the Phanerozoic (Haq and Schutter, 2008), the preferential extinction of tropically adapted fauna (Isozaki and Aljinović, 2009), the migration of mid-latitude fauna toward tropical domains (Shen and Shi, 2002), and the occurrences of mid-latitude tillites (Fujimoto et al., 2012) and alpine glacial deposits in high altitudes (Fielding et al., 2008). The high δ13Ccarb values during this period were also interpreted to indicate high primary productivity and leading to an effective burial of organic matter promoted by the global cooling episode (Kamura event; Isozaki et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2011). The global cooling episode potentially affected biological activity in the shallowmarine domains; i.e., the low eustatic levels invoked delivery of fluvial organic matter to shelf because of the increased land area, which likely resulted in increase of organic matter, expansion of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), and enhanced denitrification in the water column.”
2. Smolarek-Lach et al., 2019
Mercury Spikes Indicate a Volcanic Trigger for the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction Event … We conclude that our Hg and Hg/TOC values were associated with volcanic pulses which triggered the massive environmental changes resulting in the Late Ordovician mass extinction. … Mercury enrichments have also been described for the middle and latest Permian extinctions. Sanei et al.’s study of the latest Permian mercury enrichment in the Canadian High Arctic, attributed this to emissions from the Siberian Traps [flood volcanism] with deleterious environmental consequences. … [T]he Hg enrichment in the Katian geochemical record (the ornatus anomaly) is interpreted as a volcanic event that triggered severe cooling. It has been suggested that the upper pacificus anomaly is connected with a volcanic eruption which triggered an albedo catastrophe and the rapid expansion of ice sheets.”

"What would our energy system look like if the move to a low-carbon society wasn’t left to governments and big energy companies but was instead led by civil society?  We are all used to the debate between states and markets, private vs public provision in shaping the direction of the energy sector; but communities, citizens and local authorities together can form a “civic” energy sector that could revolutionise the way we generate and use energy.  People in the UK are not well served by the current energy market. Investigations have found poor competition, a slow switch towards renewables, and the value in the system being captured by international companies, with very little economic benefit remaining at a local level.  But there is another way, identified by Realising Transition Pathways, a consortium of researchers from across nine UK universities. Existing community energy projects – run by groups of citizens – could link with new roles for local authorities as energy service companies to form a “civic” energy sector.  This civic sector would expand on the work of energy crowdfunding platforms such as Pure Leapfrog and mutual models such as Energy4All to provide new ways for ordinary citizens to invest in local energy resources.  The growth of a civic energy sector would be bad news for the large utilities. The UK’s traditional Big Six energy providers would lose ground in both the generation and supply markets and would need to shift their business models to provide new services. Civic energy would need some early support, but it could soon become the natural preference over what an increasingly outdated utilities sector is offering, having failed to anticipate the potential of local energy and what customers want from their energy providers. Distributed energy would need both technological and institutional change. It would require lots more small and medium scale renewables – more solar, onshore and offshore wind, biogas heat and power plants, and marine energy such as tidal generation. All of these new technologies would need to connect to much smarter distribution grids than we currently have and would require new ways of moving power from the bottom up as well as the top down.  However our work shows that local energy doesn’t mean energy independence; indeed in a civic energy future, interconnection between regions, across the UK and internationally would be critical to balance the system. This wouldn’t mean and end to big power plants, just far fewer of them. These connections would be aided by a smarter, more responsive electricity grid. This could mean a shift to tariffs based on when you use energy rather than how much you use. Consumers would have to be much more engaged. In order to develop a distributed energy system households and businesses would need to get serious about energy efficiency and be more responsive to smart meter data.  Local authorities will also be vital as, in a distributed network, consumers would likely get bills from their local authority energy company. These bills would be for services such as a “warm home” or “hot water” as opposed to the relatively crude system of just paying for energy by volume needed. The old system of paying for how much you use means big utilities can’t stomach a big fall in consumption, so why would they help you really reduce your bill?  If you were paying for “heat” and “light” rather than power by the unit, your energy supplier would want to to keep you warm and your house lit as cheaply as possible,  which means big investments in energy efficiency.  Local authorities are in a great place to do this as they are trusted far more than current utilities.  But of course not all local authorities have the same resources. The north-west of England is not as suited to solar as the south-east, for instance, and the mountainous north of Scotland can provide much more hydro-electricity than the flat farmland of the Fens.  In order to move to a distributed energy system, we would need to carefully plan for maximising energy resources in each region.

A 2001 Salon magazine “terror in the skies” alarmism article featured a Dr. James Hansen late-1980s prediction that New York City’s West Side Highway would be underwater within 20 years.

Of course the West Side Highway is not underwater today.
Nor does it appear that there have been any detectable changes to its shoreline position since 1936.
In fact, outside the realm of popularized alarmism, it is well known that geological processes are more determinative of relative sea level changes than climate factors contributing to sea level rise or fall (i.e., glacier melt or advance).
Piecuch et al. (2018) concluded “the majority of large-scale spatial variation in long-term rates of relative sea-level rise on the US East Coast is due to geological processes that will persist at similar rates for centuries.”

Pfeffer and colleagues (2017) assessed 849 coastal sites and determined that geophysical processes, or vertical land motion (VLM) trends (ranging from −13 to +16 mm yr−1 ), “have been recognized as a dominant component of the total relative sea-level variations observed at coasts” at locations throughout the globe.

In a new paper, Armstrong and Lazarus (2019) indicate “trends in recent rates of shoreline change along the U.S. Atlantic Coast reflect an especially puzzling increase in accretion, not erosion.”
The numbers are indeed “especially puzzling” for those immersed in sea-level-rise alarmism.
From 1830 to 1956, shorelines eroded at the rapid rate of -55 cm per year on average. Since 1960, the U.S. Atlantic coast has been expanding (accretion) at a rate of +5 cm per year.
The authors seek to provide a “plausible” explanation for this “enigmatic pattern” by suggesting “beach nourishment” (infrastructure development) may explain the tendencies for shorelines to grow as sea levels rise.
For those who do not ascribe to sea-level-rise alarmism, the recent reversal to shoreline accretion is not puzzling and needs no such “plausible” explanation.
Instead, these trends are consistent with a pattern of shoreline growth “all over the world” for the most recent decades.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe “Green New Deal” is a multi-trillion-dollar plan proposed by Ocasio-Cortez in February of 2019 and backed by almost one hundred members of Congress, including most of the Democratic presidential hopefuls.
Among a slew of other sacrifices, the program would force our prosperous society to replace diesel and gasoline-powered vehicles with electric vehicles and meat eating with vegetarianism. Liberty would be replaced by stifling government regulation.

The Green New Deal And Climate Change – What You Need To Know explains why the “Green New Deal” is neither green nor scientific, and needs to be rejected.
Lynne Balzer’s new book The Green New Deal And Climate Change – What You Need To Know explains how the climate science that’s driving the radical policy initiatives is flawed, fraught with outright scientific fraud and how all the proposed green initiatives are in fact anti-green because they would end up irreversibly ravaging our environment.
50 years of wrong predictions
This book details the 50-year history of climate change alarmism that began in the 1970’s with its dire warnings about global cooling caused by mankind and how that term changed first to “global warming” and then to “climate change” when the warming stopped.
None of the predictions, ten-year survival warnings or tipping points given during the past five decades has ever materialized.
Ms. Balzer, a schoolteacher from America’s heartland, presents compelling reasons why wind turbines, solar power and biofuels are not only impractical but would actually greatly damage the environment.  The book exposes the serious flaws in the science behind the entire manmade global warming scenario and the scientific impossibility that carbon dioxide, a trace gas, could be responsible for warming the planet.

Balzer explains how prominent climate scientists have been hiding data and attempting to destroy other scientists who disagreed with their claims.
The right antidote for the truant FFF school kids
The Green New Deal and Climate Change: What You Need to Know is essential reading for all voters and policy makers.
It’s also the ideal book for the FFF school-striking kids to read because it’s written by a schoolteacher in terms that are easily understood by laypersons.
Every responsible parent or grandparent needs to give this book to their children so that they will be able to view the climate issue critically, calmly, rationally and objectively.
Ms. Balzer’s book concludes that the energy “solutions” specified in the Green New Deal are neither green nor sustainable and that so-called renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power and biofuels, are not only impractical and economically devastating, but also very damaging to the environment.
The “Green New Deal” is one social engineering lesson we’d be far better off going without.

"Skateboarders aren’t too popular with civic authorities. Routinely demonised as vandals and as a danger to other members of the public, they are often portrayed as an antisocial nuisance to be excluded by law or sometimes lured away to officially sanctioned skate parks. Skaters, being predominantly teenage lads, can seem like an alien and dangerous sub-species, scowling from beneath hoodies festooned with zombies, occult runes or lewd cartoons.  Yet the real trouble with skateboarding is that it challenges the dominant use of cities, which remain controlled by civic and corporate interests whose primary purpose is to run the place as a machine for consumption. Pesky skaters are at very least an unruly nuisance getting in the way of valued customers, or, worse still, are enjoying the cityscape for free, a specific symptom of a general teenaphobia. Iain Borden, the UCL professor whose ground-breaking book first brought the place of skaters in the city to attention recently suggested skating had achieved a more positive place in many cityscapes around the world, now recognised as a creative, challenging and healthy activity.  To an extent this is true. Skateboarding builds confidence and the social capital that can combat social exclusion, alcohol and drug abuse. The sport is becoming respectable with skateboarding designed into some spaces and superb new skate parks.  However civic respectability may not be part of the attraction.  Central to skateboarding is the sense of the skaters’ local scene, a heritage and culture that may be inscrutable to non-skaters. Skate culture is powerful social glue. Skaters will tell you that they can turn up in an unfamiliar city, skateboard in hand, and immediately be welcomed to join in with the locals.   Skateboarders’ bonds can also come as a surprise to city authorities. In the autumn of 2014 the city council in Norwich proposed a ban on skateboarding throughout the city centre. Norwich’s new skate park had been built, according to the council, on “the tacit understanding” that skaters would not use the city centre. On the evening of the council debate to herald the ban the public gallery of the town hall was packed with skaters, with more beside left outside unable to fit in following a demonstration and a public petition with more than 6,000 signatures.  The council withdrew its immediate plans for a ban although the possible use of a restriction, a Public Spaces Protection Order, has been mooted. This new PSPO legislation also threatened skaters in the town of Kettering, while more typical bans are also looming in Barking and Bristol. Iain Borden’s global optimism can seem a bit too sunny down at street level. Skaters are not out to cause conflict. They would much prefer to be left to their own devices, often out of sight and out of mind. While the ominous hoodies and garish logos may look like trouble, it is worth taking time to watch skaters using their favourite spots, as against the fleeting encounters on the high street.  Skate scenes are very sociable, with their own etiquette for taking turns, working out tricks for competitions and looking out for each other. The sport fuels creativity through photography, video and graphics. Skaters treasure and look after top spots, raising money to build ramps and blocks. The spots may not be theirs to own, but they are very good at colonising a city’s forlorn and forgotten corners.  In my city of Newcastle upon Tyne the top local site, the Wasteland, was an old factory floor – skated for more 20 years. “Our summer home” the skaters would say – and they visited it up until the very day when developers finally excavated the concrete, including the parting graffiti: “Farewell our fair weather friend”.  A new wasteland has been found, again a demolished factory site – and money has been raised from DIY skate competitions to build new ramps and blocks. Revealingly the same site is also features on a recent list of Tyneside’s top eyesores.  The skater’s eye sees the city differently. In Tyneside their other favourite site is across the river in Gateshead. Called Five Bridges it is a windswept plaza where pedestrian walkways converge under a vast and gloomy flyover. It is an unlovely space, but Gateshead Council put more than £11,000 into building skate ramps and jumps – a great deal of money to invest in entertaining unruly youths.   It did so after an elderly resident had told her councillor about the skaters who hung around on the plaza. Bracing himself for the usual complaints the councillor was surprised to hear that she liked it when the skaters were there because then it felt safe to walk through. So don’t think of skaters as hooligans and vandals. They are much more like a badly dressed version of the Boy Scouts, although the skaters I got to know through my research are not so keen on that cosy description. Maybe a better idea is like the elves in the fairy tale The Elves and the Shoemaker, a mysterious and often invisible presence busily making the city a better place to live."

A case for psychotherapy
In a recent paper dubbed “The Denial of the Apocalypse – Dealing with the Climate Crisis from the Perspective of Existential Psychotherapy” appearing in the German Das Psychotherapeutenjournal (The Psychotherapist Journal), author Fabian Chmielewski explains which “denial processes are effective and what the psychotherapists could and should concretely do about it”.
Panic over climate change is normal
According to Chmielewski, a psychologist with a practice in Hattingen, being in panic about the rapidly approaching climate apocalypse is in fact rational behavior, while having doubts and remaining calm about it is abnormal and thus needs to be addressed.
The journal’s editorial, written by Hans Schindler, comments that although Chmielewski’s paper is contentious, it is “a suitable impetus for the necessary debate about the socio-political responsibility of our professional group and for the discussion about the possibilities – and limits – of engagement in our roles as psychotherapists and citizens.”
Leading journal in Germany
Das Psychotherapeutenjournal is not just some crackpot publication that gets little attention in Germany, rather it is indeed the organ of the Bavarian State Chamber of Psychological Psychotherapists.
The journal is co-financed by the membership fees of the other German state chambers and sent throughout Germany. It is the central organ of a corporation under public law, which represents the profession of psychotherapists by law.
Concrete psychotherapeutic ‘interventions’
The abstract of Fabian Chmielewski paper:
A broad consensus of serious research warns of the scenario of a soon inevitable spiral of man-made climate change. Nevertheless, both large sections of the population and decision-makers do not seem to be adequately interested in the impending destruction of the world as we know it. The gloomy prophecies of climate scientists are played down or even denied, the necessary climate policy steps are not taken. The article looks at these phenomena from the perspective of existential psychotherapy and tries to point out possible causes and mechanisms of this repression as well as to derive concrete psychotherapeutic ‘interventions’. It also argues for the active participation of psychotherapists in health campaigns against this widespread “existential neurosis”.

Chmielewski claims that the “Fridays for Future” strikes and demonstrations are the clearest and most media-effective indication of the impending doomsday scenario, and calls for the implementation of the drastic climate policy measures demanded by science and that both doctors and psychologists warn of the health consequences of climate change and give it top priority. Here, he suggests, panic is the psychologically appropriate response.
Top human health priority
Chmielewski notes that at its annual general meeting, the Marburger Bund (association of physicians) demands: “Stopping climate change caused by humans and its consequences for human health must also be given absolute priority in health policy action”.
“Existential threat”
In the paper, Chmielewski writes that in recent times, various psychologists and psychotherapists have marked climate change as an “existential threat” (Psychologists for Future, 2019).
And when it comes to scientific dissent with regards to the upcoming climate doomsday, auditor Chmielewski writes that despite the scientific certainty of climate doomsday:
Nevertheless, important decision-makers are either completely denying man-made climate change or trivializing it and the urgency of the pressure to act. […] A large part of the population does not seem to be adequately interested in the impending destruction of the world as we know it and – as Brick and van der Linden (2018) put it – has only one lethargic “yawn” left for the apocalypse. Even more questionable seems to be the motivation of people to reject the human cause of climate change as a lie – sometimes with astonishing aggressiveness and with reference to untenable conspiracy theories.”
Suggesting compulsory hospitalization, medication
Also commenting on Chmielewski’s paper at the critical German achgut.com here, Air Tuerkis notes that generally therapists are rightly afraid to impose a certain point of view on people. But according to Chmielewski: “Exceptions are to be made, however, if an acute own or foreign endangerment is present”.
Tuerkis continues:
The concept of an ‘acute danger to oneself or others‘ is quite explosive here. It releases the therapist, for example, from the duty of confidentiality. The term normally aims at impending criminal offences that pose a danger to life and limb and above all a the danger of suicide. In Bavaria the legislator speaks of a danger to public safety to a considerable extent.”
A ‘considerable and acute danger to oneself or others’ is even sufficient as a reason for compulsory hospitalisation and compulsory medication. In this case, the patient could be admitted provisionally for up to 48 hours without a court order.”
In other words, back to the dark days days of Soviet-style punitive political psychiatry. Dissenters should be medicated into changing their views.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn and interview with flagship German business daily Handelsblatt here, Danish economist Björn Lomborg warned of the “inefficiency in climate protection” and says Germany is a “deterrent example” in this respect.
“Gigantic costs”
He told the Handelsblatt that the once highly praised “Energiewende” was “poorly implemented” and that the costs will be “gigantic”.
Image: Twitter.
“Germany, with its promotion of renewable energies, is a particularly deterrent example in this respect. Such mismanagement adds up to gigantic additional costs,” said Lomborg.
Great doubts concerning costs
The high profile  Danish economist also told the Handelsblatt that the goal of climate neutrality makes no economic sense, saying: “That is easy to say, but extremely difficult to implement. I have great doubts as to whether all these states will be able to answer the question of what it will cost in the end.”
Lomborg also told the Handelsblatt that bans would be counterproductive, and that consumers will simply spend the money they save by not flying on other CO2-causing products. “The only sure way to reduce CO2 emissions is to make people poor.”
Technology is the key
Lomborg says that he supports a CO2 tax over the short-term to reduce CO2 emissions but that that ultimately the only way will be through improved technology, and not political measures. “We need innovations to combat climate change. That must be our first priority. […] The key then is innovation.”

Citizens will rise up against bans
Lomborg says technical innovation is better than demanding people pay 16% of GDP on climate protection. “People don’t want that. They will then vote for politicians like Trump or Bolsonaro.”
Only one percent comes from wind and sun
When it comes to wind and sun as a supply of energy, Lomborg says that ultimately the huge costs will have to be correctly taken into account, and warns that they are far from being a cheap supply.
“You have to see the cost of the whole system. […] And we should not lose sight of the dimensions: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), one percent of global energy demand is currently covered by wind and sun, while the IEA estimates that it will be about four percent by 2040,” Lomborg told the Handelsblatt.
Going it alone, shifting emissions “crazy”
And the Danish economist warns against Europe going it alone on CO2 reductions. If it does, ” then the energy-intensive industry will disappear in the direction of the USA or Asia. It is crazy to drive the energy-intensive industry out of Europe and shift emissions to other regions of the world.”
Education and development
Lomborg also told the Handelsblatt that the best way to protect developing countries from climate change is to invest in their education and health care – so that they will be able to “get themselves out of sheet metal huts.” Storms wreak far greater damage on impoverished societies than on developed ones.
“If we lead people out of poverty, they will become less vulnerable to the consequences of climate change and to many other challenges. Yes, we must fight climate change, but we must do it intelligently,” said Lomborg

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate science skeptic Michael Kruger of Science Skeptical here writes that the earth has become GREENER and more fertile due to more CO2 and warming.

Source: Zhu et al 
Hard to believe, but the earth is not turning into a desert and more arid due to the CO2 increase in the atmosphere, like alarmist scientists and media like us to believe it is, but rather it is becoming greener and more fertile.
This is what scientists have found through the analysis of satellite data over the last four decades.

A study published in 2016 in Nature Climate Change proves that the earth has become considerably greener over the past decades.
For their study, the researchers led by Zaichun Zhu evaluated vegetation data recorded by three satellites between 1982 and 2009. The evaluation showed that since 1982, the plant world has become more luxuriant and thus greener on a large part of terrestrial land surfaces.
Area “twice the size of the USA”
“The biggest greening trends can be seen in the southeast of North America, in the northern Amazon region, in Europe, Central Africa and Southeast Asia,” said Zhu and his colleagues.  “This greening, which we have observed, is comparable in scale to an additional green continent twice the size of the USA,” says Zhu.
To find out exactly what is responsible for this increase in plant material, the scientists fed ten global ecosystem models with data on greenhouse gas emissions, land use and the development of climate factors such as temperature and precipitation. The result: 70% of the earth’s greening is due to the fertilizing effect of rising CO2 levels and 30% to climatic effects and other effects such as climate change, nitrogen deposition and changes in land cover.
Thus, in the high latitudes and in Tibet and other highlands of the mountains, the rise in temperatures is responsible for the fact that the vegetation there became more luxuriant. “Warming promotes photosynthesis and prolongs the growing season,” the researchers explain.
Increasing precipitation in the Sahel and South Africa
In the Sahel and South Africa, on the other hand, increasing precipitation is becoming noticeable. This makes the region more fertile and greener.
The rise in CO2 emissions and climate change therefore favor the greening of the earth and plant growth. Even Syria has greened.

The earth has become greener over the past 4 decades. This is the main conclusion of an international study published in Nature Climate Change on 25 April 2016. In 40 percent of the world’s regions, a significant increase in leaf biomass was observed between 1982 and 2015, only 4 percent showed significant losses of vegetation. The vegetation corresponds to the size of a continent twice the size of the USA.

The desert regions have also become greener, such as the Sahel on the border with the Sahara, the Fertile Crescent, which stretches across Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran, and the former region of Carthage in North Africa, which used to be the granary of Ancient Rome.
These areas were already green and fertile in the climate optimum of the Holocene directly after the last ice age. From there, in the course of the Neolithic revolution, agriculture spread to Europe and Northern Europe.


The Sahel region has been greening for four decades:


This has been shown by a variety of studies.
Sahara shrinks by over 700,000 sq. km.
In 2018, Venter et al. recorded an eight percent increase in timber vegetation in sub-Saharan Africa over the last three decades using satellite imagery.
According to Wikipedia, the Sahara covers an area of around 9.2 million square kilometers. Eight percent of this corresponds to more than 700,000 square kilometers. This is an area almost as large as Germany and France together!

Lake Chad is growing
Even Lake Chad at the south edge of the Sahara is growing again and getting greener.

A greener Europe
Also in Germany it has not become more arid over the last four decades, as the media and climate impact researchers have recently informed us. Quite to the contrary:

Above all the north, the east, the low mountain regions and the Alps have become greener, as the satellite data show. The forest area is also growing in Germany, which is over 30% wooded. Between 1992 and 2008, the forest area in Germany “grew by an average of 176 square kilometers per year”.

"Although many supporters of Donald Trump seemingly believe that global warming is a hoax, almost everyone else agrees that the climate emergency should be at the top of the list of important policy issues. Identifying the problem, however, is not much use unless we also identify the appropriate tools to address it. In my own field of specialisation, central bankers have caught climate-change fever. Under the leadership of Christine Lagarde, for example, both the International Monetary Fund and now the European Central Bank have declared the planet’s climate health to be “mission critical.”  To be sure, financial institutions must fundamentally rethink some things in the light of the climate crisis. For example, a bank or insurance company calculating risks to real-estate loans would make a serious mistake if it followed the standard methodology and plugged into its formulas the probability of a flood based on data from the past 100 years. Instead, it should take a forward-looking approach, which means using estimates of the increasingly elevated probability of such disasters. But central banks and international financial institutions simply lack the necessary tools to have first-, second-, or maybe even third-order effects on greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. So, what policy tools would have first-order effects? In the US, the “green new deal” signals commitment to the climate cause. But I fear that the legislative proposal that its congressional supporters have introduced will do more harm than good. It includes extraneous measures such as a federal jobs guarantee. This proposal creates a factual basis for a lie that US climate-change deniers have long been telling: that global warming is a hoax promoted as an excuse to expand the size of government. That is a sure-fire way to generate votes for Trump in November. Technological innovations in areas such as solar power certainly will play a big role in mitigation. But technology is not a policy. Subsidies are a policy. There is a case to be made that governments should subsidise research in climate science and relevant technologies. There is also a strong case that policymakers should allow free trade in solar panels, turbines and other equipment, to lower the cost of generating renewable energy at no cost to domestic taxpayers. But the policy that will move us closest to achieving global environmental targets, such as those in the Paris climate agreement, at relatively modest economic costs, is to raise the price of emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. If, for example, solar power or other renewables can in fact meet most of our energy needs at a reasonable cost, then a high carbon price will encourage that result. And if some other technology or approach is needed, the carbon price will reveal that as well. The price of carbon can be raised via one of two policies: a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, that is, a system of quantitative emission limits with tradable emission permits. In theory, the two approaches are equivalent: the quantity of carbon permits is calculated carefully, so that the resulting price when they are traded is the same as the price that would be achieved by the tax. In the real world, however, there are significant differences between regulating prices and quantities. The most important differences relate to uncertainty and political economy. For starters, it would be great if policymakers could commit to a century-long rising path for the carbon price. People could then plan far ahead. Firms would know with certainty the penalty for building long-lasting coal-fired power plants. But, even assuming a miraculous burst of multilateral cooperation, today’s leaders cannot bind their successors 50 years into the future, which rules out precise certainty about the future price or quantity of GHG emissions. What is critical, though, is quickly to establish the expectation that the price of carbon will follow a generally rising path in the future. To achieve this, governments must start increasing the price today; lofty statements from public officials and optimal calculations from climate modellers will not do the job. Predicting political economy, meanwhile, is extremely difficult. In the climate-change arena, everything is judged to be “politically impossible,” and was even before Trump. Even so, at the global level governments are probably more likely to agree to quantitative emission targets – as in the 1997 Kyoto protocol and the 2015 Paris accord – than to a global carbon tax, which would be considered too severe an invasion of sovereignty. When it comes to the national implementation of any global effort to limit CO2 emissions, however, I lean toward a carbon tax over tradable emission permits. Previous attempts to introduce emission permits, such as the EU’s emissions trading system, have revealed a tendency to mollify industry by issuing more permits than originally intended and giving too many to legacy firms. The logic of doing so is to “make them whole,” but this can result in windfall gains when the firms sell the permits. In any case, putting the price of carbon on an upward path, whether via a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, is the right tool for the job. Obviously, no single citizen can expect to solve the problem of climate change alone. But whereas some individual actions are mainly symbolic, others can have an effect that is at least proportionate to the number of citizens undertaking them. For frustrated young people, one piece of advice is clear: while going to a Greta Thunberg-inspired demonstration is fine, registering and voting is critical. If Americans aged 18-24 were to turn out and vote in the same proportions as older age groups, Trump would almost certainly not be re-elected. With Trump gone, the US could rejoin the Paris agreement and adopt effective measures to combat global warming – and other governments would lose an excuse they currently have to delay action. • Jeffrey Frankel is a professor at Harvard University’s John F Kennedy School of Government.

The stricter climate protection targets recently announced by Chancellor Angela Merkel at a Protestant Church Congress would put a considerable burden on the German economy and every single household.
If the goal formulated by Merkel to increase the CO2 reduction target from 90 to 100 percent by 2050 were really achieved, then it would result in additional costs of around 3000 billion euros, according to a calculation by the former Hamburg Senator for the Environment, Fritz Vahrenholt (SPD).
7.6 trillion euros, twice Germany’s GDP
The cost of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 thus would rise from an estimated 4600 billion to 7600 billion euros. This is about twice as much as Germany’s gross domestic product in 2018, according to the magazine Tichys Einblick in its issue published Monday.

For these figures, Vahrenholt relies on a study commissioned by the Federal Government on the costs of the Energiewende (transition to green energies), which the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, the German Academy of Engineering Sciences (acatech) and the Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities presented in November 2017.

Additional 320 euros per month per household
According to the study, the researchers expect costs for reaching the 90 percent target to reach 4600 billion euros by 2050. According to the study, this corresponds to an average additional burden on households in Germany of 320 euros per month.

Reductions getting increasingly difficult, expensive

An increase in climate protection targets beyond the 90 percent aim, as Angela Merkel has now formulated as a target, is particularly expensive because all “favourable” possibilities for CO2 reduction and replacement have already been exhausted.
“The technical expenditure for any further reduction is much higher since all potentials for direct electricity use have been exhausted and low-cost fossil natural gas must be replaced by elaborately produced synthetic energy sources,” the researchers wrote in 2017.
3000 billion euros for last 10% reduction
On the basis of the cost assumptions made by the researchers, Vahrenholt extrapolated the costs for the last ten percent. According to this approach, the costs for the last ten percent are 3000 billion euros. By way of comparison, in their government report the researchers stated that the additional costs of increasing the climate protection target from 85 to 90 percent amounted to 1300 billion euros.
1050 euros per household – per month!

If the demand of the “Fridays for Future” demonstrators were met and climate neutrality were to be achieved by 2035, the costs would be incurred in a shorter time. According to Vahrenholt, the cost burden would rise to 1050 euros per household – per month!

"Austerity has led to an ugly food bank boom across the UK. Civil society – led by the Trussell Trust – has created a network which meets emergency needs for those unable to afford food. Those judged eligible are given food boxes containing a three-day supply of food. And now, sitting alongside food poverty in our Victorian-wannabe society, our poorest citizens are also threatened by fuel poverty. Around 17% of UK households struggle to meet their domestic energy needs, and the resulting exposure to cold, damp and mould in homes is linked to a range of respiratory and cardiovascular health problems, “excess winter deaths”, developmental problems for children and mental health concerns. These problems have prompted energy company Npower to consider spending up to £20m on an initiative to create “fuel banks”. Similar to food banks, fuel banks will provide vouchers to those in dire need to meet their energy costs for a certain period of time, either from or alongside food banks. This could work by offering emergency credit vouchers for those who pay for their gas or electricity through keypads. On the face of it, fuel banks are well-intentioned. Depending on the details (eligibility conditions, the value of the vouchers, and so on), they could allow some respite during short-term emergencies. People facing sanctions on their social security payments, for instance, or low-income households with other budgetary crises – particularly during winter.  There is also some evidence that those receiving emergency food boxes from food banks are unable to use their contents if they need to be heated or cooked, due to being unable to afford gas or electricity. Providing energy vouchers alongside food boxes therefore seems sensible, and may go some way towards alleviating the survivalist dilemma faced by some households of “heating or eating”. But let’s not get carried away. Fuel banks can be no more than a sticking plaster for people who can’t afford heating – fuel poverty requires emergency surgery, not first-aid.  Policies which subsidise energy prices tend to be inefficient and only work for a limited time. People fall into fuel poverty due to a combination of badly built homes, high energy prices and low incomes and yet fuel banks and energy subsidy schemes simply focus on the symptoms without addressing the causes. Furthermore, any praise for Npower’s benevolence must be tempered by reminding ourselves that it retains a profitable position as one of the UK’s “Big Six” energy providers. The symbolism is also concerning – what do fuel banks say about our society’s desire to properly grapple with fuel poverty? Their development is another step towards what social geographer Stefan Bouzarovski terms the “privatisation and residualisation” of fuel poverty policy (in England – the relevant powers are largely devolved), where action is no longer funded from general taxation, and overall ambition is curtailed so only the most vulnerable are targeted. Perversely, fuel banks could undermine the case for effective action on fuel poverty: “Look, we’re already doing something about it – why should we bother regulating housing or energy?” Helping the fuel poor escape their predicament requires much more than the temporary, selective relief of a few from an energy giant with a corporate social responsibility agenda. We all have the human right to an adequate standard of living which includes food and a safe, warm home – a society which respects human dignity must keep eradication as the ultimate goal of fuel poverty policy. Political ambition, effective policies on housing, energy and low incomes and a commitment to the fulfilment of human rights are what the fuel poor desperately need – not charity."
"As bushfires raged across Australia’s south-east, Scott Morrison responded to questions about the climate crisis by stressing the nation-state’s weakness, not its power. Australia produces just 1.3% of global emissions, he said, and it wasn’t credible to suggest that “doing something more or less” would change a worldwide phenomenon.  Yes, he did insist his government was acting. We were, he said, “doing our bit” and “carrying our weight”. Those are lines with which you might dismiss an overzealous charity panhandler: “I’ve already given, thank you!” They’re a response to a tiresome obligation. They’re not a promise of solutions. Morrison has not said that temperatures will stabilise and the climate emergency will be averted. How could he? The only international mechanism currently in place stems from the Paris accords, the agreement by which the nations of the world pledged to keep global temperature rises below 2C. But Paris is palpably failing. None of the major powers will meet their targets – and no other plan exists. In democratic theory, the modern state legitimates itself through a simple bargain: we pay its taxes and obey its law. In return, it protects us and keeps us safe. The increasing inability of states to keep that pact in respect of climate will only become more obvious, exacerbating an already widespread cynicism about the political class. Paradoxically, a growing perception of state impotence will almost certainly be accompanied by ever more aggressive demonstrations of state power. In Australia, Morrison’s supporters talk about fuel loads and arson. In part, the pivot away from climate represents a simple bait and switch. After the world recorded its second-hottest year ever, conversations about hazard reduction help drown out conversations about climate. But the new focus also shifts the debate in a direction the government likes. If environmental bureaucracy had prevented hazard reduction (it didn’t), the answer lies in slashing green tape, an easy extension of an already existing ideological commitment to deregulation. More importantly, the identification of (a largely bogus) arson outbreak transforms an ecological crisis into a law and order problem, paving the way for new legislation and fresh penalties. And that’s something the state can deliver. Think of Morrison’s almost instant response to the needles-in-the-strawberry affair. Decrying fruit saboteurs as “cowards” and “grubs”, the prime minister introduced harsh new laws that would send them to jail for as long as 15 years. More police powers and increased sentences play to the strengths of what Nietzsche called “the cold monster”, allowing the leaders who announce them to sound stern and authoritative. Accordingly, in Australia in 2019, politicians spent more time discussing how best to punish environmental protesters than they did devising legislation that might protect the climate. Peter Dutton, for instance, called for activists to be “shamed”, jailed and cut off welfare. “These people are anarchists and fringe-dwellers and they should face the full force of the law,” he said. No government minister used similar rhetoric about carbon polluters. Similarly, in Queensland, the Labor premier Annastacia Palaszczuk almost certainly can’t deliver the jobs that rural supporters of Adani think the Carmichael coalmine will bring them (the employment promises keep shifting) and nor can she save the Great Barrier Reef (since that would entail stopping climate change). She can, however, rush through Joh-era style laws to jail Extinction Rebellion members. The state, by definition, possesses a monopoly on coercion. As a result, politicians incapable of any real policy agenda know they still unleash force. As Morrison himself says, the core responsibility of a prime minister is to “keep Australians safe”. If the 2019-2020 fire season really does foreshadow the new normal on a warming planet, governments face a looming crisis of legitimacy, precisely because there’s nothing safe about a country in flames. We’re likely, then, to see politicians asserting authority in an all too traditional way, with an increasing resort to the rhetoric of national security. As I have argued previously, it’s not difficult to imagine what Morrison’s slogans of “resilience and adaption” might mean in the context of, say, climate refugees. For decades, we’ve seen asylum seekers used as targets whenever a weak leader wants to look tough. Global heating will make future governments seem extraordinarily weak – even as a huge new wave of refugees arrives. In the midst of a genuine emergency, with the army already on the streets, the likely conjunction of climate and border politics does not bear thinking about. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"

"Catching a glimpse of the northern lights is apparently the top experience for Britons compiling a “bucket list” of must-do experiences before they die. It’s not surprising, the aurora borealis is a breathtakingly beautiful natural phenomenon, but one that is seldom seen from the British Isles. Nevertheless, on the morning of March 18, the British press were reporting a brilliant display of the northern lights the previous night.  Social media was overflowing with photographic evidence of a display stretching from Scotland to Somerset.  But what had brought the lights to the UK that night? The story begins in the early hours of March 15, when a magnetically active region of the Sun’s surface crackled and erupted, hurling billions of tonnes of the solar atmosphere out into the solar system.  Unless you have a keen interest in our local star, you were probably unaware this had happened.  It didn’t make the news.  But for scientists studying how solar activity affects the space environment surrounding our planet, it was the start of an interesting couple of days. Within hours, the trajectory of this magnetised outpouring of subatomic particles had been modelled.  The cloud, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), was heading in our direction at about one million miles an hour.  It looked like it would deliver a glancing blow to planet Earth some time on March 17, but what would happen if it did?  Space weather forecasters the world over set to work. A likely outcome in this scenario is that the arrival of the CME will trigger a geomagnetic storm.  This occurs when the magnetic field within the CME couples with the Earth’s magnetic field, allowing energy and matter to transfer from the CME to the near-Earth space environment.   The most obvious symptom of a geomagnetic storm is more intense aurora borealis due to the increased inflow of electrically-charged particles to the Earth’s upper atmosphere.  But less attractive side-effects include disruption to hi-tech navigation and communications systems, and the risk of damage to satellites and power grids.  Space weather forecasting, while still in its infancy, is a serious business. By March 16, forecasters at the US Space Weather Prediction Center were predicting the CME would trigger a geomagnetic storm in the days that followed.  Then, at around 4am UK time on March 17, it engulfed NASA’s Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite, the space weather monitor that constantly samples the solar wind upstream of the Earth.   For the first time since it left the Sun, it was possible to measure the orientation of the magnetic field inside the CME.  The orientation of this field, the remnants of the Sun’s magnetic field torn away when the CME was launched, is crucial. It controls the coupling between the CME and the Earth’s own magnetic field.  Although it can take almost any orientation, if the field inside the CME points southwards, it will oppose the Earth’s magnetic field (which, as any compass shows, points north) and these opposite polarity fields interact strongly.  If the CME’s field points northward, the interaction is much weaker. The satellite revealed that the field inside the incoming CME was strong, and as it streamed past the Earth over the course of the morning, it fluctuated between northward and southward orientations, triggering mild geomagnetic disturbances.  Then around noon, the CME’s magnetic field turned southward and stayed southward for the next 12 hours. The strong and sustained coupling poured energy into the magnetosphere, the region of space normally dominated by the Earth’s magnetic field, triggering the strongest and longest geomagnetic storm of the Sun’s current 11-year cycle of activity. Excited aurora-spotters all over the globe weren’t disappointed.  As night fell, the northern lights, and their southern counterpart the aurora australis, lit the skies with dancing displays of green and red light.  Normally concentrated in ring-like ovals that circle our planet’s magnetic poles, the auroral zones expanded equatorward, pushing auroral displays as far south as Kansas and Virginia in the northern hemisphere, and as far north as New Zealand and Australia.  In the UK, those hoping to see the aurora were battling a blanket of mist and fog that settled across much of the country, but many of those with clear a view of the sky reported sightings of the northern lights. Although the biggest geomagnetic storm of the current solar cycle, this St. Patrick’s Day storm was not a once-in-a-lifetime space weather event.  Mid-latitude aurora sightings are rare, but typically occur a handful of times in each 11-year solar cycle.  The current solar maximum is not as intense as the previous peak in 2003 and the frequency and severity of geomagnetic storms has been lower.  Over the coming days, high-tech infrastructure operators will look at how their systems responded to the storm, but the early indications are that there were no significant problems. So if this wasn’t a unique event, why did it make the headlines? One reason why public interest in the northern lights has increased since the previous solar cycle is the advent of social media and mobile technology.  Now anyone can sign up to space weather alerts and have warnings of solar flares, CME eruptions or geomagnetic activity delivered to the phone in near real-time.  Hopeful aurora spotters can find out what others in their country or region are seeing and interact with them easily, most commonly by using the #aurora hashtag. Lancaster University’s AuroraWatchUK service is Britain’s most popular aurora alerting system and uses real-time magnetic field measurements from across the UK to sense the geomagnetic disturbances associated with the northern lights. Social media channels now mean our alerts can reach huge numbers, improving the odds of people seeing the aurora from their back garden.  During the St. Patrick’s Day storm, our social media posts reached more than 200,000 people, with thousands of shares and retweets. For UK-based aurora-spotters, geographic location, weather and light pollution are not ideal.  But if you want to tip the odds slightly in your favour, as well as looking up, you should really think about looking at your phone."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn the first 5½ months of 2019, over 200 scientific papers have been published that cast doubt on the position that anthropogenic CO2 emissions function as the climate’s fundamental control knob…or that otherwise serve to question the efficacy of climate models or the related “consensus” positions commonly endorsed by policymakers and ²²²²mainstream media sources.
These 200+ new papers affirm the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes, emphasizing that climate science is not settled.
More specifically, the papers in this compilation support these four main skeptical positions — categorized here as N(1) – N(4) — which question climate alarm.
N(1) Natural mechanisms play well more than a negligible role (as claimed by the IPCC) in the net changes in the climate system, which includes temperature variations, precipitation patterns, weather events, etc., and the influence of increased CO2 concentrations on climatic changes are less pronounced than currently imagined.
N(2) The warming/sea levels/glacier and sea ice retreat/hurricane and drought intensities…experienced during the modern era are neither unprecedented or remarkable, nor do they fall outside the range of natural variability.
N(3) The computer climate models are neither reliable or consistently accurate, and projections of future climate states are little more than speculation as the uncertainty and error ranges are enormous in a non-linear climate system.
N(4) Current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often ineffective and even harmful to the environment, whereas elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields).

In sharp contrast to the above, the corresponding “consensus” positions that these papers do not support are:
A(1) Close to or over 100% (110%) of the warming since 1950 has been caused by increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, leaving natural attribution at something close to 0%.
RealClimate.org: “The best estimate of the warming due to anthropogenic forcings (ANT) is the orange bar (noting the 1𝛔 uncertainties). Reading off the graph, it is 0.7±0.2ºC (5-95%) with the observed warming 0.65±0.06 (5-95%). The attribution then follows as having a mean of ~110%, with a 5-95% range of 80–130%. This easily justifies the IPCC claims of having a mean near 100%, and a very low likelihood of the attribution being less than 50% (p < 0.0001!).”
A(2) Modern warming, glacier and sea ice recession, sea level rise, drought and hurricane intensities…are all occurring at unprecedentedly high and rapid rates, and the effects are globally synchronous (not just regional)…and thus dangerous consequences to the global biosphere and human civilizations loom in the near future as a consequence of anthropogenic influences.
A(3) The climate models are reliable and accurate, and the scientific understanding of the effects of both natural forcing factors (solar activity, clouds, water vapor, etc.) and CO2 concentration changes on climate is “settled enough“, which means that “the time for debate has ended“.
A(4) The proposed solutions to mitigate the dangerous consequences described in N(4) – namely, wind and solar expansion – are safe, effective, and environmentally-friendly.
To reiterate, these 200+ papers compiled in 2019 thus far support the N(1)-N(4) positions, and they undermine or at least do not support the “consensus” A(1)-A(4) positions.  The papers do not do more than that. In other words, it is not accurate to claim these papers prove that anthropogenic global warming (AGW) positions are invalid, or that AGW claims have now been “debunked”.

"Wheat has been found in a settlement on England’s south coast dating back to 6000BC – 2000 years before farming reached Britain. This finding overturns many cherished archaeological beliefs – or myths – about the era. Though they were once patronised as simplistic hunter-gatherers, it turns out early Britons must have been active traders with the agricultural superpowers of their day in France and the Balkans. It’s time to reassess Mesolithic man. The introduction of farming is usually regarded as a defining historic moment for  human societies. Agriculture creates the conditions for permanent settlement, urbanisation and complex societies.  The positive impact and significance of farming, starting during the period known as the Neolithic, is often contrasted harshly with preceding hunter gatherer cultures. These societies, associated with a period entitled the Mesolithic in Britain (c. 10,000-4000 BC), were relatively mobile and the passage of time has been unforgiving in respect of the survival of their material culture.  This has meant a tendency to presume the peoples of pre-farming Britain were socially simple and geographically isolated. The recent TV show 10,000 BC, which approximates this period, perpetuates the view that life at this time was simply “nasty, brutish and short” with little for people to do other than eat hazelnuts as they waited patiently for wiser peoples from the East to arrive along with the lifestyle benefits of the new technology – farming. Yet Mesolithic societies were as complex as any other. For instance, the earliest built ritual monuments in Britain, usually associated with farming societies, emerged as early as 9000BC near Stonehenge and one structure in Scotland may represent a calendrical device nearly 5000 years older than the first historical calendars.  The first permanent homes and domestication of animals including the dog also occurred before the introduction of farming.  Yet, the use of grain and specifically wheat, remained essentially absent and a key indicator of farming in regions far from south west Asia, where grain was domesticated 12000 years ago.  Consequently, a debate continues as to whether farming was introduced following colonisation by groups already practising agriculture or the new technology was adopted by indigenous hunter gatherer populations. Was farming a movement of people or ideas? Farming is thought to have been introduced to Britain in around 4000BC, perhaps held back by the island’s new isolation following sea level rises at the end of the ice age. The same processes, however, also provide an opportunity to preserve evidence and Britain’s continental shelf has exceptional archaeological potential.  To investigate whether early traces of farming might be preserved in sediments on the sea bed, we gathered a team from the Universities of Birmingham, Bradford and Warwick, together with the Maritime Archaeology Trust. Our results, just published in the journal Science, suggest that grain, rather than indicating the onset of farming, was actually present in Mesolithic settlements in Britain 2000 years before local agriculture. We found evidence of grain after analysing DNA recovered from the uniquely preserved Bouldnor Cliff off the south coast of Britain. In the past ancient DNA has most commonly been obtained from anatomically intact material, such as hair, bones and teeth. It has only recently become clear that DNA can also be retrieved from other materials, including sediments, or SedaDNA – a discovery which has the potential to revolutionise the field.   The sedaDNA sequences at Bouldnor Cliff suggested a mixed habitat of oak forest and herbaceous plants, much as we would expect.  We found traces of animals that could indicate human activity – lots of dogs, for instance, and aurochs (ancestors of the modern cow), as well as deer, grouse and rodents. However, in later sediments, dated to 6000 BC, the results revealed the presence of Einkorn wheat. This was 2000 years earlier than expected and at a time when the cutting edge of agriculture may have lain in the northern Balkans or possibly on the Mediterranean coast of France. What does this mean? In the absence of direct evidence for cultivation, it seems likely that wheat was imported rather than grown locally. If so the implications are considerable.   The presence of wheat suggests the existence of a web of social networks stretching between Mesolithic Britain and the advancing Neolithic front far to the south and east. Far from being simple or isolated, the Mesolithic peoples of southern Britain were probably engaged in trading or gifting exotic foodstuffs across much of continental Europe – it seems absolutely unreasonable to imply that hunter gatherer groups were passive recipients in such an exchange. The results also indicate that key historical events, including the arrival of people in the Americas and agricultural development of Southeast Asia, may also be best explored through investigating the extensive land masses that were lost to the seas as a consequence of global warming.  The results of the work at Bouldnor Cliff now suggests that that such landscapes also retain caches of genetic material that may not be preserved or even represented on land. If so the analysis of marine sediments may be an archaeological “game-changer”."
"The climate debate seems to be as polarised as ever. While joint political pledges offer some hope that climate change no longer has to be a partisan issue, a look at the comments below most articles on global warming says otherwise.  Some put this is down to differing core values, others point to psychological outlooks. However our research highlights an overlooked element – language itself and labelling opinions can frame public debate as polarised and antagonistic. Labels are everywhere in the climate debate, including politicians railing against “flat-earth climate sceptics”, popular science writers calling their critics “climate change alarmists”, and even others who argue that people who use the word denier should themselves be called “global warming Nazis”. These labels are not only offensive, but they also polarise the debate into opposing “us and them” factions. This has important knock-on effects, as the perception of widespread scientific and policy disagreement makes the public less certain climate change is happening and lowers support for climate policies. Categorising and grouping people is a fundamental part of the human cognitive process, helping us understand and assimilate the vast amount of information we face each day. Labels are used in all walks of life, but when it comes to climate change, Susan Lawler’s words could not be truer: “their meaning is opposite to their definitions”. For example, “scepticism” implies seeking the truth, constant questioning and is a fundamental scientific tenet – it famously took Thomas Edison 1,000 attempts to invent the light bulb, refining his approach along the way – but these days it is applied to all sorts of positions and rationales. The use of the term “denier” is also particularly contentious and obstructive – however all labels in the debate can contribute to polarisation, regardless of their origin. Crucially, no labels exist to identify those who are not actively engaged in the climate debate (with the label “lukewarmer” arguably on the sceptical end of the spectrum, rather than identifying the unengaged general populace). The debate is therefore putting people off from engaging in constructive dialogue.  Firstly, labels have pejorative undertones which frame the debate as antagonistic and combative, allowing uncriticised stereotypes to develop. Using labels directly influences the way in which individuals are seen in the eyes of others, rather than attempting to understand how underlying political or ideological viewpoints can contribute to individual opinion formation. Secondly, labels only identify those at polarised extremes, encouraging these groups’ identities to harden and become less open to dialogue. This delays public understanding about climate change by contributing to a “logic schism” across which dialogue and real policy action is less politically viable. Labels foster an environment where preservation of one’s ideology and group identity takes priority over constructive deliberation of knowledge or evidence. Essentially who one is becomes more important that what one is arguing. Thirdly, labels fix opinions and increase their likelihood of transforming into stereotypes. Opinions can evolve over time, but labelling an adversary allows people to ignore their views and can contribute to an opinion becoming increasingly static or unresponsive to new information. Labels such as “denier” or “warmist” reduce the need to delve deeper into arguments and rationales of others in the debate and to write off those expressing an opposing point of view. Fourth, labels fail to capture the complexity of individual opinions and rationales. Academics have come up with increasingly detailed taxonomies of climate thinking, yet they do not capture well the arguments and motivations which together make up an opinion. Labels are also failing to capture geographic complexity, as viewpoints on climate change encompass different meanings in different geographical contexts]. We need new ways of framing and talking about climate change.  We need to remember that science “does not provide us with convenient yes/no answers” and being sceptical is part of the scientific process. Removing these antagonistic labels from the debate could encourage all those engaged in this area to think of it less as a polarised debate and move towards a more nuanced and constructive discussion about specific issues of disagreement. The current academic focus on categorising labels about climate change diverts attention away from much-needed research on underlying rationales. Scientists can play an important role in informing and legitimising new policies, therefore it is vital that climate researchers pay attention to their choices of language."

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate sensitivity and the warming pattern
By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In March 2018, we reported on a paper that derived the sensitivity of our climate system with the best data available. Lewis/Curry (2018) reached the result: 1.3 °C for doubling of the CO2 in the atmosphere with a rise (Transient Climate Response), long-term equilibrium (ECS) of 1.7 °C (see Table 3 of the paper).
The numbers hardly react sensitively to the choice of (larger) time windows, they fluctuate very little, whether one evaluates 1870…2016 or 1930…2016. There has been a whole series of precursor studies also from other authors who also arrived near these quite small values. Also papers examining historical periods (last glacial maximum to pre-industrial) do not contradict these low figures.
So the much more dramatic sensitivity estimates, especially from GCM model considerations (for General Circulation Models), — 1.86 °C for TCR and 3°C for ECS — are not applicable? “It’s not that simple,” some activists insist because then the low sensitivity of the Earth’s climate would not necessitate urgent action to reduce greenhouse gases.
So how can we save the GCMs from empiricism with their worrisome projections? A key argument so far is this: models predict a different spatial distribution of ocean warming than what we observe:

 

Fig.3: The warming patterns derived by models (top) and the observed patterns. Of particular importance is the fact that the CMIP5 models indicate a rather uniform warming of the tropical Pacific as a result of the (mainly man-made) forcing (hence the model-mean), but the observations show a significantly stronger warming of the western tropical Pacific compared to the eastern one.  The images were generated with the KNMI Climate Explorer.
So it could well be, activists say, that the deviation are just a “whim of nature”, an internal variability, and after the end of this rather random episode, the warming becomes much stronger on a global scale on accordance to the models. There is talk of “trajectories” which were and will be possible, and the observations strongly deviate negatively because they are a random one of the possible warming patterns. In short: “What we have observed so far is not the real reality, but it will certainly get much worse. Believe the climate models!”
2 new papers
Here we present two current papers that provide explanation. To start: The observations of the warming rate are correct, the deviating patterns of the climate models are caused by their inadequacies and these patterns will not change.
In Dong et al (2019), the authors show that if the convective regions with many clouds in the western Pacific warm up more strongly than those with hardly any convection in the eastern Pacific, the overall global warming is much less pronounced.
Let’s take a look at the clouds in the tropical Pacific:

Fig. 4: The convection(CAPE Index) over the tropical Pacific. The west-east gradient can be seen clearly. Source.
Convection in the western tropical Pacific leads to an increased heat radiation into space, which means that the warming there can be reduced much more effectively than would be possible with a stronger warming of the eastern Pacific with less convection, see Fig. 4.
The paper finds:
For the west Pacific patch, warming is communicated to the upper troposphere, which warms the whole troposphere across all latitudes, causing a large increase in outgoing radiation at the TOA. Furthermore, the patch of warming locally decreases tropospheric stability, measured here as estimated inversion strength (EIS), but increases EIS remotely over tropical marine low clouds regions, yielding an increase in global low cloud cover (LCC) which enhances the global SW reflection….The results first highlight the radiative response to surface warming in tropical ascent regions as the dominant control of global TOA radiation change both in the past and in the future. …This surface warming pattern yields a strong global outgoing radiative response at TOA that can efficiently damp the surface heating, therefore producing a very negative global feedback.”
It is therefore a clear physical mechanism that leads to the observed stronger warming of the tropical West Pacific leading to lower global sensitivities (= stronger negative global feedback).
The second paper, Seager et al (2019), deals with the same phenomenon and concludes that the observed pattern is not random, but a direct result of forcing. It states:
The main features of observed tropical Pacific climate change over past decades are consistent with a response to rising CO2, according to fundamental atmosphere and ocean physics….However, the strength of the tropical Pacific influence on global climate implies that past and future trends will diverge from those simulated by coupled climate models that, due to their cold tongue bias (ein Streifen kühleren Wassers in Äquatornähe des Ostpazifiks, d.A.), misrepresent the response of the tropical Pacific to rising CO2.”
Climate models have such large deficits in the depiction of events in the tropical Pacific that they are globally incorrect in determining the response to the forcing (see Fig. 3) and systematically overestimate the sensitivity to the forcing (according to Seager et al, and Dong et al).
So will we read anything about this in the media? A possible headline might be: “Climate models calculate the future too hot! Don’t hold your breath.
PlayStation climatology
We eagerly await to see whether the results of these two important studies will even be included in the IPCC’s forthcoming progress report. Here hundreds of pages dealing with model projections would have to be critically revised. One more reason for us to trust empiricism and “PlayStation climatology”.
But what is to become of the “panic” which Fridays for Future wishes to impose on us? Policymaking is hot because the models are too hot. Which scientists have the courage to be responsible and to enlighten FFF and policymaking?

Share this...FacebookTwitterOur German skeptic friend Snowfan here keeps us up to date on the latest ODEN “Ship of Fools” attempt to travel across an Arctic that is supposed to be ice-free by now.
The incentive to cross the Arctic passages in the summer is huge. Doing so would mean at least a week of fame with the media blaring out your name along with grossly hyped headlines of an Arctic ice meltdown due to global warming. One of these years, a ship might get lucky and manage to get through the Northwest Passages.

Image from: Ship-Tracker ODEN  Snowfan
And the pressure to do so is enormous because over the last ten years Arctic ice volume has even rebounded slightly and if that trend continues, as some expect, the global warming alarmist may never get another chance to get through. Last year failed.

Mid-summer Arctic ice volume has grown modestly over the past 13 years, thus casting doubt Arctic is melting further. Chart: Kirye.
The latest “Ship of Fools” episode this year is an attempt by the above mentioned Swedish ice breaker ODEN, which hopes to get through. Unfortunately conditions so far this summer have not been as favorable as they hoped, Snowfan reports:

This year Arctic sea ice in the area of interest on July 14 is (unexpectedly) thicker than it was last year at the same time, and a heck of a lot more than what some climate models and Al Gore projected a bit more than 10 years ago:

In Lancaster Sound and the Barrow Strait (eastern access point to the NW-Passage) sea ice in mid July 2019 is up to 3 meters thick, i.e. 2 meters thicker than in mid-July 2018! Source: DMI Arctic Sea Ice Thickness. Image: here.
Also defying the models is the extent of ice cover for July 9 at the Baffin inlets Regent – Boothia. Over the last 50 years, there’s been little trend change:

The latest on ODEN, according to CruiseMapper, is that it is currently well off course. Snowfan writes:
In the night of July 19, 2019, the Ship of Fools has deviated far from its planned route southeast of Coburg Island and is positioned this morning west of this island. We await with suspense to see if the climate fools will overcome the thick ice on July 20, 2019 and arrive on time in Pond Inlet.”

"Blind and furious in the smoke, we will seek someone or something to blame for our national fire emergency. We will blame our governments for their inertia on climate change, our firefighters for not burning enough or burning too much and those leftists for their flagrant use of green tape. But there isn’t a single culprit or a simple solution to a problem which has been heading towards catastrophe for decades, if not centuries.  We are all culpable, either directly through our land use practices, or indirectly through the land use practices and emissions that our often-thoughtless consumption necessitates. Like many of my ecologist colleagues, I dread the reaction to these events almost as much as the events themselves. The call for clearing country around infrastructure is already being taken up. And maybe this is part of the solution, but how many wounds can we inflict upon our planet and still expect her to maintain our climate, our air and our water? As a Country Fire Authority volunteer, my mother has been working incredibly hard for some time to plan a buffer zone around Mallacoota that balances the locals’ love for their environment with their need for protection. The plan never had a chance to be enacted. Imagine her heartbreak as she fielded 000 calls in the communications room of the Mallacoota fire station as the houses of her friends were burning. At the end of the smoke and drama that my mother is living through, and after a cold champagne in salute of survival, her mind will once again turn to protecting her community. But I worry that that same community may never again be allowed the space to calmly consider its priorities amid the barking for more clearing and more burning to ensure safe communities. The conversation that we need to have to address this deeply complex problem must be given the time and space it demands and it must be approached with open minds. Most importantly we must remain civil to each other, consider carefully each other’s expertise, experience and values and finally avoid the temptation of accepting poorly considered kneejerk reactions that will inevitably fail our planet, our ecosystems and our communities. We need to acknowledge some truths along the way. Climate change is upon us, we must act to reduce its impact. Equally, we need to comprehend that the impact of climate change will be with us now for decades, even if, as a global community, we immediately begin to take meaningful and substantive action. So, where else must we turn our gaze? Talking to my father recently in a break from his firefighting duties at Gipsy Point, his frustration was palpable. We discussed the inadequacy of land management practices that have contributed to the catastrophe which continues to threaten not only his community and the country of his heart, but also the sacred places of our mob. I’ve heard similar voices of frustration raised before from affected communities when I’ve been deployed to fires including at Wye River in 2015 and this year in south-west Victoria. Are our land management practices failing us so regularly despite the efforts of our firefighters to continually improve their fuel management programs? Perhaps what we lack is not a program of land clearing and ramped up fuel reduction burning. Perhaps what we lack, and desperately need, is a vision for our environment, for the species and ecosystems it will support, and how our communities will sit within these environments. Without this vision I fear fuel reduction burning will simply condemn our landscapes to a patchy state of recovery from a series of wildfires and hazard reduction burns. There’s already a blueprint for how we could remake our landscapes, it’s in our country’s bones. It’s in the stories and sophisticated land management practices of our first peoples. We could raise this vision again, a vision which supported the healthy soils and biodiversity that were inherited by European settlers 232 years ago, a landscape which saw fewer destructive bushfires. It would mean we must have an honest and respectful conversation with the knowledge-holders of Aboriginal communities so that we can all understand the lore by which country was managed. Eight years ago, I started a fire program with colleagues on Cape Otway. The ecosystem we were working with was suffering the stark consequences of neglect, following a contact period which had catastrophic consequences for the Indigenous population. Fortunately, we had a relatively good description of what the environment looked like under the custodianship of the Gadabanud from settler diaries, a lightly wooded rolling dune system with a diverse yet open understorey. We knew that fire had a role to play in restoring this landscape, although the complexity of the knowledge was not available to us. We’ve made many mistakes in attempting to recreate this environment, most often through my failure to account for the attributes of certain plants. But, slowly, what we can see emerging in our landscape through the use of fire, is the structure of an open woodland that is rich in plant species once more. It’s less hazardous now because we’ve changed the fuel structure, although it is certainly still flammable. Most importantly though, this process has given us a glimpse at what this ecosystem has been and could be again. I know this approach won’t be an end to catastrophic bushfires in our rapidly changing climate as it’s not the only piece to the puzzle. However, we do know that through respectful and highly skilled use of fire, this country’s first peoples produced food, fibre and medicine for a large population while protecting communities, totems and places of cultural significance. This was achieved by a society whose term of custodianship straddled periods of significant climatic change, making it an adaptive land management approach that we cannot afford to ignore now. Above all else, this was a knowledge system that provided a vision for our landscapes that doesn’t need revival, simply our attention.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe President of the German Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe (Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief, abbreviated BKK) is calling on citizens, government offices and companies to be prepared for widespread blackouts.

In an interview with German national daily Die Welt, BBK President Christoph Unger warned that in the future Germany faced higher probabilities of natural disasters arising from climate change, such as droughts, heat waves and flooding, but said his greatest concern was a power outage.
“After 24 hours without electricity we would have catastrophic conditions,” Unger told Die Welt.
He was particularly concerned about how the power supply could be switched off by a cyber attack. “We have to prepare ourselves for such a scenario and prepare ourselves for it”.
Unstable grid, more frequent interventions
He then told Die Welt that although the German power supply is relatively stable and secure in a global comparison, “the German Federal Grid Agency is having to intervene more and more frequently in order to compensate for grid fluctuations.”

Over the years Germany has added more and more volatile supplies of wind and solar power to feed into its power grid. This has made keeping the frequency within the needed range an increasingly difficult challenge.
“Faced multiple collapses”
For example, the German DWN here reported how in June earlier this year “Europe’s electricity grid faced multiple collapses” and how grid frequency in Germany had “plummeted several times to such an extent that Europe’s entire power grid had been endangered.” Some aluminum mills had to be taken offline.
Keep candles and matches on hand
To prepare for blackouts, Unger told Die Welt that citizens needed to keep “candles and matches” and always have a “batter-powered radio on hand in order to be able to receive news even when the power is out.” He added: “Every household should have a supply of food and drinking water.”
Diesel backup generators to the rescue
Ironically Unger told Die Welt that government offices and companies to ask themselves: “Is there enough diesel fuel on hand to power an emergency back-up generator? Where will the diesel come from when the electricity has not yet returned after two days but the back-up generators have to continue running and diesel can only be pumped from the tank farms with electric pumps?”
Is this the future of the European power supply? Citizens using matches, candles and battery-powered radios to getb through power blackouts and companies and government offices relying on emergency backup diesel generators? Sounds like the 1950s.

Whenever NASA GISS announces how recent global temperatures are much hotter than, for example, 100 years ago, just how statistically reliable are such statements?
Most will agree, based mainly on sundry observations, that today is indeed warmer than it was when surface temperatures began to be recorded back in 1880. But we will never really know by how much.
Surface station datasets full of gigantic voids
When we look at NASA GISS’s site here, we can see how many surface stations have data going back to earlier years. Today we see that 2089 stations are at work in Version 3 unadjusted data.
Yet, when we go back 100 years (to 1919), we see only 997 of these surface stations have Version 3 unadjusted data that is complete:


Source: NASA GISS
Note how the Version 3 unadjusted datasets going back to 1919 are poorly distributed and sorrowfully lacking over Africa, Canada, the Arctic and all across the Southern Hemisphere. Never mind the oceans.
Only a measly 174 surface stations go back to 1880!
And when we look at the number of stations in Version 3 unadjusted data going back to 1880, ONLY 174 stations actually provide us with a complete thermometer dataset:
giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data_v3/ …

As is shown, Version 3 unadjusted data going back to 1880 covers only some parts of the US and Europe. All of Canada and Russia are void of data, and so it is impossible to know what the temperatures there really was.
The same is true for the entire southern hemisphere, let alone the entire globe. The bottom line: There is no way of knowing what the global temperature really was back in the late 19th century and early 20th century.
Japanese expert: data of “no scientific value”
This tells us that global temperature trends since the start of the Industrial Revolutions presented by NASA are fraught with huge uncertainty.
“This is nothing new,” says Japanese climate expert Dr. Mototaka Nakamura in an email to NTZ. “We simply did not have many observing stations in the 1800s and early 1900s. They can produce ‘new data sets’ and claim that they have ‘better data sets’ all day long, but they just can’t make any meaningful difference for periods up to 1980.”
“Not real data”
“These datasets are products of simulation models and data assimilation software, not real data,” Dr. Nakamura added. “This problem has been present in data products produced by all institutions from the beginning – NASA, NOAA, NCEP, ECMWF, UMet, etc.”
“Spatial bias before 1980 cannot be dealt with”
But the data shortcomings get even worse. Dr. Nakamura wrote: “A far more serious issue with calculating ‘the global mean surface temperature trend’ is the acute spatial bias in the observation stations. There is nothing they can do about this either.  No matter what they do with the simulation models and data assimilation programs, this spatial bias before 1980 cannot be dealt with in any meaningful way. Just look at the locations of the observation stations used in GISS products for various years on their page.”
Dr. Nakamura commented earlier here at NTZ: “The global surface mean temperature change data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to the public.”
So how can we be sure about the globe’s temperatures, and thus it’s trends before 1980? You can’t. The real data just aren’t there.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecently NTZ published a post on a study which examined Vietnam tropical cyclone activity.
The study found that for Vietnam “none of the meteorological trends such as frequency, central pressure, wind speed, or storm intensity show any significant increase or decrease over the last four decades.”
But such a trend is not only seen for Vietnam, but virtually the entire Pacific. For example Japanese climate blogger Kirye compiled the stats on Japan typhoon landfalls and here we see they have not risen significantly, and the number of typhoons formed has even fallen:

Number of typhoons formed: jma . Number of typhoons landings in Japan: jma
At his latest Saturday Summary, meteorologist Joe Bastardi shows that this year’s hurricane season is off to a slow start as conditions in the main development zone will remain unfavorable for at least another week.
All of this tells us that global warming alarmists’ warnings of more frequent and intense storms have been completely WRONG so far.

Hurricane frequency falling
Now we look further at the statistics for global tropical storm activity from expert Dr. Ryan Maue here:

Also no trend in major hurricanes since 1992. Image: Dr. Ryan Maue
Looking at total global tropical storms, Dr. Maue’s data show no trend in close to 50 years:

The next time someone claims tropical cyclones have gotten worse and more frequent, you might want to tell them to look at the data and to stop parroting alarmist nonsense spread by the media.

"The 100 million-and-counting views of Chinese air pollution documentary Under the Dome is dramatic, but shouldn’t come as any surprise in a country where discussion of smog is more commonplace than discussion of the weather.   It is of course hard to ignore air pollution in most Chinese cities once you step outside. Where Los Angeles in the 70s was famous for its brown skyline, resulting from nitrogen dioxide and photochemical smog, China is now renowned for its white haze of fine droplets, formed when particulate matter pollution and water vapour combine and grow.  China isn’t alone in having a problem with air pollution, (go visit New Delhi, Mexico City, Lagos or London), but you simply can’t ignore it when the impacts on visibility are so great. Until relatively recently, reliable data on Chinese air pollution was hard to come by, but much changed in 2009 when the US started measuring certain pollutants at their Embassy in Beijing and placing the information online. Soon afterwards there was a rapid expansion in openness and now anyone, anywhere, can see real–time pollution all over China.  Of course much of this data simply confirms what most residents can tell for themselves – there are good and bad days (more often bad) but the availability of quantitative information does now change peoples behaviour. National acceptance of air pollution as a serious problem, via public dissemination and heated debate, followed by mitigation measures and regulation, is a very well-trodden path that virtually all developed nations have gone through during periods of rapid economic expansion. In this respect the pollution problem now in China is systemically no different to the transition periods that led ultimately to the Clean Air Act in the UK, or the introduction of catalytic converters in the US. The sources of pollution in Beijing are many and varied, but they have much in common with examples from history.  Expanding provision of energy at the lowest possible cost has always been a lever in driving economic growth, and growth in China has been no exception. Its fuel of choice has been coal, and coal used in a somewhat uncontrolled and, until recently, poorly regulated manner.   Increases in transportation infrastructure have also characterised expanding economies; in the 21st century this means private cars, lorries, aircraft and shipping. While there has been moderate progress in reducing emissions on a per-car or per-aircraft basis, this is easily overwhelmed if the absolute numbers of each increase.  Agricultural emissions are a final but often overlooked contribution to pollution, and again China is no exception.  Large populations with growing incomes want feeding, and this drives the increased use of fertilisers for productivity. In the atmosphere ammonia from often remote agriculture is a potent contributor to particulate matter found in cities. There are scant few historical examples of major economic expansion without air pollution as a consequence. In the absence of a really game-changing energy technology or fuel or food source, national strategies need to be designed to transition as quickly as possible through the polluted period, where low cost trumps all other considerations.  This is something that can be see as analogous to the demographic transition that also accompanies economic development. It may be uncomfortable to accept, but the UK probably experienced a transition period of more than 100 years of terrible urban air pollution before the problem was brought under any degree of control. It seems unlikely the government or citizens of China will accept a transition anything like that long. Control of air pollutant emissions from coal-fired power stations are effective in other countries, so there is no reason why strong regulation and enforcement can’t achieve the same in China. Fertilisers and agriculture have proved technically and politically difficult to control in Europe and the US, but the science at least is understood.  There is also much that could be learned from the recent mistakes of others. It would be disappointing if the poor performance of modern diesel engines seen in European cities were allowed to play out again in China, or indeed in other less reported on pollution megacities in India, Africa and South America. Although measurement data is sketchy and incomplete it is reasonable to assume that China is now past its “peak pollution” in absolute terms. The rate of implementation of cleaner technologies is on a scale greater than anything ever attempted before. Things are getting better, but the distance still to travel is pretty vast.   Investing domestically in cleaner power, cleaner transport, and cleaner urban living has a cost, but so does the healthcare and reduced productivity that air pollution induces. Cleaner air investments should be viewed as part of the engine of economic development, rather than the brake."

"Anne Karpf writes about the “unthinking ageism” that she thinks has crept into the climate movement. (Ageism must not pollute the climate movement, Journal, 18 January). As an older, active member of Extinction Rebellion and of Doctors for Extinction Rebellion, this absolutely has not been my experience. Retired colleagues and I have regularly shared ideas and actions with young people and learned together how to take the movement forward. An example: at a recent Reforesting Scotland gathering, one of the workshops was on XR and how a group of 70, mainly young, XR activists had responded to a call for volunteers and joined experienced foresters to plant trees at Gameshope, a Borders Forest Trust rewilding project in the south of Scotland. After the workshop a set of instructions for effective tree planting and care was devised and shared. Energy and expertise is a powerful combination.Dr Lesley MorrisonPeebles, Scottish Borders • I admire Greta Thunberg, I fear enough for our children’s future and have supported every move for an arms-free world. My generation have protested since 1936, when I marched with my father against poverty, the Spanish civil war, and the rise of fascism. We were the politically-aware children of the unemployed, grandchildren of first world war casualties, and very well aware of where fascism leads. Not an age of selfish innocence. Like many women of my age, I spent time at Greenham. Protest was part of our lives.

"Glowing fungi with an on-off system synchronised to their daily rhythms? It sounds implausible but it’s true. Some mushrooms evolved the ability to glow in the dark in order to attract insects to spread their spores, according to new research in the journal Current Biology. Fungi are peculiar beings at the best of times. Once believed to be closely related to plants, they are now understood to be more closely related to animals.  Mushrooms, or fungal fruit bodies – the bit you see above ground – may be familiar to us all as food but in the real world mushroom-forming fungi only produce these fruit bodies under special conditions. The main body of the fungus exists largely out of sight as a colony of white thread-like hyphae growing through a food source such as a piece of wood or leaf litter.  In some instances fungal colonies can be old and very large. A colony of Armillaria solidipes in the US is estimated to cover 9.6km2 and be thousands of years old. Fruit bodies are produced to disperse their sexual progeny as spores. Many fungi shoot spores into the air from the underside of the mushrooms, relying on moving air currents to passively distribute the spores over a wide area.  If the fungus is several metres up the trunk of a tree, this method is ideal. But wind speed is often either minimal or non-existent on the underside of logs or at the ground level in a dense forest or even underground, where truffles are produced.  So if air movement isn’t effective how can spores be dispersed far and wide? One option is through aroma. Truffles, the fruiting body of the Ascomycete fungi, use their smell to attract fungivores such as pigs or squirrels who eat them and leave spores behind in their waste. Stinkhorn mushrooms have a foul-smelling slime which attracts flies and other insects. The flies eat the slime and unwittingly spread the spores elsewhere. Light is also attractive to many insects. Indeed a number of fungi bioluminesce, emitting a pale green light. One of the first mycology texts I read as a teenager devoted a whole chapter to “luminosity”, mentioning various fungi including some honey fungi (Armillaria), Jack O’lantern (Omphalotus olearius, pictured at the top of this article) and a number of Mycena. In the new study, a team of Brazilian and American researchers looked at the pale green light emission from fungi, to assess whether it attracted insects and whether brighter light conferred a selective advantage for spore dispersal. The researchers looked at Neonothopanus gardneri, a particularly intense emitter found at the base of coconut palms in Brazil. It was previously thought their light was emitted continuously as a byproduct of some other round-the-clock metabolic process.  However, the study found the fungus glows only at night, and so is energy efficient; during daytime the light emission would be too faint to be visible. In any case, the best conditions for spore germination in canopy forests are found at night, when it is more humid. If the mushrooms glow only at night then the bioluminescence must serve some purpose. Camera observations showed the glowing fruit bodies became infested by rove beetles. But these beetles may have been attracted by something else – smell, perhaps.  To specifically test the glowing effect, experimental “mushrooms” made from clear acrylic resin were built. They were equipped with a light emitting diode which operated at a similar wavelength to the mushrooms. To the beetles, the light would have looked the same.  The glowing plastic mushrooms attracted these and various other insects sensitive to green light, while fewer were attracted to non-illuminated controls. From this we can conclude that for these fungi there is a selective advantage to glowing in the dark."
"Climate change will have major effects on the ecology and distribution of many animal species. Now new research suggests that rabbits will be particularly hard hit as climatic changes alter their habitat over the coming decades. Rabbits, hares and pikas could become this century’s new climate migrants – with up to two-thirds of species forced to relocate. There are almost certainly going to be extinctions among some of the more sensitive and less adaptable species.   Rabbits and their relatives hares (referred to in North America as jackrabbits) and the lesser known pikas belong to a group of mammals known as lagomorphs – of which there are 87 species worldwide.  Lagomorphs are particularly interesting to ecologists – and those of my colleagues who work in Global Food Security – as they are a major human food resource, valued game species, agricultural pests, model lab animals and key elements in food webs.  You can find rabbits, hares and pikas almost everywhere, across a huge range of environmental conditions. They’re native to all continents except Antarctica, found from the equator to the Arctic, and from sea level to the very top of the Himalayas.  A quarter of lagomorphs are already listed as threatened, and 13 species are endangered or critically endangered. We were particularly interested in how predicted changes in climate would affect this already highly vulnerable group. In our study, colleagues from Queen’s University Belfast and I collated all known records of lagomorph species worldwide. Environmental conditions such as temperature or rainfall were correlated with the sites where each species occurred to establish the suitable habitat within which each can persist. Widely accepted climate models of projected future conditions were then used to extrapolate how suitable habitat would change. The results, published in the open access scientific journal PLOS ONE suggest that two-thirds of all lagomorph species will be affected. Rabbits, hares and jackrabbits are likely to shift towards the poles with little change in the total size of their range – the geographical area in which the species can be found.  Pikas meanwhile, are likely to shift to ever higher altitudes as the lower slopes warm up leading to huge range declines. This is likely to lead to the extinction of some such as Kozlov’s Pika Ochotona koslowi, a mysterious species unique to China.  Of course the animals won’t just remain still while the climate changes around them – moving towards the poles or to higher ground is a standard strategy to track shifts in suitable habitat. Rabbits, hares and jackrabbits can move long distances and can potentially move to cooler conditions without losing too much of their range; the effects of such shifts on ecosystems are largely unknown but likely to cause significant disruption.  The smaller and less bouncy pikas won’t be so lucky. Pikas inhabit generally cooler conditions in the high mountains of the Himalayas or Rockies and will be driven further upwards until no suitable habitat remains. My colleague Neil Reid, a conservation biologist and lagomorph expert at Queen’s, points out that “they will likely be pushed off the top of the mountains, literally, with total extinction the most probable outcome”. Species traits can be useful indicators of potential responses to climate change, yet have rarely been linked to changes in distributions. Smaller-bodied species were more likely to exhibit range contractions and shifts to higher ground, but species capable of having large numbers of offspring were more likely to shift towards the poles.   The effect of climate change on lagomorphs is predicted to be so substantial that almost a third of the Earth’s land area (31.5 million km2) will lose at least one species by 2100. It is predicted that northern China will lose up to ten species, whereas Montana and North Dakota in North America are likely to gain up to five species – climate rabbit refugees perhaps, fleeing the ever-warming southern states and Mexico. Generally, species on islands and mountains will be the hardest hit by changing temperatures.  However predictive models are simplified versions of reality and as such are rough approximations of what seems likely to happen. Those we used did not account for the complexity of ecological systems, such as how species – like plants or predators – interact with lagomorphs.  Moreover, small burrowing species such as the Pygmy rabbit Brachylagus idahoensis may be able to shelter from the effects of climate change, while larger species like the European hare Lepus europaeus may have to adapt to mitigate the effects of warming temperatures – for example in the way that the Antelope jackrabbit Lepus alleni uses its long ears to shed excess heat.  So we have to be careful in the interpretation of our models – but the consistency of the results across all lagomorph species does not paint a good picture of the future for the group. Conservation strategies, such as assisted migration – where humans deliberately move species to areas of more suitable conditions, pre-empting future changes – may be one of the few options to save highly range-restricted species, even if it is highly controversial.  Collection of more species records, particularly for already rare species, as well as targeting data-deficient geographic regions (such as Russia) will be vital in increasing our knowledge of the most threatened lagomorphs and informing future conservation management."
"The amount of material consumed by humanity has passed 100bn tonnes every year, a report has revealed, but the proportion being recycled is falling. The climate and wildlife emergencies are driven by the unsustainable extraction of fossil fuels, metals, building materials and trees. The report’s authors warn that treating the world’s resources as limitless is leading towards global disaster. The materials used by the global economy have quadrupled since 1970, far faster than the population, which has doubled. In the last two years, consumption has jumped by more than 8% but the reuse of resources has fallen from 9.1% to 8.6%. The report, by the Circle Economy thinktank, was launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos. It shows that, on average, every person on Earth uses more than 13 tonnes of materials per year. But the report also found that some nations are making steps towards circular economies in which renewable energy underpins systems where waste and pollution are reduced to zero. “We risk global disaster if we continue to treat the world’s resources as if they are limitless,” said Harald Friedl, the chief executive of Circle Economy. “Governments must urgently adopt circular economy solutions if we want to achieve a high quality of life for close to 10bn people by mid-century without destabilising critical planetary processes.” Marc de Wit, the report’s lead author, said: “We are still fuelling our growth in population and affluence by the extraction of virgin materials. We can’t do this indefinitely – our hunger for virgin material needs to be halted.” The report found that 100.6bn tonnes of materials were consumed in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. Half of the total is sand, clay, gravel and cement used for building, along with the other minerals quarried to produce fertiliser. Coal, oil and gas make up 15% and metal ores 10%. The final quarter are the plants and trees used for food and fuel. The lion’s share of the materials – 40% – is turned into housing. Other major categories include food, transport, healthcare, communications, and consumer goods such as clothes and furniture. Almost a third of the annual materials remain in use after a year, such as buildings and vehicles. But 15% is emitted into the atmosphere as climate-heating gases and nearly a quarter is discarded into the environment, such as plastic in waterways and oceans. A third of the materials is treated as waste, mostly going to landfill and mining spoil heaps. Just 8.6% is recycled. “This report sparks an alarm for all governments,” said Carolina Schmidt, Chile’s environment minister. “We need to deploy all the policies to really catalyse this transformation [to a circular economy].” Cristianne Close of the conservation group WWF said: “The circular economy provides a framework for reducing our impacts, protecting ecosystems and living within the means of one planet.” The report said increasing recycling can make economies more competitive, improve living conditions and help to meet emissions targets and avoid deforestation. It reported that 13 European countries have adopted circular economy roadmaps, including France, Germany and Spain, and that Colombia became the first Latin American country to launch a similar policy in 2019. China’s ban on waste imports aims to encourage domestic recycling, the report said, but has also stimulated the development of circular economy strategies in Australia and other countries which previously exported their waste to China. Janez Potočnik, a former European environment commissioner and the co-chair of the UN Environment Programme international resource panel, said the world needed to learn to do more with less and replace ownership with sharing, as is increasingly being seen with cars."
"Last month, as I travelled to see family for a very mild Christmas in the UK, I thought about the bushfires simultaneously raging across Australia. They are just one example from a long series of extreme weather events in 2019, including cyclones in India and Bangladesh that displaced more than three million people, Cyclone Idai, which killed more than 1,000 people in southern Africa, floods that displaced tens of thousands of people in Iran, and entire townships laid to waste by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas. The year ended with reports of record rates of Arctic ice melt that, through positive feedback effects, are likely to intensify climate heating and impact the future of humanity. In the face of global catastrophe, it’s hard not to feel daunted. What can I, an individual, do to address such a crisis? Understanding that my daily actions are partly responsible for climate change, I feel a gnawing sense of sense of individual guilt.  It’s perhaps not surprising that I feel like this. I was a child of the 1980s and a teenager in the 90s: my formative years were during something like the most individualistic age in history. While I learned times tables at primary school, Margaret Thatcher was telling the nation there was no such thing as society. During my teenage years, product advertising and globalisation brought a new age of hyper-consumerism, as we were bombarded with education programmes to build self-esteem and TV shows such as Big Brother, The X Factor and The Apprentice, which all glorified self-aggrandisement in subtly different ways. Developing human minds are like sponges and ours were submerged in ever more individualistic language. Phrases such as “unique”, “personal”, “self”, “me” and “mine” were used with increasing frequency in lyrics, TV shows and books. This immersion took its toll: analysis of data from almost 80 countries  shows how the majority have shown marked increases in individualistic attitudes over recent decades. Having a strong sense of self can be useful, but excessive individualism has its costs. The more we see ourselves as discrete entities, the more likely we are to feel isolated and lonely and to show “selfish” behaviours. As a consequence, rates of anxiety and depression are rising across the world, while the climate and biodiversity crises deepen ever further. Yet times are changing. In the last decade, we may have seen individualism peak. Scientific discoveries have revealed how the perception of a distinct self is an illusion. Our bodies are made from materials that were once parts of countless other organisms, from ancient plants to dinosaurs. Most of our 37tn cells are directed by a genetic code that is a shared heritage not just of humanity but all of life on Earth. You might think your life experiences define you, but the neural networks in your brain that encode these are changing constantly – you are not even the same person you were when you started reading this article. And the new science of social networks shows how we are linked together so closely that ideas, behaviours and preferences flow between us in a way that makes it unclear where one mind ends and another begins. And people are finding new value in being part of groups, whether it is through activism (Extinction Rebellion, youth strikes, political party memberships) or leisure activities (book clubs, festivals, park runs). New research shows that when people have a broader sense of group identity (for example viewing themselves as global citizens, rather than embracing nationalism), they tend to be more likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviours, such as reducing their carbon emissions, buying sustainably and volunteering. A new age of collectivism seems to be dawning – and not a moment too soon. So what can be done to make people truly embrace being part of a group? In answering this question, it is worth bearing in mind that the evolutionary history of our brains means we are susceptible to certain biases. When populations face shocks such as environmental catastrophe or social unrest, they are more likely to strengthen bonds between their “in-group” members, while caring less about those outside of the group. This is a defence mechanism to help groups pull together and overcome hardship. Social research has shown that it operates at the country level, too – countries facing crises are more likely to show prejudice towards outsiders and elect authoritarian leaders. Environmental catastrophes are only expected to worsen under climate change, which means nationalism could grow purely due to this evolutionary bias. Yet, is this a sensible response? In 2020, we live in a highly globalised world, with cross-border flows of money and people, as well as environmental impacts such as the climate crisis and air pollution. If we bond together within nations but with less regard for the welfare of others beyond those borders, we will end up fouling the global commons, ultimately to our own detriment. Yet there is hope. New research shows how we can escape individualism. Outdoor community activities increase both our psychological connectedness to others and to the natural world. Escape cities to go for a walk with family or friends, or volunteer in a garden or park near you as often as you can. Meditation is proven to alter neural networks in the brain and reduce self-centredness, and solitary activities such as reading and playing computer games have been shown to increase empathy with others. We can all do something small to be part of something bigger and help solve our global problems. Let’s all get on with it. • Tom Oliver is professor of ecology at the University of Reading, and author of The Self Delusion, which will be published on 23 January."
"Last week it was reported that rising ocean temperatures and changing sea currents are causing leatherback turtles’ journeys from nesting to feeding grounds to double in length. After laying their eggs on some beaches, the turtles must move to cooler waters to feed, but higher temperatures mean some are having to swim further to reach suitable areas, according to France’s Hubert Curien Institute.  Pikas, small mammals native to North America, are increasingly moving off high-alpine boulder piles to adjacent forests. A study in the Journal of Mammology notes that the cool, moist, rocky habitat they require is getting hotter, drier, and less snowy. Because they live high in the mountains, when their terrain becomes inhabitable, there’s nowhere left to go. Warmer temperatures are causing monarch butterflies’ southern migrations to be delayed by up to six months. Columbia University’s Earth Institute explains that this is causing migrations to fall out of sync with the bloom time of the nectar-producing plants the monarchs rely on for food, contributing to the 95% decrease in their numbers in the last two decades. Puffins in the Gulf of Maine normally eat white hake and herring, but warmer oceans are causing these fish to move north. The puffins are trying to feed their young butterfish instead, but they are unable to swallow them. Over the past 20 years, conservationists calculate that fledgling survival rates have declined by 2.5% a year. The Scottish Association for Marine Science says that the melting of sea ice is affecting the wider food chain, as zooplankton feed on the algae growing on sea ice. These microscopic creatures are eaten by fish and shrimps, which are eaten by seals, ultimately forming the basis of 70% of polar bears’ diet, according to one science journal."
"Australian company bosses are becoming increasingly concerned about the climate crisis and are expecting tough economic times in the year ahead, a new survey shows. Global accounting firm PwC’s annual survey of CEOs shows bosses are preparing to cut jobs and don’t think Australian business and government is doing enough to deal with global heating – a dismal picture that is set to get worse once the effects of the past month’s deadly bushfires take hold.  Economists expect the damage to industries including tourism, agriculture and retail from the unprecedented fires to carve up to 0.2 percentage points from Australia’s already anaemic growth figures. Experts say the damage to the tourism sector is likely to top $1bn, and there is little likelihood that sales figures will show that Christmas revived a retail sector struggling to hold on as consumers who haven’t enjoyed a pay rise for years keep their wallets firmly shut. In September and October, before the bushfires peaked, PwC surveyed 1,600 CEOs around the world, including 117 Australians. Even then, 65% of Australian bosses said climate change was a major threat, up from 60% last year and 43% a decade ago. “The fact that it’s actually now in the top 10 of our CEO survey, not only in Australia but in many other markets, says this is something that’s not going away and it’s a genuine threat to our economy and our communities,” PwC Australia’s head of energy, utilities and resources, Mark Coughlin, said. “We actually just have to get on with it.” The proportion of Australian CEOs expecting global economic output, or gross domestic product, to drop has skyrocketed from 7% two years ago to 59% this year. With confidence that customers will spend thin on the ground, a whopping 77% are planning “operational efficiencies” – corporate code for cuts. This includes a quarter of CEOs who plan to cut jobs, a potential further blow to an economy where the unemployment rate remains stuck above 5%. Economists are pessimistic about the chances of an improvement any time soon, with Deloitte Access Economics predicting GDP growth will remain stuck at 2% for the rest of the financial year – well short of the 2.75% predicted by the Morrison government at the last federal budget and less even than the 2.25% estimate delivered in December. ANZ estimates the bushfires will carve o.1% to 0.2% off GDP growth, but the bank’s chief economist, David Plank, said the full effect wouldn’t be visible until GDP figures for March were released in June. The bushfires are unusual because natural disasters usually have little effect on GDP, which Plank said was a “pretty flawed way of measuring these things”, as it didn’t take into account the losses of forests and animals or people’s homes and businesses. “We basically said it’ll be a larger impact given the sheer size of the event and the global news around it,” he said. He said ANZ credit card data indicated a “quite weak” Christmas shopping season – further bad news for a retail sector rocked by a series of failures, including the collapse last week of fashion chain Jeanswest. Some of the weakness may be due to the rising popularity of Black Friday moving sales forward into November, and some may be due to smoke haze, Plank said. “It’s very hard to disentangle – I don’t think we’ll ever be able to,” he said. Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director Simon Westaway said the bushfires would cost his sector “at least $1bn through the firestorms and down-the-line impacts”. He said there had been an immediate “significant drop in domestic travel to many Australian regions, fire affected or not”. “It has remained hard to get a full estimate but based on the collective insights coming from the major tourism and accomodation bodies it will rise above $1bn, not fully factoring in retail and hospitality spend losses.” The fires also hit farmers hard, forcing them to shoot thousands of injured animals and disrupting the dairy industry in southern NSW. Bega chairman Max Roberts said milk was now getting off dairy farms but getting to and from the company’s processing plant remained difficult because the road south to Victoria remained cut. Trucks bringing supplies in and products out of the factory were detouring through Canberra, he said. “With our current rules on log books it makes a one-day trip into a two-day trip,” he said. “There’s certainly a cost associated with that but it’s not insurmountable.” He said the fires cut all three main highways in the area at the same time – an “unusual” event, even though in the past two out of three have been simultaneously blocked by floods. “It’s an event that will change how we do things,” he said. “I think hopefully the whole debate about how we handle climate will get some sensibility about it.” However, PwC’s survey shows that just 12% of Australian bosses think government and business are working together effectively to deal with climate change risks, a figure that has barely moved in five years. “The public discourse in Australia has been very challenging … around energy, climate, etcetera,” Coughlin said. “That really doesn’t help. When I go to meetings around the globe, particularly in western Europe, climate sciences, risks, opportunities etc has been part of the dialogue for a decade or more. “They’re talking much more about net zero [carbon emissions] where we’re debating the impacts or otherwise.”"

Ice Age now here reported, “snow and record low temperatures” in Poland — in July — earlier this week.
According to Polish sources, there was fresh snow on the highest peaks of the Tatras and the temperature fell below zero (-0.2 degrees).
June mean temperatures see no rise in Canada, Iceland
While Europe saw some record heat in June, temperatures have since fallen considerably, with many regions reporting well-below normal readings.
Elsewhere over the northern hemisphere June temperature trends show a decline over the past two decades or more.

Taken as a whole, 9 temperature stations scattered across Canada show June mean temperatures have not increased in 25 years. Chart: Kirye. Data: http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/…
Two of three stations in Iceland also show no warming. This is hardly what one would expect to find when scrutinizing behind the alarmist headlines and claims coming from global warming media and activists.

When it’s hot, the activists are so loud. But when cold offsets it all, then suddenly you can hear pins dropping.
As the saying goes regarding climate science: When it’s warm and stormy, it’s climate. But when it’s cool and calm, it’s just weather.

"In his discussion of Flybe and HS2 (Growth versus green? The short-term view always prevails, Journal, 16 January), Larry Elliott seems to be tying himself in knots. On the one hand, he rightly claims that it is the better-off who fly intercity in the UK, while on the other hand he suggests that allowing Flybe to go under would hack off a lot of voters, many of whom voted Tory for the first time in December. Frankly, I think it is more likely than not that intercity fliers and the reluctant Tories of the now-collapsed red wall form two mutually exclusive groups. The bottom line is that both bailing out Flybe and pushing through HS2 are appalling options from an environmental perspective. The green way forward is simple and straightforward. Leave Flybe to sink or swim, keep air passenger duty as it is (or preferably hike it further), and scrap HS2. The £100bn or so saved should be diverted to developing railways – and reopening some of those lost to Beeching’s axe – in those parts of the country where improved transport links are needed most.Bill McGuireEmeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards, University College London  • Larry Elliott’s article is a worrying warning that politicians are very unlikely to do anything to head off the developing climate catastrophe. Perhaps it is time to ditch the facile terminology – green initiatives, wildlife protection, special scientific interest – which give the impression that these considerations are somehow external to our own interests. Perhaps if we started talking about the biosphere of which we are all a part as “the life support system” and the choices politicians make as being between the protection of life and the destruction of life, then the consequences of these choices might be easier for us to grasp.Isabella StoneSheffield  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Hat-tip: Snowfan in Germany
The reason is the unusual cold that has swept across a large swath of the continent and which has sent temperatures plummeting to near freezing.

Yesterday morning ground frost hit parts of Belgium, Holland, Germany and the Czech Republic, as the above chart shows. Unsurprisingly, the media have been curiously silent about it.
Record Dutch July low
It has also been reported that a new all-time July low had been recorded in the Netherlands, according to one source here. The online NL Times here reported, “residents of Eastern Netherlands woke up to a frost covered landscape on Thursday” and that in Twente, “a minimum of -1.6 degrees Celsius was measured – a record low for July, according to Weerplaza.”
The cold has now gripped northern Europe for about a week now, as the mornings of July 3 and 4 saw “at times widespread surface frost in Germany” as well.

The cold is not expected to subside anytime soon. A recent GFS forecast shows it will likely persist across Northern Europe and most of northern Russia for another 10 days.
So don’t expect to see any global warming ambulance chasers to be found there. They were last sighted in Alaska, and may soon be headed to Iran or the “stans”.

"Imagine never again receiving an energy bill. Instead, you could pay a flat fee for “comfort”, “cleanliness” or “home entertainment” alongside a premium for more energy-demanding TVs, kettles or fridge-freezers. This isn’t the stuff of science fiction – it’s emerging right now. Recent changes in technology and regulation are enabling the development of new ways to provide electricity and gas.  The energy economy is changing fast. By the 2030s, the power sector will have to be substantially decarbonised if the UK is to meet its emissions targets. This means a lot more renewables, which in turn means more intermittent and variable electricity supply.  Related technological developments, for example in solar and storage, and wider developments in IT and data including the roll-out of smart meters, have the potential to transform contemporary systems of provision.   For instance, the capacity to pool and aggregate data about patterns of energy demand may enable the emergence of new business models in which “energy” suppliers also have a role in providing or managing appliances and the forms of heating, lighting, cooling, computing and entertainment that these enable.  Developments such as these call the very identity of “the provider” into question: as small-scale wind and solar power becomes more common, consumers are increasingly also producers. Even when this is not the case, there are various new “non-traditional” market entrants some of whom have new non-traditional ambitions like those of ensuring that energy is more affordable, especially for those on low incomes or the elderly.   An example is the growing interest of public bodies (local authorities, housing associations and the like) in energy generation and supply, with the aim of delivering greater affordability and fairness to consumers. Alternatively, these offerings may be provided to local communities or communities of interest and may bundle basic energy services with additional offerings such as energy efficiency measures. In effect energy supply is being repackaged as a form of service provision. We all pay energy bills and we understand that energy is delivered through wires and pipes into boilers, TVs, kettles and so forth.  However, it is not the energy, as such, that consumers’ value.   In paying energy bills, people are really paying for the services that energy makes possible: for thermal comfort, for entertainment or for a cooked meal. In other words, it is the ability to watch a favourite TV soap (while consuming a favourite TV dinner) and the cosiness of the home that really matters. This isn’t just an academic distinction. Whether energy is seen as a commodity or a service is fast becoming a crucial factor in how the sector is organised and regulated. The rhetoric of consumer “empowerment” in the energy market and the ambition to provide people with more knowledge about their energy use only makes sense if we think of it as a uniform commodity.  By contrast, if we see energy as being embedded in a huge variety of different practices – that is, if we think of energy as something that is in a sense part of writing emails, watching TV, or making dinner – then demand reduction is not about energy as such, it is about changing the details of daily life.  Recognising these differences helps understand otherwise puzzling features like why more and better information about energy use doesn’t automatically translate into energy-saving actions. The commodity-service distinction is also useful in thinking about how relationships between consumers and providers might be configured now and in the future. If we think of energy not as a commodity but as something that is incorporated in the provision of services we should also think of energy providers as service providers. We are already seeing the emergence of Energy Service Companies (ESCos) which guarantee a fixed energy bill as long as the company can install efficiency measures in your home or office. Other providers offer multi-utility tariffs, bundling together rent, water and energy into a single bill.   At the moment it is unclear whether these novel forms of “energy-plus” provision are forerunners of arrangements that are set to become the norm, of if they will remain niche solutions for a few. Whatever else, these moments of flux remind us that energy and energy services are never set in stone."

By Snowfan
The strength of particle radiation of a solar storm is given as a three-hour value in the Kp index, the daily value is called the A index.
The following table shows the development of hurricane DORIAN compared to solar activity in the daily values of the A index.
Source: https://nextgrandminimum.com/
The parallels are astonishing: It would seem DORIAN was “fed” by the strength of the solar storm in its development, especially in its peak around September 1, 2019.
It’s well known, of course: correlation isn’t causation.
So the question arises: How could solar storms influence earthly hurricanes? And the question certainly cannot be vice versa.
A commentator made the following interesting comments on hurricane activity in 2017 (including IRMA), and 2018 in the North Atlantic and a connection of solar activity with regard to changes in the jet stream:
Interesting sequence of events here; July 9/10 we had a sharp ‘Kp’ impact after a prolonged period of quiet.
On July 11th, TS Barry had been activated, by the end of the week we had the Jet Stream phenomenon, first over the pacific then over US states.
The theory is that a burst of ‘Kp’ activity expands upper atmosphere and triggers profile changes which can activate or exacerbate potential or base line activity lower down in the atmosphere.
Science in this area is in its infancy; however a discussion of what is involved can be seen at
https://howtheatmosphereworks.wordpress.com/about/solar-activity-and-surface-climate/storm-analysis/
This is also an impressive parallel development of hurricane “IRMA” (Cat. 5) and the solar storm in September 2017:

IRMA– Recorded peak intensity and (below) overall progress

 
The influence of solar activity on the Earth’s weather, e.g. sudden stratospheric warming in the winter over the Arctic with violent “Arctic outbreaks” in the mid-latitudes, is already well known.
Why shouldn’t solar activity also have a significant influence on the formation and development of cyclones through solar storms over the stratosphere and the jet stream?
An important and meaningful field of research, in my opinion…, and far more meaningful than the demonization of the life-giving CO2 in our atmosphere, with the aim of pulling money out of people’s pockets with a CO2 tax….
By the way: The solar activity also influences ENSO – NASA sees the globally cooling La Niña from November 2019 on…

The current NASA-ENSO forecast from September 2019 shows globally cooling Lan Niña conditions with SSTA of at least -0.5 K and colder in the relevant Nino area 3.4 as early as October/November 2019.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo University of Turku (Finland) physicists have determined a) the climate’s sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 is 0.24°C, b) the human contribution to the warming of the past century is only about 0.01°C, c) the IPCC and climate modeling dramatically overestimate CO2’s climate impact, and d) variations in low cloud cover control the climate.

Cloud cover changes “explain the linear trend of global temperature” since the 1980s
In a new paper, O.M. Povrovsky of the Russian State Hydrometeorological University analyzes satellite-observed cloud cover changes during 1983-2009 and their relation to global temperature change.
Povrovsky found global and regional cloudiness decreased between 2-6% during these decades, and “the correlation coefficient between the global cloud series on the one hand and the global air and ocean surface temperature series on the other hand reaches values (–0.84) — (–0.86).”
Consequently, Povrovsky (2019) concluded changes in cloud cover explain both the increasing global temperature during 1984-2009, but even the interannual variability.

Anthropogenic climate change isn’t supported by experimental evidence
Dr. Jyrki Kauppinen was an expert reviewer for the IPPC’s last climate report (AR5, 2013).
In a comment to the IPCC overseers, Kauppinen strongly suggested the “experimental evidence for the very large sensitivity [to anthropogenic CO2 forcing] presented in the report” is missing (Kauppinen and Malmi, 2019).
In response, the IPCC overseers claimed experimental evidence could be found in the report’s Technical Summary.

//-->




But the Technical Summary merely contained references to computer models and non-validated assumptions. Kauppinen writes:
“We do not consider computational results as experimental evidence. Especially the results obtained by climate models are questionable because the results are conflicting with each other.”
Upon examination of satellite data and cloud cover changes, Dr. Kauppinen concluded the IPCC’s claims of high climate sensitivity to CO2 forcing (2 to 5°C) are about ten times too high, and “the models fail to derive the influences of low cloud cover fraction on the global temperature.”
Evidence for natural climate change supported by satellite observations
When low cloud cover data from satellite observations are considered, a very clear correlation emerges.

As low cloud cover decreases, more solar radiation can be absorbed by the oceans rather than reflected back to space. Thus, decadal-scale decreases in low cloud cover elicit warming.
When cloud cover increases, cooling ensues.
In this manner, Kauppien and Malmi (2019) find “low clouds practically control the global temperature,” which leaves “no room for the contribution of greenhouse gases i.e. anthropogenic forcing.”
In fact, Kauppinen and Malmi boldly conclude that the total warming contribution from anthropogenic CO2 emissions reached only 0.o1°C during the last 100 years, which means “anthropogenic climate change does not exist in practice.”

Kauppinen and Malmi, 2019
No experimental evidence for the
significant anthropogenic climate change
“The IPCC climate sensitivity is about one order of magnitude too high, because a strong negative feedback of the clouds is missing in climate models. If we pay attention to the fact that only a small part of the increased CO2 concentration is anthropogenic, we have to recognize that the anthropogenic climate change does not exist in practice. The major part of the extra CO2 is emitted from oceans [6], according to Henry‘s law. The low clouds practically control the global average temperature. During the last hundred years the temperature is increased about 0.1°C because of CO2. The human contribution was about 0.01°C.”
“We have proven that the GCM-models used in IPCC report AR5 cannot compute correctly the natural component included in the observed global temperature. The reason is that the models fail to derive the influences of low cloud cover fraction on the global temperature. A too small natural component results in a too large portion for the contribution of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. That is why IPCC represents the climate sensitivity more than one order of magnitude larger than our sensitivity 0.24°C. Because the anthropogenic portion in the increased CO2 is less than 10 %, we have practically no anthropogenic climate change. The low clouds control mainly the global temperature.”

"It is unlawful for governments to return people to countries where their lives might be threatened by the climate crisis, a landmark ruling by the United Nations human rights committee has found. The judgment – which is the first of its kind – represents a legal “tipping point” and a moment that “opens the doorway” to future protection claims for people whose lives and wellbeing have been threatened due to global heating, experts say. Tens of millions of people are expected to be displaced by global heating in the next decade. The judgment relates to the case of Ioane Teitiota, a man from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, which is considered one of the countries most threatened by rising sea levels. He applied for protection in New Zealand in 2013, claiming his and his family’s lives were at risk. The committee heard evidence of overcrowding on the island of South Tarawa, where Teitiota lived, saying that the population there had increased from 1,641 in 1947 to 50,000 in 2010 due to sea level rising leading to other islands becoming uninhabitable, which had led to violence and social tensions. He also spoke of the lack of fresh water and difficulty growing crops due to salinity of the water table causing serious health issues for his family. He said that as Kiribati was predicted to be uninhabitable in 10 to 15 years, his life was endangered by remaining there. The New Zealand courts rejected Teitiota’s claim for protection. The UN human rights committee upheld New Zealand’s decision on the grounds that while “sea level rise is likely to render the republic of Kiribati uninhabitable … the timeframe of 10 to 15 years, as suggested by [Teitiota], could allow for intervening acts by the republic of Kiribati, with the assistance of the international community, to take affirmative measures to protect and, where necessary, relocate its population”. However experts say the committee’s ruling opens the way for other claims based on the threat to life posed by the climate crisis. The committee ruled that “the effects of climate change in receiving states may expose individuals to a violation of their rights … thereby triggering the non-refoulement obligations of sending states”. “On a personal level for Ioane and his family it is bad news, because obviously it’s decided that his claim that his right to life was threatened in Kiribati wasn’t strong enough,” said Kate Schuetze, Pacific researcher for Amnesty International. “But they said it wasn’t strong enough based on his personal circumstances and the evidence they put before the court and then they made some very strong statements clarifying the roles and responsibilities of states to say … there would be a trigger of international responsibility for other governments not to return people to places where their life is at risk because of climate-induced changes.” While the judgment is not formally binding on countries, it points to legal obligations that countries have under international law. “What’s really important here, and why it’s quite a landmark case, is that the committee recognised that without robust action on climate at some point in the future it could well be that governments will, under international human rights law, be prohibited from sending people to places where their life is at risk or where they would face inhuman or degrading treatment,” said Prof Jane McAdam, director of the Kaldor centre for international refugee law at the University of New South Wales. “Even though in this particular case there was no violation found, it effectively put governments on notice. “There have been cases brought in Australia and New Zealand since the mid-1990s about environmental harm and climate change and to date they’ve all been unsuccessful ... But now we’ve got a very clear, legal authoritative statement now that it’s almost like: watch this space.” Schuetze said there were roughly a dozen cases in the New Zealand court system similar to Teitiota’s, with people, mostly from Tuvalu and Kiribati, claiming the impacts of the climate crisis affected their right to life. “The Pacific Islands will be the canary in the coalmines for climate-induced migrants,” said Schuetze. “The message in this case is clear: Pacific Island states don’t need to be underwater before triggering those human rights obligations … I think we will see those cases start to emerge.” Two of the 18 members of the committee issued dissenting opinions on the case, saying they did not agree with the conclusion that New Zealand was justified in removing Teitiota to Kiribati, with one writing that just because “deaths are not occurring with regularity on account of the conditions … it should not mean that the threshold had been reached”. “The fact that this [difficulty growing crops and accessing safe drinking water] is a reality for many others in the country, does not make it any more dignified for the persons living in such conditions. New Zealand’s action is more like forcing a drowning person back into a sinking vessel, with the ‘justification’ that after all there are other voyagers on board.”"
"Labour’s new animal protection manifesto makes animal protection and wildlife crime a potential, if unlikely, battleground for the next election. Animal crime is an emotive issue, and one on which the main political parties differ significantly.  Labour’s stance to retain the Hunting Act 2004 stands in contrast to the Conservatives’ pledge to revoke the ban on hunting. And Labour’s introduction of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 during the last parliament suggests a positive attitude towards animal welfare.   In its policy statement, the Labour Party identifies that more should be done to end wildlife crime and animal cruelty. These terms are used to refer to a wide range of illegal activities, from the persecution of British animals like birds of prey, to the global trafficking of endangered species and their parts.  Wildlife crime is considered to be one of the most prevalent forms of crime globally. The demand from source countries is a major problem, particularly Chinese demand for prize items like elephant ivory, and Vietnam’s demand for rhino horn.  The 2014 London Conference on illegal wildlife trade concluded that poaching and trafficking require action by source, demand and transit countries. As a major destination for trafficked wildlife, the EU has a role to play in addressing global wildlife crime, and Labour’s policies acknowledge this. Experts in the field have been making these calls for several years.  Criminologists and conservationists also say there is a lack of resources for wildlife law enforcement, as well as a lack of frontline knowledge when it comes to catching traffickers within the UK. It is also an area where corruption and the involvement of organised crime and different types of criminal require a dedicated enforcement approach. There is general political agreement that wildlife crime is important. But in practice, police forces are not required to prioritise it. Despite the efforts of individual police, enforcement officers and NGOs, wildlife crime enforcement remains significantly under-resourced. Criminologists and conservationists have repeatedly identified this fact.  Labour’s basic pledges are sound: it is necessary to combat illegal wildlife crime and prevent the trafficking and poaching of endangered species including elephants, rhino and some sturgeon species.  But these should be criminal justice priorities, not just animal welfare ones. Even if tougher sentences and stricter wildlife laws were introduced, it is unlikely that the number of offences would reduce. In some cases strong penalties already exist, but they are underused: so why would a new regime make any difference?   Instead, an improved enforcement strategy is needed, with increased resources for police and conservation bodies. We also need to reform wildlife crime laws so they are less confusing, and to reduce overlap and address inconsistencies. The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee addressed part of this issue back in 2012: the committee identified sentencing inconsistency and prosecutors’ lack of expertise as issues in wildlife crime enforcement.  Austerity measures are also a factor. While the UK has an excellent network of police wildlife crime officers, many of them carry out their roles in addition to their “main” duties. Evidence to the government’s committee suggested that, in some areas, wildlife crime enforcement is under threat from police budget cuts. The Law Commission says UK wildlife laws should be reformed and combined; another move that would improve wildlife protection. Indiscriminate methods of killing wildlife like snares should be prohibited, and loopholes should be closed. Some wording in laws means that wildlife can be killed on technicalities when the law is meant to protect it. Phrases like “wilfully” or “intentionally” should be replaced with wording that actually helps investigators where an offence has clearly been committed. They should not have to prove the wildlife knowledge or intentions of the offender.   One of the problems with wildlife laws is that there are too many, providing different levels of protection for animals. This causes confusion both for the public and enforcers. The coalition government’s Red Tape Challenge suggests that there are 159 regulations relating to biodiversity, wildlife management, landscape, countryside and recreation. Wildlife investigators and campaigners often complain about ambiguous wording and different standards of protection across wildlife legislation. Because of this, a high level of legal expertise is often required even at the investigative stage. The Law Commission sought to address this with plans for a more streamlined legal regime. They suggested increased use of civil and administrative penalties, rather than the existing reliance on the criminal law.   Our current wildlife law enforcement regime makes little provision for crime prevention. Its primary function in practice is to detect and apprehend the offender after the offence has been committed. In the case of wildlife, killed as a result of wildlife crime, this is too late.  Labour’s policy suggests that they see animal protection as important.  This is good news. But if this is the case, we need effectively enforced and coherent wildlife laws as part of our criminal justice system.  As the election heats up, it will be interesting to see which of our political parties is willing to name animal protection and wildlife crime as important policing issues. But ultimately, it will be more important to see which party will commit to providing resources to make this a reality."

Share this...FacebookTwitterYou really know that climate activism is going way off the rails when even a leading German socialist thinks the movement is becoming a threat to democracy. Leading German socialist politician Wolfgang Thierse warns of Greta Thunberg’s “anti-democratic”, uncompromising rhetoric. 
Hat-tip Die kalte Sonne
“Anti-democratic affection”
Over the years a number of leading climate scientists and activists have expressed to some degree their frustration with democracy, hinting that the political system which incorporates the will of the common people in government has only gotten in the way of taking action against the “climate crisis”. What is needed, they suggest, is an elite group of Leaders to decide how to properly organize society. The average citizen is too stupid to make the right decisions.
Even some socialists are beginning to worry about the movement. For example German online flagship daily Die Welt here recently reported on how leading SPD politician, former President of the German Bundestag, Wolfgang Thierse sees in the words of climate activist Greta Thunberg an “anti-democratic affection” and thus he “warns against the climate movement”.
“Rigorism in climate debate”
Die Welt writes how Thierse also “warns against rigorism in the climate debate” and statements made by climate activist Greta Thunberg such as “that the climate does not tolerate compromises”.

Thierse made the comments to the Berlin “Tagesspiegel” in a video interview.
In Thierse’s view, such statements are “anti-democratic” and urges climate activists to take former German Chancellor Willy Brandt as an example when it comes to convincing the public on policy.
Young people don’t see the complexity
Thierse is not alone. Last month well-known nature filmmaker David Attenborough also told WELT: “The young climate activists see things in black and white, very clearly. They don’t yet know all the buts…”
In other words, the youth are being manipulated.
Attenborough added: “Maybe the young people don’t see the complexity of the problems to be solved and how to deal with them in a reasonable democratic way. Bringing the whole population along democratically is a big problem.”
German political scientist says climate movement like a religion
Also in a recent interview with German DLF here, political scientist Ulrike Ackermann said: “Rescuing the climate is almost like a religion.”  She warned: “It is of no use to paint the world catastrophe on the wall in an alarmism that can only be countered radically.”

"When life on Earth began around 3.6 billion years ago, all organisms were small. Indeed, it took some 2.5 billion years to evolve any organism that grows larger than a single cell.  Since then, things have accelerated a bit and – along with the great diversification of body forms – animals have tended to get bigger. Indeed, the largest animal ever to live, the blue whale, is still very much with us, and has been swimming the world’s oceans for only a couple of million years – a mere blink of the eye in the long, long history of life in the sea. This trend towards larger body sizes through evolutionary time has become known as Cope’s Rule, after the American palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope. Cope’s rule has been documented or disputed in hundreds of studies of numerous animal lineages over the last century, but a new study in the journal Science provides perhaps the most comprehensive test yet of its existence. The team, led by Noel Heim from Stanford University, delved into the fossil record to compile information on the body sizes of more than 17,000 kinds of marine animals that have existed since the start of the Cambrian period, 542 million years ago. The results are clear: both the average and maximum sizes of marine organisms have increased substantially over this period, whereas the minimum size has remained reasonably constant. To some extent this may seem inevitable: if life starts small, the only way to go is bigger. And although evolutionary biologists are always wary of narratives of “progress”, many innovations in evolution require a large body size – for example, the smallest vertebrates are inevitably larger than the smallest invertebrates, because it takes a certain size of organism to pack in all the stuff that vertebrates have.  Likewise, warm-blooded marine animals like whales can only stave off hypothermia if they are more than about a metre long. So the re-invasion of the seas by the ancestors of today’s marine mammals imposed a new hard boundary on the minimum size within this group, which in turn affects the average size across groups. In the new study, Heim and colleagues tested whether the observed increase in size could be explained by a simple evolutionary random walk, where body size is allowed to change randomly at each branching in the tree of life. They also modified this to impose a minimum possible size, such that the evolution of body sizes proceeded randomly but “bounced back” if a lineage hit this lower size limit.  Neither of these models fitted the observed data well. Instead, they show that only persistent directional selection for larger body sizes – due to the many advantages to being large – can explain the observed trends. Does this mean that sea creatures are all inexorably getting bigger, and will continue to do so until the oceans are full of behemoths? Not really. First, the minimum size has not changed, and – moving for a moment from evolution to ecology – it is well known that most species are small. In the seas this is especially pronounced, because marine food webs are typically highly size structured – that is, big things eat small things. It takes a lot of small fish to meet the energetic demands of a big fish, and so the only way these food webs can work is if small organisms substantially outnumber their larger predators. Second, Heim and colleagues show that most of the overall increase in body size across all marine animals is explained by the evolution of major new groups, with all of the anatomical and physiological innovation that implies. There is rather less of a drive towards larger sizes within any existing group. In fact, many ocean giants are already more or less as big as they could be, given physical and physiological limits.  In their fascinating study Sizing Ocean Giants published in the journal PeerJ earlier this year, marine biologist Craig McClain and colleagues document the factors limiting size in many of the most conspicuous large marine species. These include the risk of tentacle tangling in jellyfish, metabolic constraints on giant clams, physiological limitations of pumping water over gills in large bony fish, or the reliance of blue whales on dense concentrations of their crustacean prey. In the case of most groups of marine animals, then, it is unlikely that significantly larger members will evolve any time soon. So, even if Cope continues to rule unchallenged, a visitor to our future oceans is less likely to find them populated with fish the size of whales and whales the size of supertankers than with some new giants whose blueprints we do not yet know. However, Cope has an important rival now as an evolutionary force, and that is you, me, and everyone who directly or indirectly exploits our seas. The attitude of people down the ages when confronted with large marine creatures is encapsulated by my reaction when I first saw pictures of newly discovered giant deep sea amphipods: “Barbecue!”.  As a species we’ve been pretty effective at removing large animals wherever we roam. As McClain and colleagues say of manta rays (although this is equally applicable to most exploited marine creatures), “In the face of fishing pressure and other anthropogenic threats, it is likely that individuals in many populations may not be near their maximum possible ages or sizes.” In some species, such as plaice and cod, fisheries appear to have driven selection for smaller body sizes, and our evolving understanding of extinction risk in the seas suggests we should not take for granted the continued existence of the ocean’s giants. Of course, we have been around for too short a time to know if human-driven selection will remain a true competitor to Cope’s rule in the longer term. Indeed, as this new research shows, previous mass extinctions have led to sharp increases in body size among survivors. So who knows? Maybe Cope will again rule the waves following the current human-driven extinction crisis."
"What if you could sit at home and use your smartphone to buy energy directly from the wind farm down the road or the solar panels on the local school roof?  New technologies are about to disrupt the traditional energy market in a big way. After all, you can already control your heating from your phone, set your washing machine going from your tablet, and tell your oven when you want your dinner cooked from your office. We’re not far off the point where you’ll be able to tell your energy company you want to buy solar when it’s sunny and wind when it’s windy. This combination of cheap renewable energy, even on a small scale, with digital technologies presents a massive challenge to those big utilities who have grown used to simply posting you your bill once a quarter. In most countries large utilities control the generation, distribution and sale of energy. In the UK the big six control 95% of the market between them.  Your local solar farm or biogas plant can’t just jump in and compete directly – it has to sell into the grid through a wholesale market. That energy can then change hands multiple times before finally ending up with your supplier and on your bill. The physical electrons on the other hand don’t care who owns them and they go straight out of the solar farm to the closest consumer they can find. Remember from high school electronics? Electricity is lazy. So why can’t you already buy your power from the local wind farm? The owner of the turbines would get a better rate and so would you. After all, fewer middlemen surely means cheaper electricity.  This is indeed the case, until those calm, still evenings of summer when your wind farm isn’t doing so well and you want ice in your drinks. It’s right then that you need an energy company with lots of different types of generation to back you up. Until very recently there hasn’t been a way of getting the benefits of clean, local energy at the same time as keeping the lights on or the mojitos cool. In our research we investigated some new types of energy company that are looking to trade local power, help you reduce your energy bills and plough value from the energy sector back into local communities. Our report shows that a host of innovative business models are emerging in the energy sector that are proving a real challenge to fit into an energy system used to operating big national markets through multinational companies. We found an energy system that is missing the opportunities of local energy supply and has seen new entrants innovate underneath it.  Imagine a version of Uber that dealt with your electricity bill – start-up tech companies are already on the case, offering peer to peer energy platforms. New community enterprises are trialling smart meter installations to get cheaper bills by physically shifting power to cheaper parts of the day. Bigger organisations such as local authorities are setting up full blown energy companies in order to build more local generation and get a fairer deal for their citizens. Fitting all of this innovation into a national system that has to contend with EU regulations as well as keep an energy grid in perfect balance 24 hours a day and seven days a week is no easy task. The government knows this and so does the regulator. Energy secretary Ed Davey has supported the Local Electricity Supply report, and there has recently been an update to the UK’s Community Energy Strategy to help grow these new companies. The regulator Ofgem is curating an open discussion on how non-traditindonal business models might help or hinder the system and impact on consumers. Local energy service companies can help small businesses and households save money. They can plough money back into the local economy that currently leaks out of our cities like heat through an uninsulated loft. More, smaller companies armed with smart technologies and new approaches to energy services could mean a move from the big six to the “little six thousand”."
"The world’s energy watchdog has warned the oil and gas industry that it risks a public backlash by failing to act on the climate crisis in favour of making short-term profits. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil companies must balance their desire for near-term returns and a long-term future by playing a much more significant role in combating the climate crisis. The IEA is preparing to make its most direct call for oil companies to help tackle the climate crisis at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos on Tuesday. The oil and gas industry faces “twin threats” to its financial profitability and social acceptability, according to the IEA. “There are already signs of both, whether in financial markets or in the reflexive antipathy towards fossil fuels that is increasingly visible in the public debate, at least in parts of Europe and North America,” it said. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said: “No energy company will be unaffected by clean-energy transitions. Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option.” The report said that although some oil and gas companies have taken steps to support efforts to combat the climate crisis, the industry as a whole could play a much more significant role. Oil companies could do more now to help shrink the industry’s giant carbon footprint but most companies were yet to play a meaningful role, according to the report. The world’s oil companies have channelled less than 1% of their spending towards alternative energy technologies outside of oil and gas, despite growing calls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The leading oil companies spend about 5%, the report said. The IEA has called on the oil industry to use its “extensive knowhow and deep pockets” to help accelerate the development of clean energy and carbon capture technologies that could help absorb the greenhouse gas from factories before they enter the atmosphere. Last week Microsoft announced plans to establish a $1bn (£770m) fund dedicated to “carbon reduction, capture, and removal technologies” and aims to become “carbon negative” by 2030. The IEA report found that the combined spending of large oil and gas companies in projects beyond oil and gas was just over $2bn last year. “Without the industry’s input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions,” Birol said. “The first immediate task for all parts of the industry is reducing the carbon footprint of their own operations. As of today, around 15% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers.” Birol said a large part of these emissions could be brought down relatively quickly and easily by investing in technology that can stop methane leaking from fossil fuel projects into the atmosphere. The IEA has faced scathing criticism in the past that it is undermining the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy by mapping out influential future energy scenarios – used by governments to help set energy policy – which are not aligned with global climate targets. The IEA has called for a “grand coalition” of policymakers, investors and oil executives to work together to tackle the climate crisis but this is the first report to focus directly on the role for oil and gas companies in the energy transition. In Europe, major oil companies are facing rising public opposition, including a growing number of cultural institutions that have said they will no longer accept financial support from oil and gas companies. Last week the Royal College of General Practitioners cancelled a conference organised by the trade body Oil and Gas UK that was scheduled to take place on its premises later this month because it “conflicts with the college’s longstanding commitment to combat the impact of climate change on the environment and on the health of our patients”."
"Despite the significant risks for human and non-human life, greenhouse gas emissions (GhG) are still rising. Something has to give – and that something would appear more significant than those with the power to stimulate change are willing to admit. The UK government’s Global Calculator is a good example. This recently released tool allows us to model the compatibility of our food, travel, housing and work environment with national targets to limit climate change. The climate secretary, Ed Davey, reckons the calculator shows “everyone in the world can prosper while limiting global temperature rises to two degrees, preventing the most serious impacts of climate change.” Yet even the most ambitious changes the tool advocates deviate little from our current “normal” patterns of behaviour – supposedly “essential” appliances still include tumble driers, while under the “extremely ambitious” scenario, the urban car would still account for 29% of journeys (currently 41.5%) per year. Meat is included as a core component of daily meals, and very few indicators relate to diet. It remains to be seen which government would adopt the “extremely ambitious” changes. This isn’t what a sustainable future looks like. It isn’t even close. Do we really need tumbledried clothes, or to eat meat every day? Transitioning to sustainability will require profound changes in our everyday ways of living, particularly in westernised countries. It requires changes that are much more significant than simply doing the things that we currently do, but more efficiently.   It’s not about driving more efficiently to reduce the GhG emissions of the commute, but perhaps leaving the car at home, cycling to work – or working from home. While tools such as the one above enable people to calculate their carbon footprint, they tell us little about the changes we’d actually need to make, and how these changes would affect our daily lives. Humans are adaptive creatures, able to move homes, jobs, retire or have children – all of which require us to break down and rebuild our existing ways of doing things. Consider how eating practices change with retirement. Many retirees find themselves with the time and desire to begin growing their own food in an allotment or their gardens. Retirement might provide the flexibility to shift energy-intensive cooking and laundry to daylight hours, taking advantage of solar energy. But retirement can also mean being less environmentally sustainable. The significance of food can diminish as a result of children leaving home or the loss of a partner. Ready meals (which are often worse for the environment) might take the place of cooking from scratch. And, as food becomes a leisure activity, this can involve more car journeys. The point is that people can and do make major life transitions, and these moments are big opportunities to go green. But also, that talking about “going green” as a significant change to how we currently live doesn’t have to be as daunting a prospect as it might first seem. So, rather than a Global Calculator that simply tells us whether or not we’re helping fight climate change, we suggest a more useful tool would be one that supports us in making a metaphorical “U-turn”. This tool would guide us through a process of throwing our lives out of kilter, and renegotiating and exploring more sustainable ways of being.  It couldn’t pull any punches. Rather than focusing on “things” and “stuff”, like a more efficient boiler or a washing machine that does eco mode, such a tool would have to be framed in terms of shifting practices – grow and cook more, eat little (or, better still, no) meat, work and travel less, wear more layers to keep warm and rely less on the heating, buy less “stuff”, and so on. But that’s not to say that living sustainably is easy. Significant changes to our lives are difficult and disruptive, even more so when current policies and infrastructures don’t comfortably support them (for example: public transport systems, expectations of appropriate work clothes). And so we should design tools that encourage us to make transitions towards sustainability that are themselves more sustainable. While big changes are needed, we should work towards them in smaller, more manageable steps. But, nonetheless, steps that involve reconsidering practices, not just tweaking them. After all, encouraging someone to think that switching washing machine, or buying a more efficient car is enough, is misleading. Far better to change practices entirely, so that driving less or line drying clothes becomes the new normal."
"In a few densely forested patches of Nigeria and Cameroon there lives a gorilla so rare and so elusive that the best way to study it is through training sniffer dogs to track down its faeces. This is the Cross River gorilla, and there are just 200-300 left in the wild. To find these shy creatures and learn more about them a team of scientists from Germany and the US turned to detection dogs. They have written about their findings in the Royal Society Open Science journal.  Most of us wish our encounters with faeces to be brief before we flush them away, but this is not the case for conservation biologists. The TV series You Are What You Eat hit on a truth: faecal matter is a rich source of information about its depositors. Faeces doesn’t just tell us what the owner has been eating – it also contains DNA, gut parasites, and hormones which can tell us about reproduction and stress levels.  The researchers in this particular study were after gorilla DNA, which can be used to determine the sex and identity of the individual; this information can then be used to estimate population size, the numbers in a social group, how far the group moves around and how closely related the individuals are. In the past wild population sizes were estimated by capturing individual animals, marking them and then after some time trying to recapture them.  It is possible to estimate population size using data gathered this way, but clearly this method is not appropriate for large and endangered species like gorillas.  However, this process can be simulated using the “recapture” of faeces from the same individuals, which is what the scientists did in this study. Gorillas, as you might imagine, create large piles of faeces. But despite their size, finding such deposits in a tropical forest is not an easy task for humans, especially when the gorillas themselves are so shy.  One way to overcome this problem is by using specially trained detector dogs to find the gorillas’ faeces (or scats as we biologists call them). The use of dogs as odour detectors goes back to the 1960s when they were first exploited to detect narcotics, and these days their olfactory abilities are employed to sniff out everything from explosives to cancerous tumours to the floating poop of killer whales. Scientists still debate how good a dog’s sense of smell is.  But research shows that they can detect chemicals in parts per trillion, whereas most chemical sensing machines work in parts per billion. Dogs possess 20 times as many olfactory receptors as humans, and they dedicate 40 times more of their brain to processing smells.  It is said that if their smell was taste they could detect a teaspoon of sugar in the amount of water needed to fill two Olympic swimming pools. They also can detect all the separate components of a smell; their nose can determine the ingredients list of whatever they are sniffing. Moths and bees can also be trained to detect explosives or drugs, while African pouched rats can detect landmines and even tuberculosis better than humans with machines. The advantage dogs have over insects and to an extent rats is their ability to cover large areas in short periods of time. But as with all detection animals the problem is the need for a human handler who often slows the dog down, especially in a mountainous tropical forest. The dogs used in this study were Working Dogs for Conservation flown in from the US . They proved more successful at finding scats than human fieldworkers and they were less biased in site location. Where human fieldworkers tended to look for gorilla nests and then procure scats nearby, dogs would instead scan the whole area.  This meant the dogs found scats belonging to more individual gorillas, which in turn bumped up the estimated population size.  Given sufficient field time the authors believe detection dogs would provide a precise estimate of gorilla population size. However, specially trained dogs and handlers imported from the US meant the cost per scat found was seven times more expensive than those found by human fieldworkers. This pilot study of just a few weeks cost nearly US$100,000.  The authors of this study recognise, despite the cost, the value of using detector dogs in longer term studies of highly endangered species such as Cross River gorillas, especially if dogs are simultaneously searching for scats of several endangered species.  And they suggest the establishment of a local detection dog program. Gorilla-hunting sniffer dogs for Africa? It’s a novel cause – but a worthy one."

"China’s push for more intense farming has kept its city dwellers well-fed and helped lift millions of rural workers out of poverty. But it has come at a cost. Ecosystems in what should be one of the country’s most fertile region have already been badly damaged – some beyond repair – and the consequences will be felt across the world. This is part of a long-running trade-off between rising levels of food production and a deteriorating environment, revealed in recent research I conducted with colleagues from China and the UK. Yields of crops and fish have risen over the past 60 years at several locations we studied in Anhui, Jiangsu and Shanghai Provinces in eastern China.  But these are parallelled by long-term trends in poorer air and water quality, and reduced soil stability.   You may ask if this a bad thing.  After all, increasing agricultural productivity has been one of the factors responsible for lifting millions of rural Chinese out of poverty.  Does it really matter that the natural environment has taken a bit of a hit? Well yes. For agriculture and aquaculture to be sustainable from one generation to the next, the natural processes that stabilise soils, purify water or store carbon have to be maintained in stable states. These natural processes represent benefits for society, known as ecosystem services.   Throughout the latter half of the last century, these services were being lost relatively slowly through the cumulative, everyday actions of individual farmers. But the problems accelerated in the 1980s when farmers began to use more intensive methods, especially artificial fertilisers – and again after 2004 when subsidies were introduced.  Worryingly, in some localities, the slow deterioration has turned into a rapid downward spiral. Some aquatic ecosystems have dropped over tipping points into new, undesirable states where clear lakes suddenly become dominated by green algae with losses of high-value fish. These new states are not just detrimental to the continued high-level production of crops and fish but are very difficult and expensive to restore.   These natural processes are degraded and destabilised to the point that they cannot be depended upon to support intensive agriculture in the near future.  The whole region is losing its ability to withstand the impact of extreme events, from typhoons to global commodity prices. National policy must prioritise sustainable agriculture. This will mean big changes on the farm: fertiliser and pesticides must be applied in the correct quantities at the right time of the year, cattle slurry and human sewage must be disposed of properly, chemicals getting into streams and rivers must be reduced, and fish feed has to be controlled. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. Farmers are still generally poor, badly educated and ageing. Good agricultural advice is lacking and big cities still tempt the younger farmers away from their fields. All these factors mean that rapid action is unlikely. The recent introduction of the Land Circulation reform policy, allows farmers to rent their land to larger combines. The policy is designed to overcome the inefficiencies of small farm holdings but it may not be taken up widely in the more marginal landscapes where potential profits are low.   All the evidence points to a need for a significantly improved system of information and technology transfer to individual smallholders, probably involving a more efficient coordination between agencies. But there’s a larger-scale context to this problem that may affect us all.  China’s grain production has risen fivefold since the 1950s, outstripping the pace of population growth. Despite this, the nation is no longer self-sufficient. The shift towards more meat production has placed a demand for soybean and cereal animal feed that can no longer be met internally. In 2012, China imported more than 60% of all the world’s soybeans that were available for export, and cereal imports are also on the up.   Reliance on imports to fill a shortfall in home produce is nothing new. But in China’s case, the additional risk that agriculture is increasingly unsustainable may amplify the demand. The potential scale of demand for imports is bound to have repercussions for global food production and food prices.  Unless reforms are introduced quickly, the rest of the world may well find that they are sharing China’s trade-off with nature – through the weekly shopping bill."

A cooling/non-warming North America
A few months ago, Gan et al. (2019) reported that the North American continent as a whole (180-0°, 15-60°N) “is one of the major cooling centers” in the Northern Hemisphere, with temperatures dropping after 1998 and no signficant net change since the early 1980s apparent.

The contiguous United States has even undergone an overall cooling or non-warming trend – especially on the Eastern half – since 1900 (Partridge et al., 2018).

U.S. East Coast has been expanding, not shrinking, since 1960
A few months ago Armstrong and Lazarus (2019) indicated “trends in recent rates of shoreline change along the U.S. Atlantic Coast reflect an especially puzzling increase in accretion, not erosion.”
From 1830 to 1956, shorelines eroded at the rapid rate of -55 cm per year on average. Since 1960, the U.S. Atlantic coast has been expanding (accretion) at a rate of +5 cm per year.

12 of 15 Florida Bay islands have also been expanding in size since the 1950s (Zhai et al., 2019).

New study: 45% of 53 long-term North America tide gauges show negative acceleration
A new paper (Boretti, 2019) utilizes 90+ years of continuous tide gauge data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) to record the sea level trends from the West Coast (20) and East Coast (33) of North America.
Boretti finds the average sea level change for the 20 West Coast tide gauges amounts to -0.38 mm/yr, whereas the average sea level rise rate is +2.22 mm/yr for the 33 East Coast gauges. Much of the relative differences between the two coasts can be explained by land subsidence (sinking) or uplift (rising).
“Nearly the entire East Coast of the United States, from Massachusetts and parts of Maine to Florida, is known to be affected by subsidence [6–10]. Subsidence is much stronger along the East Coast of the United States and significant only in Southern California along the West Coast, and it increased in intensity since the mid-1900s.”

Image Source: Boretti, 2019
Of the 53 total tide gauges on North America’s East and West coasts, 45% (24) are negatively accelerating, 14 document falling sea levels, and just 11 have sea levels rising more than +3 mm/yr.
The overall acceleration for both the East and West coasts amounts to just +0.0028 mm/yr² and +0.0012 mm/yr², respectively, when using the late 1800s and early 1900s as the starting years.
An analysis by Houston and Dean (2011) showed that when the sea level trend begins in 1930, the U.S. coasts as a whole actually decelerated overall (-0.013 mm/yr²) during 1930-2007.

These modest trends would not appear to support the conention that modern sea level changes in this region are rising at alarming rates.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTenders for new wind energy projects in Germany “have fallen to a new, all-time low”, the online IWR reports here.
After the installation of thousands of megawatts of German wind power capacity led to instability in the power grid, exploding electricity prices and the destruction of natural landscapes and biotopes, protests against wind projects ratcheted up to the point where the government was forced to scale back on subsidies two years ago. The result: investments in wind parks, once seen as the future of Germany’s energy supply, have since collapsed.
The IWR writes: ”
The negative trend in the construction of new wind turbines in Germany, which has persisted for more than a year, is thus intensifying.”
And: “A short- or medium-term change is not to be expected,” the IWR reports.
As of September 1, 2019, the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) has put out to tender 500 megawatts (MW) of wind power capacity, but so far “only 176 MW could be awarded in permissible bids”.
The grinding halt in wind energy by Germany flies in the face of the country’s commitment to transition over to green energies by 2050. Already experts say Germany will fail to meet its 2020 comitments.

Following the solar energy industry to the graveyard
IWR Director Dr. Norbert Allnoch said: “Politicians are frivolously jeopardizing the economic location of another future-oriented industry, as they did years ago with the solar industry.”
Will the “restart” be enough?
The wind industry is now placing its hopes on a “restart” on green energy investment announced by finance minister Olaf Scholz in his opening speech that kicked off debate in parliament on national spending in 2020. “More of the same will no longer help us,” Scholz said on the German government’s strategy to push climate-friendly activities through support programs and tax rebates.
Climate cabinet to roll out new measures
Major decisions on green energy programs and investments are expected to be announced by the country’s “climate cabinet” on 20 September 20th, but details on wind energy expansion plans remain vague. Currently onshore wind park projects face fierce opposition from hundreds of citizen protest groups and traditional environmentalists who believe the destruction of the German landscape is not an ecological price worth paying
On other fronts, Scholz foresees a pricing system for CO2 and that any measure would need to be financially designed “in a way that works for citizens”.
“We failed to take the necessary decisions in the past decades. There is now no more time to waste,” Scholz said.

"Making something illegal will not stop it happening – just look at the trade in endangered animal parts in traditional Chinese medicine.  And in some cases making an activity illegal has made it more desirable, the consumption of bush meat in Africa being a case in point.  The forbidden fruit, or in this case monkey, tastes sweeter. It’s clear that any crackdown on illicit activity needs to address motivations. Foxhunting is a great example. Ten years after hunting with dogs was outlawed in the UK, prime minister David Cameron has promised MPs an open vote on repealing the ban if he wins the general election. Though 80% of England’s population is against it, clearly the rest still want to carry on as before. Perhaps what fox hunting diehards need is an alternative. Not something that simply exists to keep the authorities happy, but a competitive alternative in its own right. Maybe they could look to east Africa for inspiration, where the Maasai people have traded lion hunting for a different sort of competitive thrill-seeking. Addressing fox hunting requires an understanding of its causes. Politics aside, the question is why there is still such a desire to chase and kill foxes with hounds. Fox populations have not exploded since the ban, so there is no argument in terms of pest control. And in any case lamping – the dazzling of a fox with a bright light and then shooting it – when carried out by a trained marksman has been shown to be a much more effective and humane method of control. Fox hunting enthusiasts argue it is part of the nation’s cultural heritage and that the ban is eroding the culture of countryside folk. This argument is used by indigenous people to hunt everything from polar bears to dugongs or whales.  Fox hunters are quick to point out their target is officially classified as a pest not an endangered species.   But culture changes, people say, and fox hunting need not be part of the UK’s social life for ever. Child labour, for instance, was an important part of the industrial revolution in the UK – it’s now long banned, and no one wants to bring back the traditional chimney sweep. The fox hunting lobby isn’t buying into the argument that culture moves on.  They point out that the number of hunts is still the same as before the ban. Of course since the ban they have been able to engage in substitute activities such as trail hunting, the laying down and following of an artificial trail in the pattern that a fox would leave across appropriate terrain.  Thus the hunters have had outlets for their desires. Many people accept that their motivations to hunt are no longer appropriate in a modern society where food is easily available.  Fishermen practice catch and release, and hunters can shoot clay pigeons.  These activities have been turned into games: fishermen can compete in matches or at least tell their tales of the one who got away, whereas clay pigeon shooting is featured in the Olympics. Pride, prizes and prestige can be gained in these sports.  Something that is missing I suspect from trail hunting, which is born out of a stigmatised activity that now has no obvious prize.  In the past, hunts could boast of how many kills they had made in a season. Lions in Africa are another species that soon could be on the endangered species list.  Realising this, the Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania have changed one important part of their cultural heritage.  Traditionally for a man to become a warrior, a leader or at least attract a wife, he needed to go out and kill a lion.  Since 2012 the Maasai have substituted killing lions with the Maasai Olympics where they can run, jump and throw against each other.   The winners gain medals, prizes and prestige – the same honours once gained through lion-killing. This shows culture is not a static thing but it evolves in relation to its environment.  If culture does not evolve then as all things suffering Darwinian forces it will go extinct – the Maasai know this. Maasai men have been killing lions for much longer than people in the UK have been hunting foxes with hounds but have quickly accepted a change in their culture.  Those wishing to repeal the Hunting Act would do well to think about the lessons to be learned from the Maasai.  Even cultural conservation is not preservation – it is about adapting to change in your environment and acting sustainably."
"Much of the Earth was once cloaked in vast forests, from the subarctic snowforests to the Amazon and Congo basins.  As humankind colonised the far corners of our planet, we cleared large areas to harvest wood, make way for farmland, and build towns and cities. The loss of forest has wrought dramatic consequences for biodiversity and is the primary driver of the global extinction crisis. I work in Borneo where huge expanses of tropical forest are cleared to make way for palm oil plantations. The biological cost is the replacement of some 150 forest bird species with a few tens of farmland species. But forest is also frequently retained inside or at the edges of oil palm plantations, and this is a pattern that is replicated globally. The problem, according to new research published in Science Advances, is that the vast majority of remaining forests are fragmented. In other words, remaining forests are increasingly isolated from other forests by a sea of transformed lands, and they are found in ever-smaller sized patches. The shockwaves of loss thus extend far beyond the footprint of deforestation. The team, led by Nick Haddad from North Carolina State University, used the world’s first high-resolution satellite map of tree cover to measure how isolated remaining forests are from a non-forest edge. Edges are created by a plethora of deforesting activities, from roads to cattle pastures and oil wells, as well as by rivers.   They found that more than 70% of remaining forest is within just 1km (about 0.6 miles) of an edge, while a 100 metre stroll from an edge would enable you to reach 20% of global forests. Comparing across regions, the patterns they find are even starker. In Europe and the US, the vast majority of forest is within 1km of an edge – some of the most “remote” areas in these regions are a stones throw from human activity. “Getting away from it all” has never been more challenging.  If you want remote forests on a large scale you’ll have to head to the Amazon, the Congo, or to a lesser degree, central and far eastern Russia, central Borneo and Papua New Guinea. These findings wouldn’t be cause for alarm if wildlife, forests, and the services that they provide humankind such as carbon storage and water, were unaffected by fragmentation. However, by drawing together scientific evidence from seven long-term fragmentation experiments, Haddad and colleagues show that fragmentation reduces biodiversity by up to 75%. This exacerbates the extinction risk of millions of forest species, many of which we still don’t know much about. Forest species struggle to survive at edges because these places are brighter, windier, and hotter than forest interiors. Edges become choked by rampant vines and invaded by disturbance-tolerant, parasitic or invasive species that outcompete the denizens of dark forest interiors. In Borneo, for example, small forest patches house bird communities that are far more similar to those found in the surrounding oil palm than to those of larger forest tracts.   The survival of large, carbon-rich trees – the building blocks of any intact forest ecosystem – is reduced in smaller and more isolated forest fragments.  These patches thus fail to maintain viable populations, which over time are doomed – an “extinction debt” yet to be paid. With so much global forest in close proximity to humans, larger forest animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, tapirs or curassow birds are being hunted to extinction in individual areas. This shifts animal communities within the forest fragments to one dominated by small-bodied species.  Further, hunters are willing to penetrate forests for several kilometres from edges in search of game, effectively making the truly wild global forest estate yet smaller.  The insidious effects of fragmentation mean that the top conservation priority must be preventing further incursions into dwindling wildernesses. By preventing the first cut we can help to prevent global fragmentation and the further loss of biodiversity. Of course, we should not ignore fragmented regions.  Some of these, including the Brazilian Atlantic forest, Tropical Andes and Himalayas, share a toxic mix of hyperdiversity, endemic species with tiny ranges, and severe fragmentation. The critically-endangered Munchique wood-wren, for instance, exists only in a handful of peaks in the Colombian Andes, but these are now isolated from each other by cattle pastures and roads. Here we must seek to restore forest cover and improve connectivity between larger fragments if we are to prevent extinctions. However, the rapid expansion of human populations, greed, and meat consumption mean that more forest is likely to be lost, even if farm yield and efficiency can be improved to help bridge gaps between current and future demand. The difficult question is where should this expansion happen? Given the severe degradation of small and isolated fragments, perhaps conversion could target some of these patches, coupled with wilderness protection and expansion. Next time I visit my local National Park – the highly fragmented Peak District – I will spare a thought for the species that are being harmed by their habitats being broken up into ever smaller chunks. There are no easy answers to the problems of fragmentation, but our forests urgently need a global management plan."
"Renewable electricity has nearly trebled under this government.  Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat energy and climate change minister, during an environment debate held by the Daily Politics show. Amid the climate of mistrust about claims made by politicians that tends to accompany election campaigns, it is reassuring to report that the evidence supports the minister’s statement. According to official figures on renewable electricity, installed generation capacity in the UK in 2014 was 2.6 times higher than in 2010, while actual generation of renewable electricity was 2.5 times higher. For further detail see the methodology for data collection by the Department of Energy and Climate Change.  As well as electricity generated by onshore and offshore wind, solar photovoltaic, hydro, and shoreline wave/tidal energy, these figures include electricity generated by organic material. This includes landfill gas, sewage sludge, waste, animal biomass (poultry litter, meat and bone), wet biomass waste (such as animal manure and slurry), and plant biomass (including straw and energy crops).  Although most of this involves generating electricity by combustion, which yields CO2 as a byproduct in the same way as fossil fuel combustion, these organic materials decompose naturally to produce CO2 and other greenhouse gases anyway, so using them to generate electricity has little effect on net greenhouse gas emissions. The main growth area was wind, which accounts for about half of Britain’s renewable electricity, followed by photovoltaic and plant biomass. Provisional data shows that renewables contributed a record 19.2% of electricity generation in 2014.  This increase in renewable electricity can be attributed in part to the Renewables Obligation set up by the previous Labour government in 2002, which obliged electricity supply companies to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. However, the Contracts for Difference feed-in tariff system introduced by the coalition for large-scale energy generation – which established a set price that is high enough to enable investors to make a profit – is probably responsible for increasing the rate of growth. Expert studies have shown that feed-in tariffs are more effective than quota systems in encouraging investment in renewable electricity. The flaw in the coalition’s strategy is that while in other countries, electricity supply companies are obliged to buy all the electricity generated by renewable sources at the feed-in tariff price, which is higher than the market price, in Britain, supply companies buy at the market price and the government pays the difference. As a consequence, expansion of renewable electricity is limited not only by investors’ willingness to invest and planning issues, but also by budgetary constraints. As spending cuts are the order of the day, this means that we cannot be sure that the current rate of expansion will be sustained. Ed Davey’s claim that renewable electricity has almost trebled during the coalition’s term of office is accurate, but flaws in Britain’s feed-in tariff system mean that further expansion may be limited. The coalition certainly deserves some credit for its record on creating new sources of renewable electricity, and it is also true that the fear of electoral unpopularity regarding high energy bills has hampered the efficacy of its achievements. These could have been even higher if the energy companies had been required to purchase higher tariff renewable energy from distributed sources. However, when energy for heating and transport (which still depends primarily on fossil fuels) is taken into account, renewables represent only 5% of energy supply in the UK, according to the 2014 Digest of UK Energy Statistics. There is widespread acceptance, including by the UK government, that greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced to keep global temperatures from rising beyond 2°C.   The Centre for Alternative Technology’s report Zero Carbon Britain suggests that it is helpful to think the world has a finite amount of greenhouse gases it can emit to keep within the 2°C threshold. This is known as the emissions budget. The report predicts the UK’s share of the global emissions budget (offering a 75% chance of keeping below 2°C) at about 10,000 MtCO2e between now and 2050. At the current emission rate the country will produce 16,000 MtCO2e by the middle of the century.  Voters would do well to avoid the rhetoric over renewable electricity and ask which party’s policies are most likely to decarbonise all parts of the country’s energy budget, and how quickly they say they can do this. – Erik Bichard "

Share this...FacebookTwitterSatellite observations indicate the Earth has become much greener in recent decades. According to scientists, the overwhelming majority of the “significant increases in tropical forests and the forests of North America, Eurasia, and China” since the early 1990s can be attributed to the combination of CO2 fertilization (56%) and climate change (35%).

O’Sullivan et al., 2019
“The recent warming hiatus (1998–2013) was identified as a potential key mechanism behind the increased land sink during this period via reduced ecosystem respiration (Ballantyne et al., 2017).”
“At the global scale, simulated NPP [net primary production, greening] increased substantially over the 20th century to present day from 56.2 (mean of 1901–1910) to 66.0 Pg C/year (mean of 2007–2016) with positive contributions from all drivers considered, including rising CO2 concentrations (referred to as CO2 fertilization), nitrogen deposition, climate, and carbon‐nitrogen as well as carbon‐climate synergies. The relative contribution of these drivers to this overall NPP increase amounts to 60% for increased CO2, 15% for nitrogen deposition, 8% for carbon‐nitrogen synergy, 9% for carbon‐climate synergy, and 8% for climate. Both CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition individually caused a smooth, transient increase in NPP, in line with the trajectory of the corresponding drivers.”
“[R]esults show a global NPP [net primary production, greening] increase of 3.4 Pg C/year between the early 1990s (mean of 1990–1996) and the end of our study period (2010–2016), with CO2 fertilization and climate being the dominant drivers, accounting for 56% and 35% of the overall change, respectively.”
“Carbon‐climate interactions led to significant increases in tropical forests and the forests of North America, Eurasia, and China.”
A dozen new papers attest to the substantially positive impact that CO2 fertilization and warming has had on the biosphere.
• Due especially to the rise in CO2 concentrations, 52% of the globe’s vegetated lands have shown statistically significant greening/gross primary production trends since 1981, whereas just 12% of vegetated areas have been browning. CO2’s greening effect has been underestimated by 60% with outdated models.

Winkler et al., 2019
“Historical increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration, from 280 to current 400 ppm, has resulted in enhanced GPP [gross primary production/greening] due to its radiative and physiological effects, which is indirectly evident in amplified seasonal swings of atmospheric CO2 concentration and large scale increase in summer time green leaf area. Thus, these observables, expressed as sensitivities to ambient CO2 concentration, might serve as predictors of changes in GPP and help to reduce uncertainty in multimodel projections of terrestrial carbon cycle entities. This study is focused on the northern high latitudes (NHL, north of 60°N) where significant and linked changes in climate and vegetation have been observed in the past 3–4 decades: 52% of the vegetated lands show statistically significant greening trends over the 36-year record of satellite observations (1981–2016, Methods), while only 12% show browning trends, mostly in the North American boreal forests due to disturbances.”
“Here, we apply the concept of Emergent Constraints (EC) to reduce uncertainty in multi-model projections of GPP using historical simulations and satellite observations of LAI focusing on NHL. We find that the EC estimate [of the effect of CO2 on greening/GPP] is 60% larger than the commonly accepted multi-model mean value, in line with a recent study that assessed the impact of physiological effects of higher CO2 concentration on GPP of northern hemispheric extra-tropical vegetation. Detailed independent analyses of insitu CO2 measurements and atmospheric inversions imbue confidence in our conclusions. Our central finding is, the effect of ambient CO2 concentration on terrestrial photosynthesis is larger than previously thought, and thus, has important implications for future carbon cycle and climate.”
• According to observations, the Earth – especially its dryland regions – has been greening due to climate change (CO2 and temperature rise).
Brandt et al., 2019
“Recent Earth observation studies find a greening of the Earth and in particular in global drylands, which is commonly interpreted as a global increase in net primary production and has been attributed to climate change. Although changes in rainfall, fire regimes, elevated temperatures, atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen depositions are suggested explanations, only few studies provide quantitative evidence on both the biophysical processes (changes in vegetation cover, structure and composition) and controlling factors of long-term dryland vegetation trends.”
Qiu et al., 2019
“Our results show that both net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) of northern peatlands increased over the past century in response to CO2 and climate change.”
• The “remarkable” vegetation greening in the Yellow River Basin since 2000 is expected to continue for 73% of the region.

Image Source: Wang et al., 2019
Wang et al., 2019
“Changes in Vegetation Greenness in the Upper and Middle Reaches of the Yellow River Basin over 2000–2015 … In this study, the vegetation dynamic characteristics were analyzed for unconverted forestland, shrubland, grassland, cropland, and converted forestland, shrubland, and grassland from cropland over 2000–2015 in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River. … The results obtained were as follows: (1) Vegetation greening was remarkable in the entire study region (0.036 yr−1).”
“Overall greening trend in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River indicated great achievements have been obtained since the implementation of the GTGP. Vegetation restoration exerted stronger influences on converted types from cropland than unconverted types. In the future, approximately 73.1% of the study region is expected to continue increasing [greening].”
• Water-use efficiency – the ability for plants to compensate for water loss – has improved directly due to “rising atmospheric CO2 and contemporary climate change.”

Cernusak et al., 2019
“Human-caused CO2 emissions over the past century have caused the climate of the Earth to warm and have directly impacted on the functioning of terrestrial plants. We examine the global response of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) to the historic change in atmospheric CO2. The GPP of the terrestrial biosphere has increased steadily, keeping pace remarkably in proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO2. Water-use efficiency, namely the ratio of CO2 uptake by photosynthesis to water loss by transpiration, has increased as a direct leaf-level effect of rising CO2. This has allowed an increase in global leaf area, which has conspired with stimulation of photosynthesis per unit leaf area to produce a maximal response of the terrestrial biosphere to rising atmospheric CO2 and contemporary climate change.”
• A “large increase” in total biomass and improvement in water use efficiency is assessed for the Amazon region under elevated CO2 (700 ppm). Elevated CO2 “nullified” the effect of drought.
Oliveira and Marenco, 2019
“The large increase in total biomass and the substantial improvement in WUEP [water use efficiency] under eCO2 [elevated CO2, 700 ppm], and the sharp decline in leaf area under water stress widen our knowledge on the physiology of this important species for the forest management of large areas in the Amazon region.”
“Climate models predict an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and prolonged droughts in some parts of the Amazon, but the effect of elevated CO2 is still unknown. Two experiments (ambient CO2 ‒ 400 ppm and elevated CO2 ‒ 700 ppm) were conducted to assess the effect of drought (soil at 50% field capacity) on physiological parameters of Carapa. At ambient CO2 concentration, light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (PNsat) was reduced by 33.5% and stomatal conductance (gs) by 46.4% under drought, but the effect of drought on PNsat and gs was nullified at elevated CO2. Total plant biomass and leaf area production were also reduced (42‒47%) by drought. By changing leaf traits, Carapa is able to endure drought, as the consumptive use of water was reduced under drought (32‒40%). The improvement of PNsat under elevated CO2 and water stress and the leaf plasticity of Carapa broaden our understanding of the physiology of Amazonian trees.”
• Plants grown under elevated CO2 have “higher biomass, plant height, and leaf area.” Elevated CO2 “may mitigate the negative effects of water deficit” in soybeans.
Bencke-Malato et al., 2019
“In this study, we evaluated the individual and combinatory effects of E[CO2] [elevated CO2] and water deficit on the physiology and root molecular responses in soybean. Plants growing under E[CO2] [elevated CO2] exhibited increased photosynthesis that resulted in a higher biomass, plant height, and leaf area. E[CO2] decreased the transcripts levels of genes involved in iron uptake and transport, antioxidant activity, secondary metabolism and defense, and stress responses in roots. When plants grown under E[CO2] [elevated CO2] are treated  with instantaneous water deficit, E[CO2] reverted the expression of water deficit-induced genes related to stress, defense, transport and nutrient deficiency. Furthermore, the interaction of both treatments uniquely affected the expression of genes. Both physiological and transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that E[CO2] may mitigate the negative effects of water deficit on the soybean roots.”
• Elevated temperature and CO2 increased maize and soybean yield by 25%-31%.
Qiao et al., 2019
“Maize had 25% yield increase under elevated temperature (eT). Soybean had 31% yield increase under elevated CO2 (eCO2) with eT. Elevated temperature with and without eCO2 increased grain oil concentrations.”
• Rice yield is “significantly higher” with elevated CO2.
Raj et al., 2019
“Climate  change  associated  with  rising  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  concentration  may  have  impact  on  crop production and soil health. Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration may enhance crop growth with higher demand for nutrients by the crop. An experiment was conducted during July-October, 2013 using Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment facility at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi to study the impact of elevated CO2 and nitrogen (N) dose on growth, yield and nitrogen uptake in rice crop. Four doses of N, i.e., control, 0.6 g N pot-1 (75% recommended dose of N), 0.8 g N pot-1 (100% recommended dose of N) and 1.0 g N pot-1 (125% recommended dose of N) were applied in both ambient (395 ppm) and elevated CO2 (550±20 ppm)  conditions. Grain and biomass yield of rice was significantly higher under elevated CO2 condition. Plant growth and yield parameters also increased with increased N doses in both elevated and ambient CO2 conditions. Nitrogen concentration of grain and straw decreased under high CO2 level but N uptake increased under elevated CO2 condition. Agronomic efficiency of N was higher under elevated CO2 while recovery efficiency of N remained unaffected. The study showed that although yield of rice increases under elevated CO2 condition, to maintain plant nitrogen concentration, application of additional dose of N is required.”
• Trees “may temporally benefit from warming climate” in Asian boreal forests.
Zhang et al., 2019
“While summer GST [ground surface temperature] had a somewhat consistently positive correlation with tree growth, winter GST has shifted from a negative to a strongly positive correlation with growth in the last decade, coincidental with a sharp increase in winter GST since 2004. Winter GST is also strongly correlated with the rapidly thawing permafrost dynamics. Overall, our results suggest a link between recent changes in the permafrost and shifts in climate‐growth correlations for one of the main boreal tree species. As a result, L. gmelinii has experienced an important increase in radial growth that may indicate that, unlike what has been reported for other boreal species, it may temporally benefit from warming climate in the continuous permafrost region of the Asian boreal forests.”
• Due to climate change, the height growth for oak trees has been “significantly higher” during the last 30-35 years than the decades prior.
Gulyás et al., 2019
“Due to climate change, it is important to know to what extent forests will be impacted by atmospheric changes. This study focuses on the height growth response of sessile oak.”
“The relative top heights of the young stands were significantly higher than of the older stands, which means that the overall growing conditions were better in the last 30-35 years due to atmospheric changes than the mean conditions during the lifetime of old stands.”

"Ordinary people from across the UK – potentially including climate deniers – will take part in the first ever citizens’ climate assembly this weekend. Mirroring the model adopted in France by Emmanuel Macron, 110 people from all walks of life will begin deliberations on Saturday to come up with a plan to tackle global heating and meet the government’s target of net-zero emissions by 2050.  The assembly was selected to be a representative sample of the population after a mailout to 30,000 people chosen at random. About 2,000 people responded saying they wanted to be considered for the assembly, and the 110 members were picked by computer. They come from all age brackets and their selection reflects a 2019 Ipsos Mori poll of how concerned the general population is by climate change, where responses ranged from not at all to very concerned. Of the assembly members, three people are not at all concerned, 16 not very concerned, 36 fairly concerned, 54 very concerned, and one did not know, organisers said. The selection process meant those chosen could include climate deniers or sceptics, according to Sarah Allan, the head of engagement at Involve, which is running the assembly along with the Sortition Foundation and the e-democracy project mySociety. “It is really important that it is representative of the UK population,” said Allen. “Those people, just because they’re sceptical of climate change, they’re going to be affected by the steps the government takes to get to net zero by 2050 too and they shouldn’t have their voice denied in that.” The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  The UK climate assembly differs from the French model in that it was commissioned by six select committees, rather than by the prime minister. Their views, which will be produced in a report in the spring, will be considered by the select committees but there is no guarantee any of the proposals will be taken up by government. Allen said it was rare for members of a citizens’ assembly to get locked into dissent. She pointed to the success of the Irish citizens’ assembly in 2016, which helped break the deadlock in the abortion debate. “This climate assembly is going to come up with recommendations that are going to be really invaluable in highlighting public preferences,” she said. Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy at University College London, is one of four experts who will guide the members of the public in their decision-making. He acknowledged the scale of the challenges they faced in finding solutions to reaching net zero by 2050, which he said was “a hell of a job”. As well as four experts to the assembly, a panel of advisers including representatives from the Confederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, National Farmers’ Union, environmental NGOs and renewable energy companies have helped provide the questions on which assembly members will be asked to give their views. The key subjects to be considered will include transport, agriculture, domestic energy, and how consumerism is driving global heating. As well as policies such as bringing forward the ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040, the panel will consider technological solutions to cutting carbon emissions. Watson said many technological initiatives were surrounded by hype. “It is really important we get across [to the assembly members] not just that the option is x, but what the status of that option is in the world,” he said. The assembly will meet for four weekends. On the third weekend they will begin making decisions about ways to meet the net zero target. A spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion, which is calling for the government to create and be led by the decisions of a citizens’ assembly on climate, said they welcomed the fact that such assemblies were being used in mainstream politics. “However, because it is not commissioned by the government it is not what we are looking for. We want something with real teeth, that has actual power to influence policy,” she said."

In April this year I missed an important podcast interview with one of the world’s most prominent Sahara Desert researchers, geologist Dr. Stefan Kröpelin, by the Düsseldorf-based German daily, Rheinische Post.

Image: University of Cologne 
The two RP hosts conducting the interview seemed to expect Dr. Kröpelin would tell the audience how dire the consequences of man-made global warming are on the Sahara Desert and planet overall.
They didn’t get what they bargained for.
Warming does not lead to desertification
Instead, in the interview, Dr. Kröpelin rejected in very clear terms man’s major climatic impact and that global warming is only negative.
Kröpelin told listeners that history is very clear: When the globe is cold, the deserts expand. And when the globe is warm, deserts become greener and far more fruitful.
Kröpelin is a leading expert
Kröpelin has been studying the Sahara for over 40 years, spending weeks and months each year on site gathering data a reconstructing past climates. Nature described Kröpelin as “one of the most devoted Sahara explorers of our time.”
At about 9 minutes into the interview, he explains how the Sahara was massive in size during the last glacial period, and that about ten thousand years ago it greened up once temperatures shot up early in the Holocene.
When asked (10:15) if he worries that things in the Sahara “will get much worse” due to climate change, Kröpelin tells the host and audience: “First, that is a statement I 100% reject”, adding that localized desertification has more to do with the population growth at the edges of the desert and that the people who live there are cutting down trees and extracting water from the ground.
Rising precipitation, shrinking desert 
Next (12:00), Kröpelin talks about the remote edges of the Sahara where few people live: “Here we signs that precipitation is increasing and that should the trend continue, the desert is going to shrink.” Similarly as it did at the end of the last glacial. “The Sahara changed from a desert to a savannah. These are not model simulations.” He says rather this is” based 100%” on real observations of a wide variety of proxy data taken throughout the region.

The greening of the Sahara “happened not because it got colder, but because it got warmer,” he said.
A third would become livable again
Kröpelin also shocks the host and audience, claiming that even if the climate models were true, which he says he doesn’t believe, “Maybe one third of the African continent will be a livable zone again. That would be an unbelievable advantage for the people in Sub-Saharan Africa. […] I dispute that over the last decades there’s been a climatically controlled increase of the desert.”
“Never been a stable climate”
On the subject of climate-induced human migration, Kröpelin says human migrations due to climate changes have always occurred. In the past sea level changes simply caused the people to step back or forwards a few meters. But today, the problem is that the built infrastructure is unable to move with the changes. “There’s never been a really stable climate.”
“What’s one meter from 4000?”
On sea level rise, Kröpelin plays down the changes that are occurring today, reminding us that the average depth of the ocean is some 4000 meters, noting.  “What’s one meter from 4000 meters of sea depth?”
Climate change “totally exaggerated”
When asked about the climate protests now taking place (21:00), Kröpelin comments: “I would say that today’s handling of climate change is hysterical” and that “we should not be dramatizing.”
The University of Cologne expert geologist says that by only looking at the last few decades, “We can naturally create panic. But I find it totally exaggerated.”
PIK painting “doomsday scenarios”
Kröpelin notes that the claim that global warming is all bad just “isn’t true” and that “the real catastrophe would be a dramatic drop in global temperature” and that “warming is the least of our problems.” He adds: “Climate change is totally exaggerated.”
He sharply criticizes the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) for “painting doomsday scenarios” and says the topic has been heated up by politics.

"Tropical forests are being exposed to unprecedented environmental change, with huge knock-on effects. In the past decade, the carbon absorbed annually by the Amazon rain forest has declined by almost a third. At 6m km2, the Amazon forest covers an area 25 times that of the UK, and spans large parts of nine countries. The region contains a fifth of all species on earth, including more than 15,000 types of tree. Its 300 billion trees store 20% of all the carbon in the Earth’s biomass, and each year they actively cycle 18 billion tonnes of carbon, twice as much as is emitted by all the fossil fuels burnt in the world.   The Amazon Basin is also a hydrological powerhouse. Water vapour from the forest nurtures agriculture to the south, including the biofuel crops which power many of Brazil’s cars and the soybeans which feed increasing numbers of people (and cows) across the planet. What happens to the Amazon thus matters to the world.  As we describe in research published in Nature, the biomass dynamics of apparently intact forests of the Amazon have been changing for decades now with important consequences. There are two competing narratives of how tropical forests should be responding to global changes.  On one hand, there is the theoretical prospect (and some experimental evidence) that more carbon dioxide will be “good” for plants.  Carbon dioxide is the key chemical ingredient in photosynthesis, so more of it should lead to faster growth and thus more opportunities for trees and whole forests to store carbon. In fact almost all global models of vegetation predict faster growth and, for a time at least, greater carbon storage. Arrayed against this has been an opposing expectation, based on the physical climate impacts of the very same increase in atmospheric CO2.  As the tropics warm further, respiration by plants and soil microbes should increase faster than photosynthesis, meaning more carbon is pumped into the air than is captured in the “sink”. More extreme seasons will also mean more droughts, slowing growth and sometimes even killing trees. The work we have led takes a simple approach. With many colleagues, we track the behaviour of individual trees through time across permanent plots distributed right across South America’s rain forests. Together with hundreds of partners in the RAINFOR network, this close-up look at the Amazon ecosystem has been underway since the 1980s, allowing an unprecedented assessment of how tropical forests have changed over the past three decades. Our analysis – based on work across 321 plots, 30 years, eight nations, and involving almost 500 people – first of all confirms earlier results. The Amazon forest has acted as a vast sponge for atmospheric carbon. That is, trees have been growing faster than they have been dying.  The difference – the “sink” – has helped to put a modest brake on the rate of climate change by taking up an additional two billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. This extra carbon has been going into ostensibly mature forests, ecosystems which according to classical ecology should be at a dynamic equilibrium and thus close to carbon-neutral. However we also found a long and sustained increase in the rate of trees dying in Amazon forests that are undisturbed by direct human impacts. Tree mortality rates have surged by more than a third since the mid-1980s, while growth rates have stalled over the past decade. This had a significant impact on the Amazon’s capacity to take-up carbon. Recent droughts and unusually high temperatures in the Amazon are almost certainly behind some of this “mortality catch-up”. One major drought in 2005 killed millions of trees. However the data shows tree mortality increases began well before then. Some other, non-climatic mechanism may be killing off Amazonian trees.  The simplest answer is that faster growth, which is consistent with a CO2 stimulation, is now causing trees to also die faster. As the extra carbon feeds through the system, trees not only grow quicker but they also mature earlier. In short, they are living faster, and therefore dying younger. Thus, 30 years of painstakingly monitoring the Amazon has revealed a complex and changing picture. Predictions of a continuing increase of carbon storage in tropical forests may be overly optimistic – these models simply don’t capture the important feed-through effect of faster growth on mortality. As the Amazon forest growth cycle has been accelerating, carbon is moving through it more rapidly. One consequence of the increase in death should be an increase in the amount of necromass – dead wood – on the forest floor. While we haven’t measured these changes directly, our model suggests the amount of dead wood in the Amazon has increased by 30% (more than 3 billion tonnes of carbon) since the 1980s.  Most of this decaying matter is destined to return to the atmosphere sooner rather than later. More than a quarter of current emissions are being taken up by the land sink, mostly by forests. But a key element appears to be saturating. This reminds us that the subsidy from nature is likely to be strictly time-limited, and deeper cuts in emissions will be required to stabilise our climate."

5 crewmen to fly over to New York
But German online leftist daily TAZ here has uncovered that Greta’s climate publicity jaunt is going to wind up creating a massive carbon stomp, one far greater than anyone would have dared to imagine.
The TAZ writes that Greta would have been far gentler to the climate had she simply taken a commercial airliner. The reason, the TAZ writes, is because a crew of 5 men will have to fly over to New York in order to take the boat back!
This is what Andreas Kling, press spokesman for Thunberg’s skipper Boris Herrmann, told the TAZ on Thursday.
“There’s no other way,” said Kling!

10 tons instead of 4
Citing carbon emissions calculator site atmosfair, each crewman flying from Hamburg to New York will emit 2 tons of CO2 for the flight, i.e. a total of 10 tons. Had Greta simply taken a roundtrip commercial economy-class flight, she would have wound up emitting less than 4 tons.
The 16-year-old Greta and her father set sail last Wednesday afternoon on board the ocean-going yacht Malizia II with two sailors and a publicity filmmaker.
Hundreds of journalists travel to Plymouth
Moreover, “hundreds of journalists, supporters and spectators” travelled to Plymouth to watch Greta’s departure, thus adding enormously to the carbon emissions that the trip was supposed to reduced. The journalists could have witnessed here departure via live feed or a webcam rather than travelling in automobiles and what not to Plymouth.
Spokesman Kling says now they are considering sending Greta back from New York via cargo container ship.
Gee, cutting back fossil fuels “not easy” after all
Aware that the trip is possibly turning into public relations farce, sailor Herrmann told the TAZ: “The journey symbolizes two things: that it is not easy to replace fossil fuels and that mastering this challenge can be a great adventure”.

"As a result of membership of the Common Fisheries Policy, we are now allowed to catch less than 20% of the fish that swim in British waters. The other 80% we have given away to the rest of Europe.  Nigel Farage, UKIP leader, on the campaign trail When fact checking this statement, it is first of all worth pointing out that if the UK was allowed to catch 20% of the fish that swim in British waters and the EU took the rest, then there would be no fish left in the sea. In attempting to check the facts behind this assertion, one must assume, therefore, that Nigel Farage is referring to the allocations of fishing quotas which are determined by the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In 2015, the CFP allocated the United Kingdom a total of 612,612 tonnes of quota from more than 100 different fish and shellfish stocks. The total EU quota for these stocks was 2,069,202 tonnes, so the UK was allocated 30% of these fish (and shellfish) quotas.  These figures include various fish which live beyond the boundaries of UK waters, such as Arctic cod and west of Ireland sole. If one considers the 73 different fish stocks which live in UK waters, the total EU quota was 1,920,915 tonnes, of which 585,211 tonnes was allocated to the UK (which also happens to be 30%). Individual quota allocations differ according to stock, as figure one below shows. For example, the UK gets 84% of the North Sea haddock quota, 81% of North Sea monkfish quota and 98% of west of Scotland prawn quota; but only 4% of North Sea sprat quota, 18% of northern hake and 28% of North Sea plaice. Although UK waters are extensive, as the map below shows, the fish stocks which live in our waters are by no means confined to them. Some, like mackerel, make extensive migrations and only pass through our waters for a short period. Others are more sedentary, like prawns which stay close to their burrows in muddy habitats.   Many species live in different places either at different times of the year or in different phases of their life cycle. In the case of North Sea herring for example, most of the juveniles live in the south east corner around the German bight, whereas the adults tend to congregate around the Shetland Isles prior to spawning at various sites along the British coast. North Sea cod are found throughout the North Sea but prefer spawning along the border between UK and Norwegian waters.  So despite the UK having quite extensive waters, fish stocks do not respect political boundaries, and many are mobile at some stage in their life: these fish are exclusive to neither the UK, the EU, nor the bordering Scandinavian states, but are a shared resource. It would be a major undertaking to establish exactly which proportions of each fish stock would occupy any national waters. These are also likely to change throughout the year, and from year to year. The CFP was designed to manage the mobile fishing fleets that pursue these common, mobile resources. Although the majority of fish stocks around the UK are managed under the CFP, some important stocks, mainly local shellfish species such as crabs, lobsters and scallops, are also managed under national jurisdictions and bilateral agreements, for example between the EU and states such as Norway and Iceland.  The status of all stocks is determined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the recognised authority that provides scientific advice to managers. This advice is updated annually and, where possible, includes measures of stock status such as the total biomass of adults and the rate of exploitation the stock has been subjected to by the fishery.   Although the CFP is much derided, various reforms have actually resulted in improvements in the status of many fish stocks in the last decade or so: exploitation rates are down, and in most cases, to levels which are sustainable. The ICES advice also includes recommendations for total allowable catches (TACs) for each stock. Each TAC is then considered by the EU and divided into the quotas which are allocated among the member states according to fixed percentages, under allocation keys known as “relative stability”, which are based on historic fishing patterns.    In 2015, the UK was allocated 30% of the EU quota for fishing ground stocks which occur in UK waters. The area of UK waters relative to other member states is certainly high, but the exact proportions depend on the region and which components of member state waters should be considered.   If Farage’s point is that most of the quota for fish stocks that live in UK waters are fished by other member states, then he is correct; but the figure is not 80%, more like 70%. However, these are not “our” fish, the fish that live in UK waters are no more British than they are German, Dutch, Belgian, Irish or Norwegian: they are in fact European. This is a thorough and well-illustrated response which uses the most reliable and up-to-date information available. By demonstrating that the majority of fish in our waters are in fact European rather than British it highlights a key point – even if Britain left the EU we would still need to negotiate quotas which took this into account. There is no guarantee this would ensure any more of the catch. It’s also interesting to look at these figures in terms of value rather than just landings. Three of the top five most valuable UK fisheries are for shellfish: prawns, scallops and crabs. For these more sedentary species we already have almost complete control. Although some fish, such as haddock are mainly eaten in the UK, a lot of shellfish from British waters is exported to EU countries. The vast majority of our scallop catch – the UK’s third most valuable fishery – goes to France and Belgium. Likewise Spain and Portugal take a lot of our crabs and prawns. Let’s concentrate on looking after what we are responsible for, more wisely."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNatural variability rules in Antarctica. Scientists identify clouds, wind, and localized solar heating – not CO2 – as the factors driving ice melt. Rising CO2 leads to Antarctic cooling.

Image Source: Lüning et al. 2019
Antarctica rapidly cooling in recent decades
In a review of the scientific literature, Lüning et al. 2019 report Antarctica as a whole has undergone a cooling trend in recent decades.
The Antarctic Peninsula has cooled at a rate of -0.5°C per decade since the late 1990s.
West Antarctica as a whole has “slightly cooled” (or the warming has “plateaued”) over the past two decades.
East Antarctica “has not experienced any significant temperature change since the 1950s” with  ice sheet mass gains and cooling during the past 15 years.
Rising CO2 leads to Antarctic cooling
Antarctica contains about 90% of the world’s ice.
Because the continent averages -28.2°C in summer and -60°C in winter, inducing even partial retreat for an ice sheet that averages 2.3 kilometers in height would require a substantial amount of heat energy.
This effectively rules out a significant human influence.
According to scientists, raising CO2 concentrations does not even lead to warming in Antarctica. Actually, scientists find Antarctica cools in response to rising CO2 concentrations, which means we humans may be contributing more to ice mass gains than to losses.

Natural variability – clouds, wind, localized solar heating – drive Antarctic ice melt
The surface melting of portions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has received quite a bit of attention in media circles, often accompanied by scary warnings of ice sheet collapse and catastrophic sea level rise.
For example, Dr. James Hansen – admitting his doomsday predictions are tendentiously designed to be “persuasive” – has claimed sea levels will rise by 10 feet by 2065 mostly due to Antarctic ice sheet melt.

These harrowing warnings often seem to arise in response to observations of glacier calving events – large glaciers fissuring and breaking off from the ice sheet.
But glaciologists know that calving events are indicative of ice sheet thickening, not thinning. Glaciers calve when the ice accumulation has become so heavy and thick that the base of the ice sheet can no longer bear the load.

Image Source: Christmann et al., 2016
Yes, portions of Antarctica are undergoing ice melt. But ice sheet recession and advancement are both natural. And modern ice melt is well within the range of what occurs naturally for Antarctica.
Indeed, as Jones et al. (2016) conclude, natural variability “overwhelms” any forced response in satellite era trend observations.

Image Source: Jones et al., 2016
In two new papers, scientists identify the natural mechanisms driving the recession of some of West Antarctica’s glaciers in recent decades.
Scott et al. (2019) conclude surface melt is driven by wind currents and downwelling longwave radiation from clouds.
Stewart et al. (2019) find localized solar heating of surface water can explain melting in small portions of the Ross Ice Shelf.
Considering the total Antarctic meltwater contribution to sea level rise may only amount to 0.34 of a centimeter since 1958 (Frederikse et al., 2018), it is quite reasonable to conclude that nothing unusual, unprecedented, or concerning is occurring in Antarctica that could be said to fall outside the range of natural variability.

More pain for consumers. Electricity prices in Germany climb to a new high, reaching 30.85 cents (euro) per kilowatt hour. Experts warn transition to green energies may lead to shortages, higher prices.
German online national daily Die Welt here reports on how electricity prices in the country have reached “a new high” and that natural gas prices are high as well.
The German national news daily writes: “Electricity has never been as expensive for private households in Germany as it is this year.”
“Prices have risen to a new high,” Die Welt reports, citing the latest data from German Federal Network Agency.
For the first time, electricity prices for consumers reached 30 cents (euro) per kilowatt-hour, making German electric prices among the highest in the world.

Citing data from the Federal Network Agency, the average price soared to 30.85 cents (euro) per kilowatt hour, which works out to be an increase of almost 3.3 percent compared to just a year earlier. Last year the average price for one kilowatt hour was 29.88 cents.
According to Die Welt: “The Federal Network Agency evaluates the data of well over 1000 electricity suppliers.”
Why is electricity so expensive in Germany?
The Federal Network Agency puts the blame on the electricity wholesalers who, according to Die Welt, “pass on increases to the electricity exchange”.
And an end in the rising price spiral remains elusive, experts warn.
“Wholesale prices for electricity could continue to rise,” Die Welt reports. Large power producers such as RWE, warn that future plant closures due to the transition to green energies and the phasing out of the country’s nuclear power plants will “lead to a shortage”.
Die Welt ends its article: “The largest block on the electricity bill, however, are taxes, levies and allocations, which account for more than half of the total price.” One major price driver are the mandatory, exorbitantly high green energy feed-in tariffs that grid operators are forced to pay.

"You never forget the first time you see an iceberg. The horizon of a ship at sea is a two dimensional space and to see a three dimensional piece of ice appear in the ocean is quite something. But, in truth, the first iceberg you see is likely to be small. Most icebergs that make it far enough north from Antarctica to where they are danger to shipping are sometimes many years old and at the end of their lives. They are small fragments of what once left the continent. Once in a while, however, a monster breaks free from the edge of Antarctica and drifts away. Tens of kilometres long these bergs can tower perhaps 100 metres above the sea and reach several hundred more below the surface. These are called tabular icebergs – and while it is rare for humans to see something on such a scale they are part of the normal cycle of glacial ice in Antarctica. Everyone knows Antarctica is an ice-covered continent, but the ice is not static. To a scientist it is a dynamic environment – it’s just a question of the timescale you are looking at. Snow falls on the continent and over time it has built up layers of ice which flow in glaciers towards the coast.  On reaching the sea, these glaciers fracture and release icebergs or form large regions of floating ice known as ice shelves. In a few special places glaciers can extend tens of kilometres into the ocean – giant fingers of ice several hundred metres thick, pointing out into the sea. Just like a wall they shield what is in their lee, and rather than the ocean being covered by drifting sea ice it can remain open throughout the year to form what is called a polynya. The ocean still freezes, but the ice is constantly pushed away by the prevailing winds. Open water throughout winter helps seals and penguins survive, and stimulates phytoplankton production.  A new research article in the journal Nature Communications by a French team working in Antarctica has looked at the history of the polynya in the lee of the Mertz Glacier going back 250 years. This glacier forms one of these fingers of ice reaching out from the continent and the polynya in its lee can be up to 6,000 square kilometres. What they did was take a core sample of sediment from the sea bed in the lee region (the red star in the above images) and look back in time using climate proxies such as the titanium content – which can be considered a proxy for the how much of the sediment comes from the land.  The proxies tell us which species of plankton dominated the region in a particular period: if the sediment is dominated by species which live in open water then they can infer that the polynya existed and so the Mertz Glacier had a long tongue extending north. If the sediment is dominated by species which live in the sea ice, then the polynya and the glacier tongue were absent. It is quite an elegant way to investigate glacier flow.  What they found is that every 70 or so years the Mertz polynya is absent for tens of years. Given that the glacier is advancing about 1 km per year this means a super-iceberg tens of kilometres in length has regularly formed in this region. These days we can see this happen in almost real time through the amazing access we have to satellite imagery and in February 2010 an iceberg containing almost 900 billion tonnes of fresh water broke free. You may think it would drift north, away from the continent, but icebergs this big don’t have an easy path. They crash and bounce along any relatively shallow region of the sea floor and wipe out anything in their way. Most people know trawling harms the sea floor; imagine the trail of damage 900 billion tonnes of ice scraping on the sea floor can leave. Very large icebergs get identifying codes; this one became C28 as it was the 28th large iceberg from this sector of Antarctica. It took two months for C28 to reach the deep water before it shattered into two pieces (C28A and C28B since you ask) both still massive, and both went on to spawn further icebergs as they fractured into ever smaller pieces over the next few years. When still close to shore these giant bergs are bad news for penguins, who suddenly have to travel much further – around the iceberg – to find open sea, and their food. Chicks growing up near a massive iceberg may starve and die and some entire colonies may become unviable. As they drift away these huge icebergs create their own habitat cooling the seas and freshening the waters, and also seeding the oceans with iron which means more algae and plankton at the bottom of the food chain in remote locations such as South Georgia, where icebergs run aground and die.  Over the past 50 or so years the robust cycle of growth and decay in the Mertz glacier has broken down. The researchers think this is due to large-scale changes in the way the wind circulates over Antarctica – the so-called Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Other studies have shown us that the way the SAM has changed over recent decades has an anthropogenic footprint. It seems even in Antarctica we can identify human impacts on climate processes that are likely to have been operating for thousands of years."
"It was more than 100F (38C) in the attic where telephone technician Brent Robinson was working. The 55-year-old, who had worked for 30 years at Verizon, was installing a phone service for a residential customer in Rancho Cucamonga, 40 miles east of Los Angeles in southern California. He had been out for days sick earlier in the week. After he finished the job in Rancho Cucamonga, he collapsed in the car park of a grocery store where he had gone for a cool drink; paramedics could not revive him. Robinson, who died in 2011, is one of dozens of workers who die every year because of heat exposure. In 2018, 60 workers died due to temperature extremes, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data on workplace fatalities. Though the climate crisis is creating conditions where workers are facing hotter temperatures on a more frequent basis, there are no federal safety protections for workers in extreme temperatures, and only three states, California, Washington and Minnesota, have heat stress workplace protection standards. The fatality was one of several over that decade suffered by telecommunications technicians on the job. According to the CWA, it was the last fatality since the union began pushing to include heat stress workplace standards in collective bargaining agreements. “Unfortunately these catastrophic events have to occur to get employer’s adequate attention,” said David LeGrande, now retired Occupational Safety & Health Director for the CWA. The CWA represented Robinson at Verizon at the time of the incident, and LeGrande was one of the leads involved with the union’s investigation of Robinson’s death. LeGrande said: “We are, to my knowledge, the first union that has negotiated protective language with employers. That has been carried out on a national basis.” Verizon did not respond to requests for comment. According to projections conducted by the not-for-profit organization Climate Central, the number of dangerous heat days for 133 US cities, will increase from 20 a year on average in 2000 to 58 in 2050. A dangerous heat day is defined as one in which the heat index, accounting for heat and humidity, exceeds 104F (40C). “Climate change means it’s only getting hotter, and workers are at exposure for all kinds of excessive heat,” Judy Chu, a Democratic congresswoman from California, told the Guardian. Earlier this year, she introduced the Asuncion Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act of 2019, which would direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) to issue and enforce standards to protect workers from heat-related risks on the job. Chu said: “It all started when I was in the California state assembly. The United Farm Workers came to me about the situation with Asuncion Valdivia. He was a farmworker picking grapes for 10 hours straight when he collapsed in 105F temperatures. “Instead of having any kind of proper treatment for him, a supervisor told his son to take him home. They didn’t even call an ambulance. On the way home, the son saw his father foam at the mouth, fall over and die. So the son had to watch his father die of a preventable heat stroke.” In the California state assembly, Chu authored a bill for the California division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/Osha) to enforce heat standard protections for outdoor workers, which passed in 2005, making California the first state in the US to mandate employers to provide workers with periods of rest, shade and adequate water while doing outdoor work. In 2015, the state of California settled two lawsuits brought by the United Farm Workers. “Those called for greater protections for all outdoor workers in high heat temperatures and also called for establishing a mechanism where farmworkers can call us directly to report complaints to CalL/Osha,” said Marichel Meija, national field coordinator for the United Farm Workers Foundation. “We now have regular communications with Cal/Osha to ensure situations are investigated.” Now the United Farm Workers and several other organizations are pushing for similar standards to be enforced across the US. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 1992 and 2016, 783 workers in the US died and more than 69,000 workers suffered serious injuries due to heat exposure on the job, though labor advocates argue the real numbers are even higher due to widespread under-reporting and employers misclassifying worker deaths as non-work-related. “We’ve had issues where workers are not classified as dying because of their job when we know that is the case,” said Rebecca Reindel, senior safety and health specialist at the AFL-CIO union federation. “With heat you’re running into a lot of vulnerable workers, immigrant workers, where employers will pass it off, say something else happened, and no one is following up and that person’s family don’t know their rights to get it classified as a workplace fatality.” As workers in the US are facing workplace environments that are getting hotter, and experiencing extreme temperatures more frequently, critics say the Trump administration has refused to address the problem. In an April 2019 report, the AFL-CIO noted federal Osha’s inspections related to heat declined by 49% under the Trump administration’s first two fiscal years in office. More than 130 organizations petitioned Osha in 2018 to develop federal heat standards, with Chu prompted by the agency’s inaction to introduce legislation in Congress. “This bill would have such a high impact for so many workers forced to work every day in conditions they can’t control,” said Reindel of the AFL-CIO union federation. “It’s a structure to identify the hazards. These programs are really good because workers are part of the process, and when workers are part of the process that’s when you get to the root of the problem.” According to an Osha spokesperson, the agency launches a heat awareness campaign annually the Friday before Memorial Day, has been educating employers and workers about the dangers of working in heat since 2011, and in 2017 helped update an app for heat safety. The agency did not respond to requests for comment on petitions calling the agency to enact federal heat safety standards."
"Greta Thunberg summed up 2019 in five words: “Our house is on fire.” In Australia, this is now literally the case. Wildfires there have been raging for more than a month and now span an area larger than Switzerland. The situation bears all the hallmarks of a hot new world: lives lost, livelihoods ruined and species pushed towards extinction, accompanied by government inaction, industry PR spin, abetting rightwing echo chambers, and taxpayers footing the multibillion-dollar bill. Insanely, the Australian government remains in denial – ignoring the science, downplaying the seriousness and subservient to coal. The fossil fuel industry, meanwhile, is busy greenwashing and gaslighting: Chevron is boasting about its $1m donation – 0.00667% of its annual earnings – to the Australian Red Cross, and Exxon Australia just wants everyone to “Stay safe and have fun”. All this is set to a backdrop of mutually reinforcing rightwing new outlets, online bots and trolls, which are distracting and misinforming the public about the science and politics of climate-catalyzed fires. The charity of everyday people (and some celebrities) rising to meet the disaster has been inspiring and essential. Yet, tragically, it also unintentionally serves to reinforce the false narrative, perpetuated by fossil fuel propagandists, that we are all equally to blame. In reality, today’s climate chaos is big oil’s legacy, not ours. Unlike the rest of us, the fossil fuel industry saw this climate chaos coming, then literally and figuratively added fuel to the fire, doubling down on a business model incompatible with the science of stopping global warming; buying political inaction; and building a global climate denial and delay machine that has confused the public and fomented distrust of science, media and government. In October last year, the US Congress began to investigate this history. Before a packed audience at a congressional subcommittee hearing titled Examining the Oil Industry’s Efforts to Suppress the Truth about Climate Change, the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned the climate scientist Dr Martin Hoffert about his collaborative research with Exxon in the 1980s. “So in 1982,” she said, referring to a recently uncovered internal company memo containing a graph of global carbon dioxide and temperature levels rising over time, “1982 – seven years before I was even born – Exxon accurately predicted that by this year, 2019, the Earth would hit a carbon dioxide concentration of 415 parts per million and a temperature increase of 1C. Dr Hoffert, is that correct?” “We were excellent scientists,” answered the former New York University physics professor, triggering laughter from the audience. “Yes, you were; yes, you were,” the congresswoman agreed. “So they knew.” This was the first time that Congress – indeed, any legislative body in the world – had heard a firsthand account – from someone who was actually involved in the work – of just how much, and how early, the fossil fuel industry knew of the potential global warming dangers of its products. The event showed how effective such hearings can be. In the space of a couple of hours, expert witness testimony (including by one of us) and thousands of pages of documented evidence entered the congressional record. Masterful questioning helped translate a key whistleblower’s knowledge into a viral C-Span moment. It was just one hearing, but it had the makings of the tobacco industry investigations led by Representative Henry Waxman in the 1990s. He could just as easily have been speaking about fossil fuels when he described the purpose of that congressional oversight: “To build a public record and eventually create enough momentum in Congress and among the American public for legislation.” Our message to Congress after its first foray into investigating fossil fuels is this: keep going. Because big oil is the new big tobacco. Investigative journalism and peer-reviewed research, including our own, clearly demonstrate that the fossil fuel regime has deliberately denied Americans and Congress their right to be accurately informed about the climate crisis, just as tobacco companies misled Americans about the harms of smoking. From strategy to networks to personnel to rhetoric, the fossil fuel regime’s efforts to deny and delay come straight out of big tobacco’s playbook. The historical record is incontrovertible. As we summarize in a recent report, the fossil fuel industry’s own internal documents reveal that it has been studying CO2 pollution for more than 60 years. As early as the 1950s, it knew its products had the potential to change the climate. By the late 1970s and early 80s, Exxon scientists were explicitly aware that burning fossil fuels could lead to what they called “catastrophic” global warming. In 1986, an internal “greenhouse effect working group” at Shell concluded: “The changes in climate … may be the greatest in recorded history.” For all the skeletons we have already found in big oil’s closet, we are still only looking through the keyhole But instead of taking action or warning the public, fossil fuel interests stayed quiet. Then, in the late 1980s and early 90s, when global warming finally caught the world’s attention, the carbon majors sprang to action and took the low road, spending billions of dollars over the next 30 years on advertising and lobbying challenging science, slandering scientists and attacking policies to protect their profits. In so doing, they have undermined – and continue to undermine – Americans’ chances of a just and stable future. Today, the case for subterfuge is so strong that New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and 14 US cities and counties have variously sued ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel companies for fraud, damages or denial. Maui and Honolulu have recently added their intentions to file lawsuits. In Australia, there are mounting calls to make polluters, not just taxpayers, pay for wildfire relief and climate mitigation. For all the skeletons we have already found in big oil’s closet, however, we are still only looking through the keyhole. Tracking down a few hundred documents has allowed us to uncover some key cogs in the climate denial machine. Yet it is a sprawling, well-funded, well-oiled network that stretches far beyond ExxonMobil and the Kochs: a labyrinth of people and money connecting fossil fuel companies, utilities, ancillary manufacturers, trade associations, PR firms, advertising agencies, libertarian foundations, thinktanks, legal firms and individuals, all feeding an echo chamber of pundits, astroturf groups, blogs, media and, yes, politicians. Network analysis has identified at least 4,556 individuals and 164 organizations in the global web of denial. We believe the American public deserve to know the truth – and see the receipts – of these dealings that have already led to deaths, destruction and the injustices of a collapsing climate. This is where congressional authority to request documents and, if necessary, issue subpoenas, comes in. Key breakthroughs in tobacco control came as congressional investigations – as well as legal discovery and industry whistleblowers – exposed thousands, and ultimately millions, of damning documents. The tobacco industry was found guilty of racketeering in part because of the ways that individual companies had coordinated with each other and with third-party allies to present false information to consumers. That history is a precedent for Congress to investigate an industry network that has misled the public and policymakers in an effort to deny the dangers of its products and derail regulation. As the congressional scholar Morton Rosenberg recently testified in the Senate: “Congress and its committees have virtually plenary power to compel production of information needed to discharge their legislative functions.” We are not politicians or political strategists, so we do not presume to dictate how Congress exercises its investigatory powers. But as experts in the history of climate denial and global warming politics, it is our opinion that holding the fossil fuel industry accountable would be one of the most impactful ways for Congress – and governments around the world – to combat the climate crisis. Impeachment investigations understandably occupy much attention. Unfortunately, irreversible global warming and the fossil fuel regime underwriting it will be even harder to unseat than a president, and time is not on our side. Geoffrey Supran is a research associate in the department of the history of science at Harvard University, where he investigates the tactics of fossil fuel interests. He previously co-led the fossil fuel divestment campaign at MIT, as well as the first major scientist protests against the Trump administration Naomi Oreskes is professor of the history of science at Harvard University and the co-author, with Erik M Conway, of Merchants of Doubt and The Collapse of Western Civilization"
"Britain’s tallest tree is a 200-year-old, 44-metre high beech growing in woods in West Sussex, according to the Tree Register.  Although this incredible beech, found on the National Trust’s Devil’s Dyke estate, is slightly taller than the previous champion – another of this genus in Gloucestershire – these are not actually the tallest living trees in Britain but the tallest native trees – ones known to have been growing in Britain since the last ice age.  If we included all trees – native or those introduced at a later date – there would be others in the running. Currently the tallest tree growing in the UK is a Douglas fir growing in Reelig Glen, near Inverness which measures just over a massive 66 metres. Height, of course, is not the only thing that can make a tree stand out. Other categories competing for most impressive tree include age and mythology. Here are four others that fit the bill. When Nottinghamshire residents go just about anywhere in the world and explain where they live, the immediate response is “Aaah! Robin Hood!”  Famous around the world for harbouring the infamous folk hero, the “Major Oak” is one of Britain’s oldest oak trees. No one is sure exactly how old it is but estimates of 800 to 1,000-years-old mean that it has survived through at least eight centuries of change. The major is a fine example of Quercus robur, or the English Oak, and brings thousands of tourists to Sherwood Forest every year. Sadly visitors can no longer climb inside the tree as it is now fenced off and to prevent them from falling, the massive branches are propped up on large poles.  It is debatable whether Robin and his Merry Men did actually hide inside this tree but keeping things inside it has been recorded several times during its history, initially as the “Cockpen Tree” when it was used to contain birds before a cock fight. It was only named the Major Oak in the late 1700s after Major Hayman Rooke, the local historian who described it. In the 19th century it was known for a while as the “Queen Oak”. Nottinghamshire is also home to the original Bramley apple tree. Bramleys are large, sour apples well known all over the world for their cooking quality, and they all descend from one 200-year-old tree which still exists today. The tree was first grown from a pip in 1809 in a back garden in Southwell by a young local girl called Mary Ann Brailsford. Once the quality of the fruit had been noted in the 1860s the tree was propagated by Merryweather’s Nursery, also in Southwell.  It’s astonishing to imagine that every single Bramley apple tree across the world has been cloned from this original tree (or indeed from a clone of a clone of a clone of this original tree)  originally grown from a pip so many years ago by a little girl. Although the original was grown from seed, new Bramley apple trees are grafted onto another type of apple tree to help reproduce them. Bramleys are also sterile, able to receive pollen but not able to pollinate other Bramleys themselves. This is because they have an extra set of chromosomes, which means they need two other different types of apple tree to pollinate – otherwise their apples won’t grow and swell. We have to move along to Wales to see Britain’s oldest tree, a 5,000-year-old yew growing in St Cynog’s churchyard at Defynnog near Sennybridge, Powys.   It’s not surprising that this is a yew, as these conifers have an amazing ability to regenerate. For centuries yews have been known as the “tree of life” due to their longevity. When the centre dies away and they become hollow, the cylindrical shape of the trunk is actually amazingly strong and is still able to support the massive crown of the tree.  Yew trees have been long associated with churches and graveyards and in ancient legends they were associated with immortality. In Wales the tradition of the yew as such a symbol is linked with ancient Druid beliefs and customs, and was often a meeting place where rituals and festivities took place. Finally, the award for the tree with the widest trunk goes to another English Oak with an amazing 12-metre circumference. This tree is known as the “Majesty” and is growing in Fredville Park, in Kent. Although the tree is completely hollow, the trunk has not split. One journal entry recorded a visit to the tree in 1793: Call on John Plumtree, Esq. of Fredville, who very politely shews us his famous oak, called Majesty - measure this tree; 4 feet from the ground the circumference is 31 feet; it is supposed to contain from 36 to 42 tons of timber. Two branches separated from this tree about four years ago, in a calm day, which contained three tons of timber. Another oak, called Beauty, 14 tons of timber; girt, 4 feet from the ground, 16 feet 4 inches, is 63 feet high, perfectly straight, and a beauty indeed!"
"Planning permission has been given for what could become the world’s largest offshore wind farm on the Dogger Bank, off England’s east coast. If fully constructed the project will have up to 400 turbines with a total generation capacity of 2.4 GW. That’s enough to power 1.9 million households – more than Manchester and Birmingham combined. So why now? And why so big? It seems the UK government is essentially taking a punt on the future of offshore wind. Investment in a more expensive renewable technology at an earlier stage means a premium is being paid in the hope it will kick-start a whole industry. This would in turn reduce costs, while generating low-carbon electricity out of sight. Dogger Bank, located more than 80 miles off the Yorkshire coast, is indeed far out of sight. It seems a good location for a wind farm. The region was an island during much of the last ice age and today it has shallow water, seabed conditions well-suited to the foundations of wind turbines and of course strong, consistent wind. Its development nevertheless raises a number of technical and logistical challenges, notably linked to the influence of the weather on the maritime supply chain. No wind farm has yet been built that far from land. Furthermore, it still needs to secure contracts for government subsidies. With fewer neighbours to annoy, offshore wind farms are generally less contested than their onshore equivalents. Offshore wind can have nevertheless a detrimental impact on the natural environment, like disturbance to the seabed by laying cables. But it seems there could be an overall positive effect on marine wildlife as the “artificial reef effect” helps fish group together. Electricity generated by onshore wind can now compete on cost with electricity generated with conventional sources such as gas. But offshore projects from the last licensing “round 3” issued in 2010 are often located in large zones far from the coast such as Dogger Bank, which pushes up costs. Nevertheless, prices could easily come down. Indeed, as solar power has recently shown, renewable energy technologies can become dramatically cheaper once they achieve maturity and the technology is scaled up. While long-term projections of future electricity costs are always uncertain,  offshore wind could become cheaper through better technology, economies of scale and through optimised designs becoming standardised. Dogger Bank could be a big part of this – the first of a series of large wind farms which will gain strength in numbers and reduce generating costs. There are many reasons a country might want to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Energy generated from oil and gas causes air pollution and environmental degradation, while still requiring subsidies just like renewables. As demonstrated by the late economist Shimon Awerbuch, volatile fossil fuel prices on the international market have a detrimental impact on modern economies. More renewables makes sense to mitigate the impact of future international energy crisis. It looks as though offshore wind is now the preferred path for the UK government to meet renewable energy targets. It hopes offshore will provide 8-10% of the UK’s electricity by 2020. Offshore carries a much lower political cost than its onshore equivalent, with wind turbines anywhere near either homes or areas of natural beauty facing very vocal opposition.  From 2030s, it can be expected that the cost per unit for this technology will be cheaper than for so called “clean” coal or “clean” gas generation while generating far less carbon emissions and pollution. But, if the UK is to decrease drastically its dependence on fossils fuels and decarbonise its electricity sector, offshore wind cannot be a substitute to the development of other renewable energy sources and to the systematic implementation of large-scale energy savings programmes."
"The lynx: a short-tailed felid weighing up to six times more than your domestic moggy. This large carnivore once roamed the British Isles 1,300 years ago but, due to habitat destruction, overhunting of its prey and purposeful killing by humans, the species was driven to extinction in the UK. Now, there are plans to reintroduce this species to three sites in England and Scotland. But what are the chances of a success? The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has strict guidelines for reintroducing species into the wild.  One of the key recommendations they make is that the main causes of the historical decline must be addressed to ensure success of the reintroduction.   In terms of the threats to lynx, we now have stringent land management policies in place so it is unlikely that the cat’s preferred forested habitat will be destroyed.  The previous decline in the prey base (notably deer) is also not a problem today – in fact, many would agree that we have too many deer due to the lack of natural predators. But it is unclear to what extent the last threat – the purposeful killing by humans – is under control. Previous research has noted that the main cause of death among carnivores that have been reintroduced is due to humans. Although attitudes towards carnivores are generally positive in the UK, they become more negative among the people that could be adversely affected by these species and it is these people who have the power to kill. These are the farmers, gamekeepers and hunters (all of whom are allowed to own guns) who will be sharing their land with this species and may be worried about the damage that lynx can cause. The IUCN clearly states: Any translocation will impact and be impacted by human interests. Social, economic and political factors must be integral to translocation feasibility and design. These factors will also influence implementation and often require an effective, multi-disciplinary team, with technical and social expertise representing all interests.   Much research to date has looked into the biological factors surrounding the potential success of reintroducing lynx (eg. here, here and here), but far less attention has been focused on these important social, economic or political aspects. And it is the human dimension that will play a large part in dictating whether this project succeeds or fails. It is therefore worrying that amongst the main proponents of the lynx reintroduction, only one social scientist is listed on its team of experts (the rest being biologists).  This is not uncommon amongst species reintroduction projects: the Scottish Beaver Trial reintroduction team also does not have a social scientist. Given the widespread call among conservationists to include more social science into wildlife management schemes, it is disheartening to see that more is not being done in this country to integrate the human aspects of conservation into environmental projects. Although I cannot deny that the lynx would bring positive effects to this country by reducing deer populations (which might have additional benefits for young trees), we cannot disregard the potential negatives. Lynx can occasionally kill livestock, which could have economic and psychological costs.   The frequency of predation may be low, but this has not stopped the continual persecution of reintroduced predators in other parts of the world, such as the Mexican wolf. Indeed, the reintroduction of lynx in France failed because of hunting.  It is therefore crucial that we do not underestimate the potential for opponents of the lynx reintroduction to negatively impact the success of the project. Research in other areas of Europe has shown that attitudes towards lynx are, in general, positive.  It is likely that this is the case in the UK too, and I am sure that many British people would love to have lynx wandering the countryside again.  Like the Scottish Wildlife Trust, I too feel that we have a moral and ecological case to bring this species back, but until more extensive work is undertaken to address the threat of human persecution, I do not hold out much hope for this felid’s future in the UK."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenland’s ice sheet mass losses have significantly decelerated since 2013 – a reversal from the rapid retreat from the 1990s to 2012 driven by cloud forcing and the NAO (Ruan et al., 2019). The post-2013 “relatively stable” ice sheet even gained mass during 2017-’18 (Andersen et al., 2019).

Ruan et al., 2019    
Decelerated Greenland Ice Sheet Melt Driven
by Positive Summer North Atlantic Oscillation
“The GrIS lost mass at a rate of about -102 Gt/yr in early 2003, increased to -393 Gt/yr during 2012-2013, but suddenly reduced to no more than 75 Gt/yr during 2013-2014 (Bevis et al., 2019). It is suggested that this deceleration is due to the increased snowfall accumulation driven by the positive phase of summer North Atlantic Oscillation (sNAO; Folland et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2015).”
“It is shown that the deceleration of GrIS melting since 2013 is due to the reduction in short-wave solar radiation in the presence of increasing total cloud cover, which is driven by a more persistent positive summer North Atlantic Oscillation (sNAO) on the decadal time scale.”
“After an extreme year of the GrIS mass loss in 2012 (Tedsco et al., 2013; Nghiem et al., 2012) the rate of mass loss dramatically decreased since 2013 and has returned to about the same level (or even less) as was observed during 2004-2005. This indicates that the deceleration in GrIS mass loss since 2013 is mostly attributable to a reduction in the total mass loss during the summer season.”
“[T]he total cloud cover decreased with a rate of around 0.5% per year before 2013 in most of Greenland except the northeast area. As a result, the melt-albedo feedback is enhanced (Hofer et al., 2017) and the increased shortwave radiation over the low albedo ablation zone leads to accelerated melt of the GrIS (Box et al., 2012; Van-Angelen et al., 2012; Franco et al., 2013). Since 2013, the total cloud cover over most of southeast Greenland increased at a rate of more than 0.1% per year.”
“The lower SLP over Greenland is also consistent with the dramatic cooling of the northern North Atlantic Ocean during the same period. On the surface, the mean summer sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre is more than 2ºC colder than the SST during 2003-2013; in the upper 300m, the volume mean ocean temperature is nearly 1.6ºC less (Fig. 6). The cooling of the ocean is not only helpful for the atmospheric configuration over the Greenland, but also favorable for the reduction of mass loss due to warmer water intrusion into the marine-terminated glaciers, though the latter process explains only around 30-50 Gt of the total mass budget of the GrIS (Zwally et al., 2002; Box et al., 2009; Tedstone et al., 2013).”


Andersen et al., 2019
Update of annual calving front lines for 47 marine
terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland (1999–2018)
“Currently, the mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet is the largest Arctic contributor to global sea-level rise (van den Broeke et al. 2009, 2017; Box et al. 2018).”
“The period 2007–2012 underwent a rapid loss of glacier area, compared to 2013–2018, in which glacier area was relatively stable, associated with a small area change. The year 2017–2018 stands out as the only period with net area gain (+4.1 km2).”

It’s time to take the debate away from the extreme factions and to move it to cooler heads, says veteran Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann
Former German Public television meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann wrote an essay commentary for the Swiss online Die Weltwoche here titled “Tell me where you stand”, where he compares today’s white-hot intolerance seen in climate science to the political intolerance witnessed in former communist East Germany.
“Religious furor”
In East Germany, either you adhered to the state’s hard communist doctrine, or you were the enemy. Such is the atmosphere we see today in climate science. Kachelmann writes: “Again today it’s either-or, and nothing in between.”
“Debates are important, and we must conduct them with arguments and without the religious furor that is being practiced today by both sides.”
The veteran meteorologist describes how on the climate issue “there are two irreconcilable camps”: the climate deniers and climate hysterics – each arrogantly claiming “infallibility”. It is no longer possible to be in between. Even those in between get insulted and attacked equally by both sides.
Natural science at schools have been “almost completely gutted”
While Kachelmann writes “deniers” are mostly older, right wing persons, the alarmists are made up of mostly “ugly young people” who are the products of school systems that have had their “natural science subjects almost completely gutted out”.
“These people don’t need graphs, but rather the godlike feeling of being on the correct side, which is why you don’t have to be so precise with facts,” Kachelmann comments.
“Today, the divining militancy of both sides is preventing a serious debate on priorities,” He says. “The green and brown nuts try to recruit for their political advantage those who have a big opinion on the subject, but no idea about it.”
Academic (green) supremacists
One example of the militant intolerance Kachelmann describes is illustrated by a recent Twitter comment by Potsdam scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, who reacted to German parliamentarian Philipp Lengsfeld, who earlier had tweeted on a “remarkable” statement recently published by 90 leading Italian scientists who challenged the alarmist climate science and claims of consensus.

That comment by Lengsfeld was obviously too much for Rahmstorf, who was obviously unnerved that a parliamentarian would make such an observation. He not only attacks Lengsfeld and this site here, but he also insults and slanders the 70 Italian scientists.
His Twitter comment in English:
It is particularly noteworthy when a member of parliament cannot distinguish a climate denier website from serious science and falls for a list of signatures by predominantly unprofessional and emeritus people – even more untrustworthy than the lung physicians.”
In Rahmstorf’s view, anyone who challenges the Potsdam alarmist climate position is an enemy of the climate state, and any scientist who questions the science is equivalent to a tobacco scientist.
Yes, its’ time to move the debate and science over to moderate voices.

"A mission to Mars has captured the public’s imagination and the possibility of making that second small step has never seemed so close. Current NASA plans include sending humans to the red planet as early as the 2030s.  Should we ever establish colonies on Mars, we’d need to build power generation engines. This would imply finding energy sources and working substances to convert heat into useful energy. Now, in research published in the journal Nature Communications, my colleagues and I have found a way to make this happen using a substance easily found on the planet: the solid form of carbon dioxide, known as dry ice. We have developed an engine which can harvest energy from dry ice as it turns from solid into gas. For Martian exploration, it could be a game changer. To understand why, let’s go back to Earth for a moment. Here, we use water to turn the energy stored in coal, oil or gas into useful mechanical or electrical energy through what is known as a “heat engine”. In a steam engine, the most common form of heat engine, fuel is used to heat up water which then vapourises into high-pressure steam. This steam then powers a turbine to generate electricity, or a locomotive engine to create motion. Water is an ideal substance to use as it is widely available and cheap, and it is capable of undergoing a phase change (from liquid to vapour) within temperature ranges that are easily achievable with our current technology on Earth.  This whole situation changes dramatically on Mars; although water is still available on the surface of the red planet, it is locked in solid form. Heating it to melting point and then to boiling point to use it as a working substance requires a lot of energy.  However Martian dry ice already exists close to its “sublimation point” – the temperature at which it turns directly from solid to gas. It therefore only takes a relatively small nudge for dry ice to change states. The challenge is to harness the energy released by this change to power a heat engine – or even a whole colony. We turned to a common scientific effect you’ve probably noticed before in your kitchen. When a water droplet is placed on a hot surface held above 100ºC it boils off, creating steam. However when the surface is heated above a certain temperature, known as the Leidenfrost point, the water no longer boils away. Instead, the drop sits on a layer of its own vapour and levitates on top of the surface. This is known as the Leidenfrost effect. This same effect allows dry ice to levitate freely on top of solid surfaces, as it directly changes from solid to vapour and therefore it too is kept afloat by a layer of newly-formed gas. We can put this to use. By placing water droplets and small blocks of dry ice on top of hot, turbine-like surfaces, we have used the Leidenfrost effect to create rotational motion. The turbines channel the released vapour, whose flow in turn drives the levitating surface above to rotate. In a series of experiments, we have shown that carbon dioxide is a viable working substance for heat engines. By channelling the vapour released upon sublimation of dry ice discs on top of turbine-like surfaces, we have been able to use dry ice to power an electrical generator. Crucially, the vapour produced by the dry ice discs generates enough pressure to overcome gravity, lifting the disc off the turbine surface through the Leidenfrost effect. The discs thus become levitating rotors, meaning the engine is extremely low-friction.  You won’t find solid dry ice occurring naturally here on Earth. However satellite images from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show the situation is very different on the surface of Mars where large gullies can be found, about 2 km in length. These structures are very different from Earth’s water gullies.  Instead of fanning out at their bottom end as you would expect from a gully created by water, Mars’ gullies end in a pit-shaped apron. NASA scientists have recently shown that such shapes might be caused by gliding boulders of solid dry ice, which sublimate (turn to gas) as temperatures rise in the Martian summer. Carbon dioxide thus plays a similar role on Mars to water on Earth. It is a widely available resource which undergoes cyclic phase changes under the natural Martian temperature variations. Perhaps future power stations on Mars will exploit all this CO2 to harvest the energy from the sublimation phase change as dry-ice blocks evaporate, or to channel the chemical energy extracted from other carbon-based sources, such as methane gas. One thing is certain; our future on other planets depends on our ability to adapt our knowledge to the constraints imposed by strange worlds, and to devise creative ways to exploit resources that do not naturally occur here on Earth."
"Almost all of us walk somewhere every day of our lives. According to the UK’s most recent National Travel Survey 22% of all trips are undertaken on foot – and walking continues to be the second-most important form of transport for all journeys after travel by car or van. For short trips of less than a mile, walking is totally dominant accounting for over 78% of all such travel. One third of all trips less than five miles in length are also on foot.  By contrast, cycling accounts for just 1.5% of all journeys. Even if we only look at all trips under five miles, cycling still makes up less than 2% of journeys.  But you wouldn’t get this impression from listening to politicians, reading policy documents, or observing investment in infrastructure. While both cycling and walking improve personal health and the environment, one gets far more attention than the other. The government has just released its response to a major consultation on its “vision for cycling and walking”, for instance. The document’s name? Cycling Delivery Plan. Although walking is given some consideration in the detail of the document, the priority is clear. While cycling is being actively promoted as a healthy and sustainable form of urban transport, walking remains largely neglected in terms of active policy and investment. Look at London’s “cycle superhighways”, for instance, announced earlier this year to much fanfare. These highways follow significant increases in trips by bike in central London following investment in new infrastructure promoted by the London mayor.  Such investment is of course welcome and long overdue, and much remains to be done as cycle infrastructure remains poor in most other parts of the country. But the fact cycling is beginning to be considered an important form of urban transport that needs to be planned for highlights the fact that travel on foot is not given such recognition. It can, of course, be argued that pedestrians do already have their own dedicated infrastructure – in urban areas at least – in the form of pavements, pedestrian zones, and crossings. For the most part we accept these conditions as adequate and do not question how they might be better, however a closer look suggests that this is rarely the case.  In most locations, road space continues to be dominated by, and planned for, motor vehicles and people on foot are crammed on to pavements that are often too narrow. Pedestrians are made to wait for long periods to cross busy roads, exposed to traffic noise and emissions, and then given insufficient time to cross before the lights change to keep the traffic moving.  Poorly placed (and often unnecessary) street furniture, together with inconsiderately (and potentially illegally) parked cars often obstruct the pavement, while pedestrian surfaces are often poorly maintained and rarely cleared of leaves or snow and ice. Try to negotiate the average urban pavement with a child’s buggy or in a wheelchair and the difficulties become all too obvious. Poor pedestrian infrastructure disadvantages all those who do not have access to, or choose not to use, a motor vehicle. We’ve got into this situation because walking is taken for granted. Such a simple activity has been largely ignored in the planning process; it is seen as making few demands on the environment and thus needs only a minimum of facilities. In contrast, because motor vehicles make much greater demands on the environment their needs have been prioritised.  Pedestrians also suffer from being classed as “walkers” – those who walk for pleasure rather than as a means of transport. The cultural dominance and convenience of the motor vehicle has meant that urban space has been disproportionately allocated towards cars and away from pedestrians. When walking for anything other than recreation is increasingly seen as abnormal, cars will always win.  I recently headed some research in four English cities which clearly demonstrated this. As one respondent in Leeds said “you feel unusual walking”. Most respondents enjoyed walking, and did walk sometimes, but they frequently encountered unnecessary difficulties and inconveniences. The problem was summarised neatly by a Lancaster respondent: “That road is awful, the pavement is very narrow, and in autumn it’s covered in leaves so you slip over half the time, it’s terrifying. But by car the road is fine”. Walking is a cheap, simple, healthy and environmentally friendly way of travelling short distances. It is something most people enjoy doing, but our cities are built in ways that often make life difficult and unpleasant for pedestrians.  Walking needs to be taken more seriously as a means of transport (and not only as a form of exercise or leisure) – and should be actively planned for and given priority, as is beginning to happen with cycling. If more people walked and fewer people drove, it would not only benefit personal health but also cities would be more pleasant for all."
"The native peoples of Loreto, in Peru’s Amazon basin, have just ended a month long occupation of 14 oil wells belonging to the Argentine company Pluspetrol. Negotiations are still underway between the oil company and various other communities, represented by the indigenous association Feconaco. This is not the first time Feconaco has occupied Pluspetrol’s operations. Such actions on the part of indigenous groups are relatively common. Amazonian people don’t appear to have learned direct action from the occupy movement or from Euro-American protest traditions, despite the similar tactics. In the absence of functioning state protection, native people have always had to stand up for themselves.  Last September, for instance, Ka'apor people of northeastern Maranhão in Brazil published photographs of illegal loggers whom they had captured and tied up. They had taken matters into their own hands because the state was not protecting their territory. The pioneers of indigenous direct action were the Kayapó of southern Pará in Brazil, who began monitoring goldmining and later logging in their territory, which senior leaders tolerated and indeed profited from. In the early 1990s, environmental destruction and mercury poisoning led many Kayapó people to support a younger generation of leaders who expelled the miners and loggers from their territory. Images of the Kayapó have since become synonymous with indigenous environmentalism. The relative success of direct action in recent decades contrasts with the often bloody encounters that went before, from which poorly-armed Indians invariably emerged badly.  Indigenous people in the Amazon have been the victims of the mining and energy industries for hundreds of years. The earliest colonists were motivated by greed for gold, and successive waves of exploitation have followed. The violent and coercive labour relations of the rubber boom (which ended a century ago) continue to affect how local people view trade and outsiders. Fur hunters would shoot native people on sight throughout much of the 20th century. A good friend of mine, one of my principal informants in the field, fled Brazil as a child after his family were killed by fur hunters, and came to live with another tribe in the border area between French Guiana and Suriname. Here, and across the Guiana region (the vast area of northeastern Amazonia bordered by the rivers Negro, Orinoco and the lower Amazon), mining for gold, diamonds and other minerals has led to significant social conflicts. The region’s small communities are held together by personal ties of kinship and are highly dependent upon local ecosystems for their livelihoods. This makes them particularly vulnerable to the side-effects of extractive industries such as environmental destruction and pollution of rivers and lakes. But there are also social and medical effects: prostitution, alcoholism, drug addiction and the introduction of new diseases such as HIV. Mining and oil companies generally earn a bad reputation for their Amazon activities, but projects devised in the name of “sustainability” can have a negative impact too. Think in particular of the programme of hydroelectric dams being rolled out across Brazil. Belo Monte, the world’s fourth largest hydroelectric dam, is being built across a southern tributary of the Amazon, for instance. It has already caused the influx of tens of thousands of workers, with severe strain on local social relations. Its impact on a vast ecosystem – a major hydrological basin – will be monumental.  Protests against the Belo Monte dam have failed, as a Brazilian government focused on development ploughed on with its project which is, after all, consistent with the political rhetoric of the “green economy”. Indigenous people are a small section of the electorate, and their voice cuts little sway in the national political scene.  Protests against international private companies can arguably be more effective, in so far as the directors of these companies consider a poor public image to significantly affect their profits. A legal battle raging for nearly two decades between indigenous peoples in Ecuador and the energy giant Chevron, contributed to the corporation earning the title of a Lifetime Award for Shameful Corporate Behaviour by grassroots satirists in Davos earlier this year. Yet the corporate social responsibility activities which result from such pressures all too often seem to be largely cosmetic. Where direct action has succeeded it is largely thanks to the construction of new kinds of alliances between indigenous leaders, progressive and socially oriented NGOs, and independent activists, including some academics. Indigenous people in the Amazon basin have gradually, over the centuries, become more adept at getting organised and speaking the language of power. They’re now a key part of a global indigenous peoples’ movement which can call on an increasing number of activists with training in international law, documentary film making, or indeed anthropology, to assist campaigning efforts. On a smaller scale, communities regularly engage with different projects brought by outsiders, including the “partnerships” proposed by extractive industries.  However, they just as often come to regret their entrance into the relationship. Indigenous people come to realise that their understandings of fair exchanges are not the same, and sometimes not even compatible with those of their interlocutors, whether they be loggers, miners, or people looking for more intangible wealth such as traditional designs, music or ecological knowledge. These experiences show that the conflicts that sometimes arise between native people and outsiders seeking to extract natural resources are not merely conflicts of material interests, and are not structured merely by an imbalance of power. They are on a more fundamental level conflicts of worldviews, of cosmovisiones, as Afro-Colombians sometimes call them.  Indigenous people have made vast efforts to speak across the gap between themselves and others who live and move in the capitalist world. The onus is now on outsiders, including postcolonial states and transnational organisations, to make a corresponding effort."

"A double bill of plays that premiered 10 years ago and were hailed as the first big theatre productions to tackle the climate crisis head-on are to be updated and revived. The Donmar Warehouse and Theatr Clwyd are to stage Steve Waters’ The Contingency Plan, a pair of plays first performed at the tiny Bush Theatre in west London in 2009.  In his review, the Guardian’s Michael Billington called them an urgent wake-up call, presenting the issues in compelling human terms. He wrote: “We have waited a long time for a play that dealt comprehensively with climate change. Steve Waters has generously provided two.” They were directed by Michael Longhurst and Tamara Harvey, now in charge of the Donmar and Theatr Clwyd respectively and both keen for them to be seen by a wider audience. Longhurst said it felt at the time “that we were breaking through with something, that it was a major piece of work … an epic pair of plays that were really putting the subject on the agenda in an exciting and engaging theatrical form – and doing that possibly for for the first time. I think the credibility of those plays has stood up since.” They have asked Waters to update the works, looking at the science and political context. One of the plays, On the Beach, features a glaciologist who has been studying an iceberg called Pine Island that was then melting swiftly. “It’s gone now, it’s just gone,” Longhurst said. Both theatres will also work with Julie’s Bicycle, a nonprofit organisation that works within the creative industries, to ensure the coproduction is made sustainably. The revival was announced as part of Longhurst’s second season as artistic director of the Donmar. Other productions include Suzan-Lori Parks’ In the Blood and the world premiere of an adaptation by Tim Price of Ruben Östlund’s film Force Majeure, which features skiing and an avalanche. “It feels utterly impossible to put on the stage but that became the appeal of it,” said Longhurst, who will direct. “Ultimately it is a close-up, forensic look at a marriage imploding and it will be brilliant.”"

NASA GISS likes to go back in history and alter the temperature figures from recorded datasets from all around the world, and then declare global warming.
Yet when we examine the (real) unadjusted, unaltered data, we find an entirely different story: In many places there has been little or even no warming over the recent decades. Many locations have seen cooling, in fact.
For example, using the data from the Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA), I checked 12 France stations which have August temperature data going back to 1982. Seven of 12 stations show August temperatures there have not warmed since 1990!

France August temperatures haven’t risen in almost 3 decades. Data source: JMA.
Looking at the 6 stations that have complete data going back to 1996 in the Scandinavian country of Finland, we also see the same story for August:

Three of 6 Finland stations have seen a cooling trend for August since 1996. The warming at the other three are statistically insignificant. Data source: JMA.
In neighboring Sweden we also find 6 stations for which the JMA has almost complete data going back over 2 decades:

Six stations in Sweden show a cooling trend for August since 1995. Data: JMA
These show no warming as well.
So when we look at the untampered data at stations in Europe, we find that there has not been any warming over the past recent decades. The story is the same at many stations scattered around the globe.
NASA GISS claims that warming has occurred because it simply changed the data to make it appear that way. Real data tell a different story.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is another example of the tricks the mainstream media use to produce fake drama and urgency concerning sea level rise and climate change – namely omissions – and how geologist Sebastian Lüning held their feet to the fire.

Geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning puts German ARD broadcasting’s feet to the climate fire. Photo. Die kalte Sonne.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning wrote a complaint to German ARD public broadcasting concerning its December 2, 2018, one-sided reporting of the Indian island of Ghoramara and the sea level rise it is allegedly experiencing. The €6.9 billion euro publicly funded, 22,612-employee ARD is the German equivalent to the UK’s BBC.
What follows is the exchange between Lüning and the ARD editorial staff:
======================================
From: Dr. Sebastian Lüning
To: NDR Rundfunkrat
Date: 3 December 2018
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
On December 2, 2018, you reported on the Tagesschau.de evening news on the Indian island of Ghoramara, which according to your report is “sinking into the sea” due to climate change.
https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/indien-klima-ghoramara-101.html
In concrete terms, the report cites rising sea levels as the only cause. This, however, distorts the facts, as the shrinking of the island actually has a number of reasons. Although the globally rising sea level plays a role, other processes are much more important, which your correspondent Bernd Musch-Borowska fails to mention a single word about and thus ultimately over-dramatizes the role of climate change. This is all the more regrettable because the report appeared on the first day of the Katowice Climate Conference and thus casts the technical robustness of your reporting in to doubt.
In view of the enormous importance of climate change in the public debate, you should make additional efforts to avoid such one-sided and technically unbalanced presentations in your program, e.g. by consulting experts before publication.
The island of Ghoramara lies at the mouth of the Ganges. As in many deltas of the earth, strong currents prevail here, which lead to a constant rearrangement of sediment and a systematic shifting of the islands. Similar coastal dynamic processes can be observed in the area of the East Frisian Islands.
The island of Ghoramara and neighboring islands in the Sundarbans have therefore always been exposed to major morphological changes. In addition, there is a rate of subsidence of several millimeters per year, which is also typical for deltas, an amount which even exceeds the global (eustatic) sea-level rise of 2-3 millimeters per year. In addition, the construction of several dams in the catchment area of the Ganges has led to a reduced sediment load in the river and delta, further exacerbating erosion.
Also activities on the island of Ghoramara have made the problem worse. Strong groundwater removal has led to an additional compaction and lowering of the island. In addition, the islanders have removed part of the protective mangrove vegetation in the process of creating additional arable land, leaving the soil vulnerable to erosion during storms.
If you are interested, I would be happy to provide you with the relevant technical literature.
The Tagesschau article falsely suggests that sea-level rise is the main problem for Ghoramara. This is wrong. What is true is that the shrinking of the island of Ghoramara has a variety of causes, which can be divided into 1) natural, 2) non-climatic anthropogenic and 3) climatic anthropogenic causes. I would therefore like to ask you – at the same place as the original report – to list the complete range of causes so as not to provide a basis for accusations of climate dramatization on the occasion of the current climate conference in Katowice.
Best regards,
Dr. habil. Sebastian Lüning

But the editor-in-chief of ARD, Dr. Kai Gniffke, finally replied evasively on January 4, 2019. The pdf of the reply can be found here. In the reply, the ARD defended its report, writing: “Unfortunately it is not possible to address all backgrounds and developments in daily reporting.”
To which Lüning responded:

From: Dr. Sebastian Lüning
To: NDR Broadcasting Council [ARD]
Date: 10 January 2019
Dear Dr. Nenz,
Dear Dr. Gniffke,
Thank you for sending the statement. Of course, the answer is not satisfactory, because you reply to my accusation of selective and distorted reporting by claiming that the climate conference and the scarcity of the reporting justify the deliberate omission of important contextual information. The incomplete presentation, however, automatically leads to an artificial dramatization. Ultimately, it is deliberate cherry-picking.
The editorial team is thus in the same line as the former editor of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Christopher Schrader, who in your program ZAPP openly admitted that in his articles he follows a personal mission and prefers to leave scientific uncertainties unmentioned in order to prevent citizens from becoming unrestful and doubting the energy revolution.
https://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/zapp/Von-wegen-Klima-Wissenschaftsjournalisten-wettern,klima302.html
I was also surprised that another mistake had crept into your answer. You wrote that there are “more violent and more frequent storms” in the area of the Indian island of Ghoramara due to climate change. This is also wrong, especially as it is not even claimed in your original article. Studies in the northern Indian Ocean have not found a trend in tropical cyclones for the last three decades. See Hoarau et al. 2012:
https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.2406
It would be really important that you introduce quality assurance measures in your ARD editorial office in the area of climate change reporting in order to avoid such obvious mistakes and distortions. As you may know, this is not the first case. As an example, I would like to mention your reporting on the warming of the North Sea in 2017:
http://www.kaltesonne.de/um-antwort-wird-gebeten-der-fall-nordsee-erwarmung/
For the sake of transparency, I would also like to ask you to allow us to publish your Ghoramara statement on the website www.kaltesonne.de.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. habil. Sebastian Lüning
Again the ARD editors followed by dodging the facts of their poor reporting in a response to Lüning’s message above, even going so far as to deny everything. What follows is their response to Lünings accusations:
From: Dr. Kai Gniffke (Editor-in-Chief ARD-aktuell)
To: Dr. Sebastian Lüning
Date: 25 January 2019
Dear Dr. Lüning,
We regret that our detailed response to your program complaint was not satisfactory from your point of view. As we have already stated in the opinion, we believe that the situation of Ghoramara has been accurately described in the criticized report. In principle, not all aspects of a complex issue can be presented in a single contribution. We understand your comments as a suggestion and have already written that an in-depth consideration, for example in the context of a longer radio feature, is conceivable.
In your reply, you also mentioned our report on the warming of the North Sea in 2017, which you also criticized. We refer you to our corresponding statement, which you had already published on your website. You are also welcome to publish our most recent statement there.
We thank you for your comments and assure you that we will continue to report on climate change and its impacts.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. Kai Gniffke
First Editor-in-Chief ARD-aktuell
Clearly the ARD’s reporting was sloppy and intentionally one-sided with the aim of generating climate urgency. And the reactions by its editors told us us they had no plans to change anything with regards to quality control and its obligations to viewers.
But today, months later, Die kalte Sonne here informs that ARD editor Kai Gniffke has left the ARD. But don’t expect the quality of climate science reporting to improve at ARD any time soon.

"Richard Nixon was in the White House, Mao Zedong was running China and Ted Heath was the prime minister of the UK when hand-picked members of the global business, academic and policymaking elite were first invited to a get-together in the Swiss resort of Davos in 1971. This year marks the 50th Davos but there is not exactly a party mood. The World Economic Forum, the body that organises the annual talkfest in the snow, is “committed to improving the state of the world” but in key respects things look worse today than they did at the start of the 70s. Not in every way, obviously. The percentage of the world’s population living in abject poverty has come down sharply, largely because of rapid growth in China and India. The gap between rich and poor within countries has increased over the past five decades but inequality is not the same as destitution. Living standards have risen, whether measured by incomes per head, life expectancy or technical progress. There were no smartphones in 1971 and nor was there an inkling that they would be manufactured in the economic superpower that China has become. Under Mao, China was essentially a peasant economy and the reforms that led to industrialisation and the migration from the country to the cities were still some way off. Nobody had the slightest interest in China’s growth rate or its trade policy. A small group of developed countries – led by the US – accounted for the lion’s share of global GDP and called all the shots. That is no longer the case. By the early 70s, the long period of post second world war growth was coming to an end. The Bretton Woods currency system, held together by the link between the US dollar and gold, would collapse in 1971 as a result of the inflationary strains on the American economy caused by the cost of the Vietnam war and higher domestic spending. The mood music does not seem to have changed all that much. The 2020 Davos takes place amid concern that a crisis is looming. It is more than a decade since the end of the financial crisis of 2007-09 but the recovery has been tepid. Wage growth, investment growth and productivity growth have all been poor. Financial markets look dangerously overvalued. So why is the current state of affairs more troubling than it was in 1971? Well, for a start there seemed a simple – if harsh – way out of the economic problems associated with the end of Bretton Woods. Inflation, according to economists such as Milton Friedman, was caused by profligate governments printing too much money to pay for excessive wage settlements and public spending pledges. The answer was to reduce budget deficits, to rein in the power of organised labour and to give control of interest rates to independent central banks. This was broadly the system in place from the mid-1970s to the moment when everything went pear-shaped in 2008. At that point, there was something of a crash rethink. Interest rates were slashed, central banks pumped money into their economies, budget deficits were allowed to balloon. Yet the strong and sustained recovery that was expected has not happened. The main impact of the extraordinary policy stimulus has been seen in asset prices rather than in the real economy. In the event of another crisis, central banks look to be short of conventional weapons. Tentatively, there are signs that fiscal policy – regulating the economy through tax and public spending – is making a comeback. In Britain, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, says interest rates are going to stay low for years to come, making it possible to borrow cheaply for long-term infrastructure projects. Clearly, the money could be put to good use. The big, inescapable difference between the 1971 Davos and the one this week is the threat posed by the climate emergency. A flick through Fritz Schumacher’s seminal 1973 green text – Small is Beautiful – finds no mention of global heating. It simply was not a political issue back then. Now, of course, it is. Each year the WEF asks a sample of experts and policymakers to list the most likely risks the world will face over the next decade. Unsurprisingly, against a backdrop of droughts, hurricanes, bushfires, melting glaciers and a steady heating of the planet, for the first time the top five threats are all environmental. Klaus Schwab, the founder of Davos and the WEF’s executive chairman, has written to all those attending this year’s event urging them to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. An indication of how successful that appeal will be should come on Tuesday when Donald Trump drops by. What Trump should say – but won’t – is as follows: the US recognises the existential threat posed by global heating. It accepts that multilateral cooperation is needed if the problem is to be tackled before it it is too late. As a businessman, he is aware that no company could hope to survive if it depleted its own capital in the way that humans are consuming natural resources. To that end, the White House is working on an ambitious plan for the climate change summit due to be held in Glasgow at the end of this year. As the world’s biggest economy, the US will commit to stringent emissions targets, commit to renewable energy and bankroll a modern equivalent of the postwar Marshall Plan to help poor countries make the transition to a low-carbon future. Why? Because whereas the threat in 1948 was the spread of communism, now it is the much greater danger that capitalism will eat itself."
"Efforts to reduce levels of one potent greenhouse gas appear to be failing, according to a study. Scientists had expected to find a dramatic reduction in levels of the hydrofluorocarbon HFC-23 in the atmosphere after India and China, two of the main sources, reported in 2017 that they had almost completely eliminated emissions.  But a paper published in the journal Nature Communications says that by 2018 concentrations of the gas – used in fridges and air conditioners – had not fallen but were increasing at a record rate. Matt Rigby, from Bristol University, who co-authored the study and is a member of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment, said academics had hoped to see a big reduction following the reports from India and China. “This potent greenhouse gas has been growing rapidly in the atmosphere for decades now, and these reports suggested that the rise should have almost completely stopped in the space of two or three years. This would have been a big win for climate.” Scientists say the fact they found emissions had risen is a puzzle and could have implications for the Montreal protocol, an international treaty that was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer. Kieran Stanley, the lead author of the study, said that although China and India were not yet bound by the agreement, their reported reduction would have put them on course to be consistent with it. “Our study finds that it is very likely that China has not been as successful in reducing HFC-23 emissions as reported,” he said. “However, without additional measurements, we can’t be sure whether India has been able to implement its abatement programme.” HFCs were hailed as an answer to the hole in the ozone layer that appeared over Antarctica in the 1980s because they replaced hundreds of chemical substances widely used in aerosols that depleted the thin layer of ozone that protects Earth from harmful rays from the sun. But in recent years there has been mounting concern at how the potent greenhouse gas was undermining efforts to keep global heating below dangerous levels. Scientists say one tonne of HFC-23 emissions is equivalent to the release of more than 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Experts estimate that had the HFC-23 emissions reductions been as large as reported, the equivalent of a year’s worth of Spain’s CO2 emissions would have been avoided between 2015 and 2017. • This article was amended on 6 February 2020 because HFC-23 is not used in inhalers, as an earlier version wrongly said. This has been corrected."
"World leaders and business chiefs meeting in Davos this week will be confronted for the first time with an agenda on which the climate and ecological crises take top billing. Financial and economic concerns have been shunted down the list of priorities in favour of five environmental issues: climate breakdown and extreme weather; failure to mitigate or adapt to climate change; human-made pollution; biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Green campaigners and social and human rights activists have been raising concerns on all of these for more than two decades, but it seems that finally the world’s powers are paying attention. In some cases it may be too late to act to avoid the consequences of the delay in taking action. Since 2015 when the landmark Paris agreement was signed, greenhouse gas emissions have risen a further 4% and although there are signs the rate of increase may be slowing, that is nowhere near enough. Oceans are at the hottest ever recorded. Last year, ecological scientists said 1 million species were on the brink of extinction. The biomass of wild animals on the planet has fallen by more than 80%, about half of the area of key natural ecosystems has been lost, and insect populations have crashed, according to the report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2018 that by 2030 the world must be on track or exceeding 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels would be all but inevitable. Warming has already topped 1C and 2019 was the second hottest year on record. As the Davos agenda shows, businesses are taking note. Ashim Paun, the global co-head of environmental, social, and governance research at HSBC, said: “Will 2020 be an inflexion point? Our investor clients increasingly think climate change is absolutely core to their investment processes. So this year we look to major political and policy developments – the details of the EU green deal in March, the outcome of elections, particularly the US where we see the outcome as fairly binary for climate, and whether this year’s climate talks in Glasgow [in November] can regain previous momentum.” There is plenty that all people around the world can do to get involved and shape the direction of this crunch decade. “2019 proved that activism works,” said Richard George, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace. “The amazing contributions from the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion, along with many others, got us a net zero target [in the UK and other countries], and almost universal agreement that not only is climate change happening but action to stop it is both vital and urgent. What we need now is real action to get the carbon out of our energy, transport, food and finance sectors, which means turning up the heat on politicians and corporations. This is the year to do it.” There will be international conferences this year on the climate, the oceans, biodiversity, deforestation and a host of other pressing environmental concerns. Many targets and deadlines for taking action are pegged to 2020, and governments and businesses will have to answer for any failure to meet those goals. The world is changing and leaders in all spheres are recognising that people are no longer willing to passively accept environmental destruction. Here’s what to look out for in 2020. Nearly five years have passed since the signing of the Paris agreement pledging to prevent global heating of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Since then, progress has stalled. Last year’s UN climate conference in Madrid ended inconclusively with no agreement on some basic aspects of implementing Paris. More importantly, countries’ commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 accord are inadequate to stay within the 2C limit and would lead to a disastrous 3C rise. That makes this year’s climate summit the biggest since Paris. Governments must come to COP26 in Glasgow in November armed with new emissions targets commensurate to the risk of climate breakdown. If Donald Trump is still in power, other countries must press ahead without the US and face down challenges to the Paris accord from Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. That will be a massive struggle, and strong clear messages from civil society will be vital to its success. Trump has blasted through federal protections ranging from clean air and water to Alaskan drilling and pipeline construction, and if he wins a second term he is likely to continue on that track. In international terms his influence has been baleful on climate action: he started the formal process to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, and that decision that will come into effect the day after the presidential election on 3 November. COP26 begins on 9 November and the US delegation will be drawn from the Trump White House whatever the election outcome. British diplomats will be looking to use the supposedly friendly relationship between Trump and Boris Johnson to try to ensure the US does not play a disruptive role. Trump will also preside over the G7 meeting in June, which means environmental issues will be off the agenda. In some previous years, notably 2005-07, the then G8’s focus on the climate proved a valuable spur to progress in the UN climate talks. This year that will be missing. Plastic pollution, overfishing, overheating and acidification from climate change are driving a crisis in the oceans. The World Ocean Summit in early March in Tokyo will set out the latest science on ocean health and present possible solutions. Later that month, from 23 March to 3 April, comes the final scheduled meeting of the UN effort to draft a new global treaty on the seas. IGC4 aims to set out a new legally binding instrument on “the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”. Ecosystems around the world, from the Amazon to the Antarctic, are on the verge of collapse owing to human encroachment and exploitation, pollution, water scarcity and the impacts of global heating.  Two meetings will focus attention on the loss of biodiversity and ways to stem further destruction. The World Conservation Congress in mid-June in Marseille is a four-yearly meeting of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the organisation that compiles the global red lists of endangered and threatened species. A series of meetings held under the UN convention on biological diversity will culminate in a meeting at Kunming, China, in October where progress – or the lack of it – on protecting wildlife and plants will be assessed. The current global biodiversity action plan runs from 2011 to 2020 and its key aims are likely to be missed. A new action plan for the next decade should be adopted at the Kunming conference. The Paris agreement was not the only major international achievement of 2015: there was also the signing of the UN sustainable development goals, a set of 17 plans to remedy social and environmental ills – including eliminating poverty and hunger, empowering women and girls, improving access to healthcare and education in developing countries, and providing access to clean water and sanitation. Most of the goals are pegged to 2030, and this year is a staging post to assess progress at the UN high-level political forum in New York in July. The last few years have seen a new wave of environmental activism targeting businesses, whether through divestment campaigns aimed at fossil fuel investors, arts sponsorship deals or direct action. That is likely to increase in 2020 as the impact has become clearer. BlackRock made an unprecedented decision last week to start stepping out of investments with a high climate risk, and other funds will come under pressure to follow suit. There are a variety of ways people can make their views known to company boards, from questioning their pension funds to joining protests or even becoming a shareholder. Globalisation has led to a massive increase in carbon from shipping, which now represents 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions but will reach 17% by 2050 if unchecked. But shipping has been deliberately excluded from UN climate negotiations and little progress has been made in the last two decades on cutting greenhouse gases from one of the dirtiest forms of transport. At the International Maritime Organisation meeting in March in London, countries are supposed to come up with a new way forward to fulfil the UN agency’s aims of halving shipping emissions by mid-century – a goal that campaigners say is still inadequate. Last year Extinction Rebellion led effective protests. This year, decisions deferred last year will come back to the agenda. In 2010, companies from around the world joined forces on a target to banish deforestation for palm oil from their supply chains permanently by 2020. That target looks far from being met, but at the Consumer Goods Forum in June in London the signatory companies will have to explain their progress and what they hope to do to improve their performance. Palm oil is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation, particularly in south-east Asia where wildlife ranging from the orangutan to the Sumatran elephant and rhino are being endangered. Consumers have the chance to make their views felt: nobody wants their grocery shopping to contribute to species loss, and there are ways to grow natural resources without causing ecological disaster. It is up to producer companies and retailers to make the difference. The new European commission took office in Brussels late last year with one central promise: a green deal for Europe, by which the whole of the European economy and EU regulations would be overhauled to put environmental protections at the heart of continued prosperity. Clean energy, transport and industry will create new green jobs to replace those lost in polluting industries, and citizens will enjoy cleaner air, water, a healthier natural environment and a stable climate. That is the goal, at least. Living up to that promise will involve hard choices and skilful diplomacy, and in the course of this year the European commission, member states and EU parliament will face a series of key votes and decisions. The EU will also play a leading role in COP26, and the EU-China summit pegged for mid-September in Leipzig in Germany will be key. With the US rejecting the Paris agreement, cooperation between the world’s other biggest emitters will be vital, so the EU must forge a partnership with China or face failure at COP26."
"The Black Death struck Europe in 1347, killing 30-50% of the European population in six violent years. It wasn’t a one-off epidemic: it signalled the start of the second plague pandemic in Europe that lasted for hundreds of years and only slowly disappeared from the continent after the Great Plague of London in 1665-1666. These outbreaks were traditionally thought to be caused by rodent reservoirs of infected rats lurking in Europe’s cities, or potentially by rodent reservoirs in the wilderness. But our research, published in the journal PNAS, suggests otherwise.  If the “reservoir” thesis were correct, we would expect plague outbreaks to be associated with local climate fluctuations, through changes in agricultural yields and primary productions in forests, affecting the number of urban and wildlife rodents, resulting in more plague. We found that Europe’s plague outbreaks were indeed associated with climate fluctuations – but in Asia. The Black Death came to Europe from Asia. Historical records tentatively map it back to outbreaks in 1345 in Astrakhan and Sarai, two trade centres located on the Volga river near the Caspian Sea.  Where the Black Death came from before it hit those cities is not known, but by recovering fragments of DNA from the teeth of plague victims in Europe, the closest currently known living relatives of this medieval strain of the plague causing bacteria Yersinia pestis are circulating in marmots and long-tailed ground squirrels in north-west China. Some dominant narratives on the plague are poorly substantiated. One being that medieval plague was transmitted by black or brown rats and their infected fleas jumping to humans. This was indeed how the third plague pandemic in the 19th and 20th centuries was transmitted – but there is poor archaeological evidence there were many rats across much of northern Europe in the Middle Ages aside from small populations of black rats in harbour towns, and no historic records that rats played a role in the disease. “Rodent reservoirs” represent another dominant narrative. The idea is that the disease was introduced in medieval Europe once (the Black Death epidemic) after which it settled into local rats or wildlife rodents, and continued to cause outbreaks in European cities for hundreds of years.  This is the narrative we aimed to substantiate through evidence, but which we ended up challenging. Using tree-ring based climate records from Europe and Asia, we showed that plague reintroductions into European harbours were associated with periods of wet conditions, followed by a drought, across large parts of Central Asia.  These conditions were tough for rodents in the region, traditionally the hosts of the plague bacterium, and their numbers would plummet. Infected fleas would seek new hosts, often latching onto passing human traders or their camels, though we don’t yet know exactly how the plague made the journey westward. What we do know is that, 14-16 years after the rodent-killing drought, we would often find plague reintroduced into Europe.  The chart below shows these climate fluctuations in Central Asia preceded the Black Death in 1347, the Italian plague of 1629, and the Great Plague of Marseille a century later, but notably not the London plague of 1665 or the outbreak in Vienna the following decade. This followed a pattern that we associate with current-day plague outbreaks. What is the implication of such a finding? In terms of our understanding of the past plague pandemics, it provides a different perspective as to how the disease moved across Eurasia, driven by climate events that were and still are frequently occurring.  It implies that there might never have been permanent reservoirs of plague among European rodents. While alpine marmots might have been affected and transmitted plague in medieval Europe, we found no indications that they can form a long-term reservoir, as their cousins in Asia do. Furthermore, the observation that plague disappeared from the European mainland, while outbreaks in the Middle East and northern Africa continued to follow upon climate events in Central Asia strongly suggests that the reason why plague disappeared from Europe should be phrased not in terms of why its reservoirs disappeared, but why the disease could no longer spread efficiently across the continent. It gives historians, epidemiologists and biologists new questions to ask in their quest to reconstruct what exactly happened during one of the most devastating pandemics in human history."
"The solar eclipse due to cover much of Europe on March 20 will be the continent’s first for 16 years. Back in 1999, as people stopped staring at the sun and got back on with their day they caused a power surge which still stands as a UK record – greater than anything after a football match or royal wedding.  At the time, solar power made up just 0.1% of all Europe’s electricity produced from renewables. Since then it has increased to at least 5% as countries subsidise renewables to meet EU targets. The installed capacity of solar power in continental Europe is expected to reach 90 GW this year, comparable to 150 coal fired plants. Under clear skies, regulators expect some 35 GW of solar energy to fade away with the eclipse before being re-injected into Europe’s electrical system. This is a big test for solar power. It’s the first time when such an event could have a significant impact on those European countries with lots of solar panels such as Germany (with 44% of continental Europe’s installed capacity), Italy, Spain and France. Much more, European grid integration means everyone could be affected. Keeping the grid stable during the eclipse is the main concern for power utilities. The electrical grids of continental Europe are linked together in what’s called the European synchronous area, allowing countries to juggle excess energy between them to meet demand. Grid regulators will have to coordinate across regions to manage the solar drop off along and demand, all in real time.   According to ENTSOE, Europe’s association of national grid operators, around 50% of the lost power will come from Germany and 21% from Italy. The grid will be losing 0.4 GW/minute at the start of the eclipse and gaining 0.7 GW/minute as the sun returns.  This is a huge amount of electricity generation to come online at once. The European power system will need to adapt in real time, with countries helping each other by providing the necessary reserves of coal, gas and hydropower to keep things running. Electric grids operate on the principle that demand and supply need to be carefully balanced. In continental Europe, grids are connected as one synchronous network. The normal operating frequency is 50 Hz, with two statutory limits, the upper limit, which is 50.5 and the lower limit which is 49.5. Above the upper limit, the generators will trip, while below the lower limit demand will disconnect completely, that means power won’t reach end users and blackouts will happen.  Think of it like driving a car with a target speed of 50 miles/hr (+/-0.5mph). The accelerator is generation, the forces dragging on the car represent the demand. Keeping the frequency at 50Hz means maintaining secure operation of the system, quality of supply and operate economically. Despite the impact on solar energy the eclipse’s most significant effect on the power grid will actually be as a result of human behaviour. During the 1999 eclipse in the UK, people stopped working to enjoy the phenomenon, as highlighted in this graph by Solar Power Portal. The 3 GW surge was greater than the 2.8 GW surge after England played Germany in the 1990 world cup semi-final, or the 2.4 GW surge after the 2011 royal wedding. Something similar will happen this time round. There will be a drop in demand before maximum eclipse, and increased demand after as people come back inside, turn on the tv and fire up the kettle.  In this time the system will have to adapt to the changing load and this could be a challenge. Planning is critical, as you can’t just instantly increase electricity generation. But electricity surges happen from time to time – the 2014 World Cup provides a recent example – and grid coordinators have contingency measures in place to balance supply and demand. The solar eclipse on Friday is a good test for the future, when even more electricity will be produced from renewables like solar and wind, which are more volatile and dispersed generation. Germany, Italy and the US are among the countries where solar will make up a large proportion of overall power. In such situations, even cloudy weather will create a big decrease in production.  If you want to look at what happened during the eclipse, then BM reports provides near real time and historic data on the UK’s national grid balancing system – electricity generation, system prices, warnings, frequency, wind forecasts, market activity, and so on. So, while most people will spend Friday morning observing at the sun with their pinhole cameras, I’ll be keeping one eye on the grid."
"There have been many proposed solutions to the climate crisis – from outright bans on fossil fuels to planting 2 billion trees – but Jonathan Safran Foer’s antidote to global devastation strikes me as the neatest and most achievable. It could sound like something written by a prophet in stone: Eat No Meat Before Sundown. But Safran Foer, in his brilliant book, We Are the Weather, insists on couching it in far more conversational terms: we need to make a “collective act to eat differently”, he says, and one straightforward way is to aim to eat no animal products before dinner. This idea for a roughly two-third shift in animal consumption comes armed with unarguable statistics about its positive effect in reversing climate trends, including the killer pay-off: “If cows were a country they would rank third in greenhouse gas emissions, after China and the United States.”  I meet Safran Foer in London in the autumn, while Extinction Rebellion are glueing themselves to corporate buildings. He has chosen to eat at Nopi, Ottolenghi’s brasserie outpost off London’s Regent Street, not least because in Safran Foer’s decade of campaigning against factory farming (his 2009 book Eating Animals was the starting point) the chef has become a good friend and ally. We order sharing plates including cauliflower and green bean fritters, hispi cabbage and tofu mayonnaise, chickpeas with sumac feta and – ignoring any potential for caricature – talk first about the protests and their effect. There has, Safran Foer says, been nothing remotely like them in the US, but he is not convinced they are effective. “I saw a protester asked on the news, ‘What is the point?’” he says. “The reply was the obvious one: ‘We wouldn’t be talking about it now, if this were not happening.’ But is that exactly a point? You can imagine ways in which it could be a bad thing if it becomes too divisive, or is seen as just a liberal concern.” One theme of his book is that human beings cannot hold potential apocalypse in their minds for very long: “We are good at things like calculating the path of a hurricane,” he writes, “and bad at things like deciding to get out of its way.” He uses at one point the analogy of his grandmother’s family in 1930s Poland to examine human reaction to the psychology of existential threat. His grandmother heard what was happening in Germany and – partly through luck and circumstance – decided to emigrate. All her relations heard the same news and were paralysed by it, or had other concerns. He fears that is the effect of a lot of well-intentioned hand-wringing about the planet, the virtue-signalling threats of doom. The scale overwhelms us, and we do nothing. “I don’t understand why the Extinction movement isn’t concretising. Why it isn’t issuing specific ideas,” he says. “They are awfully vague and unrealistic. Why not say: ‘Here’s a thing we can all do to help this month?’ And do that every month. I feel then that an awful lot of people would start to give it a shot.” His informed suggestion about daytime veganism is a case in point. But even then, and in his book, he cautions against being too shrill. One of the most persuasive adopters of his plan in the US has been the chef Samin Nosrat, bestselling author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. “The way Samin talks about it is climate leadership, for me,” Safran Foer says. “She doesn’t ask anyone else to do it. She says: ‘I might not be consistent with it, it is going to be a big change. But knowing what I know, this is what I feel I should do.’ When people lecture me on their own ethical accomplishment, I find that extremely annoying and certainly not inspiring. But if somebody says, ‘I want to try this, I fear I might fail,’ people start to think, ‘Well, you know, I could try that too.’” Safran Foer is upfront about his own lapses in the book. He confesses even to one or two fast-food burger moments when tired or emotional or lazy. That seemed to me quite a brave thing to do, but also a persuasive one. “It felt like an embarrassing thing to write,” he says. “But I have definitely had meat. And I have often wanted it. These days I find cooking vegetarian quite easy. But veganism is much more difficult. I mean I wrote the book, so I had to do it. But it was still like, ‘Oh shit, this is difficult.’” He thinks that above all we need to get away from thinking in binary terms. “If someone says to me, you know, I couldn’t give up chicken, or cheese, or burrata, that’s fine, just eat much less of it, or only eat it for dinner. The goal is not to perfect a virtuous identity for yourself. The goal is to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.” Safran Foer first found a global audience as a wunderkind novelist. His book Everything is Illuminated, a fictional personal journey into Holocaust history, earned him an eye-watering publisher’s advance and universal critical acclaim. It came out when he was only 25. He followed it with another chunky bestseller, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which offered a child’s eye view on the 9/11 attacks, and became a film starring Tom Hanks. In his two polemical books, he uses a pared-down version of that hyper-intelligent novelist’s voice, but retains a genius for a compelling story and a telling detail. He understands that the best of the latter are often the most simple. One thing that struck him when he started to share a platform with distinguished climate scientists was that they were all, to a woman and man, vegetarian. “They just took that as read,” he says, “in the same way they would never drive an SUV. The funny thing was that it was too obvious to them almost to mention.” Another telling revelation, he says, struck him when Eating Animals came out. He imagined it would likely be loved by animal rights protesters and hated by farmers. In fact, he had the opposite experience. “Farmers I spoke to welcomed the book. They despise factory farming more than anyone. The whole model of industrial agriculture obviously seeks to remove farmers from the process. Sustainable farming offers them a future.” The protesters, meanwhile, found plenty to protest about in Safran Foer’s human and realistic tone, because that is what they do. We dig into our sharing plates, Safran Foer doing his best to avoid the rule-breaking components of our order, yogurt and feta. “This is part of my difficulty right here,” he says, of a slightly awkward interaction with the waiter when he suggested he would rather not have dairy. “I still don’t quite know how to have the conversation about these things. I know how well they source things here. And I don’t like that feeling of sounding judgmental. There is nothing I like less than going to dinner at a friend’s house having forgotten to tell them.” What will he do? “It depends. If they have gone to a lot of effort sometimes I might not say, just because in the scheme of things one dinner obviously doesn’t matter.” In all of this, he suggests, we put too much emphasis on motivation and not enough on action. An honest commitment to try to change habits is always far more effective than hard-and-fast denial, but deciding what is possible is the first step. He tells a story of a couple he met at a reading he gave; when he came to sign their copy of his book he saw that the title page was covered in writing. “They told me that they were about to get married, and decided to have a plan for the future. The plan involved trying to eat vegetarian except at dinner. Vegan two days a week. Have no more than two kids. And to drive no more than 1,500 miles a year. That struck me as a good way of looking at it.” Safran Foer went home that evening and wrote his own plan. It involved among other things a commitment not to fly for vacations as well as one to try to stick to his diet. “Everyone might think about a plan,” he says. And what better moment to adopt one than new year 2020? We Are the Weather is out now (Hamish Hamilton, £16.99). To order a copy, go to guardianbookshop.com"
"The prime minister says the Coalition is acting on emissions, meeting its targets and doing more than Labor did when in power. What’s the reality? No. National emissions peaked in 2007, the last year of the Howard government, came down each year under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, and have flatlined since the Coalition was elected in 2013. This graph by Nick Evershed, Guardian Australia’s data and interactive editor, sets it out clearly. (Specifically, that they are on average 50m tonnes less each year under the Coalition than Labor.) This was not correct until last year, when the government released revised historic emissions data (as explained here). Since then, Morrison’s claim is roughly accurate. But it is a meaningless statistic – a clear case of nonsense framing to mask what is happening. Labor can’t be held responsible for the historically high emissions level it inherited when it came to office, and pollution fell about 14% in the nearly six years Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard were prime minister. The ALP can’t take all the credit for the decline. The millennium drought, the global financial crisis and a high Australian dollar all had some impact. But government policies, including the carbon price scheme introduced in partnership with the Greens and independents, had some effect. Emissions reductions stopped under the Coalition about the time the carbon price scheme was repealed in 2014. The most recent quarterly greenhouse data found rising pollution in most parts of the economy were offset by a significant fall in emissions from agriculture due to drought and floods – a shift that has nothing to do with the government. This is where we risk getting buried in numbers, but bear with me. It makes sense for governments to set emissions targets. How else to assess whether countries are playing their part in addressing a dramatically escalating global problem? But the most important initial question about a government target, before asking whether it will be met, is whether it addresses the problem faced. As far back as 1990, the Coalition went to an election under Andrew Peacock promising to cut emissions 20% by 2000. But Australia’s first target under the Kyoto protocol, the initial climate pact signed in 1997, allowed it to increase emissions by 8% above 1990 levels by the years 2008-2012. Put another way, the Howard government adopted a goal that allowed it to emit even more heat-trapping gas as part of an agreement under which developed countries were supposed to be cutting pollution. As has been well ventilated, it was no accident that 1990 was chosen as the baseline year. There was a hell of a lot of land-clearing and deforestation that year, releasing a stack of carbon dioxide. As the graph above shows, emissions plummeted after 1990, largely because land management in Queensland changed. It meant Australia had set itself a target that allowed it to not just increase pollution by 8%, but dramatically ramp up emissions from fossil fuels and other industry. As this graph shows, that’s what happened. It leaves out emissions of what is known as LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) – which are important, but have been used to muddy the picture – to show Australian pollution from electricity, industry, transport, agriculture and waste is up about 30% over three decades. So, yes, Australia “beat” its first Kyoto target. If it had used any year after 1991 as the baseline it wouldn’t have. And fossil fuel emissions – the primary driver of the climate crisis – have continued to rise. Australia’s 2020 target is usually described as a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020. As analysts and politicians have pointed out, it is neither meeting nor beating that goal. Government data shows emissions are expected to be just 0.3% lower this year than at the turn of the millennium. Again, the wonders of greenhouse accounting. As the ANU economist Stephen Howes explains, Australia’s 2020 target was expressed in more than one way. It was also listed with the UN as a 0.5% cut below 1990 emissions levels – that baseline year again – for the average of the years 2013 and 2020. Under that complicated formulation, Australia will technically beat its 2020 target. But it will still be putting the same amount of heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere this year as it was 20 years ago. Not much. The Department of the Environment and Energy projects that pollution will be only 4% lower in 2030 than today. It expects that despite assuming that, due to the falling cost of solar panels and some state-based targets, renewable energy will rise to provide 51% of electricity in the national grid by then (a level that the government opposed as damaging to the economy at last year’s election). If the department projections are correct, it means we will not have made a 5% emissions cut below 2000 levels by 2030, let alone 2020. That, despite Morrison claiming it will be met “in a canter”, the government is not on track to meet that either. Before getting to the specifics, it is worth considering what was agreed in Paris, and what it means for Australia. The headline goal of the 2015 pact was to limit global warming to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels and trying to keep it as close to 1.5C as possible. Scientists say that means net zero emissions by about 2050. That this is the implicit target of the Paris agreement is now broadly accepted across the engaged community. More than 70 countries say they are working towards that goal. In Australia, a coalition of groups including the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Energy Council issued a statement in December saying the country should adopting policies that put it on a path to net zero national emissions. Every state, whether run by the Coalition or Labor, has a net zero emissions goal. The Morrison government doesn’t. Asked by 3AW’s Neil Mitchell on Monday about a suggestion federal Labor would recommit to net zero emissions by 2050, the prime minister said he had “no idea what the Labor party is talking about”. Pressed further, he acknowledged the government promised at last year’s Pacific Islands Forum, where Australia faced sustained criticism from island nations for its support of the coal industry, that it would consider it. But he stressed he was concerned that “it wouldn’t be a good thing” and did not think it should be adopted unless it was clear what it would mean for jobs. Australia disregarded scientific advice in setting its initial, medium-term target under the Paris agreement. The then Abbott government was advised by the Climate Change Authority that Australia’s part under a meaningful global pact would be equivalent to a cut of between 45-63% below 2005 levels by 2030. It instead opted for a 26-28% reduction over that timeframe. Again, there was some fudging. Rather than stick with 1990 or 2000, the government opted for a baseline year that – as emissions were substantially higher in 2005 than in 2000 – made the proposed cut appear larger. If the government had stuck with 2000 as the baseline, its Paris target would be a 16-18% cut. Department data suggests national emissions are expected to instead be 16% below 2005 levels by 2030, well short of the minimum 26% goal. The government plans to make up the difference through another accounting measure: claiming credit for “beating” or, as it now describes it, “overachieving” its Kyoto targets. Using what are known as Kyoto “carryover credits” is politically and legally contentious, and opposed by many countries at climate talks. Critics say Australia is still trying to claim credit for a 30-year-old land-clearing loophole that it used against targets that were already far lower than what scientists said was necessary. Not so far. The government’s main climate policy remains the $2bn climate solutions fund, under which taxpayers pay businesses and land-owners to limit pollution, mostly by planting or protecting vegetation. Recent evidence suggests it is struggling to find people to sign up. In October, the government quietly commissioned a review of the policy in what was seen as an acknowledgement that it was not delivering what was needed. The Coalition supports some energy projects, particularly pumped hydro storage, and is promising a long-delayed electric vehicle strategy and a “technology investment roadmap”. Morrison says Australia is leading the world on renewable energy, and emissions from the electricity sector have fallen while those from other sectors increase. But spending on clean power fell 56% last year, and the government has rejected calls for an overarching policy to drive private investment. Australia is responsible for about 1.3% of pollution, but has only 0.3% of the global population. It is one of the top 20 emitting nations, releasing more than G7 members Britain, France and Italy. It is also the third biggest exporter of fossil fuels and aims to expand the trade. Several analyses have found that, even by the inadequate standard of international action to address the climate crisis, Australia is performing poorly. Science and policy body Climate Analytics says it is expected to fall even further behind because, unlike comparable countries, it has no plan to introduce an effective national emissions reduction policy."
"More than half of all Australians have been directly affected by the summer’s bushfire crisis, including millions suffering health effects, according to a new survey from the Australia Institute. As fire crews in New South Wales and Victoria prepare for the return of severe fire conditions later this week, the survey of more than 1,000 people found 57% of Australians were directly affected in some way by the fires over the past three months.  About a quarter of those surveyed (26%) reported illness or health effects as a result of smoke haze, while a third (33%) reported a change to routine – such as not jogging outside – as a result of the conditions. About 15% said they had been forced to change or cancel holiday or travel plans, while 12% said regular places of business or leisure were closed as a result of the disruption. The number of people reporting negative health impacts has been extrapolated in the nationally representative survey to represent about 5.1 million Australian adults. The number of people reporting poor health as a result of the fires was highest in NSW, where 35% of those surveyed saying they had suffered illness such as breathing or respiratory problems because of the smoke. In Victoria, the figure was 29%, but the survey was taken from 8-12 January, before the hazardous levels of smoke haze hit Melbourne the following week. With 9% of respondents saying they had missed work because of the fires or smoke, the Australia Institute is estimating that at least 1.8 million work days were lost as a result, based on the assumption of one day off for each worker affected. Using Australian Bureau of Statistics labour figures, the survey estimated disruption of the workforce to have cost more than $1.3bn in lost economic production, which it says is a “conservative” estimate. “In many areas, including in large cities, workplaces closed for many days and in some cases for a week or more,” the survey said. “If we assume an average of two days of lost production on average, the estimate of lost production doubles to $2.6bn.” The research also showed a correlation between those directly affected by the fires and concern about the impacts of climate change. People who had been impacted by the fires were much more likely to be “very concerned” about climate change (58%) than those not impacted (32%). Those directly affected were also more likely (68%) to say Australia is experiencing “a lot” of climate change impacts, compared with those not affected (42%). The findings also showed greater concern for Australia’s forests and wildlife and government inaction among this group. Only about a third of all surveyed said they believed the federal Coalition had done a “good job managing the crisis”. Tom Swann, senior researcher at the Australia Institute, said the findings underscored the extent of the “vast” social, economic and medical impacts of Australia’s “national climate disaster”. “This research suggests that, as Australians face the escalating impacts of climate change in their own lives, calls for policies that reduce carbon emissions will continue to grow,” Swann said. “Even looking simply at lost work days, the bill is in the billions of dollars. The broader impacts and recovery efforts will cost many billions more and take many years. “That is why it is so concerning that rising emissions threaten to make events like this even more common in the future.” Swann said the findings should give extra impetus to the organisation’s call for a levy on fossil fuel producers to help pay for the escalating cost of natural disasters. “Establishing a National Climate Disaster Fund would move some of the financial burden of these events from the households, businesses and taxpayers that are currently forced to pick up the tab,” he said."
"In my time I have seen some pretty strange things parading as art – I still vividly remember the sawn-up sharks and cows in Damien Hirst’s Sensation Exhibition.  Beauty and art I guess is in the eye of the beholder.  What I consider to be art you may well think of as a pile of rubbish, and indeed it may actually be someone’s junk. Anthropologists consider art to be a uniquely human activity in which a person produces something for the aesthetic appreciation of others.  But human motives are seldom so simple. Modern-day artists are very aware of the commercial value of their product and of the fringe benefits of being successful artists such as fame and attracting members of the opposite or same sex. Art I suspect was never just for aesthetic appreciation. This anthropologic definition of art seems to exclude the possibility that animals can be artists. For example, we might find male birds of paradise extremely beautiful but this is not art.  Bird song is often described as music and the displays of some animals are described as dance.  But do they qualify as art? Although the song of many birds is improved by practice during the animal’s lifetime it is largely innate – the animal is not composing on a blank slate. And the same seems to apply to animal dances or constructions.   The intricately designed nests of the weaverbird would seem to be a work of art but is nothing more than an evolutionary pre-programmed design – and, of course, it was designed to hold eggs not for artistic appreciation.   Our descriptions suggest artistic qualities in these animals, but the reality suggests something much simpler. The dulcet tunes of my voice may sound beautiful to some, but they are the result of my environment and not any artistic composition. There are, however, cases of artistic creation in the animal kingdom that may meet the anthropologist’s requirements for something to be considered art.  One such case is the song of the male lyrebird from central Australia.   The lyrebird does not learn its song from his father as is the case with most bird species. Instead it samples the song of birds from its habitat and puts these samples together in a continuous sequence, just as a DJ might rearrange snippets and loops of old records into a new song.   The aim of the male lyrebird is to create music that will attract females, which also seems to work for human musicians. When in captivity it has even been known for these birds to sample the sounds of human activity such as chainsaws cutting down trees or even human music played by loggers. Thus, the bird is producing non-innate “music” for the appreciation of others, in this case females of the same species. Studies have shown that most bird song cannot be considered music, innately produced or not, because it does not follow human musical scales. I personally find this a weak argument as there are a great number of musical scales used by humans. What is noise to me maybe music to you. Male bowerbirds make and decorate what is essentially a twig sculpture – bower – to impress females. Females pass by, inspecting these works of art – and the males stand in front of them hawking their artistic prowess.   Male bowerbirds use visual illusions that mess with perspective, just like the artist MC Escher. They create a courtyard of objects in front of their bower, the largest objects being placed further away creating a forced perspective that they are larger than they really are. If the female is impressed by the male’s artistic talents then she will mate with him. The theory being that great male artists possess good genes, which the female’s offspring will inherit. Once mated, the female will leave the male and head off to make her nest and rear her offspring alone. There are of course captive animal artists such as pet cats or zoo-housed chimpanzees who are provided by humans with an opportunity to express themselves artistically. They may produce works like Jackson Pollock – but this is an induced, not a spontaneous activity and it is not clear if there is any artistic intent.  Although the famous sign language chimpanzee Washoe would sometimes describe what her paintings represented. Bower and lyrebirds provide just two animal examples from the wild of work that can be considered art in light of the human definition of the subject.  Personally, I believe there are many more artists to be discovered in the animal kingdom.   But I, for one, would question this division between things that are beautiful or artistic. Surely what is important is that there is an aesthetic appreciation of them: whether they are a beautiful mountain that has been sculpted by glaciers, a sculpture made by bowerbirds or Michelangelo’s David.  Personally, I appreciate the beauty in all three of these examples because they elicit in me the same emotional response of being in awe."
"The world’s ocean contains trillions of plastic fragments coming from packaging, fishing gear and other synthetic objects that break down at sea over time.  Most of what is known about these ocean plastics comes from surface net sampling, where the top 15cm of water is filtered to collect particles larger than 0.3mm.  Now we have published the first ever high-resolution depth profiles of ocean plastics in the journal Biogeosciences and data repository Figshare. Most of the submerged plastics were very small – less than 1 mm across. Previous studies had noticed that tiny plastics were missing from the oceans. We show that at least a fraction of this missing plastic is still adrift at sea, but at depths greater than the surface layer that is usually sampled by scientists. A better characterisation of the vertical distribution of marine plastic pollution will improve predictions of plastic loads, particle sizes, and ecological impacts in the world’s oceans. Buoyant plastics can be pushed underwater by the turbulence created by wind and waves. Models predict that the number of plastic particles decreases abruptly over the first few meters of the water column. However, until now, no subsurface measurements existed to test this prediction. We developed a new device that collects samples from the sea surface at 50cm intervals, down to a depth of 5 meters. This device was used to sample one of the world’s major plastic pollution hotspots: the North Atlantic “garbage patch”. Buoyant plastics were concentrated at the sea surface, with both numerical and mass concentrations decreasing exponentially with water depth. Nevertheless, under stronger winds this decrease was less abrupt. Our results match relatively well with those predicted by scientific models. The speed in which buoyant plastics return to the sea surface after being pushed into deeper waters by turbulence is an important parameter for predicting the depth profiles of marine plastic pollution. We found that smaller plastics present lower rising speeds, being therefore more susceptible to transport into deeper layers. Even under light wind conditions, many of the tiniest plastics were still hidden underwater. This indicates that previous studies using surface-only samples are biased towards larger plastic pieces.  Two major studies last year headed by ocean scientists 
Andres Cózar and Marcus Eriksen both concluded that there are major losses of small plastics from oceans. We show that at least a fraction of this “missing” plastic is just under the sea surface. More at-sea and experimental work is required to further quantify this effect and develop models capable of estimating depth-integrated size distribution of buoyant plastics drifting at sea. Samples of ocean plastics from below the surface are still very scarce. Further multi-level sampling is extremely important to help us estimate how much plastic is actually in our oceans, and understand its ecological impacts. Knowing how deep plastics go will help determine the chance of animals inhabiting different depths to encounter and interact with plastic items. For instance, sea birds, turtles, and mammals, which breathe air and use the sea surface for daily activities, present high rates of plastic ingestion and entanglement. Ocean plastics are also enhancing ocean drift opportunities and causing damage to biota and habitats. Plastic items harbour organisms such as microbes, invertebrates and fish, which can disperse across oceans and potentially invade non-native habitats. We emphasise that estimates on the amounts and impacts of plastic pollution across the oceans, both in coastal and oceanic environments, are urgently required. Such research is crucial to better inform those aiming to reduce the flow of plastics entering this environment, and develop mitigation strategies for this worldwide problem."
"Donald Trump told the world’s business leaders to stop listening to “prophets of doom” as he used a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum to attack the teenage activist Greta Thunberg over her climate crisis warnings. The US president hailed America’s growth record and compared campaigners against global heating with those who feared a population explosion in the 1960s and mass starvation in the 1970s. On an opening day in Switzerland dominated by the climate emergency, Thunberg scoffed at Trump’s claim that his backing for a new initiative to plant 1tn trees showed his concern for the environment. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  “Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour,” Thunberg said. “And we’re asking you to act as if you love your children more than anything else.” The US president and Thunberg did not meet face to face at the WEF, but Trump left few in doubt about who he was referring to as he defended his record since entering the White House three years ago. “This is not a time for pessimism,” he said. “This is a time for optimism. To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers. “They want to see us do badly, but we don’t let that happen. They predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the 70s, and an end of oil in the 1990s. These alarmists always demand the same thing: absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives. We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our country or eradicate our liberty.” He said he was “a big believer in the environment” in a speech that ensured he was absent from Washington as impeachment hearings took place on Capitol Hill. “The environment to me is very important,” he said. He made no mention of the climate emergency but backed the plan – launched in Davos – to capture carbon by planting trees on a mass scale in the coming years. “What I want is the cleanest water and the cleanest air,” he said. Environmentalists were unimpressed by a speech in which Trump boasted that his support for the coal and oil industries meant the US was self-sufficient in energy. Thunberg said: “Planting trees is good, of course, but it’s nowhere near enough, and it cannot replace real mitigation and re-wilding nature. We don’t need to lower emissions. Emissions need to stop.” Thunberg had three demands for her Davos audience: The halt of all investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction by companies, banks, institutions and governments. An immediate end to all fossil fuel subsidies. An immediate exit from fossil fuel investments. “We don’t want it done in 2050, 2030, or even 2021, we want it done now,” Thunberg said. “You might think we’re naive, but if you won’t do it, you must explain to your children why you’ve given up on the Paris agreement goals, and knowingly created a climate crisis,” she said. She then added that the right, the left, and the centre of politics had all failed the sustainability test. “No political ideology or economic structure has managed to tackle the climate and environmental emergency and create a cohesive and sustainable world.” Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace’s executive director, said: “The 1tn trees initiative didn’t make up for the lack of a wider attack on the climate emergency, and Trump had failed to appreciate the scale of the crisis. “To assume you can have a great, profitable America, and happy Americans without understanding the risk to Americans from climate change is astounding. It just demonstrates the level of denial, and the capture of this government by the coal, oil and gas industries.” Trump said the American dream was back, “bigger, better and stronger” than before, adding that the benefits of growth were going primarily to low-income workers rather than the better off. Trump added that 7m jobs had been created and 12,000 factories opened during his presidency. Many of the president’s claims were rejected by the Columbia University economics professor Joseph Stiglitz. “Research shows that Trump normally tells five or six lies a day. He far exceeded that today,” he said, noting that growth had been faster under Barack Obama than it was currently under Trump, and that life expectancy had fallen every year of his presidency. Although the US economy grew far more rapidly in previous decades than it has since he was elected in November 2016, Trump said: “I’m proud to say that the US is in an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before.” The main hall in Davos, together with an overspill room, were packed to hear the president, although there were some titters as he ran through a litany of boasts. “I hold up the American model as an example to the world,” Trump said, contrasting his record with that of his predecessor, Obama. The US was “thriving, flourishing and winning” unprecedentedly, he added, citing trade deals signed last week with China and Mexico-Canada as models for the 21st century. “I am looking forward to a tremendous new trade deal with the UK,” Trump said, noting that Britain had a “wonderful new prime minister” in Boris Johnson, who was keen on a deal. The president said the economic boom had happened despite the US Federal Reserve, which “raised rates too fast and cut them too slowly”."
"Ministers have been urged to step in to help families whose homes are at imminent risk of collapsing into the sea on the fastest-eroding coastline in northern Europe. Residents in the Yorkshire village of Skipsea were told this week that more than 20 homes were at risk of falling into the North Sea in the next 12 months, with hundreds vulnerable in the coming decades. Parts of the 52-mile east Yorkshire coast are disappearing much faster than forecast. Rising sea levels and more frequent storms brought on by the global climate emergency have accelerated the erosion. Councillors will this week urge ministers to treat coastal erosion as a natural catastrophe like flooding, saying that there is a lack of national guidance and funding to help tackle the issue. Jane Evison, a councillor on East Riding council, said families whose homes were at imminent risk of sliding into the sea were liable to pay the full cost of demolishing their property and for their relocation. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) provides up to £6,000 in retrospective funding towards the cost of demolishing each property, but Evison said the total bill was at least double that. “The’ve lost their home and the legal responsibility is on them – they don’t have that sort of money,” she said. “At the moment the only funding we have available to us is from Defra [but] it doesn’t cover the cost at all, and then the council is making up the remainder of what it costs.” Evison said ministers should treat coastal erosion like flooding, where significantly larger pots of funding are made available to local authorities, homeowners and businesses to cover the bill for damage. She said: “We know sea levels are rising. It’s going to accelerate. It’s an act of nature we have no control over. We think it isn’t a special case – it’s the same as flooding – so we should be able to bid for genuine costs to help keep people safe.” A council report, due to be discussed on Wednesday, found that some parts of the picturesque Yorkshire coastline were disappearing at more than double the average speed. On one two-mile stretch south of Withernsea, near Hull, 10 metres were lost in nine months last year, compared with a yearly average of four metres. The report states: “This erosion rate is expected to increase in future due to sea level rise and more frequent storm events linked to climate change, which will put even greater pressure on both the coast and council resources. “Despite this, there remains a lack of national policy guidance and funding mechanisms for adaptive management in locations where defences cannot be constructed or maintained.” Prof Mike Elliott, who co-authored an academic report on coastal erosion, said the government was wary of “opening the floodgates” to potentially thousands of compensation claims for people living on the eroding east coast, which stretches from Bridlington to the white cliffs of Dover. A Defra spokesman said it was investing £1.2bn in coastal defences to protect 170,000 properties by 2021 and that it was working with local authorities on a £23m five-year scheme to monitor the erosion."
"The search for alternative energy sources in the age of climate change has overlooked tidal energy: a vast and unexploited worldwide resource.  For three decades now, tidal lagoon schemes have been recommended as an economically and environmentally attractive alternative to tidal barrages. More recently, two proposals for tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay, Wales have emerged and there have been several reports documenting how such a project there could have the potential to harness significant energy resources.  Tidal energy involves constructing a barrage, a dam or some other sort of barrier to harvest power from the height difference between high and low tides. The power is generated by running the water through turbines, found within the barrier. The technology used is very similar to that found in hydropower schemes, however unlike rivers tidal currents run in two directions. Where a tidal barrage blocks off an entire estuary, a tidal lagoon instead impounds an artificially created area of the sea or estuary. A lagoon doesn’t necessarily have to be connected to the shore – it could even sit out in the ocean.  As the tide goes out the lagoon remains closed, and full. It then opens the flood gates to let the water out until water levels on each side of the lagoon wall are even. When the tide comes in the process is reversed.  It’s tough to estimate exactly how much tidal power can be exploited, but the UK may have close to half of Europe’s total. And few potential sites worldwide are as close to electricity users and the transmission grid as those in the UK.  Swansea Bay is located in the Bristol Channel on the South Wales coastline. As part of the Severn Estuary it experiences one of the world’s largest tidal ranges, often reaching 10m.  A tidal lagoon has been mooted in the bay before, back in 2004, but the latest proposals are on a grander scale. The structure shown below would cover 11.5 km2, cost £913m to construct, and would be capable of generating 495 GWh per year – enough energy to power 155,000 homes. The Swansea Bay scheme demonstrates a renewed interest in tidal power, which has many advantages compared to other renewable sources. It is well documented that increasing integration of volatile, unpredictable sources of renewable energy such as wind and solar power jeopardises the stability of the power grid. In order for the grid to remain stable the power generated at any instance has to match demand, therefore it is important that the transmission network contains power sources that are immediately available. While the sun may stop shining, and the wind can drop, the tides remain predictable – an obvious advantage for tidal power and a great help for National Grid forecasters. Yet improvements are still needed. The upfront costs remain high, and there are some ecological implications. Experiences with artificially closed compounds have demonstrated that the costs of managing an artificial tidal basin (for example in the case of La Rance, Brittany, and Cardiff Bay), Wales are high and need careful monitoring and planning.  Turbines can become more efficient, perhaps learning from the wind industry about aspects such as varying the speed of turbines. We need to develop better 3D modelling to get a better sense of how the tides ebb and flow, and how turbines perform under turbulence. But there are important positives that should lead to more tidal power. The re-opening of dams and barriers, often built between the 1950s and 1970s can have great ecological benefits for the water bodies behind them due to a creation of a gradient that is beneficial to aquatic ecology (brackish water) and an increased oxygen content; in such instances, tidal technology can also be used as a tool for water quantity management, while generating power.  They can actually improve some ecosystems and have additional societal benefits besides renewable energy such as flood defence, environmental and ecological water quality improvement, fisheries and even tourism functions.  New technologies are being developed that would allow energy to be harvested from new areas, where the difference between high and low tides are measured in centimetres rather than metres. All this make an investment in a tidal lagoon for Swansea Bay seem like a strong investment in the future."
"Would the prime minister rule out protecting Australians from terrorism if it cost a single job? Would he promise that no nurse, teacher or other public servant would be sacked in pursuit of a budget surplus? Of course not. But when it comes to preventing dangerous climate change, the government whose policies closed the entire Australian car industry claims that every job is sacred. Yeah, right. The one thing we can say with certainty about the coal industry is that, regardless of climate policy, automation will decimate coal communities in the coming decade. The coal companies sacked around half their workforce in the late 80s – the minute new technology let them – and the coal industry is gearing up to do it again. Adani promised its proposed Queensland coalmine would be automated “from pit to port” and the rest of the industry is publicly preparing for the same goal.  But while #ScottyFromMarketing loves to position himself as defending coal workers from climate activists, he is strategically silent when it comes to protecting those same coal workers from the ravages of automation. If the Coalition wanted to protect the jobs of those who currently work in the coal industry, they would ban the introduction of robot-driven trucks and trains in existing mines and ban the construction of new, highly automated mines in regions that have never mined coal. But they won’t, because supporting the coal industry has nothing to do with protecting the jobs of existing coal workers. Coal is about symbolism and the symbiotic relationship between the Coalition and the coal industry. Fresh from doing nothing to prepare for the worst bushfires Australia has ever seen, Scott Morrison’s latest inactivity revolves around doing nothing to prevent our already changed climate from heatingup even more. Now that pretending there’s doubt about the science of climate change doesn’t cut it, our spin-doctor-in-chief has moved on to feigning concern with the economy as his latest excuse for climate inaction. The prime minister is under mounting pressure to match the net-zero emission targets for 2050 that’s supported by all Australian states (including New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia, with Liberal governments). And while he might not hold a hose when the bushfires are raging, there’s no doubt Morrison knows how to put a fire hose on his colleagues. Step one is, of course, to shoot the messenger. While it’s usually scientists or environmentalists that cop abuse for speaking up against the federal government’s love affair with coal, Morrison didn’t miss a beat when he set out to mock and belittle the NSW environment minister, Matt Kean. Practice makes perfect. Step two is to pull out the straw man. Shutting the coal industry down overnight would be reckless and cause lots of pain for no real gain. The fact that no one, ever, has called for the shutdown of the coal industry overnight makes it a particularly hard fight to lose. But it distracts journalists for just long enough to move things along to step 3. Econobabble. If we know one thing about the economy it’s that it changes so frequently and so unexpectedly that it is literally impossible to predict. But even though no economist can accurately predict what the exchange rate or unemployment rate will be in three years’ time, Australian governments have become expert in worrying about what the economy will look like in 30 years’ time. It doesn’t matter whether it’s tax cuts, penalty rate cuts or climate policy. Australian politicians love to talk in detail about what the impact of their policies will be in 30 years’ time, rather than talk at all about the problems they are ignoring today. Peter Costello started it with his ridiculous fear campaign about “the costs of ageing”, but the Coalition, under Abbott and Morrison, plumbed new depths with their fear campaign aimed at anyone trying to save the planet. Saying that you accept the science of climate change but think preventing it is a bit expensive is like saying you accept the science of immunisation but then decide to only inoculate one of your three kids. Climate science told us long ago that our bushfires, hail storms, floods and cyclones were going to get a lot worse if we kept burning so much coal, oil and gas. Economics has told us all along that prevention is cheaper than cure, and that the removal of fossil fuel subsidies and the introduction of a carbon price would be good for the overall economy, good for the budget and good for the climate. But just as we replaced real science with climate denial, we have replaced real economics with dodgy forecasts and bizarre criteria like protecting every coal job for the next 30 years. Less than a year ago, Morrison promised the budget would be in surplus, wage growth would pick up and the economy would grow strongly. They were wrong about these things, not because they are stupid, but because no one knows what will happen to the economy in a year’s time – let alone in decades to come. Which brings me back to that fire hose Morrison is trying to put on his Liberal colleagues who believe it makes more sense to try and prevent climate change than to use a term in government blaming others for it. When pushed on setting more ambitious emission reduction target, Morrison mounted his high horse to declare: “What troubles me is that there are plenty of people at the moment who will go out and make a glib promise about that and they can’t look Australians in the eye and tell them what it will mean for their electricity prices, what it will mean for their jobs.” Whether because of privatisation, outsourcing, offshoring, technological change, policy change or just plain bad luck, we should always be generous in helping people when they’re forced to make a new start. But promising that our country won’t tackle climate change unless every single coal worker’s job is safe is not generous. It’s a cruel hoax designed to conceal climate inaction. No one job is worth saving at the expense of dangerous climate change. Not even Scott Morrison’s. • Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute"

"Australia’s unprecedented bushfire crisis has unfolded in waves across the spring and summer, demanding coverage across many months that has encompassed a vast geographical area and has tried to make sense of dozens of interrelated narratives, from the personal stories of individuals caught in the disaster to the devastation of wildlife, social media misinformation and the overarching relevance of the climate crisis. The key vehicle for delivering the news on the bushfires has been our daily live blog. Our first day of live coverage, incredibly, was on 10 September, months before the normal onset of the bushfire season, when fires raced through parts of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. Since early November we have covered the fires live on 32 days, including continuously from 16 December to Christmas Eve, and again from 30 December to 11 January, often for more than 12 hours a day. But of course an event of this size and drama cannot be covered solely from the office. The logistical challenges of putting reporters and photographers into fire zones hundreds of kilometres from their Sydney or Melbourne bases have been huge. The safety of our journalists has always been our priority, but inevitably in a situation where the demands on them are extreme and communications often impaired, there have been anxious moments. We have been rewarded by extraordinary dispatches, telling the stories of places whose names have sadly become synonymous with disaster: Balmoral, Cobargo, East Gippsland. In other towns, such as Mallacoota and Malua Bay, we have been able to reconstruct the terrifying events there through the accounts of residents both in print and audio. The crisis came at what is usually the quietest news time of the year, when many staff are on leave. Many gave up their summer breaks to work long hours on our coverage. Some were themselves caught up in the fires while on holiday, able to report on a harrowing experience only when communications were restored. Reporting events on this scale has been challenging enough, but putting them in the context both of Australian domestic politics and the wider question of climate change has put even greater demands on our reporters and opinion writers. From the start we have been at pains to keep the climate crisis at the forefront of our coverage, by explaining the science and holding the government to account for its response. The photographer Chris Hopkins and I drove from Melbourne to Bairnsdale, Victoria on Monday 30 December, the day after emergency services took the unprecedented step of advising everybody in the far-east wedge of the state to get out. Under a bridge on the eastern side of Bairnsdale, next to a sign that said “no camping”, we found evacuees such as 77-year-old Marilyn Withers, whose face was red from the 43C heat. That night the temporary campground under the bridge swelled to the hundreds, including many who had fled with just the clothes on their backs and who were now sleeping in their cars. The discount department store sold out of tents that night, we were told. Many people had not intended to flee, but changed their minds when they saw the size and speed of the smoke column. It looked like a moving volcano. We watched from a pie-and-sandwich shop on the edge of town alongside Alan and Jenny Blair, who had made a last-minute decision to leave their six-hectare property at Wy Yung. While we spoke the wind was roaring in from the north-west, pushing the fire towards Wy Yung and Bairnsdale. At 5pm, the wind changed, sparing the Blairs’ home but devastating the villages of Clifton Creek, Sarsfield, and Bruthen, taking 43 houses and a school. The next morning at the official evacuation centre it was easy to spot those whose houses had been lost. They walked around white-faced, desperate to talk to someone but wary of the notebook. I made friends with the animals: 250 horses held safe in the saleyards, countless dogs, five chickens laying eggs in the back of a Landrover. Shellshocked humans who did not want to talk about how they were doing told me about how their pets were faring, and then their kids, and then finally themselves. Everyone who stayed to defend their property told us they would never do that again. I grew up in the shadow of bushfires, on the other side of the Victorian alps. When a woman told me the church where her family was buried had burned down, I told her my family’s church had burned too, in another bushfire. It feels inevitable now that if you live in Australia some part of your life will burn down. It’s just a matter of when. My first fire callout this season was to the well-heeled Sydney suburb of Turramurra in November, where no property was lost, houses were doused in the delightfully coloured pink fire retardant and some departing firefighters handed us ice creams on their way out. My most recent was to the area around Nowra, south of Sydney, and the NSW southern highlands in January, where houses were lost and fires created their own lightning storms. In between, I went to the Mount Gospers fire twice and the Green Wattle Creek fire as it hit Balmoral again and again over consecutive days. Reporting on the fires requires a lot of driving, instinct and guesswork. There is often more information in the newsroom than on the ground, and we relied a lot on firefighters, the fire and traffic apps and radio broadcasts. I also received text updates on wind and weather changes from my dad, who can read charts better than I can. We would find crews, conduct interviews, take photos and get advice about where we could see firefighting efforts without getting in the way or getting too reckless. Then we’d park the car for half an hour, file to Guardian Australia’s live blog or the news desk, and do it all again somewhere else. In Kurrajong Heights, photographer Jessica Hromas and I met a strike team waiting for a fire to come up from the gorge and into the suburbs. A firefighter told us where to park our car – facing out and with doors unlocked – and said he’d give us a radio so he could tell us when to escape. Again and again I saw the short-lived relief in people’s faces as a wind change saved their home, before they realised it meant someone else would likely lose theirs. From a personal point of view, it has been heartbreaking. The scale of the disaster, the fear and anger and sense of powerlessness on the ground is palpable, and it’s the moments that are hard to write about in the usual news style that I will remember the longest: The sound of thunder in Nowra rolling overhead from dirty brown clouds, knowing it was one of three storms generated by a nearby fire. The feeling of guilt having firefighters check on our welfare and make sure we weren’t hungry. The steely bravery on the face of a 12-year-old kid who wasn’t evacuated before the roads closed and was now helping their mum put out spot fires in the backyard. The overwhelming desire to hug interview subjects, either because they’d just gone through something horrific or they’d just done something extraordinarily selfless, and because this isn’t just a news story, this is home. There has been a lot of anger and politics swirling around Australia’s bushfires, as well as a lot of facts – some relevant, some not, and some fake. As an environment reporter, one of my main roles during the bushfire crisis has been to get into that swirling mess and come out with something that gives people a clear picture of what’s going on. So while some of my colleagues have been delivering blistering and heart-wrenching narratives from the fire grounds, I’ve been knee deep in academic papers about bushfires, and conversations about the Forest Fire Danger Index and the Indian Ocean dipole. I have been talking to ecologists to work out what the environmental impact of these fires will be – the answer is unfolding, but the experts say they’ll be amazed if we don’t see species becoming extinct. We’d had warnings this bushfire season was going to be bad – rainfall had been at record low levels in many areas, and temperatures at record highs. As the fires took hold in NSW and continued in Queensland, a blame game emerged. These fires had little to do with the climate crisis, some were saying, but were down to “greenies” and their “policies” to stop hazard-reduction burning in forests and national parks. Australia has plenty of academic expertise on bushfires because it’s part of our lived experience. One of the first people I spoke to, Prof Ross Bradstock, gave an almighty sigh when I called him up to ask if this really was all the fault of the Greens. This was “conspiracy stuff”, he said, an accusation that almost always came up after major bushfires. I later took a further look at hazard-reduction techniques and their limitations. I tried never to leave the climate question unanswered. I’ve spoken to I don’t know how many experts in their field over the last few months. I’ve disturbed conservationists and scientists on their holidays. One ecologist on Kangaroo Island was telling me what was going on while she and her children evacuated her house from the threat of a fire. The climate crisis comes up in every conversation. "
"It’s the most famous taxi in the world and a British icon, rivalling the Queen and red pillar boxes for global recognition. Now there’s a battle to make London’s black cabs greener. Geely, the Chinese automaker that owns the London Taxi Company, is investing £250m in a zero-emission capable version of the world-famous black cab to be built in Coventry. British firm Metrocab based in nearby Tamworth has also developed an eco-friendly version of the London cab. Meanwhile Shenzen-based BYD has signed a deal to provide electric cars for London chauffeuring firm Thriev. It’s no surprise these innovations are happening in London as the city has taken increasingly aggressive steps to combat poor air quality. Since 2008 London has hosted one of the largest low emission zones (LEZ) in the world and an ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ) has now been announced that will come into force in central London in 2020, with proposed regulations on new taxi purchases as early as 2018. On the face of it, electric vehicles (EVs) are the perfect fit for taxis. Taxi firms differ from private consumers as the vehicles can be in almost continuous use, so running and operational costs are much more important than initial purchase price. Wherever electricity is significantly cheaper than petrol, cab companies are able to absorb the higher costs of EVs. Research by Coventry University on small car fleets supports the evidence from a growing number of EV taxi firms that higher levels of vehicle usage can quickly translate into savings. Electric vehicles are also more reliable than their conventionally fuelled equivalents as EVs have fewer moving parts – which is a big advantage when temporarily losing a cab means an immediate loss of revenue. Low or zero tailpipe emissions may not always be a big draw for individual passengers, but they can be enough to win corporate and government clients keen to burnish their environmental credentials. Finally, larger firms can enter the electric vehicle market on a trial basis, supplementing their fleet without the risk of disruption that individual buyers might experience if going electric proves to be not to their liking. Yet technical challenges remain. Taxis aren’t public transport. They don’t follow set routes, might not own their own specialist infrastructure and are less likely to have set idling times. As such, limited range, charging time and availability are all more significant impediments for cab firms. The new model proposed by the London Taxi Company would overcome this challenge by operating a hybrid engine capable of running on electricity in the ultra-low emissions zone and petrol outside it. Metrocab’s solution is to use a petrol range extender to boost battery life. At the same time, firms such as Thriev have sought to roll out their own charging infrastructure to reduce charge times down to half an hour. Yet clearly doubts linger – and it is telling that while Nissan decided to suspend its petrol-based version of the black cab (also assembled in the West Midlands) in light of the ULEZ announcement, they have not announced plans to introduce an electric version. As David Bailey at Aston Business School observes, the current market leader in electric vehicles appears to be adopting a wait-and-see approach, to see how the market develops. After all there is still quite a bit of scope for change – and by 2018 a range of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will provide a faster fuelling, if more expensive, alternative. These concerns are real, but so are the opportunities for manufacturers. London’s ultra-low emissions zone announcement represents the next step in a trend towards city-level polluter-pays policies. Europe already has well over 100 low emission zones. Paris, for instance, already operates a very visible electric vehicle sharing scheme and a ban of diesel vehicles has been mooted for 2020. In Beijing, new emission limits are being considered, while an entire zero-emission city is being built in Dongtan, an island near Shanghai.  Global warming may be low on the priority list for national governments, but for city authorities the impact of emission on air quality is often an immediate and pressing concern. Manufacturers that are able to make a success of the London ULEZ  may find a queue of emerging-market megacities considering similar regulations. In this context, it is no coincidence that two Chinese car-makers are leading the race. Electric taxis are more common in Chinese cities, in large part due to the high costs of liquefied natural gas as an alternative fuel. Chinese automakers have also struggled to establish their brands in Europe and America, but in the taxi market they are more able to compete on specifications.  Geely’s investment in LTC could be a masterstroke. In one leap, Geely acquires a globally recognised design icon, a relatively protected launch market in the form of the London black cab trade and access to significant research and development resources in the West Midlands. Geely already produces a version of the London cab in Shanghai and has a stated interest in pushing exports for the updated electric model. All of which is good news for the UK. The ultra-low emissions zone both improves health in the capital and injects life into the emerging electric taxi sector where the country has historic design advantages. This demonstrates the strength of coupling forward-looking environmental policies with regional R&D investments in niche sectors. Whether or not this outcome is design or a happy coincidence will surely not trouble the prime minister as he touts the deal on the campaign trail."
"African elephants are in serious danger. The magnificent creatures are found in 37 countries – and most of these populations are threatened by poaching. The problem is that protecting elephants isn’t cheap and conservationists struggle to fund their work.  In Africa, budgets are tight and governments have bigger priorities such as funding health and education. At an international level public sympathy for elephants rarely translates into cash, so donor funding is normally short-term and unpredictable. This is why many African governments stockpiled ivory that was confiscated from poachers or came from elephants that died of natural causes before selling their ivory legally and using the money to pay for conservation work. This last happened in 2008 but several African countries are stockpiling more of their ivory for the future. Many countries outside Africa – prominent among them China – have markets for antique and legally stockpiled ivory. So the sale of ivory can provide a reliable source of funding for elephant conservation. But outside Africa this trade is often passionately opposed. This partly comes from lack of awareness – many people think all ivory comes from poaching, whereas some comes from elephant deaths and herd conservation and management. Many people are also uneasy about the idea of making money from wildlife and are particularly uncomfortable when it involves animals as majestic as elephants. This is one reason why in the last year several countries have destroyed their ivory stockpiles in the hope it will discourage trade and reduce poaching. In contrast, countries such as Botswana and South Africa, which have large and growing elephant populations, continue to store theirs. A more specific issue has come to light, however. We now have good evidence that the trade is being undermined by corruption. Poached ivory is being laundered as legal ivory and park staff, customs officials and politicians have been implicated. Some conservationists argue this corruption can’t be tackled and have called for a complete trade ban. The fact that people are exposing these examples of corruption is a great step forward. This is because conservationists are generally wary of publicising the problem. However, together with colleagues, I recently argued that we should not single out the ivory trade. Corruption could be undermining every aspect of elephant conservation and we have no evidence that this trade is more affected. Successful elephant conservation is based on funding park management, enforcing laws and sharing benefits with local people. All of these can be undermined by bribery, cronyism and embezzlement. This is illustrated by a 2010 study that looked at how well African national parks protected their wildlife. It showed that all animals are in decline in the more corrupt countries, including lower-profile species such as antelopes and zebras. This suggests elephant numbers would be dropping anyway in these countries, independent of international wildlife trade policy. Fortunately, evidence from business and anti-poverty projects does show that corruption can be tackled. An important first step is breaking up the problem into specific issues, such as embezzlement of national park budgets or bribery of police to turn a blind eye to poaching. This makes the task less daunting, changing the idea that corruption is a huge, unsolvable problem. Many of these problems can then be reduced by adopting good business practice. These include commonsense actions such as checking project bank accounts and sacking rule-breakers. Another approach is to focus on where conservation groups have the most influence. Police and customs officials put most of their efforts into stopping crimes against people, not animals. So it makes sense for conservationists to try and stop elephants being poached in the first place. Increasing success on the ground ensures healthy elephant populations and local people’s support for their conservation. It also tackles the problem of ivory laundering at source. All of this suggests we can tackle corruption in elephant conservation but need to change how conservationists deal with the problem. A good start would be following the example of anti-poverty groups, such as CAFOD, Tearfund and Christian Aid. They recognised that corporate bribery was stopping them achieving their goals and took action. This is why they played an active role in publicising the problem and supporting new anti-corruption initiatives, such as the recent UK Bribery Act. Just as importantly, the international community needs to consider corruption when developing elephant conservation strategies. At the moment, it takes a crisis before new policies and projects are developed. These initiatives then focus on countries with the biggest poaching problems and assume more money and stricter laws will help. But such policies actually play into the hands of corrupt officials. It is much easier to steal money in a crisis and stricter laws just create more opportunities for bribery. Burning ivory reduces the supply and could increase prices on the black market. So unless corruption is tackled, investing in elephant poaching hot-spots will be a short-term solution at best. Instead, we need projects to understand and tackle corruption. We should learn from countries with successful elephant conservation policies and give them a greater voice in international debates. Finally, we should discuss corruption more openly and use our head as well as our heart when trying to save Africa’s elephants."

By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)

The Gulf Stream provides heating for Western Europe. Some climate activists paint horror scenarios on the wall that the Gulf Stream is slowing down or even stopping due to climate change – with fatal consequences for Europe. However, other scientists see no evidence of this in the hard data. You can find more on this discussion at our DkS archive.
Today’s blog post: What’s new on the Gulf Stream?
In February 2019, Lozier et al. reported in Science that the models did not even correctly quantify the most important drives of the Gulf Stream. The dominant factor is not the Labrador Sea east of Canada, but the Arctic Ocean east of Greenland. See also report in The Daily Caller.
The Gulf Stream is apparently not as vulnerable to climate change as we thought. ScienceNews on 31 January 2019:
Climate change might not slow ocean circulation as much as thought
New findings from an international ocean observing network are calling into question the long-standing idea that global warming might slow down a big chunk of the ocean’s “conveyor belt.” The first 21 months of data from sensors moored across much of the North Atlantic are giving new insight into what controls the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, a system of currents that redistributes heat around much of the Western Hemisphere.
Researchers had thought the strength of that circulation, known by the acronym AMOC, was largely influenced by the sinking of cold freshwater in the Labrador Sea, between Greenland and Canada. And climate simulations suggest that the sea’s deepwater formation might slow as the world continues to warm — which also could slow down the entire Atlantic current system and possibly make temperatures on land in the northeastern United States and the United Kingdom plunge. That concept inspired the (otherwise unrealistic) 2004 climate apocalypse film The Day After Tomorrow.

This MDR report from July 2018 also deals with fundamental problems of understanding:
Does a weak Gulf Stream deliver heat to us?
A new study is causing uproar and a lot of criticism. It deals with the Gulf Stream. So far it has been said: If it becomes weaker and possibly fails to appear at all, then it gets cold. A research team from China and the USA now claims the opposite. They say that a weakening Gulf Stream is heating up the global temperature once again.”.

Also see the articles on the study in Die Welt. Backers of the tough IPCC line were horrified. Alarmist site Klimareporter does not like the study at all and calls it “provocative“. Also the climate alarmist SZ daily was also dissatisfied. It is best to have the results explained directly by the authors without filtering. What follows is the accompanying press release from the University of Washington dated 18 July 2018:
Atlantic Ocean circulation is not collapsing – but as it shifts gears, global warming will reaccelerate
A huge circulation pattern in the Atlantic Ocean took a starring role in the 2004 movie “The Day After Tomorrow.” In that fictional tale the global oceanic current suddenly stops and New York City freezes over. While many aspects of the movie are unrealistic, oceanographers are concerned about the long-term stability of the Atlantic Ocean circulation, and previous studies show that it has slowed dramatically in the past decade. New research from the University of Washington and the Ocean University of China finds the slowdown is not caused by global warming but is part of regular, decades-long cycle that will affect temperatures in coming decades. The paper [Chen & Tung 2018] was published July 18 [2018] in Nature.
“Climate scientists have expected the Atlantic overturning circulation to decline long-term under global warming, but we only have direct measurements of its strength since April 2004. And the decline measured since then is 10 times larger than expected,” said corresponding author Ka-Kit Tung, a UW professor of applied mathematics with an adjunct appointment in atmospheric sciences.
“Many have focused on the fact that it’s declining very rapidly, and that if the trend continues it will go past a tipping point, bringing a catastrophe such as an ice age. It turns out that none of that is going to happen in the near future. The fast response may instead be part of a natural cycle and there are signs that the decline is already ending.”
The results have implications for surface warming. The current’s speed determines how much surface heat gets transferred to the deeper ocean, and a quicker circulation would send more heat to the deep Atlantic. If the current slows down, then it will store less heat, and Earth will be likely to see air temperatures rise more quickly than the rate since 2000.
“The global climate models can project what’s going to happen long-term if carbon dioxide increases by a certain amount, but they currently lack the capability to predict surface warming in the next few decades, which requires a knowledge of how much the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases is being absorbed by the oceans,” Tung said.
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, is a conveyor belt that brings surface water northward in the Atlantic; from there, the heavier salty water sinks and returns at depth from the Labrador and Nordic seas, near the North Pole, all the way south to the Southern Ocean. Most people are interested in what happens at the surface — the Gulf Stream and associated Atlantic currents carry warmer water north, bringing mild temperatures to Western Europe.
But the new paper argues that the most important step, from a climate perspective, is what happens next. In the North Atlantic, the saltier water from the tropics sinks almost a mile (1,500 meters). As it does, it carries heat down with it away from the surface.
Changes in the strength of the AMOC affect how much heat leaves our atmosphere. The new study uses a combination of data from Argo floats, ship-based temperature measurements, tidal records, satellite images of sea-surface height that can show bulges of warm water, and recent high-tech tracking of the AMOC itself to suggest that its strength fluctuates as part of a roughly 60- to 70-year, self-reinforcing cycle.

When the current is faster, more of the warm, salty tropical water travels to the North Atlantic. Over years this causes more glaciers to melt, and eventually the freshwater makes the surface water lighter and less likely to sink, slowing the current.
When the AMOC is in a slow phase, the North Atlantic becomes cooler, ice melt slows, and eventually the freshwater melt source dries up and the heavier saltier water can plunge down again, which speeds up the whole circulation.
The new study argues that this current is not collapsing, but is just transitioning from its fast phase to its slower phase – and that this has implications for heating at the surface.
From 1975 to 1998, the AMOC was in a slow phase. As greenhouse gases were accumulating in the atmosphere, Earth experienced distinct warming at the surface. From about 2000 until now, the AMOC has been in its faster phase, and the increased heat plunging in the North Atlantic has been removing excess heat from the Earth’s surface and storing it deep in the ocean. “We have about one cycle of observations at depth, so we do not know if it’s periodic, but based on the surface phenomena we think it’s very likely that it’s periodic,” Tung said.
The new paper supports the authors’ previous research showing that since 2000, during which observations show a slowdown in surface warming, heat has accumulated deep in the Atlantic Ocean. The new study shows this is the same period when Atlantic overturning circulation was in its fast phase.
Recent measurements of density in the Labrador Sea suggest the cycle is beginning to shift, Tung said. That means that in coming years the AMOC will no longer be sending more of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases deep into the North Atlantic. “The good news is the indicators show that this slowdown of the Atlantic overturning circulation is ending, and so we shouldn’t be alarmed that this current will collapse any time soon,” Tung said. “The bad news is that surface temperatures are likely to start rising more quickly in the coming decades.”

Die Welt reported on July 21, 2019:
Deep temperatures have been measured in the North Atlantic since the 1940s,” reports Professor Monika Rhein of the University of Bremen. These temperatures are an indirect indication of the strength of the Gulf Stream. “These measured data show strong fluctuations, but no trend in any direction,” says the oceanographer, summing up the long series of measurements. A decrease in the Gulf Stream has therefore not yet been observed.”
The German Climate Consortium published a Brochure on the Gulf Stream in July 2018.
Thibodeau et al. 2018 2018 analyzed oxygen isotopes of foraminifera of a Northwest Atlantic sediment core and found that the attenuation of the Gulf Stream (AMOC) in the 20th century led to a Gulf Stream minimum in the 1970s. The Gulf Stream was also particularly weak during the Little Ice Age, a natural cold phase. See also report in the Daily Mail.
McCarthy et al. 2018 found that a part of the Gulf Stream variability was related to the NAO ocean cycle.
Yan et al. 2018 complained that climate models represented the strong Gulf Stream variability only in a diminished form, an important inadequacy of model simulations.
Todd et al. 2018 short-term changes of the Gulf Stream after powerful hurricanes.
Good et al. 2018:
The observed AMOC overturning has decreased from 2004–2014, but it is unclear at this stage whether this is forced or is internal variability.
Lique & Thomas 2018 warned that the Gulf Stream could change over time. Report on this at Scinexx:

North Atlantic: climate change shifts the circulation
Sinking zones of the Atlantic circulation could shift considerably
Shifted engine of circulation: Climate change could not only weaken the Atlantic circulation flow, but could also shift it, as a simulation now suggests. The large sink zones of warm water would no longer lie off Greenland, as they do today, but in the Arctic Ocean and the subtropical Atlantic. This, however, could have a strong influence on the current – and also alter the heat exchange and the buffer effect of the ocean, as the researchers report in the journal “Nature Climate Change”.

"They are the answer to the classic quiz question: “What is the most deadly animal on earth?” By the time contestants have debated the demerits of tigers, cobras and great white sharks scores of victims of the real worst killer will have died and other people will have been infected by the diseases it spreads. The mosquito goes about its deadly business every day, moving infections around that kill hundreds of thousands of humans every year.  It increasingly seems nowhere is safe – experts have warned mosquitoes could bring malaria and dengue fever to the UK within decades. There is nothing good to be said for mosquitoes. Scientists willingly concede that their eradication would bring significant benefits for humanity with no obvious downsides. What good mosquitoes might do, mostly through sheer weight of numbers as food for other creatures or as amateurish pollinators, are roles readily filled by alternative species. As the famous and charming folk song has it: “All God’s creatures got a place in the choir”, some singing higher, some lower and some just clapping their paws. However the lyrics do not suggest that any of the choir are sneaking off for a clandestine blood meal, infecting millions of people with malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, west Nile virus and a host of other less familiar dreads.  Even the most generous explanations of the mosquito’s place in the world is that it is here to remind us of our fall from grace. Instead of trying to invent a place for the mosquito in a supposed natural balance that is a cosy but flawed version of the natural world, perhaps it is better to see these insects as the Gothic fly in the ointment they so clearly are. The mosquito has replaced many of the old monsters and demons of earlier folklore in our imaginations.   Mosquito natural history is a perfect mixture of monstrous traits. They are associated with swamps and miasmas, those eerie and uncertain places of which humanity is wary. Even before we understood the role of these blood-sucking flies in transmitting disease, humanity had a sense that there was something carried in the filthy swampland air that brought disease and that these places were best avoided.  Swamps and fens are odd places, neither land nor water, but perfect mosquito habitat. In the UK some of the earliest surveys of ponds and wetlands in East Anglia were driven by the desire to find the mosquitoes’ lair, in the very same swamps where once saints and heroic warriors had ventured to confront fiends. Mosquitoes are also creatures of the night. The fall of darkness has always been a threat to us light-loving primates, not just at a basic biological level as our senses falter but also in religion and custom. Mosquitoes awake with the failing light, able to find their victims when we can only hear their whine.  Above all they suck blood in order to reproduce, or at least the females do, which only fuels the religious constructions of why humankind is plagued by them.  We no longer have the Saxon hero Beowulf to confront the monsters in their water lair, but instead Bill Gates has malaria and its mosquito vectors in his well resourced sights: the rational world of science and technology pitted against a blood sucking foe from the twilight. It is the classic struggle. Meantime mosquitoes have made some advances of their own. In the UK headlines warn us of a “plague”, that a “killer mosquito lurks in Britain” which will “threaten to terrorise the UK” . Malaria had been indigenous to the country since at least Roman times, notably around the coastal marshes of the Thames estuary, the same marshes from which the terrifying convict Magwitch looms at the start of Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations, in classic swamp monster style. However by the early 20th century the disease had been eradicated.   It is those same marshes that now seem to be home for a bridgehead of invasive mosquito species new to the UK, moving north from the continent. They include the Asian Tiger mosquito, a vector for west Nile virus. This mosquito is a miniature cantilevered marvel of black and white, drawn straight from the pages of a Victorian gothic fantasy. The killer swarms rising from their swamp lairs show no signs of retreat."
"Images of the crumbling fabric and antiquated network of environmental services, including the mechanical ventilation and air-conditioning system in the Palace of Westminster, suggest that the building may have had its day. Yet appearances may be deceptive.  A research project that I’ve been leading since 2012 has shown that the palace is actually a highly innovative building. The striking skyline of Gothic towers and turrets is the outcome of Victorian technical achievement and architectural design, and the stack system which provided ventilation for the debating chambers for more than 90 years is one that is now being widely considered as a model for low-energy, sustainable ventilation in large public buildings.  Victorian engineers and scientists were confronted with the challenge of resolving the two parallel (and, at times, competing) agendas of a flamboyant Gothic scheme and the problem of ventilating such a large building in the days before mechanical ventilation and air conditioning.  Since Christopher Wren remodelled the interior of St Stephen’s chapel for the House of Commons in the 17th century, the issue of air quality and temperature in the debating chamber had been a major concern. Overcrowding and candle lighting made the space difficult to keep cool and adequately ventilated. A fire in 1834 gave the opportunity to rebuild the palace – and an architectural design by Charles Barry and Augustus Welby Pugin was selected in January 1836, four years before the government decided on a stack ventilation system. It was a Scottish physician, David Boswell Reid, who presented a series of diagrams outlining what he considered the ideal ventilation system. Reid’s vision was a centralised system that would serve the entire palace, in which all of the fresh air was introduced through air shafts inside the Clock and Victoria towers. The air would be supplied to the different rooms via the basement with the aid of steam-powered fans.  The towers were part of Barry’s original architectural plans, but a third tower, known as the Central Tower, was added to function as a stack through which the building’s hot air could be exhausted. The stack effect was to be enhanced by waste heat from gas and smoke fumes, at times boosted with the aid of coke fires.  Reid tested his design in a model debating chamber at his laboratory in Edinburgh and, from autumn 1836, was able test his system in two chambers built as temporary accommodation for parliament. Members were directly involved in evaluating and refining the system, which included a sophisticated climate control strategy that created individually controlled micro-climates in different parts of the chamber. After four years of experimentation, Reid was finally employed to develop the stack ventilation system for the actual palace. But applying his system to the existing architectural design posed insurmountable difficulties and in 1846 the centralised scheme was abandoned. A simpler system using local turrets was adopted instead. Reid’s responsibility for the ventilation became confined to the House of Commons – while the architect, assisted by Michael Faraday and his engineers, took on the ventilation system for the House of Lords. Between 1847 and 1860 numerous local turrets were gradually introduced across the palace to serve individual sections.  The Central Tower was reduced in size and the striking skyline of turrets that contribute to the palace’s distinctive Gothic character, evolved in response to this decentralised approach. The original drawings and sketches also illustrate that the tiered outline of the turrets fulfilled functional requirements and that the stacks had sophisticated mechanical details such as storm guards and wind-sensitive louvres. Pugin and Barry subsequently gave the exterior of these utilitarian structures the appearance of elegant Gothic spires. The general principle behind the system was simple but its day-to-day operation involved a complex process: continuous monitoring of weather conditions, indoor climate and occupation levels and user experience. This was done entirely manually in a strict operational regime.  To maintain comfortable conditions the system had to respond to changes in the weather and fluctuations in the number of MPs, but also to highly subjective factors, such as the perception of temperature, humidity or air currents that members encountered inside the debating chamber. The monitoring system involved collecting and processing user feedback, alongside measurements. During every sitting the speaker or the sergeant-at-arms reviewed feedback from MPs, passed to them by messengers and, if necessary, gave orders to make ad-hoc adjustments to the climate conditions or the ventilation rate.  Although the speaker and many members knew that it would be impossible to achieve a full consensus on comfort, dissatisfied MPs frequently put pressure on attendants and engineers by demanding adjustments. In 1852, and again in 1854, the MPs appointed a select committee to review the design and management of the ventilation.  Reid’s original system was replaced with a new system after merely two years due to sustained pressure. He was never given enough time to fully complete his system, let alone demonstrate its full capabilities.  A new system by the physician Goldsworthy Gurney was adopted and in the House of Commons revealed significant improvements in temperature and air quality, but more importantly it received approval from MPs and a similar system was adopted in the House of Lords. No fewer than ten select committees were appointed over a 90-year period to specifically coordinate continuing scientific evaluations and performance.  The House of Commons was completely destroyed by the German Luftwaffe in 1941. The last, most systematic and comprehensive scientific evaluation before this historic system was destroyed was undertaken between 1902 and 1931. This included chemical and pathological examinations of the air, physiological studies, and investigations into improving air flow. In 1944, a special select committee recommended a modern system with air conditioning to replace the original Victorian system, which it dismissed as “antiquated” and “ineffective”. The new system was instead described as the “best which modern science can devise”. On several occasions between 1941 and 1943 Winston Churchill spoke passionately that the “traditional character” of the original debating chamber should be restored, yet advocated embracing modern technical solutions for the ventilation. Over the past seven decades we have experienced yet another change of attitude, and the forthcoming refurbishment opens up the opportunity to revisit the potential of the historic system. Stack ventilation is now touted for creating sustainable systems in large public buildings. There are numerous modern examples, including UCL’s Schools of Eastern European and Slavonic Studies or Cambridge’s Department of Mathematical Sciences.  Commons speaker John Bercow recently said that refurbishment required an approach through which the “Victorian legacy can be rendered practical for contemporary representation”. Detailed studies of the performance of the historic system that I’ve carried out suggests that that past could potentially inform the current renovation in a sustainable manner."

In a recently published paper published by a team lead by Jessica Wang of the Department of Earth System Science, University of California Irvine titled: “Hydroclimatic variability in Southeast Asia over the past two millennia,” in the journal of Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Wang et al found good evidence of a positive correlation with solar activity since 1200 CE, “contrary to the findings in previous studies”.

Wang is developing high-resolution and precisely dated stalagmite stable isotope records (of C and O) to evaluate past hydroclimate variability. She and her team of researchers compare the new records with regional tree-ring records and stalagmite records from the broader Asian monsoon region to better understand regional hydroclimate dynamics.

The researchers use global climate model simulations to better understand the role external forcings (i.e., solar activity) have on precipitation variability over the last two millennia.
What follows is the paper’s abstract:
The spatiotemporal variability of the Asian Monsoon (AM) over the last two millennia has been attributed to a combination of external solar and volcanic forcing and/or internal coupled atmosphere-ocean dynamics, but the relative importance of these mechanisms remains unresolved. The present knowledge of multidecadal to centennial-scale AM variability over Mainland Southeast Asia is not well-constrained, despite substantial progress in understanding seasonal to decadal variability from tree ring records. Here we present the first high-resolution stable isotope (δ13C and δ18O) speleothem record from northern Laos spanning the Common Era (∼50 BCE to 1880 CE). The δ13C record reveals substantial centennial-scale fluctuations primarily driven by local water balance. Notably, the driest period at our site occurred from ∼1280 to 1430 CE, during the time of the Angkor droughts, supporting previous findings that this megadrought likely impacted much of Mainland Southeast Asia. In contrast, variations in stalagmite δ18O reflect changes in rainfall upstream from our study site. Interestingly, the δ18O record exhibits a positive correlation with solar activity that persists after 1200 CE, contrary to the findings in previous studies. Solar-forced climate model simulations reveal that these δ18O variations may be driven by solar-forced changes in upstream rainout over the tropical Indian Ocean, which modify the δ18O of moisture transported to our study site without necessarily affecting local rainfall amount. We conclude that future rainfall changes in Mainland Southeast Asia are likely to be superimposed on multidecadal to centennial-scale variations in background climate driven primarily by internal climate variability, whereas solar forcing may impact upstream rainout over the Indian Ocean.”

Yet another paper showing that climate variability was common over the past 2000 years without added CO2 from man.
Confirmed by 100s of studies
Alarmists may wish to dismiss these findings, but Wang’s results are in line with those of hundreds of other studies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German business daily Handelsblatt here reported last month that leading German energy expert Jens Koeppen of Angela Merkel’s CDU party is calling for “drastic” permitting rules when it comes to installing wind turbines.

The proposed rules would make a number of proposed wind projects impossible.
Currently a work group that is focused on acceptance and made up of members from the coalition parties is trying to figure out a way to get around the rapidly growing protests against more wind turbines, whose erection are deforesting and industrializing large swaths of Germany’s idyllic landscape. 
Traditional environmentalists and conservationists are livid over the environmental destruction and health risks posed by wind parks. 
Protests have become formidable, and as reported yesterday here, Germany’s expansion of wind energy has literally ground to a halt as a result and has thus angered climate protection alarmists and Big Wind lobbyists.
The Handelsblatt writes citizens are tenaciously fighting the installation of 200-meter tall turbines, even doing so in court, and explains how one CDU-politician is calling for a nationwide wind turbine setback rule based on the one used in the southern state of Bavaria.
Bavarian 10H rule has effectively stopped new wind projects

The Bavarian 10H rule forbids the installation of any wind turbine within a distance equaling 10 times the height of the turbine from any residential area. That means no 200-meter tall turbine can be built within 2 kilometers from a residential area. In Bavaria that rule has literally ended the installation of new wind turbines.
Koeppen told the Handelsblatt that “the citizens must be taken seriously” or else “no progress will be made”.
Currently there’s a wave of lawsuits challenging wind park proposals across the country.
Communities risk being surrounded and plagued
The German UBA Office of Environment, however, warns that even a distance of 1000 meters would reduce the area wind turbines by up to 50% in some places.
Citizens are also very concerned about the health impacts from infrasound generated by wind turbines, which experts claimed can have an impact 10 kilometers away.
Once peaceful communities now find themselves divided
Wind energy has not only divided the environmentalists, but also disturbed the tranquility and harmony once found in many idyllic communities across the country.
Politicians as well are divided. The conservatives in the CDU aim to assure adequate setbacks for wind parks near communities. The socialists in the SPD, on the other hand, wish to relax the rules and thus clear the way for more wind park installation near communities.

"The Guardian’s Leave It In the Ground campaign names and shames the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation for not divesting their holdings in fossil fuel companies.  Editor Alan Rusbridger launched the project by declaring the case for the divestment of fossil fuel investment is overwhelming both on moral and financial grounds.   While this campaign and those against Harvard, Oxford, Sydney and other universities are great at generating publicity – the Wellcome Trust announced it had already sold off its £94m investment in ExxonMobil – they may be doing more harm than good.  The tactics applied harken back to the anti-apartheid boycotts of the 1960s-1980s in the hope that the campaigns will ultimately filter through to the money making parts of the fossil fuel industry. Yet none of the arguments for fossil fuel divestment appear to understand the nature and importance of ownership in modern shareholder societies.  One of the hallmarks of investing in a company is that share ownership confers the legal right of proportional ownership.  Legally, any individual holding a specific ownership share can bring issues to the company and has proportional rights to vote on all motions put to the ownership either by the board or shareholders. While corporations have to engage in conversations and negotiations with a multitude of “stakeholders”, it is only those who possess ownership rights that they are, in practice, accountable to in a fiduciary sense.  Shareholders determine the composition of the board, and the value of their investment will be influenced directly by what the board and senior management do. Those behind divestment campaigns have lost sight of the fact that investment can imply control.  Significant ownership shares, or coalitions of ownership shares, can be turned into activist voting blocks and also ensure that specific ownership interests get seats on the board.  For example, investor Dan Loeb used his fund’s position in Yahoo! to force a change of CEO while also gaining a seat on its board.  Groups such as Domini Social Investments are quite enthusiastic about their effective use of an activist investor approach to inducing corporate change.  On average they put a dozen proposals to shareholders of major corporations such as Apple, Energen and Pepsico a year, addressing issues ranging from methane emissions to political contributions and the role pesticides in the decline in the number of honeybees. Investment can influence corporate actions, which is why pension funds and institutional investors want to hold significant shares in key companies. The greater the investment, the more likely it is that the company’s management must take the viewpoint of the investor seriously, as in the Yahoo! case.  Divestment does little more on this dimension other than to turn an inside voice that can demand that a company listen into an outside voice that a company can easily ignore. Divestment does not destroy value – it simply transfers it to another set of owners who are not so morally outraged and are willing to pick up the shares set aside, at a slight bargain.  As the outraged owners are being replaced by less moral types, the likelihood that inside pressure can be brought to bear declines.  Hence, if the point of the divestment campaigners is to publicly shame the fossil fuel companies and put pressure on them to change their strategies, the campaign is doomed to fail.  Rather than the board and management having to suffer owners who are concerned about the moral direction of the company, they are now happily accountable to owners who are less likely to care about such things. Divestment campaigners seem to believe their investment goes to the company – that somehow this divestment starves the company of the ability to invest, or raises the cost of capital and debt.  In fact, buying shares does nothing to alter the cash flows available to that company for future investment.  The only time the company receives funds is when it issues new shares, and divestment will have no influence on this. Indeed, most major energy firms have not had new share offerings in decades.  Hence the conclusion that such divestment would reduce the investment capital available to fossil fuel companies has no basis in either financial reality or fact.   One response to this last general point is that while divestment will not hurt large companies, it will restrict investment in smaller fossil fuel and mining companies.  In reality this also makes no sense.   First, the groups that would divest are not so rich that they can move financial markets with their divestment alone or even in concert with others.  For example, while Harvard has lots of money in its endowment (US$36 billion) it still won’t change the price of oil or the value of oil companies. The university’s endowment pales in comparison to Bridgewater Associates (a hedge fund with US$169 billion under management) and most major pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, the majority of whom are unlikely to jump on the divestment bandwagon.  Harvard might divest, only to leave the investment to be picked up easily by investors from China, Qatar, or Indonesia.  Second, even if small companies did suffer through divestment there is nothing to stop the larger fossil fuel firms simply using their cash flow and borrowing capabilities to purchase their now cheaper and more vulnerable rivals.  So rather than divestment hurting the large amoral multinational fossil fuel companies and its remaining investors, it provides an opportunity for them to control and consolidate the industry further, potentially reaping more dividends from the act of consolidation.   If the divested funds were used to purchase shares in “alternative energy” companies all that would be happening is that the shares of those companies would be changing hands. Again, this share investment would not add to the cash flows or available investment capital of these companies unless the redirected investment went into new share offerings. Divestment campaigns can no doubt make people feel good about themselves and the actions they are taking to make the world a better place.  They can also put pressure on organisations who don’t have active ownership structures but instead view themselves as accountable to a range of people who act as if they have ownership rights – think of universities and their faculty, students and alumni.  All of this is noble.   However, such campaigns may be inferior to a more activist alternative, which is to either increase the investment or to work to pool the investments of like-minded shareholder groups so as to form ownership blocks that can demand changes in the board, management and strategy. In the end, it may be that moral outrage is not as effective as capitalism because one of the points of capitalism is to separate ownership from management while allowing owners control over managers.   One can express moral outrage about short-term shareholder capitalism but shares do not care who owns them and it is the job of the shareholder as owner to ensure that the company is run according to their wishes.  If the divestment advocates want companies to operate according to different precepts, perhaps more active ownership control would achieve their goals more quickly and effectively."
"Mongolia is hoping a massive dam on its largest river could provide much needed power and water for the country’s booming mining industry. However environmental groups are concerned that the hydroelectric power plant and a related pipeline project will do immeasurable environmental damage to oldest and deepest freshwater body in the world: Lake Baikal. As Baikal sits just over the border in Russia, Mongolia risks seriously annoying its northern neighbour at at time when the lake is already experiencing problems with invasive algae along its coasts, unregulated mining and a water level which just passed a “critically low” point. The Shuren Hydropower Plant, planned on the Selenga River in northern Mongolia, was first proposed in 2013 and is currently the subject of a World Bank-funded environmental and social impact assessment. In tandem, Mongolia is also considering building one of the world’s largest pipelines to transport water from the Orkhon River, one of the Selenga’s tributaries, to supply the miners in the Gobi desert 1,000km away. The impact of these projects will be most keenly felt downstream in Lake Baikal. The lake formed in a tectonic rift zone more than 25m years ago in southern Siberia. With a maximum depth of almost 1,700m, Baikal contains 20% of the world’s unfrozen freshwater.  Due to it’s great age, depth and remote location, more than 2,500 species have been documented in the lake, of which more than 75% are believed to be endemic and are found nowhere else in the world – from the microscopic plants that provide the lake with most of its energy to one of the world’s few truly freshwater seals, the nerpa or Pusa sibirica. Because of its unique characteristics and biodiversity, Lake Baikal was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. By far the largest and most important of the 350-plus rivers that flow into Lake Baikal is the Selenga River, which contributes almost 50% of the lake’s water. The Selenga and its tributaries cover a vast area, much of it in northern Mongolia, and the catchment of Lake Baikal is bigger than Spain. The river enters Lake Baikal through the Selenga Delta, a wetland of internationally recognised importance.   The delta is crucial to the health of Lake Baikal. Its shallow waters are a key spawning ground for Baikal’s many endemic fish and is on the migratory route for millions of birds every year. It also filters out impurities flowing through the river before they reach the lake. The Shuren dam isn’t the only threat to the delta, but it may be the most important. The Selenga is already very polluted; mining for gold and other minerals in northern Mongolia has resulted in elevated levels of heavy metals in the water. Sewage and waste-water treatment plants along its banks are often old, leading to elevated concentrations of nutrients and other contaminants.  However, actually disrupting the river flow into the Selenga delta and Lake Baikal has the potential to cause untold damage to the lake and its life. Any lowering of the delta’s shallow waters will disrupt the spawning grounds of many endemic fish species – and other species, including birds and aquatic insects will lose their homes.  Biodiversity loss has the potential to degrade Baikal’s unique ecosystems, resulting in severe economic implications for local and regional economies. Such is the concern that several environmental NGOs such as Rivers Without Boundaries and academics from Mongolia and Russia have lodged a request for the World Bank to be investigated as they claim the bank is disregarding its own regulations by funding an assessment for a project on a unique river system that is home to endangered species. The Russian Security Council, which advises the president on national security issues, has also voiced its concern. But Russia cannot be let off the hook either. In the early 1950s, a hydroelectric dam was built in the city of Irkutsk on the Angara River, Lake Baikal’s only outflow. On completion, the water levels of Lake Baikal increased by more than a metre, flooding almost 150,000ha of land, displacing 15,000 people and disrupting the Selenga delta spawning grounds. More recently, the Irkutsk dam has been implicated (along with lower than expected rainfall) in contributing to some of Lake Baikal’s lowest water levels for several decades. But these problems may pale into insignificance if the Shuren Hydropower Plant and the Orkhon-Gobi Water Diversion schemes in Mongolia get the green light."

An eye-opener book by Japanese MIT climate scientist now partly available in English at Kindle.

MIT climate scientist Dr. Mototaka Nakamura’s writes global warming data are “untrustworthy”, “falsified”.  Image: http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/
Not long ago we reported on a recently released book authored by Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, a scientist who received his doctorate from MIT and worked at NASA: “Confessions of a climate scientist The global warming hypothesis is an unproven hypothesis“.
After that post, I personally urged Dr. Nakamura to write the book in English.
Today I am very pleased to announce that a newly released Kindle version is now available with the important parts in English. You can download it for free for a limited time.
Please do download it! The English parts are within the Japanese text.
“Untrustworthy” and “falsified” data

In the book Dr. Nakamura writes how in the 1980s he became “seriously concerned about the predicted ‘catastrophic global warming due to the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere'” and how the issue motivated him to study the atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the North Carolina State University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and to become a climate scientist.
Ironically, rather than finding any robust scientific basis underpinning the hypothesis, Dr. Nakamura wound discovering just how “untrustworthy” and “falsified”  the data behind global warming really are.
“We also do not know for certain how the earth’ s climate has changed in the past 100 years or longer, although we do know well how regional climate has changed in limited regions, such as Europe, North America, and some parts of Asia,” he writes. “A quasi-global observation system has been operating only for 50 years or so, since the advent of artificial satellite observation. Temperature data before then were collected over extremely small (with respect to the earth’ s entire surface area) areas and, thus, have severe spatial bias.”
Confident other scientists will speak up on “fraudulent claims”
On whether other scientists will speak up, Nakamura wrote that he is confident that “some honest and courageous true climate scientists will continue to publicly point out the made by the ‘mainstream climate science community'”.
As an expert, Dr. Nakamura also believes that the climate simulation models used for climate change predictions have two “serious flaws” among many. One “fatally serious flaw” is the oceanic component of the models and the “grossly oversimplified and problematic representations of the atmospheric water vapor”.
Nothing except a propaganda tool
Dr. Nakamura concludes that the “global surface mean temperature change data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to the public.”

"Giant sequoia trees, the largest living organisms on the planet – some more than three millennia old – have started dying from beetle attacks linked to the climate emergency, the preliminary findings of a new study have revealed. The deaths of the trees, some of which lived through the rise and fall of hundreds of empires, caliphates and kingdoms – not to mention the inauguration of every US president – have shocked researchers in their speed and novelty.   In Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks in the Sierra Nevada, California, 28 giant sequoias have died from a seemingly deadly interaction between bark beetles, drought and fire damage since 2014, according to a joint National Park Service and US Geological Survey study that will be published later this year. Beetle attacks appear to have killed the trees in previously unseen ways, claiming mature standing giant sequoia trees known as monarchs. In addition to the beetle attacks, high-severity fires strengthened by drought and decades of natural wildfire suppression have killed 12 giant sequoias since 2015 in the national parks. The deaths have challenged age-old assumptions about the tree, which only grows on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada and is fabled for its near-indestructibility, attracting visitors from across the world. “It’s unheard of. It’s never happened before,” said Dr Christy Brigham, chief of resource management and science for Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, who oversees the welfare of ecosystems in the parks. “You think giant sequoias don’t die in fire, you think giant sequoias can’t be killed by insects. That’s not true any more.”  According to more than 100 years of records preceding California’s 2012-16 drought, sequoia trees either died by falling over or suffering near total crown scorch in wildfires, never while standing upright. But since the historically hot and dry drought, researchers have recorded trees dying “from the top down” with the notable presence of bark beetles in their crown.  Although the number of trees that have died is a small proportion of the approximately 6,000 sequoias in the park, Dr Nathan Stephenson, the US Geological Survey forest ecologist who conducted the research, said he expected more to succumb to beetle attacks if, as expected, droughts become more severe and frequent in the future due to the climate crisis. “I don’t expect a threshold to be passed, at least in my lifetime, when there’s suddenly gigantic outbreaks taking out whole groves of giant sequoias. I suspect it will be [beetles continuing to hit] the most stressed sequoias but they will be doing more sequoias, because there will be more stressed sequoias.” Stephenson said while there were no beetle attacks marked in park records, he suspected it might have happened before “deep in history”, but more needed to be done to understand what the insects were doing to the trees. Climate crisis contingency plans for giant sequoia tree deaths and high severity wildfires made for the 2050s are being enacted now, the National Park Service said. Ecologists are considering taking measures such as planting seedlings at higher elevations outside the areas sequoia trees usually grow and increasing prescribed burns to thin the forest as much as possible. Fire is vital to ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada mountains, clearing the forest floor and allowing new seedlings to establish themselves. The sequoia tree needs slow burning fire to reproduce, but decades of fire suppression has meant that burns have not taken place in some parts of the forest for over a century. As a result, the buildup of fuel in the forest means that when fires do take place, they are more intense than usual, killing sequoia trees in the process. “For the sequoias that died in fires, it’s a combination of past management practices plus the hotter drought that ganged up to kill so many,” Stephenson explained. “Sequoias have died in past fires when it hasn’t been an extreme hot drought, but it was fewer. Again, it might be a warning shot across the bow that if it continues to warm as projected, you might get more severe, longer-lasting, hotter droughts and sequoias will be exposed to those kinds of wildfires.” Tens of millions of trees have died across the US, ravaged by pests, wildfires and the effects of the climate crisis, research in August found. In February 2019, the US Forest Service announced 18m trees had died since 2017 in California, bringing the total to more than 147m for the years since the drought began in 2010.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday the online Hamburg Abendblatt published an interview with Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt on the recent climate demonstrations and alarmism. Vahrenholt calls the demonstrations and demands “over-the-top”, and a real threat to the economy. He says the climate models are unreliable and predictions of great warming “absurd”.

Vehrenholt is one of founders of Germany’s modern environmental movement, the founder of the country’s largest renewable energy company, Innogy and a member of Germany’s SPD socialist parties. Lately the retired professor has become renegade among his peers by criticizing the “over-the-top climate debate” and warning against “hasty reforms”.
Atmosphere of fear and hysteria
Vahrenholt tells the Abendblatt the climate debate has become hysterical and that in fact “we don’t have a climate emergency.” He adds: “If Greta Thunberg’s demands are implemented, global prosperity and development will be massively endangered.”
Vahrenholt is one of the more prominent signatories of the letter to the UN: “There is no climate emergency.”
In the interview with the Abendblatt, Vahrenholt rejects Thunberg’s  bleak world view, noting that human society has markedly improved on almost every front over the recent decades.
“The number of hungry people in the world has halved, life expectancy has doubled, and infant mortality has been reduced to tenths. These successes have been largely due to the supply of energy for electricity, heat, transport and nutrition,” said Vahrenholt.
When asked why so few German scientists (12) signed letter to the UN, Vahrenholt told the Abendblatt: “People no longer dare to express themselves differently.”
The German chemistry professor says spreading panic and fear is “irresponsible” and that we should: “Stop scaring the children – they are already getting delusions.”
Climate models still unreliable

Vahrenholt then tells the Abendblatt that “we have until the end of the century” to tackle greenhouse emissions – and not 12 years –  and that the situation is nowhere near as serious as the alarmist voices claim it is. Moreover, Vahrenholt reminds that the models still – which serve as the basis for the panic – have a long way to go before being reliable: “Many climate models have been shown to show too much warming and cannot reproduce the fluctuations of the past because they know only one factor: CO2.”
Later in the interview he asks: “What are we to think of models that neither reproduce the Little Ice Age nor the Medieval Warm Period – when it was about as warm as it is today?” In other words: If they don’t even work for the past, then they are completely unreliable for the future.
CO2 greens the planet
Vahrenholt reminds the Abendblatt that the added CO2 has in fact made the planet greener because of the boosted photosynthesis.
Only small number of scientists say man is 100% responsible
When asked about the 97% consensus, Vahrenholt tells the Hamburg-based daily that very few scientists deny CO2 has a warming effect, but adds: “Only a small minority believe that climate change is 100 percent man-made, and the vast majority believe in several causes.”
Green movement a real economic threat
Vahrenholt agrees that we have to reduce emissions, “but not commit suicide.”
The retired German professor advises against a hasty shutdown of coal energy, and warns it would lead to far greater poverty, even in prosperous Germany: “If we get out of coal and the combustion engine by 2030, then what will become of this country?

The retired professor also rejects the claims he turned his back on environmental protection, rather he has “stayed true to the cause”.
Schellnhuber’s 6°C warming a scandal, absurd
Near the end of the interview, Vahrenholt tells the Abendblatt he thinks the globe will warm about 1.5° by 2100, i.e. the low end of the IPCC’s 1.5 – 4.5°C projected range. He characterizes Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber’s 6°C rise – and the applause it always gets – as a “scandal” and being “absurd”.

"One weekend during the fiercely hot summer of 2018, when every single fan in Sweden had sold out, my boyfriend and I decided to get out of Stockholm and go camping. When we arrived at the campsite, we were asked not to smoke, and told firmly that no fires of any kind could be lit, owing to the forest fires that had been raging from the Arctic Circle to the Baltic Sea. Later that day, we received emergency notifications on our phones. Several more fires had broken out all over the country. I slept uneasily that night – and not only because I was on a yoga mat besieged by midges. It was my first experience of living with the climate crisis as a low-level but present danger.  This unease is now very familiar to most of us, and has been heightened by what we’re seeing in Australia. Since the fire season began there, in the middle of last year, 29 people have died, along with more than a billion animals, and an area comparable in size to the whole of England has been ablaze. It’s a vicious reminder that, for all the sophistication of the modern world, something as primitive as fire can still bring us to our knees. As shocking as the scale of the destruction has been, though, it’s easy to see it on our computer screens here on the other side of the world, in the middle of a British winter, and feel disconnected from it. We accept that the climate emergency is now truly upon us yet still feel that it’s mostly happening to other people, elsewhere. But wildfires are increasingly a problem for everyone, including in the UK. Last August, there were almost five times as many of them around the world as there had been the previous August. In the EU, the number of wildfires in the first half of 2019 was three times the annual average for the previous decade. And while they used to be a serious problem only in hotter, southern European countries such as Portugal and Spain, now northern Europe is in trouble too. The Swedish fires of 2018 were by far the most severe in the country’s history, burning an area almost twice as large as the worst previous wildfire, in 2014. In the UK, 2018 and 2019 were the worst two years on record for wildfires, particularly on moors in the north-west of England and parts of Scotland. One fire last year, at Marsden Moor in Yorkshire, destroyed almost three square miles of land. The damage is on a very different scale to the almost 30,000 square miles that have burned in Australia, of course, but this is still a development we can’t afford to ignore. Aside from all the more immediate effects – the threat to humans, livestock and wildlife – the recent increase in wildfires has been linked to severe air quality problems. People living up to 62 miles (100km) downwind of fires in the Pennines in 2018 were exposed to toxic fumes. And as there is no sign of cooler weather in the years ahead, it is reasonable to expect more fires in 2020. The EU has now established a fleet of firefighting planes, and the European Forest Institute has warned that unless we take steps to protect the countryside – for instance, by planting less-flammable species and creating barriers to the spread of flames – emergency services won’t be able to prevent the rapid spread and firestorms that have characterised the Australian crisis. This isn’t all because of the climate crisis – changes to land use and increased urbanisation over several decades are also factors. Weather patterns are noisy data, and it’s difficult to attribute any single wildfire to the climate crisis. The scientific consensus, however, is that it is increasing the intensity and frequency of fire-conducive weather across the world. Even those fires that are eventually linked to human error, like a still-lit disposable barbecue, are increasingly likely due to warming temperatures. Hotter summers mean more barbecues lit in the first place. The climate crisis is going to change the way we behave in every aspect of our lives. And with the probability of another summer of extreme weather coming, we will need to adapt to new dangers that won’t just be on the other side of the planet but, quite literally, in our own backyards. It’s not at all clear that we’re ready for what might be coming. There is still a cognitive jump yet to be made when those of us in Europe read about the fires in Australia, from mourning the destruction there to recognising that we face some version of the same threat. When we look at Australia, we’re not looking at the future that might await Europe. That future is already here. • Imogen West-Knights is a writer and freelance journalist"

Seas rose and fell by multiple meters (-5 m to +3 m) within 1250 years until as recently as 4000 to 2000 years ago.
A new paper (Loveson and Nigam, 2019) reveals sea levels were still rising at a rate of 2.2 meters per century between 8100 and 7200 years ago, reaching a highstand of 4 meters above today’s sea level 6050 years ago.
For the next several millennia sea levels rapidly rose and fell within a range 6 meters – between 4 meters above to -2 meters below present levels.
A drop in sea level at one point reached an amplitude of -5 meters in just 1250 years (4350 to 3100 years ago) followed by 3 meters of sea level rise within 1200 years (3100 to 1900 years ago).
As recently as about 300 years ago mean sea level on India’s eastern shore was still about 1 meter higher than today.

Evidence there were sea port towns along India’s west coast that are presently located much further inland suggest sea levels were 2-3 m higher prior to 2500 years ago.

At the time of the 43 AD Roman invasion of Britain, the ocean shoreline, or beach, was located 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) from today’s shore.

Image Source: BBC
A new paper (Makwana et al., 2019) indicates there were sea port settlements that are today located “far inland” compared to where they were about 2500 years ago.
The scientists suggest sea levels may have been at least 2 meters higher than today at that time.
A visual example of how 2-meters-higher sea levels could have “submerged” the coast of western India is provided.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate scientist Professor Werner Kirstein was interviewed by alternative media outlet NuoViso,  and since the video was released early this month on Youtube, it has been viewed over 130,000, times.

Politics commissioning reports for money
In the interview Professor Kirstein tells moderator Robert Stein that CO2 emissions have no effect on the climate and that “politicians commission climate scientists to produce expert reports for money.”
“Public is being deceived”
Prof. Kirstein talks about the “conscious deception” of the public and how all research projects and publications by “climate scientists” only have the goal of confirming “man-made climate change” and that different scientific views are not welcome.
According to Kirstein, the public is being deceived with the false information and that the aim of politics is to find a way to collect further taxes and to collect levies.
“We currently see this with the climate tax, which is to be introduced soon,” Kirstein says.
Movement back to feudalism
In the interview Kirstein also says that in Germany it gets down to ideologues pursuing an ideological transformation. He says: “I say this a bit exaggerated: We are to become a society of craftsmen and farmers like under feudal rule. Above are the feudals and below are the peasants who pay taxes. Industry is a detrimental thing that destroys the environment.”

Doomsday scenarios are “false”
The now retired professor calls the doomsday scenario in which the polar caps melt due to the CO2 greenhouse effect and floods and climate refugee flows occur worldwide, false.
“Even if all CO2 emissions in Germany were stopped, the effect would still be zero. We have no influence on climate change,” he says.
Mann’s hockey stick “a fake”, Gore “a profiteer”

Kirstein also sharply criticizes the IPCC and Prof. Michael E. Mann, telling Stein: “The purpose of the IPCC report is to deceive people,” and that Mann’s famous curve in the shape of a hockey stick chart and the graphics “are fake.”
Kirstein also blasted Al Gore, calling him a “profiteer” of the spreading global warming hysteria.
Warming has been natural, “All this is normal”
“In truth, it was very warm in the 12th century in the Middle Ages. And about 150 years ago a small ice age came to an end, both were suppressed in Michael Mann’s curve,” Kirstein said. He calls the rise in temperature after the Little Ice Age a natural “reheating”.
Kirstein also says the assumption that the glaciers have declined due to global warming is also wrong.
“Glaciers come and glaciers go. But that also varies from region to region,” the expert says. “That is why the ice would increase at the South Pole and some glaciers would melt at the North Pole. All this is normal.”

"Falling ocean oxygen levels due to rising temperatures and influence from human activities such as agrochemical use is an increasingly widespread problem. Considering that the sea floors have taken more than 1,000 years to recover from past eras of low oxygen, according to a recent University of California study, this is a serious problem. Ocean regions with low oxygen levels have a huge impact on aquatic organisms and can even destroy entire ecosystems. Areas of extremely low oxygen, known as oxygen minimum zones or “dead zones”, are estimated to constitute 10% and rising of the world’s ocean. This expansion has been attributed to a warming climate, which increases water temperature, changes ocean circulation, and decreases the solubility of oxygen in sea water. At the same time fertiliser and pesticide run-off from farming and other human activities leads to rising levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous reaching the sea.  Together, these two processes speed up the release of chemicals from ocean sediments and promote algal blooms. Subsequent algal death and decay result in increased consumption of oxygen in the water. The result is that other aquatic species such as invertebrates on the seafloor and fish suffocate for lack of oxygen. Due to circulation and runoff effects, dead zones are especially severe around large cities on the western continental coasts such as the coast of Peru, and within enclosed or semi-enclosed regions like the Baltic Sea or Gulf of Mexico. What effects will these changes have? We don’t yet know how great the effects of human-caused climate change will be, nor how much can be done to try and mitigate the effects on the environment. Even if oceanic oxygen levels rise again, will the world’s ocean ecosystems be able to recover?  The University of California study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, studies fossils of over 5,400 sea animals including seed shrimps, molluscs, and brittle stars in order to try and answer this question. By examining seafloor sediments the researchers assessed how global warming affected sealife during the transition from the last ice age to the more-recent interglacial period, between 17,000-3,000 years ago. What the study found was that within only 130 years the oceans underwent devastating changes that led to complete collapse of invertebrates on the seafloor. More worryingly, the fossil records show that ecosystem recovery took at least 1,000 years. So the current growth of dead zones could leave drastic and long-lasting changes to marine life biodiversity. Climate change caused by human activity has already caused significant environmental damage over a relatively short time – the vast increase in pollution, ocean acidification, overfishing and deforestation in just the last 50-100 years, for example. However long it takes us to reverse the effects of global warming, if indeed we can, it will likely take ocean ecosystems many orders of magnitude longer to recover. Though microscopic organisms residing in the ocean and on the seafloor might seem to have little relevance to us, even small changes in ocean ecosystems can have enormous effects on the entire ocean food chain, from the smallest bacteria to the largest fish. Any impact on the creatures higher up in the food chain will have a massive impact on the human communities that rely on them economically and as a food source. Studies have shown that populations of mid-water fish such as Pacific hake decreased by up to 60% during periods of low oxygen off the coast of Southern California.  Conversely, numbers of Humboldt squid, which are more tolerant of low-oxygen waters, have increased significantly in the same location. Even the fish that can survive in dead zones are not faring well: large numbers of female Atlantic Croaker have been found to be growing testes-like organs instead of ovaries, a sexual deformation which causes infertility. Any shifts in ecosystem biodiversity can lead to a vicious feedback loop: dead zone seafloors turn into biodiversity deserts, where little but methane- and hydrogen sulphide-producing bacteria survive. Paired with changes in nutrient cycling which result in the release of nitrogen gas, levels of greenhouse gases being released from the ocean to the atmosphere increase and contribute to further global warming. To prevent the possibility of a 1,000-year (or longer) recovery period from a dead zone seafloor, we need to be much more aware of how the various environmental aspects are connected. An understanding of how de-oxygenation has affected the ocean in the past and how our actions are affecting the ocean in the present is critical to either preventing a recurrence or at least minimising effects of what we have already done."
"One of the UK’s flagship sustainability policies is in big trouble. Less than a year from now, the theory goes, all new homes will be “zero-carbon”. The reality is rather different. Economic meltdown, a housing crisis, pressure from developers and poorly designed legislation have all combined to leave the country way behind schedule. The policy dates back to 2006, when the Labour administration introduced stringent sustainability legislation. All new homes, they said, would be “zero-carbon” by 2016. The provision of solar panels (and other renewable energy technologies) and better energy efficiency would balance out emissions from heating, lighting and use of appliances leaving net emissions at zero.  To achieve this, building regulations were to be progressively tightened in the run up to 2016 and a Zero Carbon Hub would be formed to knock together the heads of house builders, NGOs and bureaucrats.  At the time this target was hailed as world leading and on some level the policy has been a success. By December 2014 some 33,000 homes had been built to sustainable standards, according to one measure. However, we need to look at the bigger picture. Fast forward a decade or so and under the Conservative-led coalition government the agenda has spluttered from problem to problem. The reforms to building regulations have been delayed and are not achieving the kinds of levels envisaged. The latest were introduced a year late and only achieved a 33% improvement in energy performance, against a promised 44%. This leaves a big gap between where we are now and the next iteration, which is supposed to achieve “zero-carbon”. More worryingly, despite six years of negotiations it still isn’t clear how “zero-carbon” will be defined. What we do know is that zero-carbon is likely to be anything but.  The definition of emissions, for example, was weakened in the 2011 budget. It now includes emissions from heating and lighting but it wont include those from “unregulated energy” – that is, energy used by appliances within the home.  Emission reductions won’t even have to be achieved in the house itself. “Allowable solutions” have been introduced instead, a level of emissions above which developers can pay into a fund for low-carbon infrastructure to be built elsewhere as a way to “off-set” carbon.  Precisely at what level these allowable solutions will kick in is not clear, nor how the fund will work in reality. What is clear is that developments of fewer than ten houses (which comprise the vast majority of house-building) will be exempt from allowable solutions. Tellingly, the WWF left the Zero-Carbon Hub in protest against what it saw as a “watering down” of policy. With so many details still to be decided, it is unsurprising that there is little confidence that the 2016 target will be met. This is not necessarily the coalition’s fault however. In many ways it is the result of inherent contradictions within the policy. The underlying rhetoric has been that technology – solar panels, heat pumps, insulation and so on – will do all of the hard work and consumers need not worry themselves about how they engage with and run their homes.  But who pays for this technology? Government figures show that complying with the 2010 sustainable building regulations meant a 5% increase in real production costs compared to 2006. Complying with 2013 regulations would see that figure rise to 9%. Want to build to the strictest zero-carbon standards? That’s a 50% increase. Labour never adequately addressed the question of “who pays”, sowing the seeds for today’s problems.  More often than not it has been housing developers who have had to shoulder the costs because there has never been a significant enough “price premium” attached to sustainable homes.  These costs would come down as technologies and expertise became more widespread, but the 2008 credit crisis and the increased politicisation of housing affordability and supply changed things. These sustainability requirements had the potential to hinder the construction of new housing, so developers were vocal in their opposition. The coalition has been more sympathetic to developers than other parties may have been. Yet in many ways these policy reforms were inevitable. While it would be nice to say that the government should force increased costs on builders, the reality is very different as the government must consider whether environmental policy will jeopardise housing supply. In the midst of a financial crisis, the industry couldn’t afford the costs associated with the initial zero-carbon proposals. In many ways this watering down could have been avoided if the initial policy had more of a focus on giving home owners an incentive to be greener. The challenge for the next administration is finding a way to encourage developers to build the homes we desperately need while sharing sustainability demands between both buyers and builders. We need homes, but we owe it to future generations to make them green."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper finds the performance of test-taking (cognitive, decision-making) “astronaut-like” subjects exposed to 5000 ppm CO2 was “similar to or exceeded” the performance of those exposed to baseline (600 ppm). This study follows up on a 2018 paper that determined submariners exposed to 15000 ppm CO2 performed just as well as subjects exposed to 600 ppm.
Those of us who own CO2 monitors know that indoor (bedroom) CO2 concentrations typically vary between about 600 ppm during the day and 1000 ppm overnight – the latter earning a frowny face air quality rating.


CO2 is a cognitively-impairing toxin?
In recent years there has been a push to create the impression carbon dioxide is a pollutant, or toxin. Consequently, there have been a few studies suggesting exposure to higher CO2 concentrations (~1500 to 2500 ppm) severely impair human cognitive and decision-making performance (Satish et al., 2012, Allen et al., 2016).
If true, this would be rather problematic for elementary school children, as they are routinely exposed to CO2 concentrations ranging between about 1500 and 3000 ppm in their classrooms (Corsi et al., 2002).
Driving alone in one’s vehicle could mean exposure to “3700 ppm … above outdoor [CO2] concentrations” (Satish et al, 2012), or about 4100 ppm.
This elevated-CO2-is-toxic-to-brain-functioning paradigm suggests the world’s highways are teeming with cognitively-impaired drivers.
2 new studies show elevated CO2 has no effect on cognitive performance
The results from a 2018 study (Rodeheffer et al., 2018) measuring the cognitive and decision-making performances of submariners exposed to elevated CO2 undermined the attempts to portray CO2 as a brain-function-impairing toxin.

In the study, subjects were exposed to 3 CO2 conditions: 600, 2500, and 15000 ppm.
The results indicated there were “no significant differences” in how the subjects performed for any of the CO2 exposure levels.

A new study (Scully et al., 2019) assessing the capacity of elevated CO2 exposure to affect cognitive and decision-making performance appends the Rodeheffer et al. (2018) results.
This time, “astronaut-like” subjects were exposed to four CO2 gradients: 600, 1200, 2500, and 5000 ppm.
The results indicated there were “no clear dose-response patterns” evident for any of the exposure conditions.
In fact, the performance of subjects exposed to 5000 ppm slightly exceeded the performance of subjects exposed to 600 ppm CO2.
These results suggest the elevated-CO2-is-toxic-to-brain-functioning paradigm is not supported by real-world experiments.

"Greta Thunberg has challenged political leaders and the media to listen to the science as she warned time was running out to tackle global heating. Speaking on a panel of young environmentalists in Davos, Thunberg said the increase in global temperature could not be kept below 1.5C if the world continued to use up its limited carbon budget at its current rate. “With today’s emissions levels, the remaining budget is gone in less than eight years. These aren’t anyone’s views, this is the science,” Thunberg said, citing a 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. “I know you don’t want to report this or talk about this but I will keep repeating the numbers until you do.” The 2018 IPCC report said that the world had a limit of 420 gigatons of carbon to emit if there was to be a 67% chance of keeping the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees. Thunberg said that was now down to 340 gigatons. There was an assumption, she said, that “future generations will somehow suck hundreds of billions of tonnes of CO2 out of the atmosphere, even though such technology doesn’t exist yet”. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  The IPCC forecasts did not include feedback loops or possible tipping points that might make the need for action even more urgent, the Swedish activist said; rich countries needed to get their emissions down rapidly and then help poor countries to make the necessary changes. “Even with a 1C increase people are dying of climate change. Every fraction of a degree matters.” Thunberg was speaking hours before Donald Trump – a global heating sceptic – was due to make a keynote address to the World Economic Forum. She said people were more aware of the problem, thanks to the efforts of young people: “It feels like the climate and environment is a hot topic now. But from another perspective virtually nothing has been done. Without treating this as a real crisis we cannot solve it.” After a year in which her first appearance at Davos catapulted her to international fame, Thunberg said she could not complain about her voice being heard. “I’m being heard all the time. But the science and the voice of young people are not at the centre of the conversation and they need to be. This is about us and future generations.”"

===============================================
World may get another climate realist leader
By Kirye
As the working class struggles economically, signs of profound anti-establishment shifts are emerging in Japan, spurred on by a new political leader who is a climate and energy realist.
Rising Japanese political star Taro Yamamoto aims to shake up Japan’s crusty establishment down to the core. Image: Twitter here.
Growing poverty in Japan
In the House of Councillors election held on July 21, 2019, I voted for the recently founded Reiwa Shinsengumi party led by Taro Yamamoto . Why? According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), 57.7% of families, 81％ of single mothers and 1 of 7 children feel impoverished. These are shockingly dismal social and economic indicators for one the richest countries on the planet.
Part of this is due to an increased tax burden that have made people unhappy and poorer while the super rich profit from tax cuts. Moreover, Japanese finance minister Tarō Asō suggested that Japan could even learn from constitutional changes made by the Nazi party! Japanese president Shinzo Abe spends time on the golf course.
In contrast Taro Yamamoto, leader of the newly minted Reiwa Shinsengumi party, helps out at soup kitchens and fights for Japan’s many forgotten citizens.
Enough is enough – historic election result
Today there’s finally a growing feeling among the Japanese citizenry that the country is in need of toppling establishment structures and bringing in a new president and political party who work for justice, life and on behalf of the poor.
In the recent Upper House election, Mr. Yamamoto hauled in 992,267 votes, and so was the candidate with the highest number of votes in history in proportional representation. Now the Reiwa Shinsengumi has gone from a political group to political party, and is becoming more famous as many Japanese media are reporting on the phenomenon.
Energy and climate realist

When it comes to energy, party leader Yamamoto wants to use natural gas thermal power as a main energy supply, and to end the use of nuclear power (Japan is an earthquake country, so his ideas are valid).
On climate, I personally have never heard Mr. Yamamoto mention that CO2 is bad, despite so many Japanese people having been brainwashed by the media into believing we have to cut CO2 emissions. Many Japanese have never even heard of Climategate. Where does he stand on climate?

Yamaoto at JAJ press conference.
To find out, last Wednesday I took part in a press conference held by the Journalists Association of Japan and had the opportunity to tell Mr. Yamamoto the real story of how CO2 is not climate’s main driver (1:34:34 mark and 1:38:00). In summary I told him: Just this year alone, almost 200 new papers which do not support the anthropogenic global warming theory have been published so far. Last year the number of skeptic papers was 504. Moreover, NASA’s website shows only 166 stations have data that go back to 1880, and less than 1000 stations have the data from January, 1919.
I also told Mr. Yamamoto how distinguished Japanese climate scientist Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, who used to work for NASA, reminds us that only 5% of Earth’s surface has been adequately measured by thermometer over past 100 years and how the surface temperatures have been substantially affected by the urban heat island effect. Also how the real world’s temperature remains a far cry from the IPCC’s prediction.
He answered:  “In a sense it is wonderful if the fact spreads abroad and that it is controversial.”
He added:
Some people say that warming is not good, and are criticizing me because I aim breaking with nuclear power generation and I am pushing the generation of thermal power.”
This is a fresh perspective that has long been lacking in Japan, and so Mr. Yamamoto could act as a figure for changing public perception on the issues of climate and energy. Eventually the facts will win out because the sham cannot hide reality for long.
Growing roster of worldwide climate realist leaders – alarmists in panic
Already a number of worldwide leaders have expressed strong doubts on CO2 being the dangerous climate driver, for example US President Donald Trump, Russia President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia and the UK’s Boris Johnson. Others include Eastern European leaders, Italy’s Matteo Salvini and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. The momentum is real. So it’s little wonder global warming alarmists are becoming increasingly spooked and hysterical.
Some people believe that Mr. Yamamoto will be the next President of Japan, and I hope so. If it becomes reality, the world will be adding yet another climate realist to the growing roster of climate-realist leaders.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBefore people jump into a debate about weather with veteran Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann, they’d first better make sure that they really paid close attention at school and did their science homework.
In an debate at Twitter, the high-profile, seasoned meteorologist inadvertently exposed a shocking lack of comprehension of fundamental physics by some of Germany’s top climate officials, among them renewable energy expert Prof Volker Quaschning.
Hat-tip: Axel Bojanowski
High temperatures do not cause droughts
The Twitter exchange was unleashed by Kachelmann blasting the recent junk-science-driven media hype over another year of potential drought over Central Europe, and especially the false claim made by Prof. Quaschning that higher temperatures lead to more drought and forest fires. Kachelmann called this claim: false and “complete nonsense.” Kachelmann recently explained in a t-online article he penned:
Heat does not cause forest fires and is completely irrelevant. Forest fires are caused by the fact that it is dry longer, and then some fools – intentionally or not – throw something burning into the area, or park a very hot car over dry high grass and then drive away. The temperature on the day of the outbreak of forest fires does not matter.”
It’s the moisture, stupid
In other words, Kachelmann, dumps cold water on Quaschning’s claim that higher temperature is the factor behind drought and thus forest fires and Biblical-scale misery of the sort prophesized by Green fanatics. Kachelmann explains that temperature has nothing to do with the risk level of fire, and that the factor behind it is air moisture.
Shockingly, this fundamental physics law seemed to be unknown to “top scientists” such as Quaschning and others.
The FridaysFor Future activist and “renewable energy expert” Prof. Volker Quaschning kept insisting that temperature determined how dry soil would become, tweeting to Kachelmann: “Physics: More heat = more evaporation = drier ground = high forest fire risk = more forest fires. To shore this up he dragged Stefan Rahmstorf in to his side.

Confused about water vapor
Next, scientist Stefanie here tweeted a chart showing how much water a kg of air could hold versus temperature with the aim of showing Kachelmann he was wrong and that it was all about temperature:

Water vapor in grams per kilogram of air versus air temperature. Source here.
But this backfired on Stefanie when Kachelmann correctly demonstrated she did not understand the chart at all and that she had no idea what she was talking about.
That these climate experts would not know that water vapor in the air is the driving factor behind drought makes one wonder what faulty physics may have gotten applied to the climate models.
Throughout the entire thread there are attempts by the climate “experts” to assert their “academic authority”.
Other readers noted, for example, that despite extremely high temperatures in jungles, raging forest fires don’t break out in them. It’s not because of the temperature, but because of the moisture.
Climate alarmism becoming a sect
If any trend is emerging, it is that Kachelmann, a believer in man-made warming, is tiring of the fanaticism on both sides. He recently tweeted:
But unfortunately you can only stay in the sect if you join in the chattering of all the nonsense and depart from the grounds of science because of the purpose of saving the world allows all nonsense. Green and browns are outbidding each other in terms of lack of seriousness. It is getting very wretched.”

"New details of a nightmare period on Earth with surface conditions as frigid as present-day central Antarctica at the equator have been revealed thanks to the publication of a study of ancient glacier water. The research, by an international team led by Daniel Herwartz, is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and shows that even tropical regions were once covered in snow and ice. In the most recent ice age, the last glacial advance (ending about 12,000 years ago) ice sheets extended across Europe at the latitude of southernmost England and reached south of the Great Lakes in North America. Beyond lay tundra, woolly mammoths and so on – but the equatorial belt of tropical rainforest was still there. Much more drastic situations occurred far earlier in Earth’s history however, and it is these that are supported by the new study. The periods have been dubbed “Snowball Earth”. This term first rose to prominence in the 1990s on the back of decades of geological observations of rocks deposited by glaciers, on land and at sea, during much of the period lasting from about 720m to 630m years ago at locations from across the globe which – at the time – were on the equator or no more than 40 degrees from it.  This was not easy for geologists to establish, because organisms that would leave large, easily recognisable fossils (so useful for relative dating) had not yet evolved. Moreover, the distribution of continents was different and has to be deduced by measuring traces of the Earth’s magnetic field captured into the rocks when they formed (paleomagnetism). Over the period in question, a single super-continent known as Rodinia was beginning to break apart, but still straddled the equator. Why the climate should ever veer so extremely as to become caught in Snowball Earth conditions is a complex matter. On the one hand the Sun was 20-30% fainter than it is now, and thus provided less heat. However, the ancient atmosphere had much more carbon dioxide in it than now, so there would have been a more effective “greenhouse effect” to trap heat and keep the planet warm.  Changes in the Earth’s orbit, or in the tilt of its axis, might have tipped the balance – these are the likely cause of more recent glaciations – but it is possible that full Snowball Earth conditions can be initiated only when a super-continent lies across the equator. As land reflects more solar heat than the oceans, equatorial Rodinia maximised the amount of heat bounced back into space rather than absorbed into the seas and kept on Earth. Snowball Earth conditions gripped Rodinia at least twice, in an older episode known as the Surtian and in a younger episode known as the Marinoan. Herwartz and his team studied rock samples from the Dabie-Sulu belt in modern day eastern China. Back in Surtian and Marinoan times this region was between 15 and 35 degrees north, the same sort of latitude as present-day Mexico, India or the Sahara.  The team also studied rocks from a much older proposed Snowball Earth episode, about 2.2 billion years ago, sampled in Karelia, in present-day northwest Russia close to the border with Finland. These too were at a low latitude at the time in question. 
0 The researchers’ key innovation was to analyse oxygen left behind by ancient glacial water as it reacted with rocks to form new minerals. They used this to work out the prevailing surface temperatures. Oxygen comes in three stable forms, or “isotopes”. Nearly 99.8% of oxygen atoms are oxygen-16 (made of 8 protons and 8 neutrons). Most of the remainder is oxygen-18 (8 protons and 10 neutrons), but there are also traces of oxygen-17 (8 protons and 9 neutrons).  A water molecule containing a heavier isotope of oxygen has the same chemical properties as a water molecule containing the lighter oxygen-16 but will evaporate less readily and condense more quickly. This means that the oceans lose water molecules containing oxygen-16 at a faster rate, and rain (or snow) falling far from the ocean will be poorer than average in the heaver isotopes. The ratios of the different oxygen isotopes in the recent geological past can be used as a proxy for global temperature, or to estimate how much water from the oceans has been removed and stored in glaciers. It is far from simple to get at the information locked in ancient rocks of the kind studied by Herwartz’s team, but by including the extremely rare oxygen-17 isotope in their study, they were able to show that both of the heavier isotopes must have been rarer than expected in the glacial water that had reacted with the rock. The difference in the depletion of oxygen-17 compared to the depletion in oxygen-18 enabled them to demonstrate likely mean annual surface temperatures of as much as 40°C below zero. Such low temperatures imply that the oceans would have been deeply frozen too, supporting the full Snowball Earth model. But if the land where the rocks originated was so cold because it was several kilometres above sea level, the possibility that the planet was more of a Slushball Earth, with open seawater near the equator, cannot entirely be ruled out."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper appearing in the journal Urban Climate titled “Statistics on typhoon landfalls in Vietnam: Can recent increases in economic damage be attributed to storm trends?“, authored by Hiroshi Takagi, shows that tropical storm claims often made by climate alarmists are more fiction than fact. 

Tropical storm. Image: NASA
The paper concludes “it is reasonable to attribute the expansion of disaster-related economic damage to economic development and the fundamental volatility of typhoons.”
Hat-tip: reader Mary Brown
It also concludes:  “None of the meteorological trends such as frequency, central pressure, wind speed, or storm intensity show any significant increase or decrease over the last four decades.”
What follows is the paper’s abstract:


The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) indicates that the economic damage associated with storms has been rapidly growing in Vietnam. By contrast, the fatality rate due to storm-relevant disasters has been declining in recent decades. This study investigates whether typhoon trends have affected these outcomes. Best track data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) were examined to estimate central pressure and wind speed when typhoons made landfall. From 1977 to 2017, typhoons with wind speeds above 20 knots struck the country 105 times. A statistical analysis, which defined a storm’s intensity using principal component analysis (PCA), revealed that Typhoon Doksuri in 2017 was the strongest among the collection, followed by Cecil in 1985, Xangsane in 2006, and Damrey in 2017. The worst storm in history, Typhoon Linda in 1997, claimed over 3500 lives in southern Vietnam, but was only ranked 37th, demonstrating that typhoon intensity is not always the determining factor of fatalities.
Moreover, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) illustrates that none of the meteorological trends such as frequency, central pressure, wind speed, or storm intensity show any significant increase or decrease over the last four decades. However, landfall frequency has risen significantly, particularly in the northernmost part of the country where two large cities, Hanoi and Hai Phong, are located. A strong correlation was found between intensity and recent economic damage (r = 0.80) based on the proposed index of positive annual landfall storm intensity (PALSI). Given all of these factors, it is reasonable to attribute the expansion of disaster-related economic damage to economic development and the fundamental volatility of typhoons.”

"The speed with which the conservative side of politics and the media has gone from assuring us climate change was not a problem, so we don’t need to worry about reducing emissions, to asserting that climate change is a problem, but we still don’t need to worry about reducing emissions, is breathtaking. Literally, given the levels of smoke still around. You don’t get a cookie for saying you think climate change is real.  I’m sorry, you don’t. All you get is the capacity to say you have reached 1990 levels of comprehension – as that was when the first IPCC report was issued. You don’t get a prize for spending 30 years doing all you can to halt, undermine and dismantle action to reduce emissions, only to now say: “Hey, climate change is real.” Consider that the Sydney Morning Herald this week ran a front page story headlined “Minister slams climate debate”, with the lead that “Australia’s bushfire crisis has prompted a blunt warning from Science Minister Karen Andrews to those she says are wasting time arguing about whether climate change is real”. Oh good, that’s all sorted then. But when you read on, you see nothing in her statement suggest one iota of a shift in the government’s position on emissions. She told the Herald: “My starting position in the discussion tomorrow will be that the climate has changed and it continues to change. We need to focus on the steps to adapt and mitigate the impact of those changes.” The important point is she desires to mitigate the impact of the change, not to mitigate the actual change. Right now the government is indulging in the equivalent of responding to polio by promising to invest in more iron lungs. And bizarrely, it is getting credit for it. Adaptation is not mitigation. What is being said now is no different to what was said by Tony Abbott back when he was prime minister. In 2015, Abbott told parliament: “As far as the government is concerned, climate change is real. Mankind makes a contribution, and it is important to have strong and effective action to deal with it. “We have met and beaten our Kyoto targets ... We are on track to meet and beat our current commitments to reduce emissions by 2020 by 13 per cent on 2005 levels.” He then concluded: “I’m not going to put someone’s job at risk, a region’s, town’s future at risk, I’m not going to put up electricity prices to do it, I’m not going to put a tax on them to do it. I’m going to achieve it in the way we’ve met our Kyoto 2020 targets, meet and beat, and we’ve done that through better technology, through the policies we’ve put through the emissions reduction fund, and we’re going to continue to do that because it is really important.” Oh sorry, that wasn’t Abbott, that was Scott Morrison in his interview with David Speers last Sunday. If you can discern any difference in language between what Morrison is now saying and what Abbott said in 2015, then your level of reading between the lines has become so great you are seeing things that are not there. Just because we all desire the Coalition to do something on climate change doesn’t actually mean they will. And their actions over the past decade mean they have not earned the benefit of doubt, rather they have earned our total scepticism. The same goes for the conservative media. This week the NT News was getting praise for its front page, in which it stated: “What Australian needs now is real, affordable solutions – not armies of keyboard warriors.” But aside from the pretty random sideswipe at keyboard warriors, the statement is the perfect representation of meaningless dribble designed to sound like a bold stance. You know what is a real and affordable solution? Putting a price on carbon. And yet in the NT News editorial, the word emissions was not even mentioned, and I am prepared to bet my superannuation fund they would not suggest a price on carbon was an affordable solution. Similarly the Daily Telegraph’s editorial on Thursday on “Moving climate debate forward” praised the government’s policy and demanded the ALP come clean with how much theirs would cost. Give me strength. It seems that moving forward is reenacting the exact same coverage that occurred during the last election. You can’t say you agree with the science on climate change and then completely disregard the science that calls for the need to reduce emission by 45% from  2010 levels as soon as possible and to get to zero net emissions by at least 2050. Saying you agree with the science of climate change but that you believe the government’s current plan is adequate is like saying you agree with vaccination, but you chose to only get one of your three kids immunised because, heck, that is more affordable. The cheapest way to deal with the cost of climate change is to reduce our emissions and prevent, as much as is possible, further increases in global temperatures. Dealing with climate change will be tough – people will lose jobs, the prices of some things will rise, but the cost of inaction is going to be much greater and more damaging – both to our economy and to our society. Fortunately, the path to a vibrant emissions-free economy remains, and as Ross Garnaut has pointed out, such a shift will be extremely beneficial for our economy if we act now. Indeed perhaps the most frustrating thing about the past decade is that not only have we have wasted a chance to reduce emissions, we have forgone the opportunity to set up our economy for the next 100 years. Do not fall for the government’s spin. The need for action on climate change is the need to reduce emissions and to also take a leading role in that fight on the international stage. So when you hear someone in government say they believe in climate change, ask what they are doing about reducing emissions; everything else is spin."

Rising energy poverty with wind and solar energy penetration
Heating a home in the United Kingdom became 63% more expensive in the last decade, and electricity prices have risen by 80% in Germany since 2000. These developments can be traced to the increasing reliance on wind and solar energy in these developed countries (Lomborg, 2014).

Significantly due to California’s heavy emphasis on wind and solar energy penetration, Californians’ electricity prices rose 5 times more than the other states between 2011 and 2017 (EnvironmentalProgress.org).
Californians pay 60% more for electricity than the rest of the country.

Cold weather is 20 times more deadly than hot weather
A 2015 study analyzing 74 million deaths from 384 locations across the world (1985 and 2012) revealed that cold weather killed 20 times more people than hot weather did (7.29% of mortalities due cold vs. 0.42% of mortalities attributed to heat).
A new paper (Sera et al., 2019) analyzes atrributable mortality trends in urban areas – 340 cities in 22 countries – and found there was a similar (but less pronounced) discrepancy between attributable cold deaths and heat deaths (6.05% vs. 0.56%) during 1985-2014 for the world’s cities.

Cold weather death rates are increasing as heat deaths are declining
Two new papers (Díaz et al., 2019, Cheng et al., 2019) indicate that from Spain to Australia, heat-related mortality has been decreasing whereas cold-related deaths have risen in recent decades.
Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2018 found heat-related deaths declined in 7 out of 10 countries studied since 1985 and no trends in cold-weather deaths.
It is likely that the rise in both energy prices and energy poverty have heavily contributed to the higher incidence of cold-related mortality in recent decades.

The authors of a new study (Jiao et al., 2019) point out that temperature changes in the Tianshan mountains are “mainly influenced by the solar activity via the mean minimum temperature within approximately 11-year periods.”
Despite some warming since the 1950s, the authors do not maintain CO2 changes were an influencing climate factor in the 1680-2012 reconstruction.
The 1708-1801 period is shown to be about 1-2°C warmer than the the 1950-2012 period.

Jiao et al., 2019
“Regional climate change is affected by large-scale climate-forcing factors, such as solar activity and atmospheric–oceanic variability (Fang et al., 2010; Linderholm et al., 2015; Rydval et al., 2017). On the one hand, based on the MTM analysis results, the temperature changes in the study area are mainly influenced by the solar activity via the mean minimum temperature within approximately 11-year periods (Li et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015). The tree-ring chronology was developed by samples of Schrenk spruce collected from the National Nature Reserve of the Western Tianshan Mountains. The mean minimum temperature in the growing season is the main and stable limiting climate factor. Therefore, the mean minimum temperature series in the growing season during 1680–2012 was reconstructed based on the STD chronology.”
“In the past 333 years, the mean minimum temperature has roughly experienced three relatively cold periods and relatively warm stages (relatively cold periods: 1680–1707, 1802–1911 and 1935–1997; relatively warm periods: 1708–1801, 1912–1934 and 1998–2012). By analyzing similar trends in regional temperature changes in our reconstruction series with drought events, large volcanic eruptions and other reconstruction series around the study regions in Xinjiang and even large-scale regions, we found that the mean minimum temperature of the reconstruction was accurate and reliant. Moreover, the mean minimum temperature was influenced by solar activity (sunspots) and large-scale atmospheric–oceanic fluctuations (NAO, WPO, ENSO, TBO) based on the MTM and spatial correlation analysis.”

Al Gore is standing to rake in millions from a World Resources Institute meat consumption reduction report, one that will certainly help boost profits for the meat substitute manufacturers – in which Gore just happens to be a big stakeholder!

Al Gore has ties to meat consumption reduction report while holding huge stake in substitute meat company. Image: cropped here M4GW.
CNN recently reported here on the just published report from the global research nonprofit World Resources Institute. The 568-page report dubbed “Creating a Sustainable Food Future” recommends, among other actions, eating far less beef in order to rescue the planet.
Gore hack is WRI co-chair
But according to S___  at a thread at Twitter (see below), the WRI’s Co-Chair is David Blood. “David Blood is former Goldman Sachs’ Asset Management head who founded Generation Investment Management with Al Gore, yes that Al Gore,” S___writes under point no. 3.

1) So I was curious why there was this sudden push to cut meat, particularly beef consumption, it seemed to come out of nowhere, so I did a little research, a thread: https://t.co/8baJfISZ7c

So the report is now looking more and more like a junk-science-based instrument designed to boost the plant-based substitute meat industry, which include major companies such as Beyond Meat.
Kleiner Perkins: biggest Beyond Meat investor
Generation Investment Management is connected to Kleiner Perkins, where former Vice President Al Gore is one of its partners and advisors.
Who’s Kleiner Perkins? It turns out they are Beyond Meat’s biggest investor, according to bizjournals.com here. Beyond Meat is a Los Angeles-based producer of plant-based meat substitutes founded in 2009 by Ethan Brown. The company went public in May and just weeks later the more than quadrupled in there value.
Yes, Al Gore, partner and advisor to Kleiner Perkins, Beyond Meat’s big investor, stands to haul in millions, should governments move to restrict real meat consumption and force citizens to swallow the dubious substitutes and fakes.
If taken seriously, the World Research Institute Report, backed by Gore hacks, will help move the transition over to substitute meats far more quickly.
According to S___:
All these “We need to cut beef consumption to save the planet” stories originate from the World Resources Institute whose co-chair is a partner in the firm that collaborates w/ the main investor in @BeyondMeat and his co-founder is a partner in the main investor.”
Another dubious money making scheme that reeks of ethics violations and that needs to be investigated.

"The European shale gas boom has not materialised in the way that some were predicting. We are a far cry from the situation a few years ago, where interest in fracking in Europe was gathering pace on the back of the successes in North America.  The UK appeared to be leading the way, with drilling activities in north-west and south-east England. Companies started snapping up exploration licences right across the continent, and prospects from Scandinavia to the Urals found themselves being eagerly appraised. So what’s happened, and what do the prospects for Europe look like now? Of the countries in mainland western Europe, France has the most potential for unconventional hydrocarbons. The shales of the Paris Basin are thought to have major shale gas and minor shale oil potential, while the Jurassic shales in the south-east of the country may also have some shale gas potential. But a fracking moratorium has been in place since 2011, and was upheld in 2013. For the present, therefore, France ne frac pas. Germany, like France, has not permitted fracking since 2011. But unlike France, it does not have huge quantities of prospective shale. Most of the potential interest in fracking is for gas from low permeability sandstones and coal beds, and there have been moves recently to permit fracking at depths of more than 3,000 metres. The only other mainland western European country with significant shale gas potential is the Netherlands. There is considerable public opposition, however, particularly with conventional gas extraction having been linked to subsidence and induced seismicity in the Groningen area. No fracking for shale gas has been permitted so far. Shale gas in Europe by country With large areas of apparently prospective shale and a government supportive of fracking, Poland looked to be the frontrunner of the European shale gas boom. The reality has been rather more sobering, however.  Many boreholes have been drilled, few have produced the results that were hoped for, and most of the major companies have now withdrawn from the country. Polish shale gas may still prove to be viable in the long-term, but abundant shales and an enthusiastic political leadership do not guarantee fracking success. Ukraine was also seen as a major exploration target, with prospects for shale gas in both the west and east of the country. Exploration began in both areas, but subsequent political upheavals and the violent conflict in the Donetsk region have ensured that fracking has not taken off and has little likelihood of doing so in the near future. The prospective shales of western Ukraine continue into Romania and Bulgaria. Romania saw some exploration for shale gas by Chevron, but poor results and environmental protests saw the company pull out of the country in early 2015. Bulgaria, meanwhile, placed a moratorium on fracking in 2012. Hungary and the Lithuania-Kaliningrad region of the Baltic are also thought to have unconventional hydrocarbon potential, but little exploration activity has taken place. Shale oil in Europe by country The only Scandinavian country where shales have proven of interest is Denmark, where the US Geological Survey suggested that there were 2.5tn cubic feet (tcf) of onshore gas resources in the Alum Shale.  The government issued a moratorium on fracking in 2012, but Total was allowed to continue with exploration in Jutland and Zealand, with plans to carry out test drilling this spring. There have been reports that the government may consider lifting the moratorium if Total decides to go ahead with fracking on the back of good results.  The geology in southern Europe is tectonically complex. There are few shale basins, so the region has seen very limited interest in fracking. The Jurassic shales of the Basque-Cantabrian basin of northwest Spain are considered to have some potential for shale gas, and some exploration has begun there. It is clear there are very few European countries in which fracking is likely to happen any time soon, if at all. Many apparently prospective European shales have turned out to be more geologically complicated than expected.  This is related to the fact that although shale is a very common rock, it has not been a common subject of research – at least until recently. Much remains to be understood about how shales form, how they vary, and how they behave when fracked.  Environmental and political concerns have also come to the fore more than might have been anticipated, while the oil-price slump has made all efforts look much more expensive than they did a year ago.  For the companies concerned, this has changed the economics – particularly where the geology has proven complex. Europe’s shales were always going to be different to those of North America. To major companies, they now look a great deal less enticing.  Nonetheless, it is crucial that fracking research continues. A good understanding of shale geology is still in its infancy. If fracking is to take place anywhere in Europe, baseline environmental information from potential fracking sites needs to be collected, analysed, and made publicly available, along with long-term monitoring data.  Shale scientists must also develop meaningful dialogues with the public, explaining what we know and don’t know about the possible risks. The Research Fracking in Europe (ReFINE) project is involved in this work, looking at things like how far hydraulic fractures go, how large an earthquake fracking can cause, and the likelihood of leaks from shale-gas wells.  Meanwhile the EU announced several weeks ago that it was awarding €12m (£8.6m) to researchers looking at the environmental impact of fracking, and the risks of chemicals and gases being dispersed below the ground. Europe might never lead the world in fracking, but it can lead the world in fracking research."
"Prince William recently spoke at one of the largest illegal wildlife summits ever held in London. He said, “Poaching is an economic crime against ordinary people and their futures.” The quote could have been better. Poachers, after all, are merely the corner boys of the global illegal wildlife trade, the ones who benefit least financially and risk most, usually their lives. They’re ordinary people too, and vilifying them is not getting to the heart of the issue.  William had travelled to Tanzania, Kenya and Namibia in September and October this year, to learn about conservation, and a video of his trip to Tanzania was presented to the attendees. It did not go down well with various NGOs and campaigners who accused the video of promoting a “white saviour” image, given that only one African, a student, spoke to the camera, while the rest of the interviewees were international participants. Certainly, the team making the video could have better selected the participants and had a wider range of people speak. But that would be putting a sticking plaster over a very serious wound. There are fundamental issues at the heart of conservation, which as a movement was built on inequality and can also perpetuate that same inequality.  In the Guardian’s reporting of the Prince William incident, Dr Mordecai Ogada, director of Conservation Solutions Afrika, said: Conservation even now, nearly 55 years after Kenya got independence, is still the one arena where Prince William can waltz in to Kenya and tell us he wants us to do this, that or the other … He couldn’t do that in education, banking or other fields, but conservation still has that romantic, Out of Africa feel about it. This is the bigger issue we should be having a conversation about. Why, decades after the independence of many countries in the Global South, does conservation still have this (neo-)colonial undertone? In conservation, history is always present. Across the Global South, researchers like me often work in post-colonial landscapes, areas marked by evictions, forced settlement of herders, the fencing of large swathes of land for private use, or other access restrictions. This, understandably, can foster resentment, disenfranchisement and anger in people living in those regions.  I’ve looked at elephants in South Africa’s Kruger National Park, for instance, where the very name “Kruger” is divisive given he was an Afrikaner leader with a dubious relationship to conservation. There, the government has settled land claims of people who were dispossessed from the park land – for example, in 2016, six communities received 84m rand (£4.5m). Rates of visiting the park are still recovering from the fact that generations of South Africans who were classified as “non-white” were denied access to large sections of national parks under apartheid. I recently attended a session on human and wildlife “conflict” and coexistence in southern India. I realised this wasn’t a simple north-south issue. A lot of my Indian colleagues had also been trained under our current ideas about anthropogenic activities threatening biodiversity. This concept can risk bleeding into a perception of humans themselves being the threat. For example, an article in Nature on future threats to biodiversity and paths to prevent them takes on the distinctly misanthropic and negative “humans are killing the planet and all its inhabitants” when reported in the New York Post. At the same meeting, I heard sentiments way too close for comfort to the “noble savage” trope about communities, in this case local ethnic minorities, who live alongside wildlife. I was disappointed that we seemed to reduce people to bad guys, victims, or romanticise them even though conservation paradigms have supposedly shifted to centring, or at least considering people. As we talked about low-paid immigrant workers on tea plantations, I noticed there weren’t any representatives present. This risks them being “othered” and the psychological distance creating a space for us to accept them facing risks, like being killed by an elephant as they walked to work. I talked to a journalist colleague in Johannesburg and she shared a similar sentiment, the world wants wildlife stories about a collectively imagined “wild Africa”, not human stories. Because the human stories are complex, less palatable, and potentially threatening to biodiversity. And it’s a shame because Johannesburg is such a vibrant hub of entrepreneurship and creativity. We should be leaping onto that for conservation and collaborating, not seeing it as the opposition. I am not naïve enough to think that the global distributions of funding and biodiversity map onto each other. In fact, it’s no coincidence that richer countries have lost most of their large mammals in favour of agricultural, industrial and urban development. But how can we manage the funding and conservation efforts without perpetuating the “white saviour” issue?  The answer to me is clear. Conservation can’t be the preserve of people who can afford international travel and to take unpaid internships. We can make choices about communication, participation, training, educating, hiring, salaries, promotion and project leadership (let’s not trap people in assistant positions) and focus on diversity in those. The opening to every conservation text book reads like the fall from the garden of Eden and we have to turn that around; people (and not just white people) are the opportunity. Skills in spatial analysis, human behaviour, modelling data are vital to a vibrant and technology-driven approach to conservation and these are marketable skills. We need to capture this exceptional human talent, make sure a wide range of people have access to funding and ensure people feel heard in conservation so they choose to make it their career. There are already some incredible leaders and people sharing platforms, and hopefully Prince William will do that in his next speech."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German automobile industry today continues to be the real engine driving the country’s economy, but that may dramatically change for the worse – soon – according to economists Matthias Weik and Marc Friedrich in a commentary at the online news portal of the Deutsche Mittelstands Nachrichten (German Midsize Companies News – DMN).
The two authors focus on the economic direction of the German economy and how it is seriously threatened by the country’s obsession with climate protection and how policymakers are neglecting its key industry: automobiles.
Weik and Friedrich say that German policymakers are naive, and are in the process of ruining the German economy in their panic to rescue the planet from an alleged climate meltdown.
“Everybody is talking about the climate, yet no one is talking about the economic climate,” Weik and Friedrich say.
“Hard as nails” recession threatens Germany


The two economists warn of a coming recession, one that will be “hard as nails” as the ecological activist onslaught on German industry picks up.
According to the Weik and Friedrich, already “the seasonally adjusted and real order intake of German industry fell by 8.6 percent compared to the same month last year! For the tenth month in a row it is going down!”
“Companies such as Deutsche Bank, BASF, Bayer, Siemens, Thyssen, Ford have begun “massive job cuts or announced plans to do so”.

The two authors say that new buzzwords, such as “unemployment” and “layoffs”, will soon be dominating the media and that “no one will talk about the shortage of skilled workers any more, let alone climate change”.
Climate activist policymakers “negligently gamble away” prosperity 
They write that the outlook for Germany’s key industry, automobiles, “is pitch-black” as the assault against the internal combustion engine continues unrelentingly.
The authors write: “If we actually continue to destroy our car industry – which accounts for 21 percent of our GDP – then everyone must be aware of the consequences.”
These consequences would mean economic shock waves not only for Germany, but also for Europe which massively relies on revenues generated by the German automotive industry, the authors explain.


Weik and Friedrich write that Germany’s policies “negligently gamble away” prosperity and that the “coming climate change in the economy will nip all irrelevant sham debates in the bud.”
“People in the streets”…”different demonstrations on Fridays”
They add: “The heated discussions and hysteria are a sign of the famous late Roman decadence and a warning sign of the crash. For many who demonstrate today, there will be no jobs in Germany tomorrow.”
Weik and Friedrich warn that as the “economic climate changes drastically and more and more people are standing in the streets without work […] we will see completely different demonstrations on Fridays. But then it will be too late.”

In the modern climate, North Slope, Alaska (north of the Arctic circle) has a mossy tundra terrain and an absence of trees.
About 8,000 to 9,000 years ago, with CO2 levels lingering around 260 ppm, this region was imbued with both trees and animal species that today live many 100s of km south (Kuzmina et al., 2019).
Even during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 17,000 to 20,000 years ago, when CO2 levels hovered near 190 ppm, “summer temperatures were higher here than they are today” (Kuzmina et al., 2019).

Image Source: Kuzmina et al., 2019
During the LGM, horses were the most common large animal living in this region of the Arctic, followed by bison. Horses had a “substantial dietary volume” of dried grasses year-round, even in winter (Guthrie and Stoker, 1990).
Even though CO2 concentrations have reached 410 ppm today, 220 ppm higher than during the LGM, Northern Alaska is too snow-covered and frigid for horses to occupy this region now.
As Guthrie and Stoker, 1990 conclude, the Arctic is presently “no place for horses” because there is too little for them to eat, and the food there is to eat is “deeply buried by snow”.

"Time is divided by geologists according to marked shifts in the Earth’s state. Human activity has clearly altered the land surface, oceans and atmosphere, and re-ordered life on Earth. This suggests that the planet has entered a new human-dominated geological epoch, called the Anthropocene.  However there has been significant scientific debate concerning exactly when this epoch began. We argue, in a new paper in Nature, that the Anthropocene began with the irreversible exchange of species between the New and Old Worlds following the 1492 arrival of Europeans in the Americas. The resulting global networks of trade led to a rapid, repeated, cross-ocean exchange of species, which is without precedent in Earth’s history. It provides an unambiguous event after which the impacts of human activity became global and set Earth on a new trajectory. Defining the beginning of the Anthropocene as a formal geologic unit of time requires two requirements to be met. First, that there is evidence of long-term changes to the Earth as a global system. Second, that there is a marker of a global event that can be dated in layers of rock, sediment from the ocean floor, or ancient glacier ice. This marker is called a Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), also known as a “golden spike”. GSSPs have been used to define geological time for the past 600m years.  In our research we found that most previously proposed Anthropocene start dates, including the earliest detectable human impacts through farming and historic events such as the start of the industrial revolution, should be rejected. They are not based on a globally synchronous markers and may not be permanent changes that could still be seen in a few million years – the time span of a typical epoch. We found only two GSSP dates that fit. There was the 1610 Orbis (Latin for “world”) spike, when the impacts of the collision of the New and Old Worlds a century earlier were first felt globally. The species exchange between the Old and New Worlds is noted in the fossil record at this time, coupled with a marked drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide, centred on 1610. Then there was the 1964 Bomb Spike, the peak in radionuclide fallout from nuclear weapons testing, which is coincident with the acceleration of very recent global environmental changes.  While both GSSP dates appear to adhere to the criteria for the beginning of the Anthropocene, we suggest that overall, 1610 is the strongest contender. A drop in CO2, centred on 1610, was a result of European arrival in the Americas. This arrival led to the deaths of around 50m indigenous people, most within a few decades of the 16th century and mostly due to smallpox. The resulting near-cessation of farming across a continent and re-growth of Latin American forests and other vegetation removed enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to produce a pronounced dip in CO2 seen in Antarctic ice core records.   The decline in carbon dioxide fits the formal requirement of a dated global environmental change that is captured and preserved in natural material. The irreversible exchange of species fits the other requirement of evidence of long-lasting changes to the Earth. For example, fossil pollen of maize, a Latin American species, first appears in marine sediment in Europe in 1600, becoming common over subsequent centuries. In geological terms the 1610 drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide is also associated with the coolest period of the Little Ice Age – a period between about 1300 and 1870 when North America and Europe experienced colder winters – when many changes occurred in geological deposits worldwide. The boundary therefore also marks Earth’s last globally synchronous cool moment before the onset of the long-term global warmth of the Anthropocene. The second possible starting point which we and other research groups have identified is the 1964 peak in radionuclide fallout.  The advantage of this GSSP is that it is recorded in many geological deposits worldwide and it coincides with the huge acceleration of human impacts starting in the 1950s that continues to the present. Yet, from a geological perspective, there is one key disadvantage of this date: while nuclear weapons could dramatically alter the planet’s environment, so far they haven’t. The radioactive fallout from bomb tests is a very good marker, but is not itself an Earth-changing event leading to long-lasting changes. The start of the industrial revolution has commonly been suggested as the beginning of the Anthropocene. It is a clear turning point in human history and the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuel use is a critically important long-term global environmental change.  However, there is a lack of a suitable golden spike at this time because most impacts were local – while smog soon covered towns in the north of England, most of the rest of the world continued largely untouched. Meanwhile the global exponential rise in carbon dioxide is too smooth an increase to form a marker.   We could instead date the Anthropocene from a hand-picked year, not tied to a specific event in the fossil or atmospheric record, but tied instead to broad change in the Earth as a system – this is how geologists date eras beyond 600m years ago where well-preserved rock sections and specific events are hard to find. However picking the year 1760 or 1800, or when ever, is fraught with difficulty as any date chosen would be open to challenge as being arbitrary. Nonetheless, the collision of the Old and New Worlds is linked to the industrial revolution. Europe’s annexing of the Americas provided major new imports of agricultural commodities, thereby freeing Western European labour from the land – this, alongside coal, was one of two essential precursors to the industrial revolution. So dating the Anthropocene to 1610, some 150 years prior to the beginning of the industrial revolution, is consistent with the material causes of that turning point in human history. Formally ratifying the Anthropocene as an epoch requires the agreement of a series of geological committees. If it is adopted, we consider it a defining moment for humans, a time that has fundamentally changed our relationship with our environment.   Embracing the Anthropocene essentially reverses 500 years of scientific discoveries that have moved humans to a position of increasing insignificance, from the 16th-century Copernican revolution and the modern understanding that our sun is one of 1024 stars in the universe, to the 19th-century Darwinian revolution that established humans as merely a twig on the tree of life with no special origin.  A 21st-century adoption of the Anthropocene reverses this insignificance: humans are not passive observers of Earth but central to it, where the future of the only place where life is known to exist is being determined by our actions. A more widespread recognition that human actions are driving far reaching changes to the life-supporting infrastructure of Earth will have implications for our philosophical, social, economic and political views of our environment. But we should not despair. The power that humans wield is unlike any other force of nature, it is reflexive and therefore can be used, withdrawn or modified. The first stage of course is recognising it."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHigher frequencies of drought and extreme rainfall are assumed to be associated with modern climate change. But long-term studies in both hemispheres indicate extreme precipitation patterns were more common prior to the 20th and 21st centuries. Natural variability dominates precipitation patterns so thoroughly that an anthropogenic signal cannot be detected in observed records.
Internal climate variability (ICV) masks detection of an anthropogenic influence in extreme rainfall patterns (Bhatia and Ganguly, 2019).

Contrary to modeled expectations, there has been no “coherent picture” of an increase in extreme precipitation on a global scale in recent decades (Tabari and Willems, 2018).

"It’s all very well choosing not to eat genetically modified (GM) food, or even banning it entirely, but what if you then rear your cows on GM soya? Can you really maintain a consistent moral objection?  This is the dilemma many European countries are faced with now the EU has proposed measures that will further de-harmonise rules on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The latest proposal would allow member states to “opt-out” from the use of GM food and animal feed, thereby mirroring legislation passed earlier this year that allowed members to opt-out from GM cultivation.  The official aim is to allow member states to impose restrictions on GM food and feed “in respect of democratic choice and in the interest of consistency”. But countries expecting to pick and choose from different GMOs, whether crops, food or feed, will find their freedom heavily constrained. Any GM restrictions must still comply with EU law. This firstly requires that any measures be necessary to protect a “relevant legitimate objective”. Worries over the environment or public health don’t count – in theory these are dealt with under the initial authorisation process. This leaves objectives such as public morality, consumer protection or agricultural policy (preventing contamination between GM and non-GM crops, or having to change farms to use for GM crops). Even then, there must still be no arbitrary discrimination or disguised protectionism.  Consider the example of Ireland and Italy: two green, agricultural nations who may shortly be faced with serious headaches. Both have mixed feelings regarding GMOs and both have interests in prohibiting certain products, but crucially not all.  In particular, a substantial proportion of animal feed used in both Italy and Ireland is of GM origin. A 2010 report indicated that more than 90% of protein feed for livestock in Ireland contained EU-authorised GM varieties – mostly soya, maize, cotton and rapeseed. As imported feed is vital to keep Ireland’s cows and sheep well fed, and since it’s tough to guarantee zero contamination by GM sources, the country supported an amendment to EU legislation allowing for temporary tolerances of unauthorised GM feed at a level of 0.1%. Even if they would avoid GM feed in neutral circumstances, the market has created a high level of dependency by national producers on GM feed. This adds to a dilemma surrounding specific products produced nationally with GM counterparts produced outside the EU.  Rapeseed is an important crop in Ireland, for instance, just as it is in the UK. Although GM rapeseed is not currently authorised for cultivation in the EU, GM rapeseed food and animal feed grown elsewhere, mostly in Canada, is authorised.  Italy is Europe’s main producer of soybeans. As with rapeseed, you can’t grow GM soya in the EU, but GM soya products are authorised if imported, with the main suppliers based in America, Brazil and Argentina. Therefore European producers (all non-GM) are in competition with those beyond the EU, both GM and non-GM.  While Ireland and Italy depend on imported GM rapeseed and soya feed too much to impose restrictions, the two nations might be tempted to give their national producers a helping hand by attempting to prohibit GM rapeseed and soya food products. Yet if either were to prohibit these GM foods and not others, irrespective of any legitimate objective claimed, it would indicate “arbitrary discrimination” – whether direct or indirect. What of a general ban on GM food, based on consumer protection or public morality? Consumer protection won’t work. Shoppers could be sufficiently protected by labelling, which is already required (even if not considered full and accurate information).  Public morality might justify such restrictions, but if purely on GM food this would appear hypocritical. If public morality justifies a national ban on GM food, why is no such ban required for GM feed and GM crops also? Especially when the GM feed or crops lead eventually to food.  That just leaves environmental and health protection that could justify restricting one GM food and not another, or GM food generally and not feed or crops. However both are expressly excluded under the EU’s proposed legislation. Consequently, Ireland and Italy may be able to impose unilateral restrictions on GM crops, food or feed for a range of legitimate objectives. They could indeed be truly “GM-free”. However, if you claim public morality justifies prohibiting GM crops or food, you cannot then backflip and still permit GM feed.  Restrictions on cultivation might be permitted without restrictions on other GM products, but this is due to it also promoting separate objectives such as protection of traditional farming or producer choice. For the measures to be acceptable, they must be consistent."

The papers find that “summer temperatures during the HTM in North Greenland were 2° to 4°C warmer in this part of the Arctic.

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations back then of course were much lower than the historically very modest 410 ppm we have today.

"Scott Morrison has issued an extraordinary rebuke of the New South Wales environment minister, Matt Kean, for suggesting federal Liberals are pushing the government to increase its ambition on emissions reduction. Asked about Kean’s call for the federal government to abandon its use of Kyoto carryover credits to meet its 2030 emissions target, Morrison told ABC’s AM that “Matt Kean doesn’t know what he’s talking about, he doesn’t know what’s going on in the federal cabinet [and] most of the federal cabinet wouldn’t even know who Matt Kean was”.  “We are dealing with our climate policies in the same way as we took them to the election … we will meet and beat our emission reduction targets,” Morrison said. At a press conference in Canberra, Morrison told reporters he did not regret the remarks. Morrison said although the government will review the possibility of reaching zero emissions by 2050, in line with its Pacific Island Forum commitment, it would not adopt the target if it “didn’t know the cost”. The treasurer Josh Frydenberg backed Morrison’s position, by saying Kean was “wrong” to say cabinet ministers want the government to do more on climate change. After an unprecedented summer season of bushfires which Kean and even Morrison himself have conceded is caused in part by climate change, the federal government is under pressure to do more to fight global heating. At the 2019 election a record number of voters nominated climate change or the environment as their top concern. Morrison has suggested the Coalition could go “even further” than the target of 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030, which was met with a chorus of approval from moderate Liberals but sparked warnings of negative consequences for Morrison by conservative Liberals and Nationals MPs. On Monday, Morrison denied that federal Liberals were pushing to increase emissions reduction ambition, telling broadcaster Sabra Lane that “what is being suggested by your question is that there are others [who want a stronger policy] – that just isn’t the case”. “The government is completely united on focusing on the challenge of the response to the current bushfire crisis and meeting and beating our emissions reduction targets and taking our climate policies forward over the next term of government.” Morrison said the government was still aiming for a 26% emission reduction, and noted that while the government had a target, “I can’t say that for everyone else” – a reference to the fact Labor will announce its target closer to the next election. Morrison ruled out a carbon tax, increasing electricity prices and “[wiping] out resource industries”. Morrison told 3AW Radio he had “no idea” if Labor will aim for zero carbon emissions by 2050 but acknowledged that “we undertook to look at that through the Pacific Islands Forum commitment I gave last year”. “But we need to understand what that means – I mean, people can say that, but what does that mean for jobs? Now I can’t answer that question right now … But I’m concerned it wouldn’t be a good thing. “People who make these commitments need to be able to tell people what it will cost them.” The Pacific Island Forum’s communique committed Australia and other Pacific countries to produce a 2050 strategy by 2020 which “may include commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050”. The federal Liberal MPs pushing for change include Katie Allen, who has said the government is “starting to move in the right direction but we have a lot more to do”, and Dave Sharma and Tim Wilson, who both welcomed Morrison’s comments last week on the need to “evolve” policy. On Sunday Anthony Albanese promised that Labor would “take climate change seriously” and have a “very strong” policy that aimed to be “as ambitious as possible” but did not commit to outbid the Coalition because he hoped the Morrison government would take action before the next election. Albanese confirmed that a 45% reduction target by 2030 is no longer Labor policy and described it as a “mistake” that Labor automatically maintained that target from the 2016 to 2019 election without further shadow cabinet reconsideration."
