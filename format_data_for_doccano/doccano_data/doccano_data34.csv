Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman website wobleibtdieglobaleerderwärmung (where’s the global warming – WBDGE) does an excellent job at analyzing and observing climate data and trends. German readers are recommended to bookmark this site.
In its latest post the site looks at the July results and the overall global temperature and sea ice trend. It finds that multiple datasets clearly show that our blue planet remains firmly stuck on its years-long temperature plateau.
The WBDGE summarizes:
UAH/TLT saw an anomaly of +0.18°C (previous month 0.33, previous year 0.24) ranking this July as only the 9th warmest of 37. See UAH V6.0 Global Temperature Update for July 2015: +0.18°C
RSS/TLT (preliminary): saw an anomaly of 0.20°C, (previous month 0.39) and is thus in very close agreement with UAH results. This would rank it as the 10th warmest of the 37 years of data so far.

The NOAA/NCEP/CFSv2 surface temperature at 2 meters, comes in at only 0.16°C (global 2m – http://models.weatherbell.com/temperature.php). This ranks it at a relatively uneventful 10 of 37 years. Image MouseOver Tool.
In summary here we see three heavyweight datasets showing and all agreeing on a protracted stalled warming.

Growing sea ice volume
Moreover the WBDGE site writes that Arctic sea ice has grown “strongly” over last year and that there has been no melting trend there in almost 10 years.
The WBDGE adds that there is about 2000 cubic KILOMETERS more sea ice than 3 years ago: https://sites.google.com/piomas.
How can anyone say global warming is happening and is real when temperatures have long stalled and sea ice is growing?
The WBGE site comments:
Also July of 2015, and thus the 19th year without any signfiant linear global warming,  – the question remains: where’s the global warming?
Despite these real facts there are still people who publicly deny the global warming pause that has been happening since 1996 […] or who want to calculate it away with obvious data falsifications.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis too will be a sticky post for at least a day or more. Germany’s leading renewable energy expert and climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt warns of an irrational and panicked rush into renewable energies.
In a penned opinion piece in Germany’s Manager Magazin titled: “Why a Phase Out of Coal Would Be Damaging“, the German professor believes the movement to divest from fossil fuels is seriously misguided and that the move to a completely carbon-free global society would lead to “destruction on an astronomical scale“. He writes:
In order to produce the same amount of power with wind, we would see a surface area consumption and corresponding destruction of natural habitat on an astronomical scale.”
Fritz Vahrenholt was formerly responsible for the renewable energies arm of European power giant RWE, RWE Innogy GmbH. No one has overseen the installation of as much renewable energy in Europe as Vahrenholt has. In the field of wind energy he is a leading expert. He has since become a leading critic of renewable energy and climate science.
Vahrenholt, a professor of chemistry and former Environment Senator for the City of Hamburg in the SPD socialist party, asks:
How realistic is it really to produce not only electricity but also heat and fuels for transportation worldwide from China to Brazil over the coming decades without fossil fuels? As before in China a coal power plant goes online every 14 days, and India is well on the way to do the same as its neighbor.”
“Cost avalanche of 1000 billion euros”
Vahrenholt sharply criticizes Germany’s transistion away from coal and nuclear power and over to renewables because of the enormous cost burdens that citzens will have to bear in the years ahead. He writes that German Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel knows that “if the brakes on renewable are not applied, a cost avalanche of 1000 billion euros is headed our way“.
Uncontrollable supply
And as exorbitant quantities of wind and solar power are added to the power grid, Vahrenholt warns that during windy and sunny periods, large quantities of power will have to be “disposed of” on foreign markets.
We will have to dispose of the power in foreign countries more often than we do today and even pay money to Austria, Holland, Poland and the Czech Republic to take the power.”
Excess power of course would be ruinous to foreign markets. Vahrenholt reminds that sun and wind energy are fraught with technical problems because they work a minimal part time. Storage technology remains nowhere in sight.
Will have near zero impact
And even if Germany were able to solve the unsolvable technical problems, the CO2 emissions savings that Germany would achieve through a shut-down of its coal power plants would be offset by growth in China in a matter of just 2 months. The result would be no “climate protection” at all and Germans would only be able to boast over a flickering mess of a power supply.

In Vahrenholt’s view, the German green energy model is so costly that “no country in the world is going to follow it“.
Exaggerated science, flawed models
He also calls the climate science “wildly exaggerated” and maintains the climate models have been false:
There are more and more scientific findings showing that the climate effect by CO2 has been wildly exaggerated by the IPCC. There has not been any significant warming in 16 years even though one third of the historical CO2 emissions occurred in the same time period and the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is rising year after year.”
Vahrenholt describes the climate models as a joke as they do not even take the long-known ocean and solar cycles into account.
Leaping before looking
He tells us that Germany is rushing unnecessarily into renewable energies and that the natural cycles mean we have lots of time and that we should take that time and do the transition in a sensible manner. He asks:
Why the frenzied go-it-alone approach that is putting so much at risk? No nation on the planet is going to follow us when they see their own industrial base being destroyed and citizens financially overwhelmed.”
Vahrenholt adds:
In addition to the destruction of capital, there is also a grand destruction of many thousands of jobs.”
But none of this seems to impress Germany’s green government authorities, who continue to overzealously pursue shutting down fossil fuels and pushing for large-scale installation of an piece-meal energy infrastructure that has been proven to be technically flawed.
Consequences “close to insurmountable”
The German energy folly is already taking its toll, Vahrenholt writes. He claims that the “insidious process of deindustrialization has already begun” in Germany because of skyrocketing energy prices and growing uncertainty.
Consequently Vahrenholt is calling for a “fundamental reform” of the country’s energy policy and a return to a more market-oriented approach. He calls Germany’s famous EEG renewable energy feed-in act an obsolete model that is “bringing no reduction in CO2 emissions” and one that is “eroding Germany as a place for industry” and whose “consequences will be close to insurmountable“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhy hasn’t the Arctic  still not disappeared despite all the announcements that it would?
By Dr. Dietrich E. Koelle
[Translated, edited by P Gosselin]
Announcements that the Arctic sea ice would soon disappear have been among the most favorite of claims made by publicity-seeking climatologists and leading American politicians. According to the following, there isn’t supposed to be any Arctic sea ice left today:
10 Failed Forecasts
(1) M. Murphy, New Scientist, 1960: “The Arctic ocean will be ice free the entire year before the end of the 20th century” (i.e. by the year 2000),
(2) “Arctic specialist Bernt Balchen 1972: “The warming trend can produce an ice-free Arctic Ocean by the year 2000.”
(3) Jay Zwally (NASA) said in December 2007 : “The Arctic Ocean could almost be ice-free in the summer of 2012” (National Geographic)
(4) Louis Fortier (Arctic Net, Canada) 2007: “The Arctic could be ice-free in the summer by 2010 or 2015”.
(5) David Barber (Univ. of Manitoba), 2008: “The North Pole could be ice-free this summer for the first time”: June 2008 (2) (3)
(6) Prof. W. Maslowski (US Naval Postgraduate School), 2008: “In summer 2013 we will have an ice-free Arctic”.
(7) Mark Serreze, NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Centre, Colorado, USA) in 2008: “The Arctic could be ice-free in 2012”.
(8) Al Gore, former US Vice President at the Copenhagen climate conference 2009: “Arctic will be ice-free in five years” = 2014.
(9) US-Senator John Kerry 2009: “The Arctic will be ice-free in 2013”.
(10) Prof. P. Wadhams (Cambridge University), 2007: said in 2007 that the Arctic ice was in a “death spiral”, and in 2011: “the ice could be completely gone in four years”, i.e. 2015.
So what happened?
The Arcic ice has not disappeared, rather after shrinking from 1980 to 2012 it has risen over the past years (Figure 1). 2015 saw a Northwest Passage that was no longer possible to cross – too much ice.

While we shouldn’t be surprised that politicians like Al Gore or John Kerry would say such things and latch on to claims about the end of the Arctic, it is completely baffling that experts such as Mark Serreze (NSIDC) or Prof. P. Wadhams would reach such estimations.
What do all these false forecasts have in common?
They fully ignore statements that point out polar ice mass and extent are cyclical in nature. This means that it is not possible to simply extrapolate outwards from a short-term trend. There are foremost phases of expansion and retreat. The main causes for this are temperature fluctuations and changes in oceanic and atmospheric currents. Only one thing is certain: The supposedly responsible-for-everything CO2 rise here plays no role.  The proof is delivered by the development of Antarctic sea ice, which, at the same atmospheric CO2 level as at the North Pole, has risen steadily over the past 35 years and reached a record in 2014 (Figure 2). Strangely this rarely gets brought up by the media. It just doesn’t fit with the hysteria template.
Fundamentally many conventional climate scientists have a problem with natural climate factors and climate cycles. For them climate first began in 1880 along with the systematic measurement of temperature. Before that there is only proxy data, which however are imprecise and thus are best ignored. That’s why there’s a widespread lack of understanding when it comes to the natural climate factors that were at play long before man appeared on the planet.

Figure 3 below shows the global temperature from 1860 to 2000, along with the Arctic temperature. Clear to see is the 60-year cycle temperature fluctuation between 0.2 and 1.2°C. Russian Autor Frolov shows in Figure 4 a similar trend for the Barents Sea (70-90° N) and extrapolated accordingly for the coming 50 years. Here a temperature drop of about 1.5°C is expected. Also in a new GEOMAR-paper from 2014 that factors in the NAO impact reaches the result that the North Atlantic region is going to cool.

Figure 3: Temperature in the Arctic, 1860-2000
 

Figure 4: Temperature and projection at the Barents Sea 1900-2060 (Frolov, 2014)
Clearly there is absolutely no indication anywhere that points to the Arctic sea ice disappearing. American climate researcher David Dilley, who worked 20 years at the NOAA, even said that according to his analyses, cooling will continue over the next 120 years (4). This can be expected due to the anticipated temperature decline associated with the natural 230 year climate cycle that reached its peak in 2005. This trend is shown also in Figure 4 with the reduced maximum in 2060 compared to 2000.
To the contrary, scientists at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, are anticipating a long-term-reduction in sea ice cover at the North Pole area in the summer time over the coming decades (5). Ms. C. Habermalz, AWI, believes (8) the Arctic will be ice-free by 2040-2050.
No matter, there is no need to fret over the poor polar bears having their icebergs melt away, which a number of wildlife protection organizations have announced in attempts to get people to donate. Polar bears have already survived a number of warm periods – the most recent being the Holocene Maximum 7000 years ago when global temperature was some 1.5°C higher. Sea ice at the North Pole, David Dilley says, was only half as much back then (see ref. (6)).

"Berkeley this week became the first city in the United States to ban natural, fossil gas hook-ups in new buildings. The landmark ordinance was passed into law on Tuesday, after being approved unanimously by the city council the previous week amid resounding public support.  Although Berkeley may be pushing the vanguard, the city is hardly alone. Governments across the US and Europe are looking at strategies to phase out gas. In California alone, dozens of cities and counties are considering eliminating fossil fuel hook-ups to power stoves and heat homes in new buildings, while California state agencies pencil out new rules and regulations that would slash emissions. Natural gas, it seems, has become the new climate crisis frontline. Berkeley’s ordinance, which goes into effect on 1 January, will ban gas hook-ups in new multi-family construction, with some allowances for first-floor retail and certain types of large structures. The reasons behind the decision are multifold. Energy use in buildings accounts for about 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in California. If the state is to meet its goal of 100% zero-carbon energy by 2045, the gas will have to go. For decades, gas was considered among the preferred energy sources for buildings and embraced as a bridge from dirtier fossil fuels to a green energy future. “There’s been a lingering perception that burning gas was cleaner than electricity, which might have been true 20 years ago when electricity came from burning coal,” said Pierre Delforge, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council . “When we look at electrification policies, we need to think about what the grid will look like in 10 or 20 years, not what it looked like yesterday.” A state energy commission report released in early 2019 concluded that building electrification was “a key strategy” for reducing the state’s climate impacts, one that “offers the most promising path to achieving [greenhouse gas] reduction targets in the least costly manner”. Roughly 3% of all natural gas extracted by industry is leaked into the atmosphere, where methane is a far more potent, if shorter lived, greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Berkeley was also motivated to reduce health and safety risks endemic to gas appliances, which release significant emissions and pollutants indoors. And then there’s the matter of running large amounts of flammable fuel around a state known for large earthquakes. A Pacific Gas and Electric pipeline explosion in 2010 turned a Northern California neighborhood into a smoking crater. “We really believe we have the underpinnings of good legislation with economic, health and safety and climate impacts,” said the Berkeley councilmember Kate Harrison. “We can do this and we’ll end up a lot healthier and cleaner for it.” Further decarbonizing the grid and electrifying buildings will be key to helping California meet its ambitious climate goals. In 2018, the state passed a law requiring it to derive 100% of its power from zero-carbon energy sources by 2045, and to pursue a “bold path” to get there. Cities’ individual choices will be crucial in reaching that target. Energy is regulated at the state level, but municipalities control much of their own building codes. “Climate-minded cities are all pulling their hair out, like, we have a climate emergency, and the national government doesn’t care. But this issue is squarely in their wheelhouse – they’ve just got to think about it in new and creative ways,” said Bruce Nilles, managing director of the Rocky Mountain Institute. “We’re dealing with an existential crisis. We’ve got to dust off all the different ways that different actors can do good, progressive, climate-minded things.” More than 50 cities and counties in California are now considering similar policies to Berkeley’s, either banning or limiting gas and incentivizing full electrification in new buildings. Panama Bartholomy, director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition, points to this summer as a transformative one: in order to have new ordinances in place by 1 January, municipalities will have until September to pass electrification measures. “Not all 50 are going to make it. I’m thinking a couple dozen make it,” he said. Even a fully electrified California will still burn some gas, some of it to power that electric grid. Los Angeles, for example, plans to phase out some gas infrastructure, but is also investing in a new gas-fired power plant, in service of fully phasing out coal. There are also still hurdles in the developer community. When Dan Kalb, a city council member in Oakland, tried to convince a developer to build a new housing development to be fully electric, he said, they were unwilling, claiming that new apartments without gas wouldn’t command the same high market rate as units that were oven-ready. And new construction accounts for just roughly 1% of buildings in California. In order to fully phase out gas, reach climate emissions goals, reduce indoor pollution, address safety hazards, and reach zero-carbon energy by 2045, state and local governments will have to create an incentivized, affordable pathway away from the pipelines, and toward induction stoves and heat pumps. Bartholomy’s coalition is working with manufacturers to prepare them for all that new electric appliance demand. “We’ve got about 10 years to really transform this market and make the clean version the more attractive version,” said Bartholomy. If more cities can pull off what Berkeley did, they could not just clean up California, but also create a model for local and state governments across the US, as coal is phased out and the electric grid becomes cleaner. “There are gas utilities all over the industry, all over the country that are terrified that this fight is going to come to them,” said David Pomerantz, executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute. “There are rumblings in Oregon and Washington. The fight’s in California right now but it’s coming everywhere.” For utilities that sell both gas and electricity, a gas phase-out presents a tremendous market shift, but not necessarily an existential one – they’ll stay in business, their customer bases intact. But for utilities that sell and service only natural, fossil gas, the prospect of Berkeley leading California toward an electric green future is horrifying. “If you’re a gas-only utility, then building electrification is a death sentence for you. In that sense they’re almost akin to the coal mining industry,” said Pomerantz. SoCalGas, for example, serves nearly 22 million customers, or about half the state. A subsidiary of Sempra Energy, the utility arguably has the most to lose from electrification. “The Southern California Gas Company is just not coming to the table on this,” said Bartholomy. “They aren’t providing any vision to meet our climate targets.” SoCalGas did not respond to a request for comment. Gas companies won’t be the only ones left bearing the cost of old energy infrastructure. Ratepayers have in turn invested in the current pipelines, which will become stranded assets if everything electrifies. “If you’re going to have entire communities apart from the gas system under the name of decarbonization, who is left holding the bag of the things that are already in the ground?” said Michael Colvin, director of California Energy for the Environmental Defense Fund. Of all the challenges facing full electrification, the affordability component is among the trickiest. A report released in June cautioned that as more people leave the gas grid, the same fixed infrastructure costs will be spread across a smaller number of customers, raising prices for everyone left. “We don’t want to have low-income communities the only ones left paying for the natural gas – these are already folks who pay a disproportionate amount of their income for energy and we don’t want to make it worse,” said Bartholomy. But we’ve invested a lot in that gas infrastructure, and it still has to be paid for somehow, by someone. “It was put in place assuming we would be using gas infrastructure for so many years,” said Ranjit Deshmukh, environmental studies professor at UC Santa Barbara. “Are we as a society and a consumer base obligated to pay for that even if we’re not using it in the future?” If the public doesn’t pay for those pipelines, Colvin warns, it may be even more difficult to get the investment necessary to carry California into full electrification. “Who on earth is going to invest in us if we don’t honor our past commitments?” The earlier California begins fully decarbonizing the state’s energy, the more time there may be to plan for what will be a painful, if necessary, phase-out. If the state is to go zero-carbon by 2045, new gas-powered appliances would need to be removed from the market by around 2030. “We have a 10-year window to figure out a lot of these conversations. That sounds like a long time, but it’s not,” said Colvin. “There’s pipes in the ground that have been around since the 30s.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I’m meandering off into the field of nutrition, as readers here know I do this sometimes – if I feel it’s very important.
Recently at Twitter I began following Tim Noakes, a specialist in nutrition. Tim recently posted a link to a video by Dr. Sarah Hallberg, who runs a clinic for treating obesity and diabetes in Indiana. If you have 20 minutes time, do take it to watch the video. It may add years to your life (and save our bank accounts).

Some time ago I became convinced that obesity, heart disease and nutrition-related diabetes were in fact all designed to profit what to me is increasingly looking like a very deceptive and evil group of industries. It wasn’t intended at first, but then a number of parties discovered how they could rig it to their benefit, and the rest morphed into the monster it has become today.
At least two generations of the human species have had the wool pulled over their eyes with the high-carb diet, junk-science-based nonsense. Just the most basic statistics tell the whole story:
* 50% of US adults (120 million) are either diabetic or pre-diabetic.
* Each patient pays thousands annually for diabetes medicine.
* Diabetes industry alone rakes in $250 billion every year.
Let’s recall that the high-carb diet, just like global science, was once backed up by a overwhelming “consensus of leading experts”. Today hundreds of millions of people are now paying a painful price. Hallberg says:
There’s a lot of money to be made keeping you sick.”
If I were Dr. Hallberg, I’d be watching my back very closely. There are a lot of powerful forces out there who don’t want her message to get out.

The HadCRUT global temperature dataset that the IPCC references contains instrumental records that date back to the year 1850. Precise CO2 data (measured in tenths of parts per million)  from thousands of years ago can be found in Antarctic ice cores, with direct measurements (Mauna Loa) available since the 1950s.   In comparing the two records, it can be concluded that during the last 165 years, rapidly increasing CO2 concentrations only correlate with rapidly increasing global temperatures for one 25-year period (1977-2001).   Put another way, for 85% of the last 165 years there has been little to no correlation between CO2 concentration changes and temperature changes.
Maximum CO2 warming occurs within 10 years after emission
Before illustrating the lack of trend correlation between CO2 and temperature during the last 165 years, it needs to be pointed out that scientists have determined that on average it takes about 10 years for the maximum warming effect from CO2 emission to be realized. In other words, CO2 emissions from the 1950s predominantly had the most pronounced effect on temperature trends by the 1960s.  It could also be said that we are now experiencing the height of the warming effects of the CO2 emissions from the early 2000s.  The timing of the CO2-to-temperature effect was determined by Ricke and Caldeira (2014) in their Environmental Research Letters paper entitled “Maximum warming occurs about one decade after a carbon dioxide emission”.
Ricke and Caldeira, 2014:
It is known that carbon dioxide emissions cause the Earth to warm, but no previous study has focused on examining how long it takes to reach maximum warming following a particular CO2 emission. Using conjoined results of carbon-cycle and physical-climate model intercomparison projects, we find the median time between an emission and maximum warming is 10.1 years.
Selecting decadal-sale warming and cooling phases
Having established that correlational fluctuations between CO2 concentrations and global temperature should be detectable on a decadal scale (presuming that Ricke and Caldeira [2014] are correct), the CO2 and temperature record for the last 165 years can be considered — rooted in the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) assumption that temperature fluctuations should occur in direct response to CO2 concentration changes.
The IPCC routinely selects starting and ending points from the instrumental record to establish warming and cooling phases in their trend analysis. For example, the years 1998-2012 from IPCC AR5 (2013)  are selectively used to analyze the recent “hiatus” in global warming, and the years 1910 to 1940 are selected in AR4 (2007) to denote the early 20th century warming (ETCW).  In that same vein, the decadal-scale periods selectively considered for this analysis are:

1850 – 1910
1910 – 1940
1940 – 1977
1977 – 2001
2001 – 2014

1. 1850 – 1910: -0.1°C Cooling with +15 ppm CO2
According to NASA*, between 1850 and 1910, CO2 concentrations rose from 285 ppm to 300 ppm. During this same 60-year period, global temperatures cooled by almost -0.1°C despite the +15 ppm increase in CO2 concentration.  The temperature trends are illustrated below with woodfortrees interactive graphs.

2. 1910 – 1940: +0.45°C Warming with +11 ppm CO2
Between 1910 and 1940, CO2 concentrations rose from 300 ppm to 311 ppm, or by +11 ppm. Interestingly, anthropogenic CO2 emissions did not rise, but remained flat at 1 gigatons of carbon (GtC) per year during this period.  Even so, in the 30 years between 1910 and 1940, global temperatures warmed by +0.45°C, or +0.15°C per decade.

3. 1940 – 1977: -0.1°C Cooling with +23 ppm CO2

Between 1940 and 1977, CO2 concentrations rose from 311 ppm to 334 ppm, or +23 ppm. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions dramatically rose from about 1 GtC per year in 1940 to about 5 GtC per year by the mid-1970s.  During these 35+ years of rapidly rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and anthropogenic CO2 emissions, global temperatures nonetheless cooled by almost -0.1°C.

Chart: www.woodfortrees.org/trend
4. 1977 – 2001: +0.35°C Warming with +37 ppm CO2
The first and only period in the last 165 years that there was actually a correlation between rapidly rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions and rapidly rising temperature was between the years 1977 and 2001. CO2 concentrations rose from 334 ppm to 371 ppm, or +37 ppm during this period.  Temperatures rose by +0.35°C, or +0.15°C per decade  —  a similar warming rate when compared to the 1910 to 1940 trend.

Chart: www.woodfortrees.org/plot/trend
5. 2001 – 2014: -0.04°C Cooling with +27 ppm CO2
Finally, between 2001 and 2014, CO2 concentrations rose from 371 ppm to 398 ppm, or by +27 ppm. During this same period,  temperatures remained flat or even slightly cooled by a few hundredths of a degree, which meant that a substantial portion of the latest IPCC report (AR5, 2013) necessarily was devoted to explaining why the 21st century global warming “hiatus” had occurred.
Several dozen scientific papers were also published during this period, each attempting to explain why CO2 could be rapidly rising while temperatures were not.  This “pause” inconvenience was eliminated in 2015 with the onset of the 2015-’16 Super El Niño that rapidly drove up sea surface temperatures, as well as via the nearly immediate  acceptance of the controversial Thomas Karl (et al., 2015**) “pause-busting” paper which selected the year 1998 as a starting point and adjusted past warming down and more recent warming up (so as to allow temperature trends to correspond better with climate models).  With the onset of the La Niña recovery trend commencing in April/May 2016, temperatures are likely to continue to decline from the 2015-’16 El Niño peak in the near future despite the rapidly rising CO2 concentrations (which have now eclipsed 400 ppm); this may further extend the 21st century pause in global warming that began in the early 2000s.

Summarizing Question 
Many Holocene temperature reconstructions show significant fluctuation in temperatures during the last 2,000 years (i.e., a Roman Warm Period, a Dark Ages cool period, a Medieval Warm Period, and a Little Ice Age cool period). However, CO2 concentrations remained stable at about 270 to 275 ppm throughout each warming and cooling epoch.  For example, during the roughly 600 years between the as-warm or warmer-than-now Medieval Warm Period and the beginning of the 20th century (the 1300 to 1900 A.D. Little Ice Age), temperatures plummeted to the coldest centennial-scale phase of the last 10,000 years.  Yet CO2 concentrations not only did not decline along with the temperatures, they rose slightly during this period.  This record necessarily extends the lack of correlation between CO2 and temperature changes well beyond the last 165 years.
The summarizing question, then, is this:
If CO2 is a primary determinant of temperature (as the AGW theory proposes), and if the warming effects of CO2 emission reach their maximum impact within about a decade, why is the correlation between decadal-scale CO2 trends and decadal-scale temperature trends weak to non-existent for most (~85%) of the last 165 years, as well as completely non-existent for nearly all of the last 2,000 years?

"The Proms have a slightly uneasy relationship with Big Themes. Former director Nicholas Kenyon used to love them – grand overarching narratives designed to hold the otherwise unwieldy two-month music festival together. But his successors have been more circumspect, recognising that Proms-goers for the most part attend single concerts rather than a group of performances linked to, say, death or sex – or this year’s theme, nature, and our part in destroying it. That big theme, admits current Proms director David Pickard, stole up on him almost unawares. “You don’t always start with a theme,” he says. “Pieces come in and it emerges. You start to see a theme emerging from what people are wanting to write. That was what happened with this. None of these things should be forced.”  The two initial building blocks were In the Name of the Earth, John Luther Adams’s large-scale choral work, which will receive its European premiere; and the Lost Words prom, which Pickard calls “a family concert about something that matters very much to young people”. The latter is based on writer Robert Macfarlane and illustrator Jackie Morris’s glorious 2017 book of poems and paintings of the same name, celebrating nature and bemoaning the fact that children are losing the language that allows them to inhabit it. With those two concerts in place, Pickard started to think more generally about music’s relationship with the natural world. “When you ask someone to write about nature now,” he says, “they are not necessarily writing about it in a romantic way, in the way Beethoven did. They’re writing about the danger of loss.” The season will offer a fascinating juxtaposition of old and new views of the natural world, of innocent celebration and present-day fear and anger. Haydn’s Creation, Beethoven’s “Pastoral” Symphony, Sibelius’s Fifth Symphony (with its finale inspired by the sight of 16 swans passing overhead), Richard Strauss’s Alpine Symphony, Messiaen’s From the Canyons to the Stars, and other canonical nature-inflected works will sit alongside contemporary or new pieces. These include Judith Weir’s Forest, Stevie Wishart’s The Last Dance?, Alexia Sloane’s Earthward and Hans Zimmer’s Earth. Zimmer’s piece features in a prom marking the 50th anniversary of the moon landing – another theme this year – but because Zimmer has chosen to portray Earth as seen from the moon it becomes part of the underlying musical preoccupation with our precious planet. Master of the Queen’s music Judith Weir’s orchestral piece Forest dates from 1995. It has been programmed alongside Sibelius’s Fifth Symphony in a concert on the same Sunday as In the Name of the Earth – a kind of de facto Nature Day. Weir’s piece is a fairly lateral response to nature, inspired in part by the German Romantic idea of the enchanted wood and the fairytales it engendered. The piece, like much of her work, has a strong, multilayered intellectual underpinning. It is not a visceral response to threat, though audiences who have spent the past year participating in or reading about Extinction Rebellion might interpret it as such. I suggest that if she wrote it today it would most likely be a concerto for orchestra and 12 buzzsaws. “I didn’t see it as a political piece,” she says, “but I completely agree with you. If I sat down to write a piece called Forest now, I couldn’t not write about Brazil and all that stuff.” She worries that the audience will come with expectations of picture-painting. “The piece which I call Forest may not sound anything like trees or nature. It’s a busy, dense piece and you might not have that view of a forest at all.” John Luther Adams, who has spent much of his life in Alaska being inspired by and defending its wilderness, has no such qualms. His award-winning orchestral piece Become Ocean, premiered in 2013, doesn’t just represent the sea, or use it as a metaphor for human struggle in the way that composers of the past might have done. As the title makes clear, it seeks to become the ocean, to capture its power and movement in sound. Haydn is celebrating God in The Creation, while Beethoven is seeking to capture the interplay of nature and the creative spirit in his “Pastoral” Symphony. But Adams is trying to encapsulate nature itself, in all its brutal energy, with mankind removed from the picture. It’s nature as the protagonist. “My work has always been deeply rooted in personal experience of wild places,” Adams says. “I can’t imagine how it could be any other way. Nature is not just the source of everything that I do, it is the ultimate source of everything we human animals do. Everything we imagine we create comes from the world we inhabit – the very shape and substance of our minds, our intelligence.” Adams believes it is essential for artists to confront the climate crisis and the mass extinction of species now taking place. The innocence of composers who wrote about nature in the past is no longer feasible. “This is a serious business that informs what it means to be a thinking person here and now. It would not have been possible for earlier composers even to imagine.” He does not, however, want to be simply labelled as an activist, even though there have been times in the past when he was exactly that – on the frontline of the environmental struggle in Alaska. “I like to think I can have it both ways,” he says. “I write, I speak, I give interviews, it’s no secret that in my 20s and 30s I was a full-time environmental activist and that these concerns are at the heart of my life and work. “However, I am a composer and I believe profoundly in the intrinsic power and value of music as music. If my music does not move you strictly as music, then anything else I may write or say about it means nothing. The music must come first. Music is how I understand the world and this is my best gift to a troubled planet. It is informed by all these things we’re talking about, but it damned well better be good music, too.” Stevie Wishart has also composed a piece with an unambiguously environmentalist subtext: The Last Dance?, a new movement appended to a Bach suite, an inventive way of smuggling polemic into the tightest of commissioning briefs. Her short work is a baroque tango drawing on birdsong, which she tells me she has been increasingly using while holed up in a remote village in Belgium. Her tango mimics the dance of the Argentinian hooded grebe, which is a critically endangered species. The piece uses the song of the grebe, which Wishart says happens to be in the same key as the Bach suite. It’s a delightful conceit. Wishart believes using birdsong and writing nature-inspired work has reconnected her with her audience. “Contemporary music can be rather exclusive and self-referential. I feel that as composers we have lost sight of our audience. Nature is a way to rewild listening and to bring music back into an inclusive way of thinking about sound, but without any sense of dumbing down.” Young, blind composer Alexia Sloane, whose Earthward will be premiered at a Cadogan Hall chamber prom, feels even more strongly about environmental issues and is proud to call themself an activist composer. “I am very interested in the idea of engaged music and engaged art,” they say. “I’m fairly introverted and I don’t find it easy to be on the frontline, but we are losing our emotional connection with nature and art is a crucial way to reconnect.” Sloane calls it “creative activism against the extinction crisis”, contrasting it with the cold, rational response of scientists and statisticians. “Art returns to the sense of wonder. Only then can we have meaningful activism.” In the Lost Words prom, Jackie Morris will paint a red fox live on stage as she recites a poem by Robert Macfarlane; beatboxer Jason Singh, working with poet Caleb Femi and dancer Thomas Carsley, will interpret two of Macfarlane’s other “spells”, Raven and Starling; there will be extracts from Vaughan Williams’s The Lark Ascending and Einojuhani Rautavaara’s Cantus Arcticus, a “concerto for birds and orchestra” which uses birdsong recorded near the Arctic Circle. And Jocelyn Pook has written a new piece that sets words from speeches by environmental activist Greta Thunberg to music. “Her voice, a lone teenager, making such a difference is very heartening,” says Pook. “I found her speeches and her TED talk so inspiring. I found it extraordinary that she could stand up and do that, with that level of articulacy. But the one that no one can be unmoved by was her speech at the Strasbourg convention, where she almost breaks down as she describes all the environmental catastrophes that are happening.” Roll over Beethoven, Greta Thunberg is in the house.• The First Night of the Proms is at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on  19 July and  broadcast live on Radio 3 and BBC TV. The season runs until 14 September. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s and Europe’s first real heat wave (more than 3 days long) of the summer has pushed temperatures well above the 30°C. A so-called omega high pressure system centered over Eastern Europe is pumping hot air from the Mediterranean and Africa up across much of Europe.
Source: wetterdienst.de
Not about to pass up any opportunity to exploit single weather events for the global warming cause, the online SVZ here cites the DWD German Weather Service, which warns that climate change will further exacerbate summer heat waves in cities, especially because of all the concrete, steel and asphalt that act as heat storage sinks that in turn serve to slow down nighttime cooling and absorb more heat in the daytime on hot days.
The DWD advises cities to find ways to incorporate more green vegetation to help offset the growing urban heat island effect brought on by climate change, the SVZ writes.
Can boost temperatures by 10°C!
What’s interesting here is that in the article the DWD also confirms that the urban heat island effect is real and profound, claiming that it can boost temperatures in cities “by up to 10°C”. The SVZ.de cites DWD Vice President Paul Becker, writing:

Temperatures in the city as a result could be up to 10°C higher than in the surrounding rural areas where we find bodies of water and vegetation.”
So what should this tell us about readings taken from the many weather stations located near airports and cities? Of course they have been generating exaggerated results for years. And worse, the adjustments made to the temperature record over the past years are dubious at best, especially when rural stations of the past are corrected downward and recent urban data corrected upwards.
Data supporting more heat waves weak at best
On the subject of heat waves and their frequency, also read Judith Curry’s latest here.
By the way, Western Europe being on track for a record heat wave, like the media are claiming, is a bit of hyperbole. In Germany, the heat wave is scheduled to be over already over by Tuesday, making the heat wave about a whole 5 days long. That pales compared to the heat wave of 2003.
Naturally the alarmist Potsdam Institute here (also unable to pass up the chance to exploit the hot weather) is sure that heat waves are getting more frequent and intense because of global warming. But then again, the Potsdam Institute also claims that global warming is causing more wintertime cold waves. So you be the judge on whether or not they can be taken seriously.

"The focus on plastics in our oceans has highlighted the global problem of waste disposal. Household bin collection and the recycling, composting, burying or incinerating of our rubbish are key functions of a modern city. But in low-income countries about 90% of waste ends up in open dumps or is burned in the open air. Obviously, burning waste creates carbon dioxide and the smoke contains health-harmful particles, but it also contains tiny black particles of soot which have a huge short-term climate impact. Researchers from London’s King’s and Imperial colleges burned small samples of rubbish and measured the smoke. Soot amounts were greatest when the rubbish contained two plastics: polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate (more commonly abbreviated to PET and often used to make drinks bottles). Burning waste containing textiles, many of these being plastic, also contributed to high soot releases.  Using data on the contents of rubbish from around the world, the researchers estimated that the soot from open waste burning had a global warming impact equivalent to between 2% and 10% of the global emissions of carbon dioxide. Unless addressed, this problem is set to worsen as the amount that we throw away is expected to increase by 70% by 2050."
"Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands have recorded their highest ever temperatures as the second extreme heatwave in as many months to be linked by scientists to the climate emergency grips the continent. The Dutch meteorological service, KNMI, said the temperature reached 39.2C (102.5F) at the Gilze-Rijen airbase near Breda on Wednesday afternoon, exceeding the previous high of 38.6C set in August 1944. In Belgium, the temperature in Kleine-Brogel hit 38.9C on Wednesday afternoon, fractionally higher than the previous record of 38.8C set in June 1947, and then subsequently rose to 39.9C. Forecasters said temperatures could climb further on Thursday. Germany’s national weather service, DWD, said it believed a new all-time national high of 40.5C – 0.2C higher than the record – had been set in the town of Geilenkirchen near the Dutch and Belgian borders, but had still to confirm it. “The most extreme heat will build from central and northern France into Belgium, the Netherlands and far western Germany into Thursday,” said Eric Leister of the forecasting group AccuWeather. After several cities in France broke previous temperature records on Tuesday, including Bordeaux, which hit 41.2C, the national weather service, Météo France, said Paris was likely to beat its all-time high of 40.4C, set in July 1947, with 42C on Thursday. City records in Amsterdam and Brussels are also expected to fall. Cities are particularly vulnerable in heatwaves because of a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect, in which concrete buildings and asphalt roads absorb heat during the day and emit it again at night, preventing the city from cooling. The latest heatwave, caused by an “omega block” – a high-pressure pattern that blocks and diverts the jet stream, allowing a mass of hot air to flow up from northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula – follows a similar extreme weather event last month that made it the hottest June on record. Temperature records for this time of year have already been broken across much of Europe. The highest ever June temperatures were recorded in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Andorra, Luxembourg, Poland and Germany, while France registered an all-time record high of 45.9C. The latest heatwave, caused by an “omega block” – a high-pressure pattern that blocks and diverts the jet stream, allowing a mass of hot air to flow up from northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula – follows a similar extreme weather event last month that made it the hottest June on record. It is not possible to pin the heatwave definitively on climate change because weather varies naturally. Moreover, the effects of climate change are not simple. For example, heavy rain and cloud across northern Europe is likely to become more common as the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the jet stream weather system to become fixed in position. However, this year’s weather is certainly in line with the predictions scientists have made of rising temperatures, more heatwaves and prolonged droughts interspersed with periods of heavy flooding. The body’s ability to regulate its own temperature is crucial; babies and older people are less well able to regulate their temperature and should stay in well-ventilated conditions. In the 2003 European heatwave there were about 70,000 excess deaths attributed to the long hot spell. People with underlying illnesses can also have problems, and even those who are healthy can experience difficulty sleeping and discomfort, so people are advised to stay hydrated and wear loose clothing at night. There is also an impact on farmers. While warmth at the right time is crucial for crop growth, excessively high temperatures can inhibit that growth, particularly if they are prolonged. Livestock can also suffer in the heat and need extra care. Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent The highest ever June temperatures were recorded in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Andorra, Luxembourg, Poland and Germany, while France registered an all-time record high of 45.9C in the southern commune of Gallargues-le-Montueux. Clare Nullis, a World Meteorological Organization spokeswoman, said the heatwaves bore the “hallmark of climate change”. The extreme events were “becoming more frequent, they’re starting earlier, and they’re becoming more intense”, she said. “It’s not a problem that’s going to go away.” The 26-28 June heatwave in France was 4C hotter than a June heatwave would have been in 1900, according to World Weather Attribution, a new international programme helping the scientific community to analyse the possible influence of climate breakdown on extreme weather events. A study published earlier this year by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich said the summer heatwave across northern Europe last year would have been “statistically impossible” without climate change driven by human activity. KNMI has issued a code orange extreme temperature warning for all of the Netherlands except the offshore Wadden Islands and implemented its “national heat emergency” plan, while Belgium has taken the unprecedented step of placing the entire country on a code red warning. Spain has also declared a red alert in the Zaragoza region, where the worst wildfires in 20 years took place last month. The EU’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service warned of an extreme danger of further forest fires in France and Spain on Thursday, with a high or very high threat level in Belgium, Germany, Italy and Portugal. Twenty French départements were also placed on red alert. Agnès Buzyn, the health minister, said: “Nobody is immune in the face of such extreme temperatures. There are risks even if you are not particularly vulnerable.”  Britain’s Met Office issued similar advice and said the UK all-time high of 38.5C, recorded in Faversham, Kent, in August 2003, could be exceeded on Thursday. Local authorities in France have placed restrictions on water usage in 73 of the country’s 96 départements following dramatic falls in ground and river water levels. “It’s tricky but under control, but we need to be very vigilant,” said the junior environment minister, Emmanuelle Wargon. The French energy company EDF said it was shutting down two reactors at its Golfech nuclear power plant in the southern Tarn-et-Garonne region in order to limit the heating of water used to keep the reactors cool. Scientists have said such heatwaves are closely linked to the climate emergency and will be many times more likely over the coming decades. Last month, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said Europe’s five hottest summers since 1500 had all occurred in the 21st century – in 2002, 2003, 2010, 2016 and 2018. Monthly records were now falling five times as often as they would in a stable climate, the institute said, adding that this was “a consequence of global warming caused by the increasing greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil and gas”. • This article was amended on 25 July 2019 to add a temperature announced after publication. The Belgian weather service initially announced that Kleine-Brogel had hit 38.9C, but the temperature later rose to 39.9C."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI had to chuckle when I read the following press release on a study that found that global precipitation has not risen after all. Models and media reports wrong again!
==========================================
Leipzig meteorologist studies effects of climate change on worldwide precipitation

Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air. Does this mean that climate warming leads to more precipitation on average than it did a few decades ago? Dr. Marc Salzmann of the Institute for Meteorology at the University of Leipzig looked at this question. In a study he found that climate change so far has not had an impact on the average global precipitation amount. This could change by the end of this century. The meteorologist published his findings in “Science Advances”.
“The Arctic is melting, temperature and sea level are rising, and every year a new record is reached with CO2 in the atmosphere. Only the global average amount of precipitation has not changed measurably,” says Salzmann. Indeed precipitation has increased in some regions of the earth, but at the same time it has decreased in others. It is also known that as a consequence of climate change, there are heavy rainfalls more often. “With the worldwide average precipitation, however, neither computer models nor observations show significant changes,” he explains.
This is due to tiny particles called aerosols that float in the air and are created, for example, by sulfur dioxide. They have a cooling effect on the climate. But according to Salzmann, they do not suffice to offset the global temperature warming that is caused by greenhouse gases. Yet the affect of aerosols on precipitation has still been strong enough to offset the affect by greenhouse gases on the global average precipitation.
“My study shows that the global precipitation amount on average falls an estimated 3 to 4% per degree Celsius of cooling by aerosols, while the already known value for greenhouse gases is only 1.5 to 2% precipitation increase per degree of warming,” says the meteorologist. These different “hydrological sensitivities” is the reason why we can be thankful that the average precipitation amount has changed very little worldwide even though the global mean temperature has risen.
However for the future – already at the end of this century – Salzmann expects a significant increase in global precipitation amount. Because greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for a long time, the concentration rises even if emissions remain steady. Aerosol particles on the other hand get washed away by rain rather quickly.
Original in “Science Advances”: “Global warming without global mean precipitation increase?”

"The Met Office has warned that thunderstorms and severe weather across much of the UK could cause flooding in some areas. Travel disruption was also a possibility, the forecaster said. There was a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded quickly during thundery downpours, with lightning strikes, hail and strong winds expected.  Power cuts and difficult driving conditions were also possible, and 20mm to 30mm (0.8-1.2in) of rain could fall in an hour in some areas. Met Office severe weather warnings covered swaths of England, Wales and Scotland across Tuesday and Wednesday. The area affected by Tuesday’s warning has been extended, with storms expected to hit more of the country than previously thought. Calmer conditions are forecast from Thursday, with sunny spells and occasional showers predicted for many. Last week, the UK was basking in a heatwave and a 38.7C (101.7F) reading in Cambridge set a temperature record, exceeding the previous high of 38.5C near Faversham, Kent, in August 2003. Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands also broke national heat records last week as hot weather spread across central and western Europe. Experts warn that global warming caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, which are increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is making heatwaves more likely and more intense."
"The woman seeking to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as the European commission president has made last-minute pledges on the climate crisis, Brexit, an EU minimum wage and gender quotas for company boards as she faces a knife-edge vote on her candidacy. In leaked letters to the leaders of two of the EU parliament’s main political groups, Ursula von der Leyen, who was nominated two weeks ago by the heads of state and government for the top EU post, has sought to win over critical left-leaning MEPs at the risk of alienating some on the right.  The German defence minister’s candidacy is facing opposition from the Social Democrats (SPD) in her own country, the greens and the hard left, among others, in the vote on Tuesday evening in which she needs to secure an absolute majority to become the first ever female commission president. Some are opposed to Von der Leyen on the grounds that she is not one of the spitzenkandidaten, or lead candidates, who campaigned ahead of May’s European elections to head up the EU’s executive branch. The Spitzenkandidaten process is a method by which the European Parliament seeks to influence who is appointed as President of the European Commission - a role held from 2014 to 2019 by Jean-Claude Juncker. Under the process, each political grouping in the European Parliament proposes one 'lead candidate' to take the role. The presidency subsequently goes to the
political party winning the most seats, or the one that brings together the widest coalition of support for their candidate. However, this is not a formal process set out in any treaty or constitution. The candidate for the role is nominated by the European Council, made up of the leaders of the EU member states. They are able to ignore the Spitzenkandidaten nomination and to chose someone else. The appointment has to be subsequently ratified by the European Parliament though, and therefore choosing an alternative candidate risks provoking conflict between the institutions. Her patchy record as a defence minister has also been raised by the SPD in a dossier circulated among MEPs as a reason why Von der Leyen is “an inadequate and unsuitable candidate” to lead the commission for the next five years. Von der Leyen, a close ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has the backing of the centre-right European People’s party, will make a speech to the European parliament on Tuesday morning before MEPs cast their vote in the early evening but it is far from clear that she will be able to secure the backing of the 374 parliamentarians needed for her to take the post from 1 November. Should she fail to win enough votes the EU would be left in uncharted territory, with the parliament pitted against the leaders on the issue of commission presidency, and with few easy fixes available. Von der Leyen’s selection, after 50 hours of negotiations among the 28 leaders, was just one part of a package in which candidates were also chosen as presidents of the European council and European Central Bank, in which political affiliation, geography and gender had to be balanced. Sources said an emergency summit for 23 July was being planned in case of her rejection. If Von der Leyen passed the 374 threshold but failed to receive the backing of 400 MEPs there would be questions over her ability to lead the EU’s policy agenda given the fragility of her majority. In letters to the Socialists and Democrats and the liberal group, Renew Europe, sent on Monday and obtained by the Guardian, Von der Leyen has pledged to give parliament a role in initiating legislation and says she will push forward on stalled progressive policies on climate change, wages and gender equality. She has committed to setting “quotas on gender balance on company boards”, a policy first proposed by the commission in 2012, and to establishing a “legal instrument to ensure that every worker in our union has a fair minimum wage that allows them a decent living in the country they work in”. On climate change, Von der Leyen has said the EU needs to be more ambitious on its 2030 target to cut emissions within the bloc by at least 40% compared with 1990 levels, by raising the aim to at least 50% and providing a plan for a 55% cut. She has backed the proposal from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for a “carbon border tax” which would hit companies that want to trade in the EU but are based in countries that do not live up to the bloc’s environmental standards. Von der Leyen, 60, who has previously spoken of her support for the idea of a “United States of Europe”, has also called for greater burden sharing when it comes to immigration, in a thinly veiled criticism of the failure of some central and eastern European states to take in asylum seekers. On Brexit she insists that the current withdrawal agreement – described as “defunct” by the likely next UK prime minister, Boris Johnson – is the “best and only deal possible for an orderly withdrawal”. On an extension of the UK’s membership beyond 31 October, she says she would be in support “if good reasons are provided”. Von der Leyen says in her letters that she hopes the “snapshot” on her positions, some of which are retreads of previous proposals from the commission, will reassure her critics, although there is a risk of putting off MEPs within the more Eurosceptic and rightwing European Conservatives and Reformists group, in which Poland’s Law and Justice is the largest party. Portugal’s socialist prime minister António Costa tweeted that Von der Leyen’s letter contained sufficient reassurance for left-wing MEPs to give her their support, describing them as “positive commitments”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologist Joe Bastardi at Twitter posted a chart from Scripps Oceanography Institute, which does put out some excellent work despite a fair amount climate science activism from a few of its scientists.
According to the Weatherbell meteorologist, Scripps has forecast a La Niña under -2.0 over five consecutive month, as the following chart shows:

While it’s still questionable that the La Niña will arrive already this summer, there is rapidly diminishing doubt that it will be hitting the globe hard by wintertime. Joe adds:
The implication of the SCRIPPS forecast with the ONI is it would more than counter the recent strong el nino, over a multi year period”
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology writes here (April 26, 2016):
Eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures have cooled significantly in the past fortnight, and are now approaching neutral levels. As temperatures under the surface are below average, more surface water cooling is expected. However the atmosphere is only slowly responding to these changes, and hence the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and cloudiness near the Date Line continue to fluctuate around El Niño thresholds.
Six of eight international climate models suggest the tropical Pacific Ocean will return to neutral levels within the next month. By September, seven of eight models suggest La Niña thresholds are likely. However, individual model outlooks show a large spread between neutral and La Niña scenarios.”

The following chart from Wikipedia gives an overview of all La Niña events occurring since 1900.

Source: Wikipedia here.
Note how in the above figure a lack of La Niña events persisted from 1976 to 1998, a time that saw the globe warm some 0.6°C. Since 1998 the frequency of La Niña events has increased with global temperatures remaining flat. Back in the early to mid 1970s, a time of frequent La Niña events, much of the media warned of a coming little ice age. For example in 1974 German Spiegel news magazine warned that the chances of warming were less than 1 in 10,000! A number of scientists sounded the ice age alarms, blaming it in part on sinful human activity.
By 1986, with La Niña events having been absent close to 10 years, Spiegel flipped and began its spectacular warnings of global warming, showing a semi-submerged Cologne Cathedral on the cover of a 1986 magazine. by 1988, James Hansen was before Congress prophesizing the end of the world.
Significant midterm climate cooling in the pipeline?
The oncoming La Niña in combination with weakened solar activity and a flip towards the cool phase by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) may soon be all working in tandem to set up months of global cooling ahead, which means a likely resumption in the overall global warming pause over the latter part of the current decade.
Global temperature over the years ahead will hinge in part on how frequently La Niña events occur.

"A declaration by the head of BHP that tackling the climate crisis will require “the biggest global mobilisation since World War II” has prompted claims the world’s biggest miner is more serious about the problem than the Australian parliament. But shareholder advocates warned BHP’s pledge to do more on climate change, including setting targets for its customers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and linking executive pay to pollution reduction, should be viewed sceptically while it remained a member of groups that lobbied against significant action.  Speaking in London, the BHP chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, said global heating was “indisputable” and called for drastic action, including but not limited to carbon pricing. He said the company would spend US$400m to develop technologies to cut emissions from its own operations and from the companies that buy its iron ore, coal, gas and other resources. The “scope 3” emissions released by BHP’s customers are nearly 40 times greater than what it emits itself. Mackenzie indicated the company would not cut its emissions immediately, instead promising to limit its 2022 pollution at 2017 levels, but the company has a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. He said the company would strengthen the link between emissions performance and executive pay from 2021. The announcement comes as BHP and other resources companies face increased pressure from shareholders to show they are acting in the face of what scientists say is a climate emergency. Market sources said the move was also consistent with the company planning a long-term move away from thermal coal, which is burned in power plants and is worth far less than the coking coal used to make steel. Dan Gocher, from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the commitment was a landmark shift for corporate Australia. But he said the company also needed to address the pro-coal advocacy of groups, including the Minerals Council of Australia and the Business Council of Australia, of which it was a leading member. “This is the biggest local block on Australia having ambitious climate and energy policies,” he said. “While it continues to fund these organisations we have a problem.” Gocher said while BHP’s comments sent a powerful signal, its 2022 target was not ambitious when held up next to the Paris agreement goal of limiting heating to less than 2C and its financial commitment was tiny given the size of the company. He said the company had made climate commitments before that delivered little and most of the detail was still to come. Mackenzie said BHP would set a “medium-term, science-based” target next year for the decarbonisation of its operations. “BHP plays this game better than anyone,” Gocher said. “The announcement is great, but we will judge what they are actually doing when we see it.” The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), which represents funds that manage more than $2.2tn in retirement savings, welcomed BHP’s announcement but said companies needed to provide more information about their climate risk. “ACSI encourages companies to take the lead in transitioning to a low carbon economy by setting forward looking targets,” the chief executive, Louise Davidson, said. Davidson said links between executive pay and “non-financial measures” such as climate risk needed to be based on objective targets and genuinely put remuneration at risk. “For companies that are exposed to the financial risks of climate change, it makes sense for remuneration to include links to climate risk management performance,” she said. Emma Herd, chief of Australia’s Investor Group on Climate Change, said BHP’s scope 3 emissions pledge was a significant shift. It follows liquefied natural gas producers arguing they deserve credit for lowering global emissions where their gas displaces coal, a case that has won vocal support from the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor. Herd said BHP’s statement was an important admission that companies could not claim credit for cutting their customers’ emissions if they did not also take responsibility for where they contribute to them. “This actually acknowledges that if you accept the opportunity side you also have to accept the risk side,” she said. She said Mackenzie’s speech showed what qualified as good corporate behaviour was changing. “The bar continues to move. What was considered leadership in 2018 is not what is considered leadership in 2019. The momentum is all going one way.” Taylor said MacKenzie had correctly pointed out that a transition to a lower carbon world should look to avoid major increases in the price and unreliability of energy and materials. “The government is taking a sensible and balanced approach to reduce global emissions and meet our international obligations,” he said. Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said Mackenzie’s speech demonstrated the seriousness with which the corporate sector, investors and regulators were taking climate change was growing, while Australia’s emissions continued to rise under Morrison government policies. “The gap between the approach of the corporate sector and the Australian government keeps growing as the urgency of real climate action becomes more apparent,” he said. Adam Bandt, climate spokesman for the Greens, said it was remarkable that the head of BHP was using similar language as school students striking for action on the climate crisis. He contrasted it with that heard in the Australian parliament. “I never thought I’d say the words that Liberal and Labor should take a leaf out of BHP’s book, but it sounds like BHP recognises the climate emergency as a clear and present danger, unlike the old parties,” he said."
"While young people call for urgent action on the climate emergency, universities are lagging behind, with two-thirds likely to fail their 2020 targets for the reduction of carbon emissions. And academic conferences are partly to blame. Air travel is estimated to be responsible for more than 2% of global human-induced emissions, and lecturers’ flights could be adding significantly to the carbon footprint of many universities, according to transport data provided voluntarily by 67 institutions. According to the 2019 People and Planet University League published on Tuesday, the sector appears to be taking the issues more seriously, increasingly embedding sustainability into its teaching. But still only 49 of 154 institutions are likely to meet the target set by the former funding agency of a 43% reduction of carbon emissions between 2005 and 2020. The table compiled by People and Planet, the student-led network, scores universities out of 100 on criteria such as environmental audits and management systems, the number of staff working on the issues, ethical investment, carbon management, waste and recycling, and sustainable food. The lack of progress is frustrating, says Hannah Smith, the network’s co-director of campaigns and research. “It’s abhorrent to watch universities fail on climate change at a time when people on the frontlines of the impacts are fighting back against heatwaves and forest fires. Universities have a duty to stand with those communities and their students on strike and use their privileged position to act,” she says. Network member Steff Farley, 25, a maths postgraduate student at Loughborough University, adds: “The findings expose the dragging lack of willpower, vision and energy in the sector, which shows disregard for the young climate strikers at schools, colleges and at their own universities.” The table shows that just eight universities have a policy to invest in renewable energy, says Emily Adams, 23, who is studying marine biology and oceanography at the University of Plymouth. “Our universities must now step up to take action to fund a just climate transition,” she adds. This year’s findings on carbon reduction are all the more alarming because this could be the last we hear of them. Under the government’s higher education reforms, universities are no longer obliged to provide data on carbon reduction and other green issues to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). The Office for Students (OfS) has taken over the role of overseeing the higher education sector from Hefce, the funding council that originally set the targets. An OfS spokeswoman explains: “We are committed to being a low-burden regulator and will therefore only mandate data collection where it is necessary to support our regulatory functions. Currently, the OfS does not have a regulatory need for the data within the estates management record.” She adds: “We fully support Hesa and providers working together to collect data on a voluntary basis where this adds value, but providers will have freedom to opt in to such collections. Where Hesa and providers engage in additional activities beyond those mandated by OfS, this will be subject to additional subscriptions.” People and Planet say that voluntary data collection would be incomplete and that having to pay to access the information could put it beyond the organisation’s reach. Smith says: “It is vexatious that while students of all ages go on strike to build a global movement for an equitable carbon transition, the OfS rows backwards to a time where measuring carbon emissions was deemed superfluous admin.” Universities say that they have struggled to make serious carbon reductions against a background of increased student numbers and campus expansion. In addition, the trend towards collaboration between academics from different countries and the growth of the conference scene has led to more lecturers getting on planes. According to a study of air travel at the University of British Columbia in Canada in 2017, staff from just five departments made 709 air trips over 18 months. The resulting emissions were more than 200 times the building emissions for the whole of the geography department. Follow-up research claimed that there was no identifiable link between air travel and academic productivity. “Universities and the academic community need to drive a fast culture shift away from the kudos of conference presentation tally scores, to one of sharing just as much – if not more – research through innovative and participatory alternatives,” says Smith. “Video-conferencing technology has come a long way.” She identifies three institutions, or “trailblazers”, at the top of the table that show what can be done: the University of Gloucestershire, which comes top, followed closely by Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) and Nottingham Trent University (NTU). New universities dominate the top 10, but some of the Russell Group of research-intensive, older universities have improved their positions. Bristol has risen from 27th in the 2017 table (the last one) to 11th this year, and Newcastle has gone up from 20th to 12th. Oxford, more used to being top of higher-education rankings, is just 45th, but that is an improvement on its previous position of 54th. Cambridge falls from 58th to 67th. Gloucestershire gained marks for divesting all fossil-fuel investments and for already meeting its carbon target, with a 46% emissions reduction since 2005, despite the expansion of its estate. But the university’s commitment goes far beyond its footprint to embrace the “brainprint”, says Alex Ryan, director of sustainability and an academic with national teaching fellow status, who is driving the integration of sustainability across the course portfolio. “From the beginning, our sustainability programme has been geared towards academic innovation,” she explains. “Reducing practical impacts is important but, as a university, our core sustainability legacy is the graduates we send into the world to live and work sustainably. Our curriculum experiences are not about isolated, add-on modules or abstract knowledge without application. The gearshift will come from students learning how to create change for sustainability whatever their profession. We don’t want them to go out into employment as, say, accountants or social workers who just reproduce an unsustainable paradigm. We want system change.” MMU has reduced its carbon emissions by 41% and is aiming to be zero carbon by 2038. One of its most successful initiatives has been a carbon-literacy scheme, where money is put aside to compensate for the emissions generated by international air travel, and then used to train students in tackling climate change. So far, more than 800 students have received the training. NTU has launched a green academy as a permanent department working to engage students in sustainability. It puts on pop-up events, recruits an army of eco-ambassador students, gives green rewards to staff, and even keeps bees and peregrine falcons. Biggest mover, the University of Essex – up from 124 in 2017 to 44 – says a lot has happened since the last table, such as structural changes to put an eight-strong sustainability team at the heart of the estates and campus section. There has been a review of how sustainability is being introduced into different subject areas and the launch of a free sustainability summer school for students. Daisy Malt, its sustainability engagement officer, says the changes have been driven from the top, at vice-chancellor level – and by students. “It’s becoming a big deal, partly because of publicity in the mainstream media and the Blue Planet effect, and students are wanting to be more involved,” she says. Most of those in the bottom 10 are small, specialist institutions. Rose Bruford College in Sidcup, Kent, which has the lowest score, did not comment. The second to last, the University of the Highlands and Islands, said the scores were not a true representation because each of its 13 partner colleges manages its own estate. “We are moving towards a single, partnership-wide carbon-management plan,” said a spokeswoman."
"Bowing to the interests of a few deep-pocketed utilities, Ohio has enacted a controversial new law, dubbed HB 6, subsidizing dirty, decades-old coal plants and gutting the state’s clean energy programs. I have spent the past five years researching states’ efforts to roll back clean energy laws. This Ohio bill – which Governor Mike DeWine signed the day it was passed – is the worst yet.  The legislation reflects an unfortunate national pattern: electric utilities pushing to delay climate action, bolstered by a president similarly interested in dragging our country’s feet. For years, FirstEnergy and AEP have been trying to dismantle Ohio’s clean energy policies and bail out their dirty coal plants. Since President Trump took office, these companies have found a receptive audience. FirstEnergy’s CEO has met with Trump personally. Last year, the company asked his administration to invoke emergency powers to save its struggling coal and nuclear plants. Just a few months ago, an Ohio Republican operative who has a major role in Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign called several House Republicans who were on the fence to persuade them to vote for HB 6. These companies have spent several million dollars on deceptive advertising, lobbying and campaign contributions to help elect politicians sympathetic to their cause. In return, these politicians have proven dutiful beneficiaries, working diligently to secure almost a billion dollars of ratepayer subsidies for FirstEnergy and AEP. As lobbying goes, not a bad return on investment. This isn’t just happening in Ohio. Utilities across the country are pushing to delay climate action and stall the growth of renewables, which are already a cheaper source of electricity than continuing to operate three-quarters of US coal plants. Last week in Florida, the CEO of an electric utility called for large charges on customer bills in order to make solar customers “go away”. The Sunshine State gets a measly 3% of its electricity from renewables. Yet Florida utilities still fight customers trying to install solar. In Louisiana, the utility Entergy actually paid actors to show up at a New Orleans city council meeting to secure approval for a new natural gas plant. And in Arizona, the state’s largest electric utility – Arizona Public Service – has poured more than $50m into elections, including for its own regulator, often lying about its involvement. Once its favored politicians took office, the utility succeeded in rolling back solar policies. These same electric utilities have funded climate denial for decades. Now they’ve moved on to delay: more than half the country’s highest-emitting utilities are slow-walking their own plans to decarbonize over the next decade. Some major utilities have zero plan to reduce carbon emissions. When a private electric utility chooses to spend its guaranteed profits on denial or delay, the public cannot choose to stop buying its power. There is no exit from a monopoly. In the Ohio case, these utilities started their attacks on renewables in 2011. By 2014, the state had frozen its clean energy targets and made it nearly impossible to build wind energy. This latest change will erode what little policy is left. The law will eliminate clean energy targets and gut an energy efficiency program that has saved the state $5bn – instead cementing Ohio’s position at the bottom of national clean energy rankings. With only 2.5% of its electricity from renewable energy sources last year, the state is in 49th place. In a truly Orwellian doublespeak, Ohio’s latest policy is called the Clean Air Program. The lawmakers don’t even have the guts to call the law what it is – a coal plant subsidy – and instead refer to these dirty sources as “legacy assets”. Some advocates have focused on the parts of the bill that would subsidize nuclear, and the legislation’s small offerings for solar – both carbon-free sources of power. Yet the bill provides almost twice as much funding for coal as clean energy. This is all occurring as Ohio bakes in another heatwave. As farmers throughout the state struggle to plant crops under record rainfall and flooding. As poor communities surrounding these coal plants continue to breathe toxic air. The climate crisis is on Ohio’s doorstep. Yet the corporations running these ancient coal plants want to keep them operating until 2040, when they will be 85 years old. These plants are long past retirement age. The next time you feel that you are to blame for climate change – because you forgot to hit the light switch, or you took that flight to see your ailing mother – remember the Ohio electric utilities and their coal subsidies. Remember the politicians who gave them this billion-dollar bailout after receiving personal favors, like a flight to Trump’s inauguration on a corporate jet. And know that one day after signing this bill, Ohio Governor DeWine attended a Trump fundraiser hosted by coal baron Bob Murray. Fighting the climate crisis is not about purifying yourself. It’s about dismantling corporate power. Electric utilities are a great place to start.

"Most Britons believe climate change is more important in the long term than Brexit and say it should be a top priority for Boris Johnson’s government, according to an opinion poll. Women and young people are more likely to say that action over climate change is a more pressing priority than issues around Brexit.  The ComRes survey, commissioned by Christian Aid, found that 71% of the UK public agreed that climate change would be more important than the country’s departure from the EU in the long term. Six out of 10 adults said the government was not doing enough to prioritise the climate crisis. Two-thirds of those surveyed agreed that Johnson should put the issue at the top of his agenda. In his inaugural speech as prime minister outside No 10 on Wednesday, Johnson mentioned the environment briefly. He said Britain was “leading the world in the battery technology that will help cut CO2 and tackle climate change and produce green jobs for the next generation”. Laura Taylor, director of advocacy for Christian Aid, said: “As Prime Minister Boris Johnson gets his feet under the table at No 10, there are a large number of urgent priorities. However, it’s clear that beyond the present political turmoil, UK adults know there is a bigger crisis, which is potentially catastrophic for the whole of humanity – particularly some of the world’s poorest people, who are more vulnerable to the effects of this climate emergency.” She said she hoped Johnson would “hear the challenge from the majority of the UK public to do more to tackle this climate emergency”. The extreme heat in the UK this week demonstrated the urgency of action. “Extreme weather patterns … are even more exacerbated in other parts of the world, where droughts, floods and storms are wreaking havoc, costing lives and seeing millions of pounds of damage each year.” The poll also showed that church-going Christians were more likely than the general public to say the climate emergency should be a top priority of the government, at 77% compared with 66%. Taylor said: “It has been heartening to see church denominations and Christian groups in recent months declare a climate emergency.” • This article was amended on 5 August 2019. An earlier version said the Christian Aid poll asked what issue should be “the top priority” for the new prime minister, rather than “a top priority”. This has been corrected. The headline was also amended to clarify that respondents believed that the climate emergency was more important in the long-term than Brexit."

====================================
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) couple to solar activity: New studies find a time-lag of 3 years
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/ edited by P Gosselin)
In our book “The Neglected Sun” we describe how climate is driven significantly by ocean and solar cycles. The climate science establishment prefers to ignore all of this. But lately things have turned around, as a number of scientists have been researching the subject and are publishing on this almost on a weekly basis. It is indeed becoming increasingly clear that ocean cycles are in fact coupled to a certain extent with solar activity. An important paper on this was published in the Environmental Research Letters in May, 2015. A team of scientists led by M. B. Andrews of the Hadley Centre of the British Met Office examined the relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and solar activity cycles. It has long been known that the NAO swings to the positive mode when solar activity is strong. Conversely negative NAO values often fall when solar activity is weak. For more information of the NAO see Wikipedia here.
The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a climatic phenomenon in the North Atlantic Ocean of fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure at sea level between the Icelandic low and the Azores high. Through fluctuations in the strength of the Icelandic low and the Azores high, it controls the strength and direction of westerly winds and storm tracks across the North Atlantic. It is part of the Arctic oscillation, and varies over time with no particular periodicity. Unlike the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean, the NAO is a largely atmospheric mode. It is one of the most important manifestations of climate fluctuations in the North Atlantic and surrounding humid climates.
The North Atlantic Oscillation is closely related to the Arctic oscillation (AO) or Northern Annular Mode (NAM), but should not be confused with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).
Westerly winds blowing across the Atlantic bring moist air into Europe. In years when westerlies are strong, summers are cool, winters are mild and rain is frequent. If westerlies are suppressed, the temperature is more extreme in summer and winter leading to heat waves, deep freezes and reduced rainfall. A permanent low-pressure system over Iceland (the Icelandic Low) and a permanent high-pressure system over the Azores (the Azores High) control the direction and strength of westerly winds into Europe. The relative strengths and positions of these systems vary from year to year and this variation is known as the NAO. A large difference in the pressure at the two stations (a high index year, denoted NAO+) leads to increased westerlies and, consequently, cool summers and mild and wet winters in Central Europe and its Atlantic facade. In contrast, if the index is low (NAO-), westerlies are suppressed, northern European areas suffer cold dry winters and storms track southwards toward the Mediterranean Sea. This brings increased storm activity and rainfall to southern Europe and North Africa.”
Andrews and his colleagues tried to determine if there is an empirical NA/solar relation in a simulation model. In earlier attempts the models were unable to get a handle on magnitude of the effect. But this time around the scientists were more successful. They recognized that they had indeed overseen a 3-year time lag with which the NAO follows the sun. Andrews et al also see an indication that other processes play a role – other than the pure atmospheric warming, and the dynamic effects thereof, taken into account up to now. The paper’s abstract follows:

A simulated lagged response of the North Atlantic Oscillation to the solar cycle over the period 1960–2009
Numerous studies have suggested an impact of the 11 year solar cycle on the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with an increased tendency for positive (negative) NAO signals to occur at maxima (minima) of the solar cycle. Climate models have successfully reproduced this solar cycle modulation of the NAO, although the magnitude of the effect is often considerably weaker than implied by observations. A leading candidate for the mechanism of solar influence is via the impact of ultraviolet radiation variability on heating rates in the tropical upper stratosphere, and consequently on the meridional temperature gradient and zonal winds. Model simulations show a zonal mean wind anomaly that migrates polewards and downwards through wave–mean flow interaction. On reaching the troposphere this produces a response similar to the winter NAO. Recent analyses of observations have shown that solar cycle–NAO link becomes clearer approximately three years after solar maximum and minimum. Previous modelling studies have been unable to reproduce a lagged response of the observed magnitude. In this study, the impact of solar cycle on the NAO is investigated using an atmosphere–ocean coupled climate model. Simulations that include climate forcings are performed over the period 1960–2009 for two solar forcing scenarios: constant solar irradiance, and time-varying solar irradiance. We show that the model produces significant NAO responses peaking several years after extrema of the solar cycle, persisting even when the solar forcing becomes neutral. This confirms suggestions of a further component to the solar influence on the NAO beyond direct atmospheric heating and its dynamical response. Analysis of simulated upper ocean temperature anomalies confirms that the North Atlantic Ocean provides the memory of the solar forcing required to produce the lagged NAO response. These results have implications for improving skill in decadal predictions of the European and North American winter climate.”
Other modellers also took a closer look at the sun’s control over the North Atlantic Oscillation. In June, 2014, Lin et al. presented a situation of a Atlantic ocean cycle (AMOC) slowdown for the 1915-1935 period in the Climate of the Past Discussion. The authors saw the rise in solar activity after 1914 as a trigger and were able to show the effect in their simulation. The abstract: 
An abrupt slowdown of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation during 1915–1935 induced by solar forcing in a coupled GCM
In this study, we explore an abrupt change of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) apparent in the historical run simulated by the second version of the Flexible Global Ocean–Atmosphere–Land System model – Spectral Version 2 (FGOALS-s2). The abrupt change is noted during the period from 1915 to 1935, in which the maximal AMOC value is weakened beyond 6 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1). The abrupt signal first occurs at high latitudes (north of 46° N), then shifts gradually to middle latitudes (∼35° N) three to seven years later. The weakened AMOC can be explained in the following. The weak total solar irradiance (TIS) during early twentieth century decreases pole-to-equator temperature gradient in the upper stratosphere. The North polar vortex is weakened, which forces a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase during 1905–1914. The negative phase of NAO induces anomalous easterly winds in 50–70° N belts, which decrease the release of heat fluxes from ocean to atmosphere and induce surface warming over these regions. Through the surface ice–albedo feedback, the warming may lead to continuously melting sea ice in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, which results in freshwater accumulation. This can lead to salinity and density reductions and then an abrupt slowdown of AMOC. Moreover, due to increased TIS after 1914, the enhanced Atlantic northward ocean heat transport from low to high latitudes induces an abrupt warming of sea surface temperature or upper ocean temperature in mid–high latitudes, which can also weaken the AMOC. The abrupt change of AMOC also appears in the PiControl run, which is associated with the lasting negative NAO phases due to natural variability.
Another paper on the solar impact on North Atlantic cycles – especially the NAO – appeared in the journal Annales Geophysicae. Sfîcă and colleagues reported there in February 2015:
The influence of solar activity on action centres of atmospheric circulation in North Atlantic
We analyse the response of sea level pressure and mid-tropospheric (500 hPa) geopotential heights to variations in solar activity. We concentrate on the Northern Hemisphere and North Atlantic in the period 1948–2012. Composite and correlation analyses point to a strengthening of the North Atlantic Oscillation and weakening (i.e. becoming more zonal) of the Pacific/North American pattern. The locations of points with lowest and highest sea level pressure in the North Atlantic change their positions between low and high solar activity.
Let’s now move to the Pacific Ocean. Here find the “El Niño–Southern Oscillation” (ENSO) phenomenon. Daniel Howard, Nir Shaviv and Henrik Svensmark are now able to show that the global sea level fluctuations (excluding the long-term trend) is at least 70% controlled by the ENSO and solar activity fluctuations. This team of scientists published their results in May 2015 in the Journal of Geophysical Research:
The solar and Southern Oscillation components in the satellite altimetry data
With satellite altimetry data accumulating over the past two decades, the mean sea level (MSL) can now be measured to unprecedented accuracy. We search for physical processes which can explain the sea level variations and find that at least 70% of the variance in the annually smoothed detrended altimetry data can be explained as the combined effect of both the solar forcing and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The phase of the solar component can be used to derive the different steric and eustatic contributions. We find that the peak to peak radiative forcing associated with the solar cycle is 1.33 ± 0.34 W/m2, contributing a 4.4 ± 0.8 mm variation. The slow eustatic component (describing, for example, the cryosphere and large bodies of surface water) has a somewhat smaller peak to peak amplitude of 2.4 ± 0.6 mm. Its phase implies that warming the oceans increases the ocean water loss rate. Additional much smaller terms include a steric feedback term and a fast eustatic term. The ENSO contributes a peak to peak variation of 5.5 ± 0.8 mm, predominantly through a direct effect on the MSL and significantly less so indirectly through variations in the radiative forcing.”

"Labor leader Anthony Albanese has urged the Morrison government to avoid “playing politics” with drought funding, saying Labor would support “any level” of funding the Coalition names, as long as it doesn’t come at the expense of another portfolio. The government’s $5bn “future drought fund” was knocked back in the last parliament, after Labor announced it would not support any moves to take funds from the Building Australia Fund to pay for it.  At a drought forum in Dubbo, Scott Morrison said one of the first priorities for the government when parliament resumes next week would be to reintroduce, and pass the bill. “That drought fund needs to pass the parliament,” he said. “If Labor doesn’t support it, then, we will work with the crossbench as we did on income tax cuts, where they were opposed leading up to that vote, and we ensured they were able to be passed,” he said. Labor, under leader Bill Shorten, had previously labelled the money pool, designed to keep drought-stricken communities afloat while waiting on the rain, a “slush fund” which robbed communities of other vital funding. Albanese, speaking at the same forum, said Labor was prepared to support “any level of cash that the government believes should be injected into communities”, but not at the expense of other areas. “Our concern with the legislation that was introduced last time was that it took money from the Building Australia Fund, that is an essential component of Infrastructure Australia and the idea that we would depoliticise infrastructure funding in this country in order to fund drought funding,” he said. “I say to the government, don’t play politics with this. It is too important. Just stop it. Provide the funding, with appropriations, as you should. And we’ll back it. Any level you want, done. It can go through in an hour.” The statement was greeted with applause. Morrison also plans on moving forward with plans to make it an offence, punishable by up to 12 months imprisonment, for anyone who encourages or promotes trespassing on farms, or private land, either online or through publications. “There will be legislation to deal with ensuring that cowardly keyboard warriors who incite criminal behaviour of people invading farms, that they will be classed as criminals as well,” he said. “We expect support on that.” Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick told Sky News on Thursday his party would be voting for the additional trespass penalties. Fellow crossbench senator and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson is also in favour of the move, giving the government the support it needs to pass the bill even if Labor opposes it. .@ljayes: Will you support legislation to stop activists storming farms?@Senator_Patrick: We respect the right for people to protest but it’s not acceptable for people to march onto farms in great numbers intimidating people.MORE: https://t.co/aEpX9WQanB #firstedition pic.twitter.com/k23gvzDftP Labor will hold a shadow cabinet meeting on Monday where it will finalise its positions on the coming legislation. The latest Bureau of Meteorology drought update showed “significant decline” in autumn and winter rainfall, with much of south-eastern and south-western Australia experiencing the lowest rainfall in the past 20 years. Rainfall for the next three months is predicted to follow that trend, with the BoM anticipating a drier than average quarter for most of the nation. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I posted on how weather models have been forecasting a bitter cold mid March for much of Europe.
This has now been confirmed by Joe Bastardi at his latest Saturday Summary here beginning at about 3 minutes into the report.
Not only does the GFS show bitter cold for mid March taking hold across Europe but so does the European model. Joe states at 3:22:
Europe has been very cold the past several days and will continue to be cold. It’ll warm up and then turn very very cold there again.”
Powerful La Niña in the pipeline
But what was more interesting in yesterday’s Saturday Summary was the Scripps forecast for the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which currently projects a La Niña with a value of -2.64 to be reached by the end of the year, see 18:00 mark.

A value of -2.64 is pretty intense. Though Joe does not think the La Niña will get that extreme when all is said and done, it’s clear that a significant event is very likely looming. Joe says Scripps is forecasting a stronger La Niña then what the El Niño was.
I wonder if we are going to be hearing about that from the alarmist side.
The veteran Weatherbell Analytics meteorologist points out that over the past decade the global equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature has been on the cool side more often – a fact that bodes ill for those with bets placed on continued alarming global warming. Expect more data fudging alterations ahead.
Add to this intense La Niña the cooling North Atlantic and solar activity that is tapering off, and all the ingredients are there for inconvenient cooling over the next years.

"Greta Thunberg. This time last year she was unimaginable. Then, pretty much from nowhere, there she was: small and slight, a girl just turned 16, the way-too-young odd person out on a panel of adults sitting in front of the world’s economic powers at Davos last January. Unshowy and serious, careful, firm, she said it. Our house is on fire. The ancient Greeks had a word for this: parrhesiastes. It means a person who speaks truth to power: you should not be behaving in this way. Don’t. More specifically it suggests someone in whom directness of expression and access to truth coincide; and it means someone of very little power who’s risking everything – because they can’t not, there’s no option – to speak ethical truth to powers so entrenched that they’re close to tyrannical, because telling this truth is about moral law. “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular know exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue to make unimaginable amounts of money, and I think many of you here today,” she said to the World Economic Forum conference, “belong to that group of people.”  Thunberg is Swedish; she was born in 2003 and lives in Stockholm with her younger sister Beata, her mother, a singer, and her father, an actor. There’s a picture of the family somewhere online taken when she was much younger; her mother and father are smiling broad old-fashioned smiles at the camera – doing what you do when you have your photo taken. Both the children, only waist- and knee-high, regard the lens with utter seriousness and inquiry. At eight years old, Greta Thunberg heard about climate change. She wondered why no one was doing anything to stop it. At 11 she stopped speaking, in protest; now she sees that “selective mutism” as the first step to understanding the power and necessity of speaking at all. She was 15 when she began taking days off her education to sit in front of the Riksdag in Stockholm, declaring she’d do this till Sweden reduced carbon emissions in line with the Paris agreement. She gave out leaflets: “I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future.” She made a couple of speeches internationally that tapped into a profound unspoken understanding in young people; in just six months, nearly one and a half million children across the world were schoolstriking for action on climate change. Her Instagram post on these strikes reads: “Time is much shorter than we think. Failure means disaster. The grown-ups have failed us. And since most of them, including the press and the politicians, keep ignoring the situation, we must take action into our own hands. Starting today. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is needed. Please join in.” Earlier this month Opec declared Thunberg, and with her the other young climate activists, the “greatest threat” to the fossil fuel industry. Thunberg tweeted them her thanks. “Our biggest compliment yet.” Hers is a voice totally unlike the world’s usual power-cacophony: clean, simple, inclusive, the voice of someone refusing to beguile. She talks ethics to politics without flinching. She cuts through the media white noise and political rabble-rousing to get to the essentials. This is a communal voice and Thunberg is its lightning conductor, and no wonder: when you hear her speak or you read her speeches you know you’re in the presence of the opposite of cynicism – of a spirit, in fact, that rebuffs cynicism and knows that the way we act, every single one of us, has transformatory impact and consequence. “The real power belongs to the people.” This voice lets us know we’re in disavowal, and that we’d better wake up. Then it tells us, clear as anything, how to do this. Ali Smith Actor What can people reading this do today to make an impact?A great start is to inform yourself. To read and try to understand the problem. It is very depressing but absolutely necessary. Once you fully realise the situation then you will know what to do. And then spread that information to others. Then there are lots of things you can do in your everyday life. Going vegan, stop flying and have shop-stop for instance. Of course we need a system change. But I believe that you cannot have system change without individual change. In today’s debate climate, a lot of people will not listen to you unless you practise as you preach and live by example. And we need everyone to listen. So making some personal changes is very much worth it. Leader of the Labour party How will young people today have to live and work differently in the future because of climate change?In the global north the immediate differences may not be very striking. But we need to rapidly remove all fossil fuels from our everyday life and leave them in the ground. This is what most politicians do not seem to understand. Lowering emissions is not enough. In the global south, however, people already are very much affected. There is an ongoing catastrophe in many parts of the world. And this is already affecting hundreds of millions. There will of course be lots of benefits to changing to a green economy. But we must remember that this is above all an emergency – not primarily an opportunity to create new green economic growth. We need a whole new way of thinking. Actor and campaigner How can we most effectively and efficiently support you and your amazing work? (PS: Thank you for your efforts, you’re the most inspiring person.)Activism seems to be working. So I would encourage people to become activists. And if you have a big platform, then highlight the crisis and communicate the information. There will be general, global climate strikes on 20 and 27 September. We need everyone to participate in these. Even adults and unions and so on. And of course we do this every Friday. Everyone is welcome to join. Poet laureate Environmentally speaking, what has been humankind’s most catastrophic invention?I don’t think there is one singular worst invention. It is all of them combined with our current systems. But the idea that we can dig up astronomical amounts of fossilised, compressed biomass and burn it in the atmosphere without consequences is pretty catastrophic. And also the thought of eternal economic growth on a planet with limited resources. Model and campaigner Do you have any sense of what job you would like to do in future – would you be interested in going into politics, for example?I think I would like work where I feel most needed. I would love to study science but the scientific facts are already there. We now need to communicate those facts and then [take] political action. The politics of today don’t interest me much, however. It’s all about competing, and it’s more important how you say something – the way you say it – than the content of what you actually are saying. That has to change. Singer and songwriter Do you ever feel overwhelmed with the huge following you now have? (PS: You are such a remarkable person, and even though things are looking pretty dark, I do hope that you take some time to be proud of how many people you have engaged with your words. Well done!)Yes, of course. What has happened during the past few months is very hard to grasp. I would never have expected anything close to this. Labour MP for Tottenham Can you be politically conservative, ie on the political right, pro-growth, pro-capitalism and pro the for-profit motive, and still support the climate change movement and green issues?That is not for me to say. I am only communicating the scientific facts. This question is probably not possible to answer without personal opinion and I leave that to others. But I think we can safely say that all ideologies have failed. If some have failed more than others then that is for others to say. Comedian You are my new hero and you have really helped me to explain what is going on to my children. How do you keep so calm when people use personal attacks to try and undermine your work?I had expected that. If you don’t fully understand the ongoing climate breakdown, then what I and the other school strikers do must seem very strange… and since most people are not aware, this is unfortunately what I expected. And I don’t think I can do much about it. Even if I would constantly prove them wrong with facts and arguments, they would make up new things to attack the climate movement or me. But I think that as long as they go after me personally with insults and conspiracy theories then that is good. It proves that they don’t have any arguments. And that they see us as a threat because we are having an impact. Historian and author Do you think human beings are generally selfish and focused on their own needs, or do you believe human beings are naturally cooperative, empathetic and creative? Or something in between? And does your view of humanity determine your activism?I don’t believe humans are naturally evil. But under the wrong circumstances we can be very selfish and greedy, like now. People can be taught to be good, or bad. I think we all need help to focus on the right things to do. With more than 7 billion people on the planet, we need to cooperate. I don’t believe we are continuing to ruin the biosphere because we are evil. I am convinced we are doing it because we are not fully informed of the consequences of our actions. And this is very hopeful to me, because I believe that once we know we will change. This has a huge impact on my activism, because people are adaptable and the changes necessary are not impossible. Founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and UN messenger of peace The Jane Goodall Institute’s Roots & Shoots programme involves thousands of young people of all ages in roughly 60 countries. Hundreds of groups are working on projects in connection with the climate crisis. Do you think it is important that young people roll up their sleeves and take action in addition to marching? If so, what would you suggest?Yes, everything is needed. There are thousands of ways to take action. For example, plant trees, pick up litter, join an organisation or movement that makes a difference and especially try to influence adults and put pressure on people in power. I started my activism at home, changing my parents’ and relatives’ habits and ways of thinking. Do you have days when you feel “there’s no hope, we’re doomed”? If so, where do you get the motivation to keep fighting?Ali B Kord, Sydney, AustraliaYeah, you have no idea… But that’s not a reason to quit. We must never give up. I have made up my mind and decided to never, ever give up. I’ve worked in the environmental sector for the past five years. I have gone vegetarian, barely fly (and offset when I do), and cycle to work every day. The problem is I often find it impossible to make others understand the severity of the situation. Any tips on how to effectively persuade people?Craig Blyth-Moore, EdinburghI think a combination of activism works. If more and more people start behaving like we are in a crisis, more people will understand. People in poverty have little or no concept of climate change because they are busy just surviving. How do we reach the parts of society like this?Mike Jarrey, Ghent, BelgiumGood question. I think we must make them realise that climate-related issues are the key to other issues as well. Such as equality and social injustice and human rights. The climate issue offers a solid, science-supported black or white issue. The sooner other movements realise this, the better. You’ve called for a global general climate strike on 20 September. What do you think about the possibility of a continuous general strike and the impacts it could have on global business-as-usual?Thomas Kane, StockportWe children are calling for the adults to join us on 20 and 27 September. To have real impact we must get to the stage where we have continuous general strikes. That will have an enormous impact on business-as-usual. We must get there soon. It would open people’s eyes and put things in perspective. I’m 21 and I am facing a lot of ageism. I am discriminated against and invalidated because of my age. I’m told I don’t understand “how the world works”, and that my experiences don’t count. How do you push back against ageism and keep raising your voice?Gayane Aghabalyan, Yerevan, ArmeniaI don’t care about age. Nor do I care about those who do not accept the science. I don’t have as much experience, and therefore I listen more. But I also have the right to express my opinion, no matter my age. Also, being young is a great advantage since we see the world from a new perspective and we are not afraid to make radical changes.  As a biology teacher I support your actions because I view the planet from the perspective of ecology. I would like to draw your attention to two important graphs that can be seen online based on the present scientific evidence available. The first is human population growth v global warming and the second is human population growth v extinctions. Both have near perfect positive correlations. So do you think we have a responsibility to manage population growth to save the planet?Colin Pascoe, BathThe problem is not the people. It is what we do. But of course it is more difficult to live sustainably with more people on the planet. But these solutions can never be discussed on a personal level – it must be handled on a global level. If we are to control the number of people on Earth then I guess we must start with the high emitters. This debate would take decades and leave no space to solve other problems. It’s simply too big for us individuals. In my experience, the “we are too many people” argument is used as an excuse for not taking action ourselves. Whether we start controlling births or not, we need to get to zero emissions. How do we get the message across in countries like China and Russia, which do not have the open media that we have?John Telling, Tunbridge WellsWe do what we can do. I, for instance, can’t vote in China or Russia. Nor do I control media in China or Russia. I can only do what I can. And if enough people stand up for the climate and the environment, that will eventually spread to other countries. Perhaps even to China and Russia. We must focus on what we can do. Not what we can’t do. I am an old man without children. Why should I care about what happens to the planet after my death?Confundido, online, name not suppliedMaybe you believe in something? Like karma, faith? Or morality? Or just because it’s the right thing to do. How do you explain that, despite the findings of scientists and the alarming UN report, some people keep on denying or ignoring the climate crisis?mdivet, onlineI don’t believe so much in denial. I think either you don’t fully understand or you don’t accept the facts. This is because the facts just don’t fit your idea of how things are or should be. Your ideology or religion, for example. To accept the climate emergency is to admit that we have all failed, in a major way. And this is not an easy thing to do. Is it too late?ID0658798, onlineNo, most studies show that it is still possible within the laws of physics to avoid the worst scenarios. But it is not possible if we go on like today. And there is a possibility that there are positive feedbacks too, once we start to act. We don’t know. Is there one achievable issue we should prioritise?Kim Williams, BirminghamTo treat the crisis as a crisis. Because we can’t solve an emergency without treating it like one. We need to look at the full picture and do all that we can. • No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference by Greta Thunberg is published by Penguin (£2.99) • Ali Smith’s latest novel is Spring (Hamish Hamilton)"

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnce again it’s time to look at how the Solar Impulse 2 project is coming along.
Readers will recall that the Solar Impulse 2 plane was designed by a team of Europeans with the aim of making the first solar-powered “solo flight” around the world and thus show the world the endless possibilities of solar power. Unfortunately the only thing that has been “endless” is the trip itself (and the costs)!
Grounded in Hawaii
Recall that the Solar Impulse 2 plane began its journey from Abu Dhabi way back on March 9 (this year). Then some 200 days later it got stuck in Hawaii and hasn’t gone anywhere ever since due to massive technical problems, also read here and here.
So far instead of bringing attention to the technology’s potential, the project has only managed to show the glaring limitations of solar power technology. Earlier I noted that the plane needs the dimensions of a jumbo jet – just to carry the payload of a car.
Bailout
The Solar Impulse 2 has run into another huge problem, it is reported: money. But that problem has been resolved, at least for now, reports the Canadian CBC. It writes that the project has “raised the $27 million ($20 million US) it needs to finish the trip, co-founder and pilot Andre Borschberg said on Monday.”
Money maelstrom project: $170 million
Moreover the CBC reports on the project’s total budget since it began in 2004: “…some $227 million ($170 million US)”. 
My God. Imagine all the other real and pressing problems that could have been alleviated with that kind of money. This is just irresponsible and the project’ backers need to be told that: chemical maker Solvay, Swiss lift maker Schindler, power grid maker ABB and Swatch’s Omega brand, to name a few. It is arguably a sin to burn away that kind of money on what is clearly a debacle while hundreds of refugees are drowning in the Mediterranean. It’s frustrating to see such misplaced priorities and funds.

It is a fact that the Solar Impulse 2 has been a greenhouse gas nightmare involving the burning of tens of thousands of liters of fossil fuels because an entire support crew has had to fly along in a fossil fuel powered jet.
One year late!
The CBC writes that the plane is planned to fly on to Phoenix, New York, Morocco before finally coming full circle back to Abu Dhabi. The team “hopes” to start again in April, 2016, when “there’s enough sun” to recharge batteries.
At this rate, they could walk around the world almost just as fast.
Route unknown – depends on the weather!
Yet, they don’t even know where they will be flying next, and that it all depends on the weather. This is how wild the project has been. The CNC writes:
Vancouver, as well as San Francisco, Los Angeles or Phoenix are all candidates, Borschberg said. They also reckon on a U.S. Midwest pit-stop followed by New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport, before crossing to either Europe or North Africa and, finally, Abu Dhabi. He hopes a year’s delay will not undermine the message he aims to spread at the Paris climate talks.”
CBC writes that Borschberg is hoping that someday this type of travel be implemented “on a large scale“.
Boy, wouldn’t that be progress. Fly from Tokyo to L.A. – in just 6 months (if you’re lucky)!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online German flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) conducted an interview with Australian astrophysicist and Nobel Prize laureate Brian Schmidt, revealing that so far only 36 of 65 Nobel laureates attending the Lindau Nobel laureate conference have signed the so-called 2015 Mainau Declaration, a document urging world leaders to act quickly on climate change.
The FAZ interview bears the title: “The evidence that must not be distorted.”
In the interview conducted by Joachim Müller-Jung, Schmidt gives the impression that there is an almost universal consensus and certainty on the science, that the IPCC is 99% sure that humans have been responsible for the recent climate change.
When Schmidt is asked by the FAZ directly why he is so sure about the science, Schmidt says he relies on the models…”extremely complex models“, and adds that although they do not know whether things in the future will happen exactly as the IPCC says they will, Schmidt tells the FAZ “we can say that most of the model calculations lead to a serious change in the atmosphere that will be unacceptable. This change puts everything in doubt – it leads to perhaps the greatest crisis for mankind. […] I would say that we can be 99 percent certain that a dangerous and man-made climate change is taking place.”
Consensus? Only 56% signed

And it turns out that not many Nobel laureates are as sure as Schmidt. The FAZ asks why “just a bit over half” of the laureates attending the Lindau conference signed the document, i.e. only 35 of 66 Nobel laureates. Schmidt replies first by claiming that there is actually only one person who steadfastly refuses to sign (Ivar Giaever) and that:
Most of the others simply had to leave the conference earlier or had second thoughts about signing because it was beyond their expertise.”
When asked by the FAZ what would happen if it turned out they are all wrong, Schmidt answers: “Then I am the first to admit that I was wrong. But I am 99 percent sure that this will not happen.”
Here Schmidt may want to look at the comparison of the model projects and the real observed data (see IPCC chart above).
At the end Schmidt says that U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Royal Society President Paul Nurse played key roles in authoring the Mainau manifesto.

"It was the hottest day of the hottest month on record – at least until this sweltering summer. I remember it well, because on 19 July 2006, my family and I moved from London to Somerset to begin our new life here. The month began with what the cynics call “a typical English summer: two fine days followed by a thunderstorm”, and hailstorms across a swathe of the country, from Cornwall to Cumbria. By mid-month the rain had mostly gone, and on clear nights, parts of England experienced ground frost – as far south as the notoriously cold spot of Shawbury in Shropshire.  But the day we drove down the A303 to the West Country produced what was then a UK temperature record for July, the hottest since records began in 1914, when the mercury rose to 36.5C (almost 98F) at the Royal Horticultural Society garden in Wisley, Surrey. A few days later, central London was also suffering from the heatwave, with temperatures peaking at 34C. In the rest of July there were scattered thunderstorms, the inevitable result of the heat. Many places experienced their warmest ever July, with above average sunshine and below average rainfall. My abiding memory is of spraying my children with water from the garden hose to keep them cool."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIncreasingly alarmist climate scientists, media members and politicians are openly challenging democracy, saying the people-represented system needs to be done away if there is to be any hope of averting major climate damage.
Nico Stehr at the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung here describes the growing dissatisfaction not only among the Tea Party or the UKIP, but also among climate scientists and others. He writes:
Among climate scientists, climate policy-makers and the media one detects a growing impatience with the virtues of democracy when it comes to the robust findings on global warming.”
Stehr, who believes the planet is indeed headed for a climate catastrophe, writes that the lack of political action on the climate issues is increasingly being blamed on the ineffectiveness of democracy. For a growing number in the media, politics and science, democracies are no longer able to meet the climate challenges the world allegedly faces.
These democracy-hostile critics warn that should we continue on as usual, we will quickly run into a catastrophe that will even “put the survival of man at risk“. The underlying message is that democracy needs to be suspended if we are to save ourselves.
Stehr cites David Shearman and Joseph Wayne Smith in their book “The Climate Change Challenge and the Failure of Democracy“. Who write:
We need an authoritarian form of government that can implement the consensus of the science on greenhouse gas emissions.”

“Enemies of freedom”
Other names Stehr cites are James Hansen and Hans-Joachin Schellnhuber, But Stehr is wary of the approach and cites philosopher Friedrich Hayek who warned of the danger of becoming intoxicated by the belief that knowledge can allow the control of human activity, a trap academics often fall into. Hayek was not surprised that: “People who become intoxicated by the progress of knowledge, often become the enemies of freedom.”
For Stehr, it is no surprise today that in Paris “doubts over the functionality of democracy …are going hand-in-hand with the further escalation of apocalyptic consequences of climate change for humans.” Stehr finds it ironic that it has come down to:
Democracy can be rescued only by getting rid of democracy.”
Steyr writes that one major problem that the critics of democracy have is their deficit in understanding the role of science in society.
Under the climate catastrophe scenarios and solutions put out by alarmist climate scientists, there is no alternative to an authoritarian approach. If a slow moving democracy gets replaced by an authoritarian regime capable of implementing the “needed” measures, then naturally course will find itself under an autocracy. And should democracy indeed take the actions necessary to curb the alleged problem, then here too it will find itself under an autocracy. Ultimately the choice is between a consensual autocracy or a non consensual one. With alarmist climate science view, submission is the only option.
More democracy, not less, is the solution
Stehr ends of his commentary by stating he believes the solution is not to restrict democracy, but rather to expand it and “the global opportunity to have an impact, and to extend and multiply knowledge from individuals, groups and movements that deal with environmental problems.”

==========================================
German June Temperature Data – Statistical Analysis
By: The Indomitable Snowman
Recently, Pierre posted an article that included temperature data for the month of June in Germany. By inspection the sequential plot of the data appeared to show no long-term trend of any sort. However, more insight can be gained via quantitative statistical analysis.
Statistical Results
Using the tabulated data (graciously provided by Josef Kowatsch) for the sequential years 1930 – 2015 (86 data points in total), it is readily found that the mean value of the data set is 15.7, while the standard deviation is 1.20.
Trend Chart
Using the data points and the above information, it is a simple task to construct a “trend chart” – in which the data points are plotted, but with the inclusion of horizontal lines for the mean value, +/- one standard deviation, and +/- three standard deviations:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The trend chart clearly shows that the “system” is statistically well-behaved, with the points clustering close to the +/- one-standard-deviation band – indicating that there is no secular change in the underlying system over the time span, and that the variability about the mean can be solely attributed to statistical fluctuations. (It is also a well-known problem that when such a stable system is sequentially sampled, apparent-but-phantom “trends” will seem to appear; these can be seen in the plot, but they are not meaningful – they are artifacts of the sequential sampling.)
Histogram
The proper way to group the data in such a system is grouping by standard deviations – something that is best-presented in a simple histogram:

The center bar is the number of occurrences within one standard deviation of the mean, while the other bars (moving outward) show the number of occurrences from one to two standard deviations (plus and minus), etc. Even though the number of data points is relatively small for the emergence of complete statistical behavior (i.e., the system is undersampled), a Gaussian profile (expected of a system that has a stable mean and statistical fluctuations about that mean) is clearly discernable.
Further, simple Gaussian statistics would predict the following number of occurrences for a Gaussian system with 86 data points – 54 within one standard deviation of the mean, 30 between one and two standard deviations, and 2 beyond two standard deviations. The actual numbers from the data are 55, 28, and 3 – remarkably close to the simple Gaussian expectations, even though the system has been undersampled.
Conclusion
Statistical analysis of the data indicates that the system in question has been stable over the entirety of the sampling period (1930 – 2015) and is not changing. In particular, the system, even though undersampled, produces results that are in almost exact agreement with expected results for a system that is stable around a central mean – with the variability between individual samples being entirely attributable to simple statistical variability.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a video posted at Youtube showing how a wind turbine caught fire and self-destructed in a spectacular fashion. Certainly nothing you’d want to be close to as debris is seen flying over a large area.
Hat-tip Gerti at FB.

What’s interesting is that in the background we see there is also a second turbine on fire. The other turbines in the park are not even operating, even that the wind is blowing, which tells you just how useless these things are in helping developing countries get electrified and modern.
Most likely this was some feel-good project financed or even funded by the UN, World Bank or some renewable energy development and technology transfer fund of some type. This is what we get for the money.
One can only speculate on the root cause of the problem. In many third world or emerging countries, however, maintenance standards are often inadequate, and so such systems break down far more prematurely, thus making them even bigger money losers.

"The former boss of Unilever is seeking a team of “heroic chief executives” to drive a shift to a low-carbon, more inclusive way of doing business. Paul Polman, who stepped down from the Anglo-Dutch owner of Marmite and Dove in November last year after a decade at the helm, warns that the rise of populism and Brexit are symptoms of capitalism’s failure to adapt. Bosses, he insists, must commit to fighting inequality and tackling the climate emergency. “We are about to commit the biggest intergenerational crime in the history of mankind. We need to bring us together not drive us apart,” said the 63-year-old Dutchman, who won plaudits for pushing the benefits of sustainable business long before it became fashionable. “If you don’t address inequality and climate change, to keep it simple, a lot more people are going to be dissatisfied, feel not included or left behind, and making these choices of rejection at the ballot box. The fact we are having these issues of populism and schisms in society is exactly because we are not addressing the underlying issue to evolve capitalism and make sure it works for everybody,” he said.  He believes the starting point is “heroic chief executives willing to step up and move outside of the comfort zone and take personal risks. I tried to do the same with Unilever. It’s a matter of willpower.” Polman has backed his words with cash by investing in Imagine, a foundation to push the UN’s sustainable development goals. But he has several other projects on the go, including helping the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and François-Henri Pinault, the boss of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent owner Kering, to develop a fashion-industry deal to cut waste and carbon emissions that is set to be announced at the G7 meeting in Biarritz next month. Polman said the aim is to get a fifth of the industry on board. He his hoping that signatories including the Calvin Klein owner PVH, H&M and Inditex, the owner of Zara, will inspire others. Polman is also backing an initiative that adopts similar tactics to advance disability rights, Valuable 500. The campaign, which is aiming to recruit 500 chief executives of major companies who commit to putting disability on their board agenda this year, has just won the backing of seven major financial institutions, including the Bank of England, HSBC and Lloyds. The banks join existing signatories, including Barclays, Accenture, Microsoft, Virgin Media and Sainsbury’s. “We are trying to create tipping points on a sectorial level. The premise is that chief executives in the private sector need to drive major change in the absence of politicians doing it right now. Not exclusively but actively helping de-risk the political process,” Polman said. “Over the next 10 years more responsibility will be put on business to move faster to implement the [UN’s] sustainability goals simply because of financial flow that needs to happen that cannot come right now from government.” With only 100 companies responsible for 71% of carbon emissions , persuading a handful of these bosses to see the economic and moral benefit of changing their ways can create a race to the top, according to Polman. The boss who has publicly backed the young people behind Extinction Rebellion and is a fan of the teenage activist Greta Thunberg, said businesses that do not embrace issues of diversity, sustainability and equal rights will also struggle to attract talented young workers. “Millennials want to work for companies that stand for more than just making money.” Polman said he is no longer ridiculed for suggesting that tackling climate change makes business sense and that companies are also beginning to see that addressing equal rights is just as important. “We are now at a point in society where the cost of not acting in these areas is higher than acting. It is becoming mainstream. It comes down to humans, that’s the missing element,” Polman said. Caroline Casey, the founder of the Valuable 500 campaign, hopes that persuading key business leaders, such as Richard Branson, who has dyslexia, to be more open about their own disabilities and take action to make their companies more inclusive will demonstrate change is “good for business, good for people with disability and good for society in general”. She points out that there are about 13m people with disabilities in the UK who, together with their families, have a spending power of £249bn. However, businesses pay them far less attention than vegans, for example, who number less than one million. People with disabilities are also valuable employees who may be concealing non-obvious conditions such as autism, mental health problems or even blindness in the workplace. “There’s a cost to exclusion because we’re not releasing potential,” Casey said."
"Australia remains “deeply concerned” about China’s treatment of the Uighur people, including use of forced labour, the foreign affairs minister Marise Payne has said. On Monday Payne revealed that China had blocked Australia’s attempts to offer consular assistance to dual citizens and their families, and rejected China’s claims that concerned nations had rebuffed an offer to visit Xinjiang province.  Payne made the remarks to Radio National ahead of an ABC Four Corners investigation on treatment of Uighurs, which has prompted Cotton On and Target Australia to commit to investigate their supply chains because they reportedly source cotton from Xinjiang. Asked about the detention of more than a million Uighurs, Payne said Australia was “deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Xinjiang, including the use of detention facilities”. “Those concerns have been raised with China regularly including by me directly in my visit last year. “A letter was signed to the president of the Human Rights Council and the UN high commissioner for human rights a week or so ago – we were one of 22 signatories to that letter – and I think what that reflects is an increasing international focus on the developments in Xinjiang.” That letter, which called for an end to mass arbitrary detention, prompted a fierce backlash from China. It accused the signatories of having “wantonly criticised and smeared China in total disregard for the truth” and said that by “blatantly politicising the issue of human rights, they have grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs”. Asked about the cases of 10 Australian permanent residents allegedly detained, including a two-year-old Australian citizen, Payne confirmed Australia had sought information and offered consular assistance to Uighurs but had not had access to the boy. “We do request consular access when we are notified of such a detention … it’s very important to note there are complex family arrangements around family members who are in Xinjiang. “But if they’re not Australian citizens we don’t have an entitlement to consular access, [and] China doesn’t allow consular access to dual nationals unless they’ve actually entered China on their Australian passports, so that does add to the complexity.” Asked if China’s claims officials from the 22 signatory countries had declined an invitation to visit, Payne replied: “I don’t understand that to be the case. “We have sought diplomatic visits in the past … and those requests, as far as I’m aware, have not been granted.” Payne committed to continue to seek access to Xinjiang and “press our concerns” through the Human Rights Council and directly with China. Payne was also asked about comments by Australia’s defence force chief, Angus Campbell, reported in the Australian Financial Review, that China could take advantage of climate change to occupy abandoned islands in the Pacific. While not naming China, Campbell reportedly told a forum on climate change and national security in June that the potential for territorial expansion could be opened up if smaller islands were abandoned as a result of rising sea levels. “If other states see the opportunity to occupy uninhabited spaces then it could introduce new tension into our region,” he reportedly said. In response, Payne noted at the Pacific Islands Forum in 2018 Australia had signed the Boe Declaration, which she said “identifies climate change clearly as a key security issue”. “We are very focused on our engagement on climate in the region,” she said. Payne said Australia’s infrastructure financing facility in the Pacific would help climate adaptation and resilience through investments in energy, transport, communications and water."
"For a week this September, dozens of news organizations in the US and around the world will join forces to devote their front pages and air time to a critical but under-covered story: the global climate emergency. This unique media collaboration, timed to coincide with landmark UN Climate Action Summit in New York, is the first initiative of Covering Climate Now, a project co-founded by The Nation and the Columbia Journalism Review, in partnership with The Guardian, which aims to kickstart a conversation among journalists about how news outlets can improve their coverage of the climate crisis.  The project, which is still welcoming additional media partners, includes more than 250 newsrooms, representing every corner of the media landscape, all of whom have pledged to dedicate resources to climate coverage for the week starting 16 September and leading up to the UN Summit on 23 September. The partners include major TV networks (CBS News) , digital players (HuffPost, Vox, the Intercept, Slate), local newspapers (the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Minneapolis Star Tribune),  public radio programs (Marketplace, The World) and many others. Covering Climate Now launched in May at an event at Columbia Journalism School with dozens of newsroom leaders, including the legendary TV journalist Bill Moyers, who delivered the keynote. At the time, the co-founders of Covering Climate Now, Mark Hertsgaard of the Nation and Kyle Pope, editor-in-chief of Columbia Journalism Review, wrote an impassioned oped calling for change in how the media covers the climate crisis. “At a time when civilization is accelerating toward disaster, climate silence continues to reign across the bulk of the US news media,” Hertsgaard and Pope wrote. “Especially on television, where most Americans still get their news, the brutal demands of ratings and money work against adequate coverage of the biggest story of our time.” Partners in the September week of coverage will make their own editorial decisions about what stories to feature. All that’s required is for each outlet to make a good faith effort to increase the amount and the visibility of its climate coverage – to make it clear to their audiences that climate change is not just one more story but the overriding story of our time. The point is to give the climate story the attention and prominence that scientists have long said it demands so that the public and policymakers can make wise choices. You can read more about the initiative here."
"Record temperatures across much of the world over the past two weeks could make July the hottest month ever measured on Earth, according to climate scientists. The past fortnight has seen freak heat in the Canadian Arctic, crippling droughts in Chennai and Harare and forest fires that forced thousands of holidaymakers to abandon campsites in southern France and prompted the air force in Indonesia to fly cloud-busting missions in the hope of inducing rain. If the trends of the first half of this month continue, it will beat the previous record from July 2017 by about 0.025C, according to calculations by Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, and others. This follows the warmest-ever June, which was confirmed this week by data from the US space agency Nasa, following Europe’s Copernicus satellite monitoring system. In response to the new numbers, Michael Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, tweeted: “This is significant. But stay tuned for July numbers. July is the warmest month of the year globally. If this July turns out to be the warmest July (it has a good shot at it), it will be the warmest month we have measured on Earth.” The scientists stressed that this outcome is uncertain because conditions could change in the second half of the month, but it underscores a broader pattern of steadily rising temperatures caused by increasing emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants, deforestation, cars, planes and other sources. Mann estimated the chance of a new record this month at about 50%. In the longer term, he said records would continually be broken. “We have shown in recent work that the record warm streaks we’ve seen in recent years cannot be explained without accounting for human-caused planetary warming. Those warm streaks are certain to not only continue but to worsen if we continue to burn fossil fuels and warm the planet.” Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Data from the first six months of this year indicates this year has a 99.9% chance of entering the top five, according to Gavin Schmidt. “It is clear that 2019 is shaping up to be a top-five year – but depending on what happens it could be second, third or fourth warmest. The warmest year was 2016, which started with a big El Niño, which we didn’t have this year, so a record year is not particularly likely,” he said. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change. Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America. When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage. Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK, it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather. Of the many recent temperature anomalies, perhaps the most remarkable was in the Canadian Arctic community of Alert, Nunavut, which hit a record 21C on 14 July, although temperatures at this time of year are usually just a few degrees above freezing. Last month, France shattered its previous heat record during a heatwave across much of Europe that was made at least five times – and possibly hundreds of times – more likely by human-driven climate disruption, according to scientists. Political leaders have failed to halt the rise in emissions that is behind global heating. On Tuesday, the UK environment secretary, Michael Gove, warned that time was running out to prevent a breakdown of the climate and natural life support systems. “These twin challenges of biodiversity and climate change are massive and urgent and interrelated. The action taken so far hasn’t been sufficient, but late as it may be, there is still time,” he warned. “The scale of action required may be daunting, but the need to act is imperative.” The UK has avoided most of the extreme heat seen in Europe in elsewhere in recent weeks. The average temperature in the first two weeks of July was 15.1C, which equals the July average, though Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office’s National Climate Information Centre, said there might be a modest rise because the second half of the month is usually marginally warmer than the first. Concerns about rising temperatures and their impact on health are growing. On Tuesday, the Red Cross launched a new Heatwave Guide to help urban planners and city authorities reduce the risks, which are particularly great for the elderly, very young children, pregnant women and people who are socially isolated. “Heatwaves are one of the deadliest natural hazards facing humanity and the threat they pose will only become more serious and more widespread as the climate crisis continues,” said Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Previous heatwaves have killed tens of thousands of people, including 2,500 in India in 2015 and 70,000 in Europe in 2003, according to the Red Cross."
"The British government has spent £680m of its foreign aid budget on fossil fuel projects since 2010, according to analysis that highlights the UK’s failure to align diplomatic, trade and aid policies with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Britain allocated more overseas development cash to oil and gas in the two years after signing the 2015 agreement than it had in the previous five, according to the study commissioned by the Catholic development agency Cafod and carried out by the Overseas Development Institute.  Although the UK also increased support for renewables, Cafod said the continued support for carbon-intensive energy in middle-income countries was diverting resources that should be used to help poor communities gain access to electricity from wind and solar power. “The UK wants to be a leader on climate change, so it’s shocking that UK aid money is still being spent on fossil fuels overseas,” said Sarah Wykes, Cafod’s lead analyst on climate change and energy. “At a time when we are reducing the UK’s own reliance on fossil fuels, why are we spending billions of pounds saddling poorer nations with outdated technologies that will cause more climate damage? The whole point of development aid is to improve the lives of people living in poverty. The government needs to align its aid spending with its climate goals and urgently commit to ending all new aid for fossil fuels.” In recent months the UK parliament has declared a climate emergency and the government has announced plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Next year it is expected Britain will host a United Nations climate summit, where nations will try to draw up more ambitious plans to limit further global heating. But the Cafod study shows these efforts are not reflected in the government’s development policies. From 2010-17 the UK provided £7.8bn in financial support to foreign energy projects through a mixture of overseas development assistance, export credit guarantees and other official funding flows. The report says 60% of this total went on fossil fuels. Most of this came in the form of export credit guarantees by UK Export Finance. An earlier analysis by DeSmog UK, an investigative environmental journalism outlet, found an elevenfold increase in UK Export Finance support for overseas fossil fuel projects last year, including oil and gas operations in Oman, Kuwait and Brazil. The Department for International Development stressed that it has provided 17 million people with access to clean energy, but recognised the need to shift further from fossil fuels. “We need to do more if we are going to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate,” a government spokesman said. “As the prime minister announced at the G20 last month, in future we will look for the greenest way to deliver UK aid. Developing countries will be hardest hit by climate change. We cannot eradicate poverty without also protecting the environment.”"

Of course it wouldn’t be long before his flock lost their faith and disappeared.

Recently released MRC report concludes that celebrities who preach green lifestyles live lavish, energy-intensive lives. Photo: MRC.
A similar situation is playing out today when it comes to “climate protection” preaching celebrities and prominent personalities as they demand people scale back their lifestyles and accept Spartan living. All the while these same celebrities enjoy rich and lavish lifestyles in huge mansions, private jets and yachts.
The MRC.org here has released a 28-page report on environmental hypocrites who don’t follow what they preach. At the top of the list we find Leonardo DiCaprio, James Cameron and Al Gore – all of whom boast a net worth of well over a 100 million and frequently use private jets to travel all over the world.
The report features 12 celebrities, and it states there are many more and that they are in good company.

Moreover a  2014 study by the British government found that people who claim to worry about climate change use more electricity than those who do not. Wouldn’t you think that after preaching energy savings for over 25 years, these people would by no be among the most energy frugal by now? They aren’t. The MRC adds:
At the 2014 UN Climate Summit, the speakers alone (not the attendees or notable guests for the summit) traveled a grand total of 1,036,537 miles from locations as distant as China, India and Peru. That’s enough miles to circle the equator 41.6 times. […]
Hollywood has many more climate change alarmist hypocrites who weren’t included in this report. Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, commuted more than 300 miles to work by jet, multiple times a week. Paul McCartney once had his Lexus hybrid car flown from Japan to the UK, which The Huffington Post admitted caused its ‘transport footprint’ to be “over 100 times greater than it should have been.” Not only did Live Earth Concert star Madonna fly all over the world to promote her career, The Daily Mail (UK) reported that she owned “a collection of fuel-guzzling cars, including a Mercedes Maybach, two Range Rovers, Audi A8s and a Mini Cooper S.
Trudie Styler, the wife of Sting, even admitted in 2008 that the couple were climate change hypocrites. According to The Daily Mail (UK), ‘[e]nvironmental experts labelled Sting’s band, The Police, the dirtiest in the world because of the amount of pollution created during last year’s reunion tour of the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, the UK, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan.’
The media’s, and particularly the broadcast networks’, lack of coverage of this hypocrisy is inexcusable. The Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics states that journalists need to ‘Provide context. Take special care not to misrepresent or oversimplify in promoting, previewing or summarizing a story.’ Yet, in covering for these celebrities, the media broke this rule in order to promote a liberal, climate change alarmist agenda.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientific Consensus: “Efforts to curtail world temps will almost surely fail”
By Kenneth Richard
Already this year there are 6 peer-reviewed papers examining efforts to curtail CO2 emissions through the use renewable energies. They all conclude that the effort won’t be successful. Given the trillions already committed and at risk of being totally wasted, one has to seriously question the wisdom of the effort.
In fact, some think the renewable energy effort could make things even worse.
What follows are 6 scientific publications from this year alone that tell us the climate protection efforts are not working.
1. Jones and Warner, 2016
“Here we quantify the changes in the global energy mix necessary to address population and climate change under two energy-use scenarios, finding that renewable energy production (9% in 2014) must comprise 87–94% of global energy consumption by 2100. Our study suggests >50% renewable energy needs to occur by 2028 in a <2 °C warming scenario”
Press release here.
“Efforts to curtail world temps will almost surely fail”
The Texas A&M researchers modelled the projected growth in global population and per capita energy consumption, as well as the size of known reserves of oil, coal and natural gas, and greenhouse gas emissions to determine just how difficult it will be to achieve the less-than-2 degree Celsius warming goal.  “It would require rates of change in our energy infrastructure and energy mix that have never happened in world history and that are extremely unlikely to be achieved,” explains Jones.   “Just considering wind power, we found that it would take an annual installation of 485,000 5-megawatt wind turbines by 2028. The equivalent of about 13,000 were installed in 2015. That’s a 37-fold increase in the annual installation rate in only 13 years to achieve just the wind power goal,” adds Jones.  Similar expansion rates are needed for other renewable energy sources.  “To even come close to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, 50 percent of our energy will need to come from renewable sources by 2028, and today it is only 9 percent, including hydropower. For a world that wants to fight climate change, the numbers just don’t add up to do it.”

2. Lomborg, 2016
“All climate policies by the US, China, the EU and the rest of the world, implemented from the early 2000s to 2030 and sustained through the century will likely reduce global temperature rise about 0.17°C in 2100. These impact estimates are robust to different calibrations of climate sensitivity, carbon cycling and different climate scenarios. Current climate policy promises will do little to stabilize the climate and their impact will be undetectable for many decades.”

3. Moriarty and Honnery, 2016
Highlights: “We argue it is unlikely that RE [renewable energy] can meet existing global energy use.
Fossil fuels face resource depletion, supply security, and climate change problems; renewable energy (RE) may offer the best prospects for their long-term replacement. However, RE sources differ in many important ways from fossil fuels, particularly in that they are energy flows rather than stocks. The most important RE sources, wind and solar energy, are also intermittent, necessitating major energy storage as these sources increase their share of total energy supply. We show that estimates for the technical potential of RE vary by two orders of magnitude, and argue that values at the lower end of the range must be seriously considered, both because their energy return on energy invested falls, and environmental costs rise, with cumulative output. Finally, most future RE output will be electric, necessitating radical reconfiguration of existing grids to function with intermittent RE.”

4. Ferroni and Hopkirk, 2016  
Abstract: “Many people believe renewable energy sources to be capable of substituting fossil or nuclear energy. However there exist very few scientifically sound studies, which apply due diligence to substantiating this impression. In the present paper, the case of photovoltaic power sources in regions of moderate insolation is analysed critically by using the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (ERoEI, also called EROI). But the methodology for calculating the ERoEI differs greatly from author-to-author. The main differences between solar PV Systems are between the current ERoEI and what is called the extended ERoEI (ERoEI EXT). The current methodology recommended by the International Energy Agency is not strictly applicable for comparing photovoltaic (PV) power generation with other systems. The main reasons are due to the fact that on one hand, solar electricity is very material-intensive, labour-intensive and capital-intensive and on the other hand the solar radiation exhibits a rather low power density.”
Conclusion: “[A]n electrical supply system based on today’s PV technologies cannot be termed an energy source, but rather a non-sustainable energy sink. … [I]t has become clear that photovoltaic energy at least will not help in any way to replace the fossil fuel.”

5. Bannaga, 2016
“It is evident that UN efforts to combat climate change are not effective because past experience shows that CO2 generation cuts weren’t near enough. The recent Paris Agreement may restore a faith in UN process if implemented but doesn’t reduce temperatures as needed unless all drivers of climate variability are considered, particularly the abortive role of developing cities. The UN Programme appears to be focusing on attaining urban resilience rather than targeting grassroots causes. Urbane-bias global policies drive the rural population to leave their land and flood cities while over-usage of natural resources by the rich is left unchecked.”

6. Kelly, 2016
“The growth of the ecological footprint of a human population about to increase from 7B now to 9B in 2050 raises serious concerns about how to live both more efficiently and with less permanent impacts on the finite world. One present focus is the future of our climate, where the level of concern has prompted actions across the world in mitigation of the emissions of CO2. An examination of successful and failed introductions of technology over the last 200 years generates several lessons that should be kept in mind as we proceed to 80% decarbonize the world economy by 2050. I will argue that all the actions taken together until now to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide will not achieve a serious reduction, and in some cases, they will actually make matters worse. In practice, the scaleand the different specific engineering challenges of the decarbonization project are without precedent in human history. This means that any new technology introductions need to be able to meet the huge implied capabilities. An altogether more sophisticated public debate is urgently needed on appropriate actions that (i) considers the full range of threats to humanity, and (ii) weighs more carefully both the upsides and downsides of taking any action, and of not taking that action.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterMartin Greive and Daniel Wetzel at Germany’s center-right national daily Die Welt have a commentary on renewable energy, telling readers that it will hit the poor in Germany the hardest.
They write that the Energiewende (transition to renewable energy) will result in 540 euros in extra costs for each German household in 2016.
And things are going to get much worse, they warn, adding:
Economic experts believe that extra costs will be 100 billion euros over the next ten years.”
The figures were calculated by the Cologne-based Institute of German Economy (IW Cologne). The costs stem from the 6.35 cents/kwhr feed-in surcharge consumers are forced to pay for green energy, power grid costs, and other charges. Greive and Wetzel also write that the long technical delays dogging North Sea wind parks is causing additional costs for consumers to the tune of 17 euros.

The flagship daily quotes IW Cologne energy expert Esther Chrischilles, who points out that the costs are especially hitting the poor:
Most of the costs a politically dubious with respect to wealth redistribution.”
The Die Welt journalists write that in total the added costs will amount to 100 billion euros for companies and private households over the next ten years, according to Eric Schweitzer, President of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry DIHK).
Michael Fuchs of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat Union (CDU) party says, “I ask myself how consumers are supposed to handle this.”
German Vice Chancellor and Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel is coming under increasing fire for failing to get the electricity costs under control and failing to reform Germany’s crushing EEG feed-in act.

"As viral stunts go, getting the weather onside for your collaboration with the world’s most famous environmental activist is quite the coup. But, unlike newsagents hawking two-for-one lollies and tabloid front pages extolling fun in the sun, the 1975 and Greta Thunberg aren’t pretending there’s any silver lining to this heatwave.  “Unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don’t stand a chance,” says Thunberg on the track (confusingly, also called The 1975), a rallying cry for action on the climate crisis.  Over on Twitter, the band’s frontman, Matt Healy, has pointed out that “Steves” and “Marys” identifying themselves as “Brexiteers” have been united in their dismissal of the track. The BBC has helpfully stated that the band will more than likely take international flights to complete their upcoming tour dates, “despite air travel being a significant contributor to climate change”. (Manager Jamie Oborne told the Guardian that they couldn’t fix touring overnight, but that it was no reason not to act.) Sure, an ambient, spoken-word song is probably not going to do much about the “overall failures of our current systems” that Thunberg speaks of. But what it does is to intelligently weaponise the “current systems” within which the 1975 exist. They may not be the world’s most commercially successful band, but – with their stylish aesthetic, unfiltered intimacy with fans and success with a post-genre mix of everything from soft rock to emo – they are one of the most mimicked, and so Thunberg’s message could spread far beyond their network. Spotify’s recommendation algorithms work by assigning thousands of intricate data points to every song, then using that data to link a track you already like, to another one you haven’t heard but would probably like as well. So, it’s easily a short leap from, say, shameless 1975 imitators Catfish and the Bottlemen to the extremely 1975-aping tracks on the new Kaiser Chiefs album to the actual band’s five-minute speech about the imperative to act on the climate emergency. Songs can’t change the world, but they can change minds. Teaming up with Thunberg is also a canny subversion of the music industry’s obsession with “features”, where artists combine star power to sweep up maximum streams and radio playlisting (especially in the US, where radio tends to be segregated by genre). See: the latest albums by Ed Sheeran, Mark Ronson and DJ Khaled, and the charts, where such tracks make up half of the current UK Top 40. The 1975 have never done a feature before, and have criticised it as a shameless grab for chart positions. That they made an exception to centre Thunberg’s vital message shows them using their platform to amplify women’s voices (something they did earlier this year when Healy read, well, something I wrote about misogyny in music at the Brits) instead of coining it in themselves. They are not just ceding the floor: the band and Thunberg’s proceeds from the track are going to Extinction Rebellion. Track features are always timely, and often fleeting things, striking while a trend or artist is hot. And Thunberg is nothing if not the voice of our time. But her track with the 1975 will ultimately open their forthcoming album, Notes on a Conditional Form – an album that, going by their last few, may end up being considered one of the defining records of the 21st century, outlasting this moment. In years to come, their collaboration may stand as a bellwether: will our offspring’s offspring be dumpster diving for old vinyl with which to construct shelter from the sun, or will they live in a world where they can listen back to it and feel relieved that we made it after all?"

By Kenneth Richard
According to a just-published (2016)  Nature scientific paper, large portions of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) are significantly melting from below due to massive geothermal heat flux forcing. A natural explanation for ice sheet loss is not consistent with the paradigm that says the melting of the GIS is largely due to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

Brand new paper at Nature:
Melting at the base of the Greenland ice sheet explained by Iceland hotspot history
Ice-penetrating radar and ice core drilling have shown that large parts of the north-central Greenland ice sheet are melting from below. It has been argued that basal ice melt is due to the anomalously high geothermal flux that has also influenced the development of the longest ice stream in Greenland. Here we estimate the geothermal flux beneath the Greenland ice sheet and identify a 1,200-km-long and 400-km-wide geothermal anomaly beneath the thick ice cover. We suggest that this anomaly explains the observed melting of the ice sheet’s base, which drives the vigorous subglacial hydrology and controls the position of the head of the enigmatic 750-km-long northeastern Greenland ice stream. Our combined analysis of independent seismic, gravity and tectonic data, implies that the geothermal anomaly, which crosses Greenland from west to east, was formed by Greenland’s passage over the Iceland mantle plume between roughly 80 and 35 million years ago. We conclude that the complexity of the present-day subglacial hydrology and dynamic features of the north-central Greenland ice sheet originated in tectonic events that pre-date the onset of glaciation in Greenland by many tens of millions of years.”
Below are four older scientific papers also indicating that the source of the rapid melt water production in northern and central Greenland is significantly related to high geothermal heat origins:

1. High Geothermal Heat Flow, Basal Melt, and the Origin of Rapid Ice Flow in Central Greenland
Age-depth relations from internal layering reveal a large region of rapid basal melting in Greenland. Melt is localized at the onset of rapid ice flow in the large ice stream that drains north off the summit dome and other areas in the northeast quadrant of the ice sheet. Locally, high melt rates indicate geothermal fluxes 15 to 30 times continental background. The southern limit of melt coincides with magnetic anomalies and topography that suggest a volcanic origin.”
2. Subglacial topography and geothermal heat flux: Potential interactions with drainage of the Greenland ice sheet
Introduction: [T]here is a growing body of evidence suggesting more extensive basal melting in the central region of northern Greenland.  Fahnestock et al. [2001a] determined age-depth relationships and basal melt rate from ice-penetrating radar in northern Greenland and detected high basal melt, in places up to 0.2 m/yr, under the onset region of the Northeast Ice Stream and its southern tributaries. This basal melt requires a geothermal heat flux much greater than the estimated continental background of 57 mW/m2  [Sclater et al., 1980],and Fahnestock et al., [2001a]  speculate that the inferred large heat flow may be of volcanic origin. Similarly, at the base of the NGRIP deep ice core, drilled on the ice divide 170 km northwest of the onset region of the Northeast Ice Stream, the observed basal temperature is at the pressure-melting point [Anderson et al., 2004; Dahl-Jensen et al., 2003]. The basal melt rate at NGRIP reaches 7.5 mm ice per year, and the modeled geothermal heat flux is between 90 and 160 mW/m2 along the flow line originating 50 km upstream of the drill site [Dahl-Jensen et al., 2003].  Again, the origin of the large geothermal heat flux remains unidentified. Ice-penetrating radar profiles show bright bed reflections in many locations in northern Greenland, indicating the presence of lubricating meltwater at the glacier base.”
3. Estimating the basal melt rate at NorthGRIP using a Monte Carlo technique
From radio-echo sounding (RES) surveys and ice core data it can be seen that the ice sheet is melting at the base in a large area in Northern Greenland. The RES images reveal internal layers in the ice. The layers are former deposition surfaces and are thus isochrones. Undulations of the isochrones in regions where the base is smooth suggest that the basal melt rate changes over short distances. This indicates that the geothermal heat flux is very high and has large spatial variability in Northern Greenland.… Combining the estimated basal melt rates with the observed borehole temperatures allows us to convert the basal melt rates to geothermal heat flow values. From the two-dimensional model we find the basal melt rate and geothermal heat flux at NorthGRIP to be 6.1 mm a−1 and 129 mW m−2, respectively.”
4. Basal melt at NorthGRIP modeled from borehole, ice-core and radio-echo sounder observations
From temperature measurements down through the 3001 m deep borehole at the North Greenland Icecore Project (NorthGRIP) drill site, it is now clear that the ice at the base, 3080 m below the surface, is at the pressure-melting point. This is supported by the measurements on the ice core where the annual-layer thicknesses show there is bottom melting at the site and upstream from the borehole. … The results show the geothermal heat flow varies from 50 to 200 mW m-2 along the 100 km section of the modeled flowline. The melt rate at the NorthGRIP site is 0.75 cm a-1, but the deep ice in the NorthGRIP core originated 50 km upstream and has experienced melt rates as high as 1.1 cm a-1.”

More Land Area Above Sea Level Now Than During 1980s

Image from  Mörner, 2017

A year ago, several geologists (Kench et al., 2015) published a paper in the journal Geology that revealed a curious phenomenon occurring along island coasts in the tropical Pacific.  Despite some of the highest rates of sea level rise in the world in this region (over 5 mm/yr  on average since the 1950s), the total land area for these islands has not only not shrunk while sea levels were rapidly rising, the coastal land area has expanded — by a net +7.3% — over the last 118 years.

Kench et al., 2015
“The geological stability and existence of low-lying atoll nations is threatened by sea-level rise and climate change. Funafuti Atoll, in the tropical Pacific Ocean, has experienced some of the highest rates of sea-level rise (∼5.1 ± 0.7 mm/yr), totaling ∼0.30 ± 0.04 m over the past 60 yr. We analyzed six time slices of shoreline position over the past 118 yr at 29 islands of Funafuti Atoll to determine their physical response to recent sea-level rise. Despite the magnitude of this rise, no islands have been lost, the majority have enlarged, and there has been a 7.3% increase in net island area over the past century (A.D. 1897–2013). “

Then, a few days ago, 6 scientists (Donchyts et al., 2016) published a paper online for the journal Nature confirming that the curious phenomenon in the tropical Pacific — coastal land growth exceeding recent sea level rise — has also been occurring across the world, or on a net global scale, since the mid-1980s.

Donchyts et al., 2016
Earth’s surface water change over the past 30 years [1985-2015]
“Earth’s surface gained 115,000 km2 of water and 173,000 km2 of land over the past 30 years, including 20,135 km2 of water and 33,700 km2 of land in coastal areas.”

The succinct translation is that sea levels aren’t rising fast enough to offset land area expansion.  The world’s sea coasts are growing, not shrinking.

Scientists Surprised?

Interestingly, in the BBC press release for their Nature paper, the Donchyts et al. scientists expressed surprise (“the most surprising thing”)  that coastal land growth has offset the recent sea level rise, and admitted that their findings ran contrary to expectations.

BBC  (press release)
Coastal areas were also analysed, and to the scientists’ surprise, coastlines had gained more land – 33,700 sq km (13,000 sq miles) – than they had been lost to water (20,100 sq km or 7,800 sq miles).
“We expected that the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise, but the most surprising thing is that the coasts are growing all over the world,” said Dr Baart.  “We’re were able to create more land than sea level rise was taking.”
The researchers said Dubai’s coast had been significantly extended, with the creation of new islands to house luxury resorts.
“China has also reconstructed their whole coast from the Yellow Sea all the way down to Hong Kong,” said Dr Baart.

Shoreline Changes Are Not Primarily Determined by Climate

It’s a little puzzling that scientists should be surprised that the Earth’s coasts aren’t shrinking.  After all, relative sea level changes are not the predominant determinative factor affecting the growth or recession of land area.  Coastal erosion and accretion, tectonic uplift and subsidence…are far more influential.
Along the coasts of Alaska, for example, the land surface has been rapidly rising (uplift) for many decades.  Consequently, relative sea levels are falling in this region at a rate of -5 to -10 mm/yr (-2 to -4 inches per decade) according to NOAA tide gauges.

Along the U.S. Gulf Coast, on the other hand, the land surface has been on a long-term sinking (subsidence) trend.  Consequently, relative sea levels are rising at rates of +5 to +10 mm/yr (+2 to +4 inches per decade) according to NOAA tide gauges.

Obviously, these regional sea level trends are only very minimally — if at all —  connected to climate-related sea level changes — or, for that matter, anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
As Testut et al. (2016) have concluded, “sea level rise is not the primary factor controlling shoreline changes.”  It’s the “non-climate” factors that predominantly determine relative sea level changes over time.

Testut et al., 2016
“We show that Grande Glorieuse Island has increased in area by 7.5 ha between 1989 and 2003, predominantly as a result of shoreline accretion [growth]: accretion occurred over 47% of shoreline length, whereas 26% was stable and 28% was eroded. Topographic transects and field observations show that the accretion is due to sediment transfer from the reef outer slopes to the reef flat and then to the beach. This accretion occurred in a context of sea level rise: sea level has risen by about 6 cm in the last twenty years and the island height is probably stable or very slowly subsiding. This island expansion during a period of rising sea level demonstrates that sea level rise is not the primary factor controlling the shoreline changes. This paper highlights the key role of non-climate factors in changes in island area, especially sediment availability and transport.”

Dr. Nils-Axel Mörner, a renowned sea-level expert who has authored over 200 peer-reviewed scientific publications during his career, has recently confirmed there has been a lack of climate-related sea level rise in areas of the world where disastrous climate-related sea level rise has been assumed to already be occurring: the Maldives and along the coasts of Bangladesh.   Severe coastal erosion can explain the relative sea level changes in these regions.  In fact, Mörner reports that the Indian Ocean as a whole has been “virtually stable over the last 40-50 years.”

Mörner, 2016
“Coastal erosion is caused by many different processes like changes in prevailing wind direction, coastal currents, re-establishment of a new equilibrium profile, sea level rise, sea level fall, exceptional storms, hurricanes/cyclones, and tsunami events. These coastal factors are reviewed with special attention to effects due to changes in sea level. In the Indian Ocean, sea level seems to have remained virtually stable over the last 40-50 years. Coastal erosion in the Maldives was caused by a short lowering in sea level in the 1970s. In Bangladesh, repeated disastrous cyclone events cause severe coastal erosion, which hence has nothing to do with any proposed sea level rise. Places like Tuvalu, Kiribati and Vanuatu – all notorious for an inferred sea level rise – have tide gauges which show no on-going sea level rise. Erosion is by no means a sign of sea level rise. Coastal erosion occurs in uplifting regions as well as in subsiding regions, or virtually stable areas. Coastal morphology provides excellent insights to the stability.”

Scientists: Sea Levels Are Barely Rising — And The Rise Is ‘Not Anthropogenic In Origin’

The sea-levels-are-dangerously-rising narrative has become so commonly headlined in the popular media that it is effectively considered an unquestioned “fact” that needs no further investigation.
But some scientists have actually taken the time to investigate relative sea level rise in long-term records from tide gauges.  And what they have found is that in some locations sea levels are rising, in other locations sea levels are falling, and most of the world’s tide gauges show that sea levels are stable, with no significant trends either way.  In fact, scientists assert that the overall rate of rise from the 19th/20th centuries to now — including the most recent decades  — has only been about 1 mm/yr, which is about 4 inches per century.  These modest rates are well within the range of natural variability.

 Beenstock et al., 2014
“Tide gauges dating back to the 19th century were located where sea levels happened to be rising. Data reconstructions based on these tide gauges are therefore likely to over-estimate sea level rise.”
“We therefore study individual tide gauge data on sea levels from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) during 1807 – 2010 without recourse to data reconstruction. Although mean sea levels are rising by 1 mm/year, sea level rise is local rather than global, and is concentrated in the Baltic and Adriatic seas, South East Asia and the Atlantic coast of the United States. In these locations, covering 35 percent of tide gauges, sea levels rose on average by 3.8mm/year. Sea levels were stable in locations covered by 61 percent of tide gauges, and sea levels fell in locations covered by 4 percent of tide gauges. In these locations sea levels fell on average by almost 6mm/year.”

Parker and Ollier, 2016
“Tide gauges provide the most reliable measurements, and best data to assess the rate of change. We show as the naïve averaging of all the tide gauges included in the PSMSL surveys show “relative” rates of rise about +1.04 mm/year (570 tide gauges of any length). If we consider only 100 tide gauges with more than 80 years of recording the rise is only +0.25 mm/year. This naïve averaging has been stable and shows that the sea levels are slowly rising but not accelerating.  … We conclude that if the sea levels are only oscillating about constant trends everywhere as suggested by the tide gauges, then the effects of climate change are negligible, and the local patterns may be used for local coastal planning without any need of purely speculative global trends based on emission scenarios.”

Furthermore, even in the regions of the world where sea levels are indeed rising, and rising rapidly (i.e., the tropical Pacific), scientists have acknowledged that an anthropogenic fingerprint cannot even be detected in the sea level rise trends.  Natural oscillations related to internal ocean processes are predominantly what drive sea level changes, not anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

Palanisamy et al., 2015
“[B]y making use of 21 CMIP5 coupled climate models, we study the contribution of external forcing to the Pacific Ocean regional sea level variability over 1993–2013, and show that according to climate models, externally forced and thereby the anthropogenic sea level fingerprint on regional sea level trends in the tropical Pacific is still too small to be observable by satellite altimetry.”
“Furthermore, regressed CMIP5 MME-based sea level spatial trend pattern in the tropical Pacific over the altimetry period do not display any positive sea level trend values that are comparable to the altimetry based sea level signal after having removed the contribution of the decadal natural climate mode. This suggests that the residual positive trend pattern observed in the western tropical Pacific is not externally forced and thereby not anthropogenic in origin. In addition the amplitude of the sea level spatial trend pattern from regressed CMIP5 MME is low over the altimetry period in the tropical Pacific. This amplitude is significantly lower than the expected error in trend patterns from satellite altimetry (in the order of 2 mm yr-1 to 3 mm yr−1, Ablain et al 2015, Couhert et al 2015) and suggest that satellite altimetry measurement is still not accurate enough to detect the anthropogenic signal in the 20 year tropical Pacific sea level trends.”

Hansen et al., 2016
“[T]he large sea-level rise after 1970, is completely contained by the found small residuals, long-term oscillators, and general trend. Thus, we found that there is (yet) no observable sea-level effect of anthropogenic global warming in the world’s best recorded region.”

Summary
To summarize, the world’s shorelines have been growing, not shrinking, in recent decades.  This growth or relative net change in coastal land area is primarily related to the effects of non-climatic processes such as coastal erosion (or the lack of it) and subsidence and uplift trends —  just as the loss of coastal land area in some locations is predominantly due to these same natural non-climatic processes.
Tide gauges averaged from all over the globe indicate that sea levels are rising very modestly, and well within the range of natural variability.  In the regions of the world where sea levels are rising, the rise is predominantly due to internal processes, as an anthropogenic fingerprint in sea level rise trends has not been detectable.
Of course, the above analysis does not fit the narrative of anthropogenically-induced dangerous sea level rise that will wipe out coastal cities and lead to the catastrophic displacement of 100s of millions of people world-wide in the coming decades.  Perhaps this is why some may find this summary of scientific conclusions undermining this popular doomsday narrative so . . . surprising.

"Australia’s deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, had told a constituent in Wagga Wagga he disputed evidence of global heating because historical weather measurements might be inaccurate, according to notes from a meeting last month. The Wagga City Council, at the heart of McCormack’s electorate, declared a climate change emergency last week.  The remarkable statement by the city leaders, in a normally conservative part of the country susceptible to extremes of drought, fire and flood, has intensified local pressure on McCormack to clarify his position. The deputy prime minister has previously made some sceptical statements and has suggested praying for rain to combat the drought. Wagga-based general practitioner Dr Trudi Beck, who has been central to a community push for the council’s climate emergency declaration, met McCormack at his office on 24 June. In notes she made immediately after the meeting, which she sent to McCormack and which were noted by a staffer who was present, Beck detailed comments made by the Riverina MP. “When asked if [McCormack believed] in climate change [he] stated that the climate has always been changing and made reference to various flood and drought events over the past 120 years,” the meeting notes say. “When asked what [McCormack] would make of data from meteorological agencies that 18 of the 19 hottest years on record have been in the last 18 years [he] suggested that earlier measurements of temperature by agencies such as the Bureau of Meteorology were not as accurately measured.” Beck and other community members in Wagga have begun “Fridays for the Future” demonstrations, where they picnic in a small park near McCormack’s office. Beck says the deputy prime minister told her she should abandon the actions and “do something useful like volunteer for Meals on Wheels instead”. McCormack told Guardian Australia that “a meeting was held with a constituent at her request to discuss climate” but did not elaborate when asked about his purported comments, or to make clear his personal view. “There was an exchange of views and the constituent was given an understanding of the government’s actions on climate. The government is taking responsible and affordable action on environmental issues which are of concern to people not just in Wagga Wagga but throughout Australia,” he said. “This has to be achieved in a responsible manner without de-industrialising our nation and driving energy costs through the roof.” Beck said she had initially thought McCormack would be open to a conversation. “The kinds of points he was raising with me were the same kinds of points I’ve heard people who do not believe in anthropogenic climate change bringing up,” she said. The Wagga city council will vote again on Monday, after some councillors launched an attempt to rescind the emergency declaration. McCormack did not express a view on the local debate but did say that “addressing global environmental issues, including those relating to climate, requires a global solution”."
"Plant enough trees and you’ll be able to take the oomph out of damaging storms. That’s the message that is coming out of a study published in Environmental Research Letters, which suggests that major reforestation across Europe has the potential to reduce the number of extra-tropical cyclones by as much as 80%. Scientists from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute used a climate model to compare the number and intensity of cyclones under two scenarios: Europe devoid of trees and Europe covered in trees. Forests make the land bumpier (than a field of wheat say) and the results suggest that this extra friction helps to slow cyclones down. The results show that a tree-covered Europe would have around 10% fewer cyclones on western European coasts, rising to 80% fewer cyclones in eastern Europe. That’s because most cyclones approach from the west, meaning those that reach eastern Europe have to bounce over more trees.  One downside to fewer storms could be a reduction in rainfall, but it’s likely that increased evapotranspiration from extra trees would help to make up the shortfall. Other things, like wind turbines or skyscrapers, could also increase surface roughness and slow cyclones down, but they’d likely reduce rainfall too."

By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
[Translated by P. Gosselin]
Not long ago we asked German public radio Deutschlandfunk why they mentioned only the alarmist viewpoint of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in a report on the Gulf Stream published in March. The DLF replied that they indeed had reported on deviating models in the past.
PIK scientist Stefan Rahmstorf naturally detests it when the German media express criticism over his statements. In the Süddeutschen Zeitung of July 3, 1999 Rahmstorf was cocksure, claiming:
The Atlantic ocean current probably will weaken notably over the coming decades – here the simulations from various institutes are in broad agreement.”
Over the past one and a half decades that “broad agreement” has turned out to be a fantasy. The wide majority of scientists see no long-term change in the Gulf Stream. At the end of May 2015 yet another institute that refuses to follow the PIK has appeared. Oceanographer Kjell Arild Orvik of the Geophysical Institute of the University of Bergen has studied the Gulf Stream at the west coast of Norway and has determined that the ocean current has remained stable over the last 20 years. At the Forskning.no website (via WUWT) Orvik explains:
What we see is that the stream is lively in the sense that it varies both seasonally and from year to year. But when observing it over 20 years, it shows long-term stability.
Of course neither German national public radio Deutschlandfunk nor the Süddeutsche Zeitung have reported on this interesting development from Norway.

"Protesters from the climate crisis group Extinction Rebellion have brought disruption to Capitol Hill in Washington, superglueing themselves to doorways to block politicians and staff. Just after 6pm, six activists stood in doorways to a tunnel connecting the Cannon office building to the US Capitol in an attempt to prevent members of Congress attending an evening vote.  A total of 17 activists were arrested and charged with crowding and obstructing, according to US Capitol police. Several were also charged with defacing public property. Demonstrators said their goal was to force a House and Senate concurrent resolution on the climate emergency – currently on hold – to receive immediate attention. In three pairs, they used Gorilla Glue to stick their hands to the doors and each other. They were draped in yellow and red tape that said “Caution” and wore yellow hazard signs that said “Declare climate emergency” or “Closed. We’re sorry. Due to the climate emergency Congress is shut down until sufficient action is taken to address the crisis.” A few members of Congress arrived and, finding their route blocked, were forced to turn around. But other people, including fellow activists, gathered under the Cannon building rotunda to watch. The demonstrators shouted, “Climate emergency now!”, “We’re out of time!” and “This is not a drill!” Among the protesters, her right hand glued to an open glass door, was Sara Soko, 22, from Washington, who said she was prepared to get arrested if necessary. “I’m doing this today because the Congress is dragging their feet on declaring a climate emergency, and it’s supposed to be like a speedy transition, and that’s what the resolution says. So we’re here to try and make this more urgent.” Politicians had failed, Soko added. “They have not done anything,” she said. “And this resolution is asking the simplest thing: it’s just to recognise the science and to declare it an emergency and that we need to do something. And they can’t even do that.” After a few minutes, US Capitol police arrived at the scene, pushing under one of the protester’s arms. He loudly exclaimed: “Ow!” The police then ordered spectators back about 10ft and formed a line of five officers. One protester exclaimed: “DC was under water last week. DC was on fire this weekend. We can’t live much longer like this.” Another said: “I know you’re listening, officers, I know you have children. Do you want them to live in a world that’s burning? … I’ve always wanted to have children. Three weeks ago I broke down in my car because I realised I can’t bring a child into this world.” Then a chant began: “What do we want? Climate emergency. When do we want it? Now.” Another loud chant followed: “Climate extinction rebellion.” After a brief pause, a young man who was looking on began singing We Shall Not Be Moved and others joined in. Finally, about half an hour after the protest began, police ordered the impromptu gathering, including reporters, to move back and out of sight of the doorway protesters. A simultaneous protest took place in the Rayburn building, again to deny access to the US Capitol. Kaela Bamberger, a spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion, which has staged attention-grabbing events in the US and abroad, said a total of 16 activists had risked arrest with the intention of disrupting “business as usual”. She added: “We believe the issue is so urgent it should be treated as a top priority. Petitioning and lobbying have been shown to be ineffective in the past, so we are taking extreme action to reflect the extreme nature of the crisis. The climate emergency should be treated with the gravity it deserves.“The legislative process has failed on the issue. We’re using nonviolent civil disobedience to combat complacency in Congress.” Extinction Rebellion Washington DC published photos and videos of the intervention on its Twitter account. One tweet said: “We are superglued to the tunnels under the Capitol because what other choice do we have when our politicians choose money over life? We are risking our freedom and safety to demand a climate emergency declaration.” Outside the Longworth building at 8.15pm, at least 10 of the protesters, under arrest and wearing plastic cuffs, were calmly loaded into two police vans while their possessions were held in transparent plastic bags as supporters watched. Some described how they had unstuck their hands from the doors in what was a slow and painful process. “I was worried about losing skin but that didn’t happen,” one said. The organisation Movement for a People’s Party, which is separate from Extinction Rebellion but was involved in the demonstration, issued a press release stating that its national director, Nick Brana, had been arrested during protests at three underground tunnel entrances leading to the Capitol. “It is not known what charges have been leveled or when Brana and the others will be released,” it added."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe July 24, 2016 print edition of national flagship daily Die Welt wrote a feature story on how German citizens are becoming fed up with the widespread crony capitalism of the wind energy business and are thus now mobilizing a fierce rebellion. The German daily writes of health issues for people living in their vicinity.
The article starts by featuring technology fan Volker Tschischke, who was once an ardent proponent of renewable energy – until wind turbines were built close to his residence and encircled his home village of Etteln. Now he leads a citizens initiative against the construction of wind parkc. The turbines “have driven him to resistance“, Die Welt writes.
Local politicians are no longer serving the interests of the local people, but rather “are rolling out the red carpet for wind power companies” and appear to be “no longer listening to the people and about the concerns of their everyday lives,” the national German daily writes.
A “destructive force”
Die Welt describes an Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) that is “dividing the people“, where those who live in big cities and thus not effected by the blight are open to wind parks, while those living in the countryside are fed up and fiercely resisting them. Die Welt reports that people across rural Germany “no longer view the Energiewende as a necessary national project, but as a destructive force.”
Now, ever so gradually, it even appears that Berlin is getting the message as leading parties see their poll numbers dropping. Die Welt writes that Berlin is now throttling the expansion of wind parks and working to “deescalate the conflict“.
“Ruined and destroyed for generations”
As an example of blight and destruction, Die Welt cites the area surrounding the central city of Paderborn, quoting a local resident who is thinking about packing up and leaving: “Here the living area is being ruined and destroyed for generations.”
Even though Berlin is scrambling to put the brakes on the uncontrolled spread of wind turbine littering across the rural landscape, local residents often remain powerless against the mighty wind industrialists and projects that have already been proposed. And even when local political leaders side up with their residents against the parks, Die Welt describes a David versus Goliath fight:
On one side there’s the mayor of the town and some of his staff, and on the other side there are corporation-like companies that hire staffs of lawyers.”

In such cases the big wind companies have an easy time pile-driving their projects through, Die Welt writes.
Opponents resort to sabotage
Also wind park developers often promise towns and villages cash-flow from wind projects, But as Die Welt reports, most never end up seeing any money. “The promise of business tax revenue is a ‘large fairy tale’.”
Die Welt also adds that wind park opponents are often labeled “grumblers“, “troublemakers” or “Energiewende blockers who use ludicrous ways to try to stop the success of the Energiewende.”
The conflict has even escalated to the point where opponents have even sabotaged a wind measurement instrument used to check the feasibility of a possible future project. Farmers are even blocking deforestation equipment with their tractors, Die Welt reports.
Lawless, Wild West conditions
In other locations it seems that wind energy development resembles the Wild West where there is a complete lack of law and order. Town have corrupted the planning, permitting and building process. Die Welt writes sometimes sleazy towns act as planner, permitting authority, builder and operator all in one. Nothing stands in the way. There are no checks and balances. Only a few profiteers. The German daily writes:
The county of Aurich is a stakeholder in wind park projects. For the investor that is totally practical. He is thus practically the funder, impact study conductor and project approver all in one.”
Whether its solar power or wind energy, there’s a common thread: A very select few are profiting hugely while the rest of society are left to clean up a huge industrial, financial and environmental mess.

"Just after 6am, Victor Funez fills a three-gallon plastic pitcher with water from a tap in the cemetery, balances it on his head and trudges home, where his wife waits to soak maize kernels so she can make tortillas for breakfast. Funez, 38, stops briefly to help his daughter with some homework before heading back to the cemetery with the pink urn. This load fills large plastic milk and juice bottles used for drinking throughout the day. The tap is the family’s only source of water, so Funez makes the journey along the dusty dirt road 15 to 20 times each day. “My husband’s job is to fetch the water so I can do the housework. It’s like this every day, all day,” said Bianca Lopez, 46. “We can live without electricity – we have candles and lamps – but water, that’s essential.” La Estación is a makeshift community of 59 households along disused railway tracks that cut across Nejapa – a semi-urban municipality on the northern outskirts of El Salvador’s capital. This tiny Central American state is one of the most murderous in the world, plagued by warring gang factions and security forces who shoot to kill. Relentless bloodshed and chronic unemployment have driven wave after wave of migration as Salvadorans seek a better life. But in recent years, widespread water shortages are increasingly helping fuel unrest and forced displacement. “Marginalized communities struggle day to day to get access to enough water. It’s not a question that this could one day cause social conflict – it already is … the whole country is close to crisis,” said Silvia de Larios, the former director of ecosystems and wildlife at the ministry of environment and natural resources (known by its Spanish acronym, Marn). El Salvador is the most densely populated country in Central America. It also has the region’s lowest water reserves, which are depleting fast thanks to the climate crisis, pollution and unchecked commercial exploitation. According to one study, El Salvador will run out of water within 80 years unless radical action is taken to improve the way the country manages its dwindling water supplies. As in just about every aspect of life in El Salvador, the water problem is only exacerbated by corporate interests, corruption and the country’s vicious street gangs. Local women have long used the banks of the San Antonio River as an open-air laundry. But the laundry spot lies within Barrio 18 territory, whereas La Estación is controlled by the rival MS-13 gang – and crossing gang boundaries can get you killed. Nejapa has one of the highest murder rates in the country, with 71 homicides per 100,000 habitants in 2018, according to research by Elizabeth G Kennedy, a migration and violence scholar. López’s only income comes from washing her neighbour’s clothes, but she endures the hardship of the tap and pitchers rather than crossing the frontline. “It would be much easier at the river, but it’s not worth my life.” For some, there’s no choice but to take the risk. At 10.30am, Elena Fuente, 46 and daughter-in-law Jocelyn Álvarez, 23, rush towards a waiting rickshaw with plastic bowls jam-packed with freshly washed clothes balanced on their heads. Álvarez loses her balance and falls, scraping her knees badly. She’s new to the river laundry, as their MS-13-controlled neighbourhood previously had running water every night, but there’s been not a drop for the past 22 days, and no one knows why. “We risk the gangs because we’ve no other choice – we’d run out of clean clothes,” said Fuente. None of the women would dream of bringing a man to the spot, she added. “That would cause a problem.” Years of drought has prompted water rationing in urban and rural areas across the country. Yet much is wasted: most rainwater is lost due to widespread deforestation and eroded river basins; once in the system, 48% of water is lost through leaks. Sources are already running dry: the Nejapa aquifer provides 40% of the water used by the overcrowded capital, but the water level has shrunk by 20% in the past five years alone. Meanwhile, a lush forest, known as the lungs of Nejapa, is being chopped down to make way for gated housing developments with private underground wells. Nejapa’s biggest industrial water guzzlers and alleged polluters – the local Coca-Cola bottling company and sugar cane plantations – have been unaffected by rationing. In the fields behind the Coca-Cola factory, murky, foul-smelling water can be seen pumping into a stream. AB InBev, the world’s largest brewer which controls the bottling company, did not respond to specific questions about the pollution, but said it was committed to sustainability and conservation. At least 90% of El Salvador’s surface water is contaminated by untreated sewage, agricultural and industrial waste, according to studies by Marn. “There are no clear rules, no sanctions, no monitoring, and big business uses these legal vacuums to exploit water as a product for profit. It’s the poorest who suffer most,” said De Larios. The suffering is stark in nearby Joya Galana, a campesino canton of 53 families with a bird’s-eye view – and smell – of the country’s biggest open rubbish dump, which has polluted every river and underground water source for several miles. Joya’s water supply is piped in from another community, but was recently cut off for three months after thousands of dollars were stolen from a maintenance fund and a waterhole fund dried up. The supply is back for now, but the situation is precarious. “Today we have water, tomorrow who knows?” said Sonia Guardado, 40, who, like many others, is considering leaving the country. “Our water supply isn’t secure. We need solution, or else we’ll have to leave.” Amid the escalating water crisis, a network of grassroots groups, environmentalists and the Catholic church convinced lawmakers to make history in 2017 by banning metal mining – a major cause of pollution. But politicians have so far refused to create an independent regulatory system, which campaigners argue would put human consumption and sustainability above corporate interests. Andres McKinley, a water and mining scholar from the Central American University (UCA), said: “This is a huge political issue; we must change who controls water. That’s the war we’re in.” La Estación was built on disused state land in 2015 by families unable to afford anything else. Four years later, it’s still battling for running water, a sewage system and land titles (the community is technically illegal). It’s a constant grind to get water – and to get rid of it – and both challenges fuel health problems and tensions between neighbours. At 2pm, thunder rolls and rain crashes down on the metal sheet roofs. Some neighbours rush outside to uncover tall barrels to collect the precious drops, but the rain also floods shallow ditches along the unpaved roads. As the storm subsides, clouds of mosquitoes appear above the dirty puddles. Last year, health inspectors blamed the community’s contraband water supplies and makeshift drainage system for a spike in mosquito-borne dengue and chikungunya. Neighbours in adjacent communities with running water stopped selling it to La Estación under threat of fines; others put up barbed wire fences to stop them laying hoses. So the inhabitants of La Estación have had to be creative. Health and water officials clock off at 4pm. At about 4.01, Esmeralda Cerritos, 29 , a local union activist, unspools a long hose and attaches it to a tap in a the house of a neighbour who charges her $2 a month. She dangles the other end of the hose into the pila, a deep trough next to the cement sink in the yard, and gathers dozens of containers and bottles, each specifically identified in the precise lexicon of water storage: balde, pinchanga, barril, tambor, cántaro, juacal, pinchel and  garrofón.  It takes three hours to fill the receptacles, which will last the family three or four days. “We’ve been trying to get running water for four years, but there’s always another hurdle,” she said. A community meeting is held to discuss the latest challenge: the health ministry will only authorize running water for households with septic toilets, which cost about $500. This either means the poorest neighbours will be left without water, or the entire community will be forced to wait another a year until a sewage plant is built. The community votes to wait, in order to avoid further divisions: in 2015, a mayoral candidate promised people running water in exchange for $250 and their votes. Fifteen households agreed: they have water (though no legal permits), and they refuse to share with neighbours. Cerritos spoke out against the deal, but received death threats. With gang members on either side of the division, Cerritos backed off. “The cycle of violence begins when the state abandons communities by not providing fundamental human rights like water, education, health and jobs – which end up being the fertile ground in which gangs and violence grows,” said Jeanne Rikkers, a violence prevention expert with the NGO Cristosal. “But the fix is only ever about the violence, never the root causes. As water become increasingly critical, gangs will likely become involved in community conflicts as the state is absent.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the print edition of Swiss news weekly “Weltwoche”, science journalist Markus Schär writes that not only has the global temperature trend suspiciously been tampered with, but so have the datasets of the Swiss Meteorological Service:

View of print Weltwoche article on global temperature “adjustments”.
To illustrate Weltwoche shows two datasets in its article from two different locations in Switzerland:

The chart above shows the mean annual temperatures and trends for Sion and Zurich before (left) and after “adjustment” (right). The “adjustments” resulted in a doubling of the temperature trend.
At the start of the article Schär characterizes Thomas Stocker’s claim that the “so-called” 18-year global temperature pause is misleading information spread by “lobbyists” as scientifically invalid, and does so for three reasons: 1) It’s not “so-called” because datasets show there’s been no warming in over 18 years, 2) the pause is acknowledged by leading experts, and 3) IPCC experts have already acknowledged it, and have even come up with “over 50 explanations” to explain it.
Schär then focusses on the reports of temperature adjustments at various locations around the world that have led to a depiction of more rapidly warming global temperatures:
The Australian last year uncovered that state meteorologists adjusted an 80-year temperature series of Australia so that a cooling of 1°C per century was changed to a warming of 2.3°C.”
Schär also wrote of NASA’s dataset:
British science journalist Christopher Booker, who called the manipulation of temperature data ‘the biggest science scandal ever’, showed how among other things that the record value for 2014 came about because the responsible NASA institute had flipped the data trend for rural measurement stations in Brazil or Paraguay.”
According to Schär at Weltwoche, also Swiss temperature data have been adjusted to show stronger warming, calling the work a “propaganda trick, and not a valid trend“.

Schär calls into question the basis used for justifying the upwards adjustment, especially with respect to the fact that stations today are more urbanized and under influence of the urban heat island effect. He writes of the Swiss data:
It is correct that meteorologists homogenize their data, i.e. filter out external influences. But here the question is: How and with what intention are they doing this? […]
The meteorologist significantly lowered the data from the 19th century and strongly raised those of around 1980.”
The result, Schär writes; was a doubling of the temnperature increase rate. Schär also reports on how German meteorologist Klaus Hager earlier determined that the newer electronic measurement instruduced since the 1980s showed “on average 0.93°C higher temperatures.”
So why the upward adjustments when we have all the instrumentation and siting issues?
Schär writes that the Swiss meteorologists have rejected Hager’s claim that the new electronic instrumentation is delivering warmer temperatures, insisting that “the thermometers in the new automatic network are showing ‘slightly lower temperatures’ than those in the ‘poorly ventilated’ Stevenson screens.” Schär continues:
The corrections, however, appear so massive that they represent half of the entire temperature increase.”
Despite the data fudging by Swiss meteorologists (and those worldwide), no one is able to hide the fact that winters in Switzerland and in Central Europe have gotten colder over the past 20 years, defying predictions of warming made earlier by climatologists.
But that’s no problem for the climatologists, Schär writes.
Temperatures no longer have to rise in order to spread the fear of climate catastrophe. In the science magazine ‘Einstein’ on Swiss television, Stephan Bader of the Swiss Meteorological Service showed that winters in the Alps were getting cooler over the past years: But he also added that it was due to climate warming: Scientists at the Alfred Wegener Institute ‘suspect’ the cold snaps came from the melting of Arctic ice (which has stopped).”
Propaganda trick, anyone?

"About 200 reindeer have been found dead from starvation in the Arctic archipelago Svalbard, an unusually high number, the Norwegian Polar Institute has said, pointing the finger at climate crisis. During an annual census of the wild reindeer population on the group of islands about 1,200km (746 miles) from the north pole, three researchers from the institute identified the carcasses of about 200 deer believed to have starved to death last winter.  Ashild Onvik Pedersen, the head of the census, said the high degree of mortality was a consequence of climate crisis, which according to climate scientists, is happening twice as fast in the Arctic as the rest of the world. “Climate change is making it rain much more. The rain falls on the snow and forms a layer of ice on the tundra, making grazing conditions very poor for animals,” she said. In winter, Svalbard reindeer find vegetation in the snow using their hooves, but alternating freezing and thawing periods can create layers of impenetrable ice, depriving the reindeers of nourishment. According to Onvik Pedersen, a comparable death toll has been recorded only once before – after the winter of 2007-2008 – since monitoring of the reindeer population started 40 years ago. The increased mortality is also due in part to a significant increase in the number of reindeer in the Norwegian archipelago. That is partly thanks to climate crisis and the warmer summers, meaning more individuals compete in the same grazing areas. Since the 1980s, the number of reindeer has doubled in Svalbard, and now stands at about 22,000, according to the Norwegian Polar Institute."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Deutsche Wetterdienst (German Weather Service), DWD, released a bulletin providing background information on a cold front that passed through the country last Tuesday and unleashed some severe storm activity.
In the East German town of Bützow a tornado even touched down and caused severe damage and dozens of injuries.
To give an idea of how intense the front was, the following chart shows the temperature drop in Hamburg brought on by the front’s passage:

Although tornadoes in Germany are nowhere near as common as they are in the USA, it is not unusual for them to occur from time to time. But when they do occur, the media and some dubious climate and weather “experts” are quick to hint that they are extreme weather events associated with man-made climate change.

So are tornadoes really becoming more frequent in Germany?
Although the DWD German Weather Service has not been tracking tornadoes that long, the data so far do not show any increase in activity over the past 15 years.

Number of confirmed tornadoes in Germany since 2000. Trend has been significantly downward over the past 10 years. Source: DWD.
In fact the trend appears to be more downward. Of course a period of 15 years is too short to draw sound conclusions, and the DWD adds that data has uncertainty. The bulletin adds:
In Germany the occurrences of tornadoes are often times not recorded, unless they cause direct or occur near a weather station. Over the years the wide use of mobile devices and i-phones have allowed the widespread recording and documentation of such events and so an estimation of their frequency can be done.”

Fellow New Englander, engineering physicist and energy expert, Mike Brakey has sent a summary analysis of NOAA past temperature “adjustments” for Maine.
=====================================
Black Swan Climate Theory
By Mike Brakey
Here in the U.S. I have documented manipulations similar to those in Switzerland and other locations worldwide that NTZ wrote about yesterday.
Over the last months I have discovered that between 2013 and 2015 some government bureaucrats have rewritten Maine climate history between 2013 and 2015 (and New England’s and of the U.S.). This statement is not based on my opinion, but on facts drawn from NOAA 2013 climate data vs NOAA 2015 climate data after when they re-wrote it.
We need only compare the data. They cooked their own books (see numbers below).

Figure 1: NOAA cooled the years of Maine’s past by an accumulated 151°F! (55,188 heating degree day units).
The last four months have been some of the coldest you might ever recall in our lifetime. So far 2015 is the fourth coldest in Maine’s history over the last 120 years. Data from 2013 confirm that so far – from January 1 to April 29 – 2015 has required 4249 heating degree days.
That rivals 1904, 1918 and 1923 over the last 120 years.
But when I recently looked at NOAA’s revised 2015 data, these last four months now would not even put us in the top twenty of coldest months. The federal government went into the historical data and lowered those earlier years – and other years in the earlier decades – so that they can keep spending $27 billion a year on pushing global warming.
They assumed no one would archive temperature data. But I did. My research indicated they used the same algorithm across the United States at the same time. Fortunately I had archived their data from 2013 for Maine and recently compared it to their 2015 data (see above table).
As an engineering physicist and heat transfer specialist, I have worked with heating and cooling degree days for forty years. It is alarming when one discovers multi-million dollar websites have been corrupted with bogus data because the facts do not match up with agendas.
It tremendously harms the industry you and I both work in. Worse, it harms the public. If the public knew the climate data facts indicated it was not getting warmer locally, and that it might actually be getting cooler, it would have all the more reason to insulate and become more energy-efficient in their homes.
I have put together a Maine history of climate temperatures in a narrated PowerPoint Presentation placed on YouTube titled, Black Swan Climate Theory.
Below is a brief sampling of my findings:

Table 1: Sampling of findings.

So far 2015 Maine temperatures, as of April, are running neck-and-neck with the coldest years in Maine’s history: 1904 (40.6°F), 1918 (42.1°F) and 1925 (42.3°F). These temperatures cited come right from the federal government’s own NOAA climate data (from 2013). I archived them on my computer for future reference.
2015 so far among coldest on record
A BLACK SWAN event is forming in 2015 (following chart):

Figure 2: Plot comparing the new, altered dataset to the 2013 dataset. Black curve is the plot of the 2013 dataset. The blue curve is the plot of the 2015 new, altered data. 
Based on the first four months of 2015, there is an excellent chance 2015 Maine temperature might average, on an annual basis, well under 43.0°F. Not only have Maine temperatures been on a decline since 1998, we are now seeing temperatures reminiscent of the bitter turn of the early 1900s.
“Massive rewrite”
It appears NOAA panicked and did a massive rewrite of Maine temperature history (they used the same algorithm for U.S. in general). The new official temperatures from Maine between 1895 and present were LOWERED by an accumulated 151.2°F between 1895 and 2012.
“Out-and-out fraud”
In my opinion, this is out-and-out fraud. Why did they corrupt national climate data? Global warming is a $27 billion business on an annual basis in the U.S alone.

Now NOAA data revised in 2015 indicate that 1904, 1919 and 1925 in Maine were much colder than anything we experience today. (See the scorecard above comparing the NOAA data that are 18 months apart). Note how for 1913 the NOAA lowered the annual temperature a whole 4°F!
For the balance of the years, as they get closer to the present, the NOAA tweaks less and less. They have corrupted Maine climate data between 1895 and present by a whopping accumulated 151.2°F.
Unfortunately NOAA is remaining true to that old saying, “Figures don’t lie but liars figure.”
A multi-million dollar website has been corrupted. I can no longer rely on the tax-payer funded NOAA for clean, unfiltered, climate data for my ongoing research.
Conclusion
I can no longer trust the climate data and energy information ultimately drawn from the U.S. government. Locally, I now have to determine if they got their data from NOAA.
This makes research a lot tougher.

"Britain’s first climate “citizens assembly” opened its final session on Saturday morning at which more than 50 Londoners will decide on carbon-cutting measures they want their district to enact in order to confront climate change. Camden’s Citizens Assembly, convened to interrogate what locals, neighbourhoods and the council can do for the environment, is deliberating action that would reduce fossil fuel usage in homes and public buildings and on roads.  The wishlist will be considered by the council as it draws up an environment action plan for 2020. The outcome of the assembly will be closely watched by other councils planning to follow suit this year, and by Westminster which will hold its own national climate assembly in the autumn. Council officials say there is a clear intention to implement at least some of the recommendations. “I hope there will be some concrete action that we can take forward as a council,” said Georgia Gould, the council leader. “That’s the idea of it being an open process – you are letting go of that control. Our climate is in a crisis and we need to act in radical new ways and this assembly is part of developing those new ideas.” Ideas being considered include community energy projects such as solar panels on schools, GP surgeries and public buildings, a revolution in heating buildings that favours air source heat pumps over old-style gas boilers, better insulation and urban greening. Anti-car measures are also being considered, though motorists produce only 13% of emissions in the district, with the rest generated by energy use in buildings. “I’m keen that they should ban all cars. They should ban all gas boilers in newbuilds now. They should retrofit old buildings,” said Rupert Cruise, one of the participants. But the assembly is diverse in age, ethnicity and outlook. Another juror, Neil Chappell, said: “I’m here to defend the motorist. Camden always hammers the motorist but only 10% of emissions is down to cars.” By the end of Saturday’s deliberations, participants will have spent 12 hours in three separate sessions listening to briefings, asking questions, debating with each other and coming up with solutions. They were recruited randomly via a street and door-knocking campaign. A shortlist was winnowed down to assure the final composition was demographically (but not necessarily politically) representative. The participants are being paid £150 in vouchers for their time. Some participants said that although they were keen to do something, they felt the real scope for action lay with the national government. After all, aircraft do not take off in Camden, there are no large power plants, and container ships do not pass through. “Most people are informed and there is consensus, but people feel that individuals can’t do much,” said Khalil Miah. “It’s up to national government to set the goalposts and the deadlines.” Others said the process itself was a breath of fresh air, helping to address not just the crisis in the environment but the crisis in democracy too. “It is absolutely great,” said Merve Öner, a student on the assembly. “It’s a diverse community and it’s delightful to involve them all. I think it should be implemented in lots of other countries.”"
"Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon has surged above three football fields a minute, according to the latest government data, pushing the world’s biggest rainforest closer to a tipping point beyond which it cannot recover. The sharp rise – following year-on-year increases in May and June – confirms fears that president Jair Bolsonaro has given a green light to illegal land invasion, logging and burning. Clearance so far in July has hit 1,345 sq km, a third higher than the previous monthly record under the current monitoring system by the Deter B satellite system, which started in 2015. With five days remaining, this is on course to be the first month for several years in which Brazil loses an area of forest bigger than Greater London. The steady erosion of tree cover weakens the role of the rainforest in stabilising the global climate. Scientists warn that the forest is in growing danger of degrading into a savannah, after which its capacity to absorb carbon will be severely diminished, with consequences for the rest of the planet. “It’s very important to keep repeating these concerns. There are a number of tipping points which are not far away,” said Philip Fearnside, a professor at Brazil’s National Institute of Amazonian Research. “We can’t see exactly where they are, but we know they are very close. It means we have to do things right away. Unfortunately that is not what is happening. There are people denying we even have a problem.” It may also complicate ratification of Brazil’s biggest ever trade deal with the European Union if EU legislators decide the South American nation is not keeping its side of the bargain, which includes a commitment to slow deforestation in line with the Paris climate agreement. The official numbers from the National Institute for Space Research are a growing embarrassment to Bolsonaro, who has tried to fob them off as lies and criticised the head of the institute. Earlier this week, the president insisted the numbers should be screened by the ministry of science and technology and shown to him before being made public so that he did not get “caught with his pants down”. This has raised fears that the data could be vetted in future rather than automatically updated online each day as is currently the case. In his first seven months in power, Bolsonaro, who was elected with strong support from agribusiness and mining interests, has moved rapidly to erode government agencies responsible for forest protection. He has weakened the environment agency and effectively put it under the supervision of the agricultural ministry, which is headed by the leader of the farming lobby. His foreign minister has dismissed climate science as part of a global Marxist plot. The president and other ministers have criticised the forest monitoring agency, Ibama, for imposing fines on illegal land grabbers and loggers. The government has also moved to weaken protections for nature reserves, indigenous territories and zones of sustainable production by forest peoples and invited businesspeople to register land counter-claims within those areas. This has emboldened those who want to invade the forest, clear it and claim it for commercial purposes, mostly in the speculative expectation it will rise in value, but also partly for cattle pastures, soya fields and mines. Earlier this month, it was reported that thousands of gold miners illegally invaded Yanomami indigenous territory near the border with Venezuela. Elsewhere, illegal loggers have mounted at least two attacks in response to Ibama enforcement operations, according to the Folha newspaper. On 4 July, they reportedly burned an Ibama truck in Espigão d’Oeste, Rondônia state and last week they were said to have burned bridges in Placas, Pará state. Rather than defend his officials, the environment minister Ricardo Salles appeared to side with the loggers when he gave a speech to a group of them in Rondônia soon afterwards, in which he reportedly told them: “The timber industry deserves to be respected … What happens today in Brazil, unfortunately, is the result of years and years and years of a public policy of producing laws, rules, regulations that are not always related to the real world. What we are doing now is precisely bringing the legal part of the real world that happens in every country from north to south.” During a recent G20 meeting, Bolsonaro told the German chancellor Angela Merkel that she had no right to criticise because Brazil’s conservation record was superior to that of Europe’s. This is a dubious claim, according to Climate Observatory, which cites World Bank data that shows Germany has given protected status to a bigger share of its land than Brazil. Brazil is also going backwards fast. After an 80% reduction in the rate of deforestation between 2006 and 2012, successive governments have relaxed protections. Clearance has been creeping up. Last year, deforestation rose 13% to the highest level in a decade. This year is on course to be far worse and the trend is back towards the dark days of the early 2000s. “Unfortunately, it is absurd, but it should not catch anyone by surprise. President Jair Bolsonaro and minister Ricardo Salles are dismantling our socio-environmental policies,” said Carlos Rittl, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, an NGO formed by a coalition of environmental groups. He said Salles had eradicated the department responsible for policies to combat deforestation, that no leaders have been appointed in eight of the nine Ibama regional offices, and that operations to combat environmental crimes declined 70% between January and April 2019 compared with the same period last year. The Deter satellite data is considered preliminary, but it is usually a guide to the longer-term trends. More detailed annual figures are usually released towards the end of the year, after the National Institute for Space Research has calculated data from the more powerful Prodes satellite system. Trees are considered essential to climate stability. Earlier this month, a study indicated that planting a trillion trees could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere by human activities. But scientists say maintaining existing forests, particularly in the tropics, is far more important."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the Institute of German Business (IW) the cost of Germany’s once highly touted “Energiewende” (transition to green energy) will soar to a whopping €31 billion ($35 billion) in 2016 alone, thus further burdening the already ailing German consumer.
Hat-tip: Gerti.

That’s a huge sum of money for the country of 80 million citizens. So, for all that money, are they now getting more beautiful weather and great results cutting back “climate-harmful” CO2 emissions? You’d certainly hope so. Sadly, the answer is s big fat “NEIN”.
Nothing in return for the money
In fact Germany’s CO2 emissions have not dropped at all over the past 7 years, and even went up a percentage point last year. Moreover, weather conditions continue today as they always have: typically rainy, cool, gray, windy and raw. For the roughly €1200 or so per year the average household has to fork out each year, it all sounds like an awfully raw deal (unless you happen to be one of the lucky few making money hand over fist in the scam). And that €1200 figure is only going to go up rapidly in the years ahead.
The www.finanznachrichten.de writes that the 2016 figure is about 3 billion (11%) more than a year earlier (2015). That’s unsustainable burden growth.

“Grid stabilization” adding to the costs
One reason for the ever increasing costs, the site writes, is the “costs for power grid stabilization“. As more highly fluctuating, weather-dependent power comes online, the costlier the grid stabilization measures become. What was once a highly stable energy supply system requiring intervention only a dozen times per year, now requires tens of thousands of interventions by the grid operators each year.
Often times wind and solar parks are forced to be taken offline to prevent the grid from getting toasted by power surges from wind gusts and sun bursts. In such cases, the wind and sun park operators are paid whether they produce or not. Last year consumers were saddled with over half a billion euros from such “unproduced energy” costs. The Energiewende is morphing into a central planning folly of the scale matched only by the Venezuelan Chavez communists.
30% higher electric bills by 2030
Another reason cited for the exploding costs is the continued new installation of wind and sun energy generation systems. Thus it is little wonder that that leading German politicians, such as Michael Fuchs, are getting antsy and calling a stop of the construction of new wind parks for which there are no power transmission lines. If this is not done, Fuchs says, German households face 30% higher electric bills already by 2020.
Just a matter of time before the fuses start blowing.

=============================
The “Trick” to Controlling the Climate Agenda
By Mike Brakey
Last April, in a short, narrated YouTube series titled, Black Swan Climate Theory [1] (BSCT) irrefutable evidence was presented that sometime between 2011 and 2015 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had on two occasions rewritten its own version of Maine’s statewide climate history. The gist of my findings was that I believe I caught NOAA purposefully using computer code (algorithms [2]) to lower historic temperatures to promote present day temperatures as the warmest on record. The image above is from the new YouTube series posted after NOAA’s acknowledgement that they had indeed made improvements to Maine’s climate history.
On May 6, 2015, NOAA confirmed in writing that the 151°F of Fudging—the Massive Rewrite of Maine Climate History, [3 ] reported in Black Swan Climate Theory [4] (BSCT) study was no accident. NOAA states the changes were intentional and were justified! NOAA’s written statement included these words [5]:
…improvements in the dataset, and brings our value much more in line with what was observed at the time. The new method used stations in neighboring Canada to inform estimates for data-sparse areas within Maine (a great improvement).”
NOAA’s statement about the need to recently introduce colder Canadian data into Maine’s past climate history was highly fishy, to say the least. I decided to rework the research parameters to eliminate possible Canadian temperature infusion and confusion. Rather than compare my archived data for Lewiston/Auburn, Maine (Zone 19) to NOAA’s “statewide” [6] data for 32 Zones as I did in BSCT, I limited my analysis to NOAA’s southern interior data (CD 2) [7]. Since Lewiston/Auburn is centered in NOAA’s Maine southern interior climate region (see blue region of state chart), the two sets of numbers should essentially be identical. However, as I theorize, my findings again suggest NOAA is using a computer algorithm to inflate heating degree-days with all the raw climate data processed by an average of more than 10 percent.
This new approach is documented on our new narrated PowerPoint series, Black Swan Climate Theory II [8] (BSCTII). It will be posted on YouTube by early June 2015. Here are some of the highlights of our findings.
Incredible discrepancy
There remained an incredible discrepancy of Heating Degree Days (HDD) between the two southern interior Maine data sets.

The green-shaded area of the above chart to the right represents NOAA’s HDD values for the southern interior region of Maine, which I downloaded in May 2015. The black bars represent the raw HDD data that I gathered for Lewiston/Auburn over the last 10 years. I observed negligible difference between NOAA’s data for southern interior Maine and for the entire state of Maine. The annual average HDD’s for 1895 to 2014 were:
* 7,565 based on the raw data for Lewiston/Auburn;
* 8,276 based on NOAA’s 2015 data for the entire state of Maine; and
* 8,381 based on NOAA’s 2015 data for the southern interior region of Maine (105 HDD colder than statewide! See NOAA table below).

Flawed NOAA algorithms
I expected the HDD’s for the state’s entire 32 zones to be greater than for Lewiston/Auburn’s Zone 19 because the statewide NOAA data includes the vast colder regions in the northern part of the state. However, NOAA’s published 2015 data indicates the southern interior region of Maine runs 0.288°F colder on average over the last 119 years! This points out another of many flaws in the NOAA data when an agency begins relying on computer algorithms over basic clean data from Mother Nature.
As I lay out my case in BSCTII, I contend that NOAA adjusted the data for all of Maine and for the southern interior region using the same algorithm shown in the first chart. NOAA’s HDD adjustments were kept small in the most recent decade then grew substantially in earlier decades of the 19th and 20th centuries.

The chart above is drawn from BSCTII, Part 3 of 6, YouTube presentation [9]. In the presentation, step-by-step, I compared the raw data for Lewiston/Auburn to NOAA’s data for the state of Maine. I was able to discern the two algorithms that I believe NOAA implemented in 2011 and in 2014. Mother Nature’s data is the solid black line in the chart. Deviations from Mother Nature is shown as the blue line (percentage adjustment detected in 2013 archived data); the red line shows the percentage adjustment made in 2014 (detected in 2015). The green line is the master algorithm, the net effect of the two adjustments (blue and red lines).
I speculate that NOAA intended to quietly rewrite climate history over two programming runs (2011 and 2014). Each would lower historical temperatures a total of approximately 130°F.
I speculate that computer programming errors were discovered internally by NOAA after the 2011 algorithm was launched. NOAA decreased the 1913 HDD by 10% as opposed to increasing it by that amount. NOAA made 1913 one of the hottest years in Maine’s history. They eventually corrected that error and others with their 2014 algorithm run. I was not the first to catch this major faux pas.
Joseph D’Aleo, did a paper in 2014, involving Farmington, Maine data in southern interior Zone 13. The title of his effort was “Data Set Changes Makes It Hard to Tell Real Story” [10]. He complained of a 5°F swing in 1913 for NOAA’s southern interior data. In my April study, I had detected a 4°F swing for 1913 based on statewide archived NOAA data.
Maine’s history made a total of 254°F cooler
The 2011 algorithm lowered Maine “statewide” temperatures around 103°F. The Phase II algorithm run in 2014 corrected the 1913 error and lowered overall temperatures an additional 151°F. I contend that the master algorithm is now fully operational and maintains that Maine’s statewide climate history is over 254°F lower than the original documented records between 1895 and 2014!
As detailed in BSCTII, I contend that NOAA has attempted to maintain a number of the climate “inflection points” for authenticity while minimizing or completely eliminating all but one cooling period between 1895 and 2014. Drawn from BSCTII, Part 5 of 6, YouTube presentation [11] the following chart shows originally three Black Swan events [12] found with the Lewiston-Auburn data (the black line) provided by Mother Nature.

Three have been reduced to a single Black Swan event on the NOAA data (the green line) from 2014 for the southern interior region of Maine. Based on this and many other revelations found in BSCTII, I concluded that NOAA’s explanation of the inclusion of Canadian data was not only fishy—it proved to be a red herring [13].
“NOAA continues to manipulate historic climate data”
Based on these findings, my ongoing working theory is that NOAA continues to manipulate historic climate data through single master computer algorithm. The master algorithm array serves as the “trick” to hide present and future Black Swan [14] regional cooling events in Maine. I have also found that identical tweaks were being made with the other individual states and United State as a whole. It is being done by consistently lowering historical temperatures on all processed climate data controlled by NOAA as will be illustrated below with archived data from 2013.

Algorithm applied nationwide…2014 a fabricated record
The graphs above illustrate how I contend NOAA applied a master algorithm “trick” not only to Maine, but to the United States as a whole. The green graphs show NOAA’s HDD published in 2013 for Maine and the U.S. The blue graphs show NOAA’s HDD published in 2015 for the same two locations. As you can see, the HDD have been inflated in both cases by the same percentages. In 2014, it appears NOAA had completed cooling both Maine and U.S. climate history by increasing HDD over 5%. This permitted NOAA to lower historical temperatures in excess of 10% between 1895 and 2014. Now NOAA and government agencies could announce to the world that 2014 was one of the warmest years in U.S. (revised) history.
Ohio adjusted as well
Another example includes NOAA’s data associated with Ohio. The green graph below shows NOAA’s data for Ohio prior to its 2014 adjustment (but after the 2011 adjustment).

The blue shows the data after that adjustment. This second adjustment reduced Ohio’s historical temperatures by 83.8°F. You can see that it is the same pattern of adjustment as in Maine and the United States as a whole. I wonder if they needed Canadian meter stations here also!
NOAA’s data associated with Tennessee increased 18,802 HDD between 2013 and 2014. This reduced Tennessee’s historical temperature record an additional 51.5°F.
What is NOAA’s rational for the major correction here? The pattern is the same.
Based on my research to date, I have concluded that:
Whosoever holds the algorithm for interpreting and documenting past climate history possess the power to shape a nation’s perception of present climate and the funding solutions. Are we experiencing global warming or global cooling? It depends on whose historical climate data we are examining!
NOAA admitted to rewriting temperature
I want to emphasize again that NOAA admitted to massive rewrites of Maine “statewide” history on May 6, 2015. NOAA indicated all these changes to include Canadian stations were necessary to make sure the data truly reflected Maine history over the last 120 years.
How do they explain similar adjustments to Maine’s southern interior region, Tennessee, Ohio and the United States as a whole? 
Every U.S. state for which I kept archived NOAA data had been corrupted in an identical manner. At this point in time, my theory that NOAA is rewriting U.S. climate history with a computer algorithm appears to still be valid.
Summary
I contend that the NOAA computer program essentially uses a very simple algorithm array, that automatically takes each historical year of local data and “shapes it” to fit into an overall mosaic NOAA wants to project to the scientific community and the general public.

The table below lists “Year”, “NOAA Master Algorithm Adjustment”, and the “Anti-Master Algorithm”.

The Anti-Master algorithm is nothing more than the reciprocal of NOAA’s algorithm.
This entire affair seems reminiscent of the early 1990s. The following chart below shows the multiple warming and cooling (Black Swan) periods over the last 1,100 years.

In 1990, the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the graph seen in Chart 1. It showed that the Middle Ages were warmer than today, in what was called the “Medieval Warming Period”. Then, around the 14th century, society begins its descent into a series of “Black Swan” cooling climate events. We plunged into the “Little Ice Age” period from which we gradually emerged in the early 1700s. There were at least five major Black Swan events over this time period.
In the late 1990s Michael Mann published Chart 2 which redefined climate history and eliminated numerous Black Swan events. A Congressional investigation uncovered numerous errors in Mann’s chart and the IPCC dropped it from the Summary of Policymakers for its 2007 report. Unfortunately, the false hockey stick is still cited by advocates of the “science-is settled” position [15]. This includes powerful members of NOAA and the current U.S. administration.
Are we now remaking American climate history to adhere to Mann’s disappearing hockey stick? I have theorized that NOAA has possibly attempted a similar approach for inconvenient climate history in Maine and across the United States.
The following chart shows the result of applying NOAA’s algorithm to the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine data (the black line). The result is NOAA’s green line.

In the transformation you eliminate two of the three Black Swans. This chart thereafter falls in line with Michael Mann’s chart from the late 1990’s that cited only one Black Swan event in the last hundred years.
My theory is that, if you begin with NOAA’s “adjusted” data and apply the anti-algorithm, you return the “processed data” back to how Mother Nature provided us the information in the first place.
USA likely in a state of cooling since 1990s
As a last example, on the chart below, we will take NOAA’s “processed” data for the United States climate history and apply the “anti-algorithm array” (see table above).

The application of the anti-algorithm would indicate the United States, as a whole, might have been in a state of regional cooling since the late 1990s, as is presently true of Maine when you use Mother Nature’s original data.
“…certain individuals in NOAA have being hoisting a fraud on taxpayers”
If my theory is proven correct, it would mean certain individuals in NOAA have being hoisting a fraud on taxpayers of the U.S. and around the world. It has added up to trillions of dollars over the decade. [16]
As noted in BSCT and BSCTII, I play a short video clip of Doctor Feynman explaining how theories are generated and how they should be tested repeatedly.

We expect no less here. I welcome a thorough examination of my algorithm theory.
In Black Swan Climate Theory II we explain, in depth, why, in my opinion, I believe this is not an accident. I have concluded American basic climate data has been hijacked and corrupted within NOAA through the use of a simple master computer algorithm that I have repeated here.
Profound implications
Based on the evidence from Maine, Ohio, Tennessee and consolidated U.S. climate data presented in the BSCT series; and should my theory be validated, the implications are profound. It would indicate we presently live in a nation where an agency of the Federal government has taken it upon themselves to rewrite the history of climate for the fifty different individual states of the Union.
If my theory proves correct, billions of dollars of climate data has been corrupted within a formerly great organization. Worse, decisions worth trillions of dollars are being made presently on fraudulent climate data. As well-intended as I believe most NOAA associates are, I implore NOAA to please make available the plain, unexciting, unfiltered temperature data provided by Mother Nature.
Throw the environmental activists [17] out! The litmus test for me is when NOAA’s climate data agrees with both satellite data and local archived data.

"Thriving doesn’t quite cover it. New data released quietly late last week underscores the staggering pace of growth of renewable energy across Australia. Nearly 3.5 gigawatts of large-scale clean energy projects were built in 2018. In capacity terms, this is more than twice the scale of Hazelwood, the giant Victorian brown coal plant that shut abruptly a couple of years ago, and it more than tripled the previous record for renewable energy installed in one year, set in 2017.  In generation terms, the amount of clean electricity being sent into Australian homes and businesses is expected to increase 36% this year, and should grow another 25% next year. The Clean Energy Regulator, which released the report, says this makes Australia the global leader in per capita renewable energy deployment. In an outcome considered near impossible four years ago, the country already has enough projects committed to meet the national 2020 renewable energy target, roughly equivalent to about 23% of electricity required. The regulator says Australia will go close to generating a level of clean power next year that the parliament legislated to avoid in 2015, after the Abbott government considered trying to abolish the 2020 target altogether before settling on reducing it by about a fifth. With the target surpassed and the incentives associated with it no longer available for new developments, analysts say large clean energy plants are being built based more on commercial factors. While state targets are playing a role, notably in Victoria, the dramatic fall in the cost of clean energy has driven businesses to sign direct contracts with new renewable energy suppliers to avoid high market prices, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. Hugh Saddler, an energy consultant and honorary associate professor at ANU’s Crawford School of Public Policy, says the pace of growth is equivalent to the electricity boom of the 1950s, when new coal and hydro plants transformed the electricity system. In a new report for the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, he says the most populous state, NSW, doubled the power it received from large-scale wind and solar plants in just 14 months. “There are just heaps of projects in the pipeline,” Saddler says. “NSW has lagged behind South Australia and Victoria for windfarms in particular, and Queensland has been even worse, but that has changed.” He says the new renewable projects in NSW should comfortably fill the gap that will arise when the Liddell coal-fired plant shuts in 2022, a planned event deemed so potentially disastrous a year ago that the Coalition under Malcolm Turnbull attempted to put pressure on the plant’s owner, AGL, into reversing its decision. The surge in clean generation is creating conditions that would have been unimaginable not so long ago. For a brief period last weekend, so much energy was being captured from the wind and sun, and demand for electricity use dropped so low, that the spot price for wholesale electricity simultaneously fell to $0 in each of the five eastern states connected through the national grid. At that moment, 44% of the electricity being used across the market was from a renewable source, compared with 26% across the week. In terms of power bills, the zero price was mostly inconsequential. It was brief – most electricity is sold at long-term contract prices and the wholesale cost is only a fraction of what people are ultimately charged. But Tristan Edis, a director and analyst with consultants Green Energy Markets, says it was a significant moment for what it points to. “I was surprised it happened, but what it tells us is it could soon end up happening on days when demand is not low,” he says. “We are adding so much solar on top of existing solar at the moment. It is making a real difference in the middle of the day.” The transformation under way is posing serious questions for regulators and generating companies. Coal-fired power plants, which still provide more than 60% of grid electricity, have traditionally been considered inflexible and capable of operating around the clock. Some black coal plants in NSW are being turned off during periods when it is not profitable to run them. Others are coming under increasing pressure as the amount of renewable generation increases. While the government now requires electricity generators to give three years’ notice before they shut a power plant down – an attempt to avoid a repeat of the abrupt closure of Hazelwood – analysts believe it is highly likely some will stop operating sooner than currently planned. A big question for the clean energy industry is: can the pace of investment last? As Guardian Australia reported last year, conventional wisdom has been that clean energy investment and the pace of change in the system would fall off once the renewable energy target stopped driving new projects unless there was a new national policy to replace it. The federal government has no plans to introduce one, beyond a shortlist of projects it is considering underwriting but is yet to develop. State targets have generally been considered not enough to fill the void. That remains the most popular view. The Clean Energy Regulator says investment after 2020 remains uncertain. But the Australian Electricity Market Operator last year found that even a business-as-usual path, including Victoria’s target of 50% renewables, was likely to lead to about 46% clean energy by 2030. Analyses had found that Australia could and would need to do more to play its part in achieving the Paris climate agreement goal of limiting global heating to as close to 1.5C as possible. Edis points out that some of the clean energy investment decisions now coming through were made when wholesale prices were high. As more generation comes on, supply outstrips demand and prices fall, there is less incentive to build unless a government policy requires it. “To be honest, I expected the investment would have slowed a fair bit earlier,” Edis says. “My feeling is it should drop away over the next six months or so. Investors will then be looking for the next coal plant to cark it.” Saddler is less certain. He sees roadblocks to further investment, including the challenge of connecting clean energy plants on greenfield sites to the grid and the need to “firm” variable renewable generation with increased between-state transmission cables and energy storage. But he says analysts and bureaucrats increasingly think some spending may continue in a way that was not expected a year ago. “It’s really just the commonwealth that’s a brake on things,” he says. “The question now is: how significant a brake are they?”"

"The true cost of cheap, unhealthy food is a spiralling public health crisis and environmental destruction, according to a high-level commission. It said the UK’s food and farming system must be radically transformed and become sustainable within 10 years. The commission’s report, which was welcomed by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, concluded that farmers must be enabled to shift from intensive farming to more organic and wildlife friendly production, raising livestock on grass and growing more nuts and pulses. It also said a National Nature Service should be created to give opportunities for young people to work in the countryside and, for example, tackle the climate crisis by planting trees or restoring peatlands.  “Our own health and the health of the land are inextricably intertwined [but] in the last 70 years, this relationship has been broken,” said the report, which was produced by leaders from farming, supermarket and food supply businesses, as well as health and environment groups, and involved conversations with thousands of rural inhabitants. “Time is now running out. The actions that we take in the next 10 years are critical: to recover and regenerate nature and to restore health and wellbeing to both people and planet,” said the commission, which was convened by the RSA, a group focused on pressing social challenges. The commission said most farmers thought they could make big changes in five to 10 years if they got the right backing. “Farmers are extraordinarily adaptable,” said Sue Pritchard, director of the RSA commission and an organic farmer in Wales. “We have to live with change every single day of our lives. “We are really keen that farmers feel they are in the driving seat and that they can be a force of change. At the moment, a lot of farmers feel beleaguered and that they have become the bad guys. But without sustainable, secure and safe farming in the UK, we will not survive.” The commission criticised decades of government policy aimed at making food cheaper, fuelling rising obesity and other health problems. “The true cost of that is simply passed off elsewhere in society – in a degraded environment, spiralling ill health and impoverished high streets,” said the report. Pritchard said the UK had the third cheapest basket of food in the developed world, but also had the highest food poverty in Europe in terms of people being able to afford a healthy diet. Type 2 diabetes, a diet-related illness, costs the UK £27bn a year, she said. The commission also said agriculture produced more than 10% of the UK’s climate-heating gases and was the biggest destroyer of wildlife; the abundance of key species has fallen 67% since 1970 and 13% of species are now close to extinction. To solve these crises, the commission said “agroecology” practices must be supported – such as organic farming and agroforestry, where trees are combined with crops and livestock such as pigs or egg-laying hens. The commission has also adapted for the UK a recently published scientific diet that is both nutritious and environmentally sustainable. While it and other studies recommend large reductions in meat-eating, Pritchard said: “There is a strong case to be made [in the UK] to support sustainable beef and lamb in the places where grass is the best thing to grow.” The so-called planetary health diet calls for more nuts and pulses in diets and Pritchard said these and more vegetables could be grown in the UK. Hazelnuts and walnuts are native to the UK, she pointed out, and some farmers are now starting to grow crops like lentils and quinoa, as well as beans and peas. The commission said the government must develop a plan to put the countryside and the communities living there at the centre of the green economy. “[Brexit] creates a once-in-50-years opportunity to change our food and farming system, but we need to act now: the climate emergency makes urgent, radical action on the environment essential,” said Sir Ian Cheshire, chair of the RSA commission and also a senior government adviser. Gove said: “This report raises issues that are hugely important. We know that it is in the interests of farmers and landowners to move to a more sustainable model.” He added that the government’s agriculture bill would reward farmers with public money for public goods and a new “farm to fork” food review would look to ensure everyone had access to healthy British food. The report was backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “This monumental report is a powerful and profound account of the ecological transformation of our food and farming system that we urgently need – and where we can start.” The commission said a new non-profit bank should be set up to provide finance to farmers investing in new practices. With Brexit uncertainty worrying farmers, the commission urged minister to stop delays on policy and trade decisions and commit to a future-proof ambition by January 2020. It also said schools, hospitals and prisons should buy more sustainably produced British food. Prof Joanna Price, the vice-chancellor of the Royal Agricultural University, said: “The report paints an honest picture of the challenges and sets out some bold ideas to address them. We strongly agree that farming can be a force for positive change and that rural communities can thrive as a powerhouse for a green economy.”"

==================================
The online SVZ here reported yesterday on a wind-turbine construction accident occurring in Southern Germany. Workers of the Hamburg-based Nordex company were operating a large hoisting crane by remote control as it lifted the 60-tonne wind turbine rotor assembly for mounting onto the 200-meter tall tower. At 60 meters height the entire assembly came crashing down onto the earth below.
See photo here.
According to an eyewitness, a gust of wind may have caused the rotor to strike the tower before falling. The SVZ reports that the impact likely caused irreparable damage to the structure’s foundation, and so the entire turbine unit will have to be rebuilt complete from scratch. Damage is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands of euros. No one was injured.
The accident is now under investigation and a construction strop has been ordered until the cause of the accident is determined. The SVZ writes that the estimated cost of a new wind turbine is near 5 million euros.

By Michael Limburg, EIKE
[Translated, edited by P. Gosselin]
Tübingen mayor Boris Palmer is considered as one of the Green Party’s more moderate realists. However when it comes to the facts about the pie-in-the-sky “Energiewende” (transition to renewable energies), the moderate realism comes to an abrupt end. Suddenly it turns to bad-mounting and insults, as one citizen in the beautiful region of Stauferfeld found out when bringing up the laws of nature – which in fact also apply even to green ideology. Idyllic Stauferfeld is planned to receive an array of wind turbines.
Though we are not the New York Times, we took the liberty of publishing Palmer’s disrespectful e-mail.
Photo: Tübingen mayor, Green Party member, Boris Palmer. Photo by: Manfred Grohe

It all started with a concerned citizen sending an e-mail to Tübingen’ s honorable burgermeister Herr Boris Palmer:
From: XXXXXXX
Sent: Tuesday, 28 April 2015 11:09 p.m.
To: Palmer, Boris, University City Tübingen
Subject: AW: FAZ article of 2 April 15: Industrialization of our landscape with wind energy machinery
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
At the former military depot 3 units will be installed, and the other 3 will be installed in untouched nature 700 meters away from the Adelberg Convent and the Herrenbachstausee nature recreation centre, right in the middle of beautiful Stauferland!
The military depot is indeed an untouched paradise for red kite birds, bats, and for rare woodcocks.
In Baden-Württemberg you can install as much wind energy and for as long as you can, and the only thing that we will surely get for it is a high number of installed capacity. However you will never get a base load capacity with renewable energies because we still do not have a sensible storage technology.
What we are getting: a huge amount of waste electricity when the wind blows, which we have to get rid of in foreign countries at a high expense. And when there is little or no wind blowing, we get the power from coal or nuclear.
Unfortunately: zero times as much installed wind capacity as you want always equals zero!
Please convince us of the opposite!
The expansion of renewable energies will certainly not fail because of resistance from citizens, but rather because of the laws of nature. It is not possible to plan wind and solar energy. They can be stored only minimally, and they will not meet the demand peaks of consumption!

But maybe we first have to first completely cover Germany with wind turbines, corn fields and solar fields in order to comprehend this.
Hopefully in this case at least the nuclear power plants in our neighboring countries are safe enough so that us German do-gooders do not perish some time soon because of a French or Polish nuclear catastrophe!
Yours sincerely,
XXXXXXX

Dear Frau XXXXXXX,
to be loud and clear about it: In the termionology of the Rems Valley, your egotistical and unknowledgeable blather deserves only one characterization: damn stupid nonsense.
Zero knowledge times zero willingness to be responsible = zero importance.
To conclude with natural laws that we should not use what is in fact an endless supply of an energy type so that we can instead use up the last remnants of coal and gas from the earth requires a blindness that is certainly beyond any cure.
Feel free to send this e-mail to the New York Times.

Dear Herr Palmer,
You may of course portray me as egotistical and damn stupid, but it does not bother me at all.
In any case you are going to find it increasingly difficult to counter my arguments and those of many other citizens, except by using defamation and polemic.
With warm greetings from the beautiful wind-energy free Stauferland in lovely Tubingen.

Obviously the green movement has started getting awfully testy about the rapidly growing dissent over the failing wind and renewable energy dream in Germany.

"Germany’s Green party has proposed stay-at-home working to help the nation cope with record temperatures. Just as other Europeans have found themselves struggling to deal with unprecedented heat levels, Germans have also been trying to find ways to cool off. “Heat-free home office days” are the latest suggestion.  With experts warning that temperatures closer to 50C will soon become the norm – instead of the lower 40s as they were this week – the opposition Greens say the government needs a heat action plan enabling employees to stay at home. The party is calling for Hitzefrei or “heat-free” leave for workers and children. In a statement, the party, which is enjoying about 22.5% support in the polls, said: “We need to be prepared for the fact that these heatwaves are only going to continue, what with the ongoing climate crisis.” Anton Hofreiter, the head of the Greens parliamentary group, and Bettina Hoffmann, the party’s environmental expert, have drawn up the proposals as part of their heat action plan, calling for “home office” for all employees except those who for operational reasons have to go to work. The proposal came as forest fires raged around the town of Jüterborg in the state of Brandenburg, with 50 to 100 hectares alight. Firefighters could do little more than to look on due to the large number of munitions buried underground at the former GDR military training grounds with the danger of detonations making the burning forests too dangerous to enter. Even as temperatures lowered on Friday across western Europe in the wake of record highs in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Paris, the continent continued to feel the effects of the heatwave. In France, hundreds of hectares of fields caught fire in Oise, the nation’s second largest grain-producing region, resulting in farmers being ordered to stop harvesting. At least one farmer was killed when his harvester became engulfed in flames, local media reported. Belgium also suffered its first death as a direct result of the heatwave when the body of a 66-year-old woman was found near her caravan close to the beach. Harvesting is in full swing in France, the European Union’s largest grain producer and exporter, where searing temperatures this week broke records in many parts of the country as well . It was the first time the authorities have ordered a halt to the harvest in Oise, FNSEA, France’s largest farm union, said. The German Greens argue that those who work outdoors on construction sites or on farms are among millions who face a “health hazard” from the heat. Elsewhere, in residencies for the sick or elderly, “cool rooms” should be set up, the party said. It is also calling for the introduction of more green spaces, with “trees, parks, green open spaces and paths” providing “large cooling air-conditioning systems” for towns and cities.  France is seen as an example to follow, with its government working on the implementation of a similar multi-faceted heat action plan. Hoffmann said not only was employees’ health under threat but their concentration levels also suffered. “Because heat reduces performance and concentration ability, it’s also in the interests of our economy to protect people from the heat”. According to one medical expert, for every 10-degree increase in summer heat, productivity sinks by 30%. But employment representatives say the majority of German employees were needed in the workplaceand other measures had to be taken instead. Wolfgang Steiger of the ruling CDU’s economics council, called the Greens’ proposals unrealistic. “Work that needs to be done needs to be done, otherwise our economy cannot function,” he said. On Thursday, the highest temperature ever recorded was in Lingen in north-west Germany, where it reached 42.6C. Daniela Jacob of the Hamburg-based Climate Service Center Germany, is among a growing number of experts to argue that temperatures in the 40s will become a new norm and will creep closer to 50Cs over the next three decades. “If one believes in the regional climate models … we could be seeing temperatures of up to 44, 45 or 46C.” "

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning und Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Konrad Kleinknecht is a professor of experimental physics and researched at the universities of Heidelberg, Dortmund, Harvard, Mainz and Munich. His publications in the fields of high-energy physics have been awarded top prizes, among them the Leibniz-Prize of the DFS, the Energy Prize of the European Physical Society and the Stern Gerlach Medal of the Germany Physical Society (DPG).
Kleinknecht has thoroughly examined the German Energiewende (transition from fossil fuels and nuclear energy over to renewables) and given the project an overall grade of “poor”.
In his book Risky Energiewende: The way out of the deadend he presents his analysis to the public. In the book’s description we find:
The exit from the use of nuclear power in Germany was decided at a frantic speed in the summer of 2011. Now we are realizing that there is no realistic plan for revamping the energy supply within the set timeframe of ten years. For revamping the entire electricity supply, and with it the economy, the time period is too short. Missing are the solid empirical grounds on which the questions of energy supply reliability, financial feasibility, the impacts on the economic development and social justice are examined. Thus the Energiewende risks failing due to its contradictions. Even the responsible federal minister for economics and energy, Sigmar Gabriel, said in April 2014: ‘The truth is that the Energiewende is on the verge of failure.’
In his book Konrad Kleinknecht attempts to name the problems and to provide the answers. For him the following questions remain: What possibilities do we have to replace a part of the energy supply with wind power and solar energy? Which sources of electricity offer a reliable supply? Can we do without coal power? Do we need new national power transmission lines? How can we store electric energy? How high is the risk of a blackout during nights when the wind is still? Will electricity prices keep rising? With a fundamental reform of the EEG renewable energy feed-in act, is it still possible to avert the huge risks of the Energiewende?
The energy supply must serve the common good and be beneficial for Germany as an industrial nation. A blackout would be a catastrophe for the entire country, and it must be avoided under all circumstances. The author tells us how this can be achieved in his book.”
The German language book Risiko Energiewende: Wege aus der Sackgasse is available at Amazon for €19,99.

"In 2005, the philosopher Walter Sinnott-Armstrong wrote a paper, It’s Not My Fault, arguing that none of us has a moral obligation to reduce our carbon emissions. He didn’t deny the looming emergency; he simply couldn’t see, after running through the available ethical theories, how it could be my duty not to go on Sunday drives in my gas-guzzling SUV (to use his example). “No storms or floods or droughts or heatwaves can be traced to my individual act of driving,” he wrote. It’s true that lots of people driving, collectively, helps to cause storms and floods, but I’m not lots of people. And it misses the point to respond that you can calculate, say, the precise area of lost Arctic sea ice corresponding to one passenger’s transatlantic flight. You can – but I want to know that if I forgo the flight, the ice is likely to remain. And, thanks to the systemic nature of the climate crisis, that’s the link that can’t be made. Sinnott-Armstrong’s argument often enrages people who think of themselves as environmentalists. But I think that’s a reaction to the fear that he’s right – that there are no strictly rational grounds for making personal sacrifices for the climate. (In the same way, it’s often noted, it seems irrational to vote in an election, given the infinitesimal chance of your vote swinging the result.) And when it seems as if there’s no rational case for doing something, it’s extremely tempting to just not do it.  But there’s another option, which is not to insist on a rational justification before you act. That’s one of many lessons I took from Charles Eisenstein’s remarkable recent book, Climate: A New Story, which offers a perspective-jolting indictment of the current state of environmental activism. The way we’re fighting global heating, he maintains, unknowingly embodies the belief system that caused it in the first place. Locked in a “war mentality”, focused on fear-based appeals about the need to avert catastrophe in order to save our species, we’re being as instrumentalist as any corporate polluter, trying to manipulate the world to our ends, treating nature as a “thing”, separate from ourselves, that we need to control. Eisenstein argues for a “deeper revolution”, in which we understand that we are nature. Everything is. And one consequence is to realise that the standard question we ask about climate-related lifestyle changes – “What direct and measurable difference am I making?” – might not be the right one. Viewed from the old mindset, the governing ethos of this revolution is bound to seem intolerably soppy. We should care for the Earth, Eisenstein suggests, out of love for the Earth. But aren’t we accustomed to the idea that love is a sufficient reason to take caring actions in other areas of life? The environmentalist Derrick Jensen has written that when people ask why he bothers, he tells them: “Because I’m in love. With salmon, with trees outside my window, with baby lampreys living in sandy stream bottoms… And if you love, you act to defend your beloved. Of course results matter to you, but they don’t determine whether or not you make the effort.” You make the effort anyway.  Charles Eisenstein and his guests chart a course beyond both optimism and despair about the climate, and everything else, in his podcast, A New and Ancient Story. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"
"A former senior government analyst has accused the Trump administration of “undercutting evidence” of the threat to national security from the climate crisis after his report on the issue was blocked by the White House. Rod Schoonover, who worked as an intelligence analyst for the federal government for 10 years before resigning earlier this month, submitted a written testimony on the “wide-ranging implications” of global heating over the next 20 years, for submission to the House intelligence committee last month.  But he said on Tuesday that the report was stopped by the White House because his findings “did not comport with administration’s position on climate change”. That prompted him to leave his post – one of a stream of scientists sidelined or forced out over what critics of the Trump administration characterize as a war on science, because warnings for the dangers of human-caused global heating conflict with the Donald Trump’s industrial objectives. “The decision to block the written testimony is another example of a well-established pattern in the Trump administration of undercutting evidence that contradicts its policy positions,” Schoonover wrote in an opinion article for the New York Times, published on Tuesday. “Beyond obstructing science, this action also undermined the analytic independence of a major element of the intelligence community.” At the last minute he said he was permitted to verbally summarize the 11-page testimony at the hearing, but it was not a full analysis. “The bottom line of written testimony was this: ‘Climate change will have wide-ranging implications for US national security over the next 20 years,’” he wrote. Schoonover, who previously worked as a tenured university professor and has a background in physics and chemistry, said the report included peer-reviewed studies, as well as the findings of government scientists. “The intelligence community has repeatedly warned of the dangers that climate change poses to national security,” he wrote, citing the outgoing director of national intelligence Daniel Coats’s warning about the likely future impact of the climate crisis. Coats, who is soon to be replaced by the Texas Republican and Trump loyalist John Ratcliffe, wrote in the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment that the climate crisis and environmental and ecological degradation “are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress and social discontent through 2019 and beyond”. Schoonover said the impact of environmental changes are likely to include issues with global food and water security, increased migration and political and economic instability. The Trump administration is routinely ignoring or blocking expertise from being aired, according to whistleblowers and groups that track agency decisions. Maria Caffrey, a former climate scientist for the National Park Service, recently filed a whistleblower complaint and testified to Congress that she was prevented from publishing data about the potential flooding of coastal parks as a result of rising sea levels. “In February 2019, I lost my job because I was a climate scientist in a climate-denying administration,” she wrote in an opinion article for the Guardian. “And yet my story is no longer unique.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermans often express dismay at the fact that American public is making Donald Trump a front runner. I’m often asked: “How can Americans be so stupid?”
To answer that, lately I’ve been telling them to just look right at home in Germany. When elected officials don’t take the public seriously, then political heads roll. Welcome to democracy.
Last Sunday the German state of Hesse, home of financial center Frankfurt, held municipal elections. The results were (for some) eye-popping. Like in America, mainstream politicians are taking massive blows.
Not only are people fed up with the arrogance of the political mainstream in USA, but so it is in Germany as well.
Over the past weeks and months there’s been a lot of grumbling among the German public amid accusations the mainstream parties have stopped taking their worries and concerns seriously. The biggest issue of concern, among many, is the mass immigration of Muslims into Europe and the continent’s security.
Voters in the state of Hesse have made their voices heard
Angela Merkel’s CDU party took a major blow in a number of cities in Hesse. The anti-immigrant, rightwing AfD party won 13.2 percent of votes in Hesse on Sunday, making them the third largest party behind Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), who won 28.2 percent and 28.0% respectively. The German Green party lost almost one third of their voters.

Over the years Angela Merkel has shifted the party to the center, making it almost indistinguishable from its traditional rival center-left SPD socialist party on a number issues. This naturally left the right political spectrum wide open for the taking. Today mainstream Germans politicians are aghast that the AfD has rushed in to fill the massive political void. Last Sunday’s election showed this in the clearest terms.
German mainstream parties in collapse
And things are only getting even worse for the mainstream parties. Today Germany’s once traditional CDU and SPD parties find themselves in full blown collapse.
This coming Sunday the rich southern state of Baden Württemberg will be holding state elections, and both mainstream parties are expected to see astonishing losses. Merkel’s CDU is forecast to pick up only a miserable 28.5% of the vote, a whopping 10.5% less than 5 years ago. The socialist SPD party faces total ruin, projected to pick up only 12.5% of the vote, which is 10.6% less then the already miserable 23.1% they got in 2011. The hard right AfD on the other hand, is expected to haul in 12.5%.
German Minister scolds the public
Many leaders of the old mainstream parties are now lashing out at the latest results of democracy, some even taking it upon themselves to scold the citizens. An angry Sigmar Gabriel of the SPD party said Monday, for example, “There is, damn it, a responsibility by the citizens for this democracy.” In other words, Gabriel’s view of democracy is one that does not offer any options. Vote for what we say, or shut the hell up.
Mr. Gabriel is the German Minister who recently warned that Americans should not be voting for Donald Trump!
Is it any wonder these old crusty politicians are losing relevance faster than immigrants are coming in? It’s not the citizens who need to take their responsibilities seriously – rather it’s the political leaders themselves.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProminent German nutritionist Udo Pollmer (photo right), a frequent guest of the media on issues concerning food, recently commented on and dismissed here the UN’s latest claim that especially processed meats cause colon cancer and red meats show a strong link.
Background here.
In the deutschlandradiokultur.de segment Pollmer first says that the science in the report is difficult to judge because the study has not been yet made open to the public. He adds, however, that the old playbook seems to be at work: create a lot of publicity and later should it turned out to be wrong, all will be forgotten. “This alone shows that it has little to do with scientific truth.”
Based on a mere 27 studies, not 800!
First the meta-analysis did not involve 800 studies, as the media all trumpeted. Pollmer says:
As by coincidence along with the WHO, also US epidemiologists assessed the global database: and they found only 38 studies that fulfilled the minimum criteria. From that after excluding parallel publications only 27 remained.”
As a result Pollmer writes that the UN meta-analysis is fundamentally inconclusive. Pollmer adds that the collection of the data based on questionnaires from many different countries is unreliable because the subjects themselves did not even know what was in the meat products.
Another problem Pollmer sees with the WHO study is that the study focused only on colon cancer rates, and not the overall rate of all cancers.

How can we know if sausage is cancer-causing, or perhaps even reduces the overall cancer rate?”
Pollmer says the correct way to conduct the study would be to put a group on a high meat diet and another on a very low meat diet. Such a study does not exist for meat, but does so with plant fiber. He writes:
By the administration of wheat bran, the number of adenomas (non-cancerous tumors] (the precursors for cancer) in the colon increased.”
Pollmer feels that the WHO is singling out processed meats in an attempt to label them the villain and that the organization is using the word “cancer” to “intimidate the public”.
At the end Pollmer asks: if meat were bad for humans, over the past 4 million years of evolution would it not have long since removed those who had eaten it?
Of course the meat eaters are here today, and instead it appears that the vegans were the ones who were naturally selected. Today they are making a comeback, but only thanks to modern food production technology and mass availability.
As for the rest of us who are concerned about remaining healthy, eat fatty meat, and especially food products made from the organs!

Share this...FacebookTwitterSnowfan at wobleibtdieerderwärmung.de features a spotless sun and quite possibly the start of cooling now that the planet is well past the peak of the recent El Niño event. What follows are some excerpts, with some editing to shorten the text to save a little time.
============================
The sun goes on strike: First spotless day this year! The earth is cooling down!
By Schneefan
The sun is on strike as for the first time since 17 July 2014 it showed an absence of sunspots. Solar activity is unusually weak.

On June 3, 2016 there were no visible sunspots. Source: sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/html.
Already at the end of May 2015 and at the end of March 2016 only a little solar activity was observed. Low solar activity leads to a global and regional cooling. That was known already in the 18th century, as some people got rich in the wheat business.
The current solar cycle (SC) 24 is the weakest in over 100 years.
And since using the new counting method July 1, 2015 (sunspot relative number) SC 24 may be the weakest in almost 200 years: Solar activity since 1700 – meteo.plus:
The following diagram shows the relative numbers for the time period 1820 until the present (source: SIDC), which are calculated using the sunspot numbers. The light green color depicts the daily value. The dark color shows the monthly and yearly average. For the long-term trend, a red line with the 5.5-year (i.e. half a cycle) average has been added, as well as a blue line showing the 30-year average.

Solar cycle 24 has been weak in comparison to the cycles of the past 200 years. The highest daily value so far for the current cycle has been only 135 sunspots. No cycle has been this weak since SC 7 (starting in the year 1823). The monthly average values are currently very low. Source: Solar Activity since 1700 – meteo.plus.
Notice:
On July 1, 2015, the relative numbers were replaced by a homogenized version. The new relative numbers are now immediately available. Comparison between the old and the new version shows the differences. More info at SIDC/SILSO.”
The mean international sunspot relative number (SN Ri) of the last 13 years starting in June 2003 up through May 2016 is SN 39 – considerably below the critical value of SN 50. http://sidc.oma.be/silso/datafiles.
This may have implications as some experts believe the threshold is met for cooling. The Berliner Wetterkarte here writes:
Mean sunspot numbers for each cycle of more than (approx.) 50 over a longer time period are associated with above-normal temperatures. If the mean sunspot number for each cycle is below 50, then below normal temperatures result, i.e. a cold period!…”
The time lag for a weak sun’s impact on climate, depending on the thermal inertia of the oceans – and depending on the study – is between 8 and 20 years: Time lag earth’s climate vs. sun = 14 + – 6 years.

From June 1997 to January 2016 global temperatures made a pause. Using the unfalsified satellite temperatures from RSS:

“Figure 1. The least-squares linear-regression trend on the RSS satellite monthly global mean surface temperature anomaly dataset shows no global warming for 18 years 8 months since May 1997, though one-third of all anthropogenic forcings have occurred during the period of the Pause.“ Source: The Pause hangs on by its fingernails
The powerful El Niño event of late 2015 has temporarily ended the warming pause:

RSS lower troposphere temperature data since 1978 shows statistically insignificant temperature rise since 1998. Source: www.woodfortrees.org/trend
Using UAH satellite data, since March the temperature has been falling as the warming effects of the recent El Niño fade:

Source: UAH Global Temperature Update for May, 2016: +0.55 deg. C
NCEP data also show that cooling continues in June 2016, as the following chart depicts:

Source: weatherbell.com/temperature.php
Since the El Niño has faded, the oncoming projected cooling La Niña is expected to arrive over the coming months: El Niño is dead, La Niña lives! – ENSO update May 2016.
Thus it may be only a question of months before the global warming pause resumes and the Earth cools with the weak sun.
Moreover the Svensmark Mechanism between weak solar activity and thus stronger cosmic rays can result in up to 100 times more powerful cloud formation in the troposphere. This has recently been confirmed by the research results at CERN.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. med Johannes Mayer made a presentation on the serious hazards of infrasound (1 – 20 Hz) from wind turbines saying: “It is unbelievable the flood of international scientific publications that has appeared over the last one and half years.”

In the presentation Mayer cites “120 scientific papers” confirming the hazardous impacts of infrasound on human health.
Bogus claims infrasound is safe
Mayer blasts the lobby-backed claims (based on measurements taken by unsuitable instruments) that infrasound generated by wind turbines is harmless to humans and wildlife and presents a number of studies showing how the very opposite is true.
At 7:35 Mayer tells the audience that 5 years ago he also used to believe that infrasound was not a real factor for anyone a kilometer or further away from the source. But after having researched the new literature on the topic he concluded that infrasound is a serious factor on the health of humans even at far greater distances.
At the 8:20 mark Mayer explains how infrasound acts on the human inner ear and interacts with the brain, and the serious effects it can have on the human organs, citing a study from medical journal Lancet. “It’s confirmed by numerous scientific papers,” Mayer tells the audience. At 9:15 Mayer presents:
The short term effects on infrasound
– pressure in the ears
– anxiety feelings
– dizziness
– exhaustion
– tiredness in the morning
– respiration disturbance
Also experiments have been done on animals, and results show profound impacts on their physiology and health, ranging from changes in hormone levels and immunological parameters to damage to lung tissue, Mayer shows. At 10:08 he presents:
The long term impacts of infrasound
– chronic respiratory disorders
– chronic stress and sleep disorders from higher stress hormone levels
– emotional disorder, depression, burnout
– high blood pressure, heart disease

And the symptoms of infrasound illness:
– depression
– irritability
– tension
– headache
– mental and physical exhaustion
– concentration and sleep disorders
– noise sensitization
All of this is caused the constant low pressure waves acting on the inner ear and fooling the body into thinking it is in motion when in fact it is not. Infrasound interferes with the body’s natural biorhythms. Mayer concludes this results in infrasound from wind turbines being “a problem to be taken very seriously”.
Especially dangerous for pregnant women
At the 15:50 mark Mayer reminds the audience that even European officials issued directives regulating infrasound and pregnant women, writing that “they should not perform activities that could generate strong low frequency vibrations because they could increase the risk of a miscarriage or premature birth.”
Mayer emphasizes that the effects of infrasound are not something imagined in people’s heads, but are in fact very real. It is even diagnosed as an illness by doctors.
“Turbines should not even be in sight”
Mayer blasts wind-turbine German government agencies for their refusal to acknowledge the very real health facts and for blindly following everything the wind lobby tells them. He cites medical expert Dr. Reinhard Bartsch of the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena (20:35):
From today’s level of knowledge wind turbines should be placed only far away from residential areas, and better: they should not even be in sight.”
At the 21-minute mark Mayer presents major publications on infrasound. Studies by Thorne and Salt show that up to 40% of people are sensitive to infrasound and that the health of these people who live near wind parks is “considerably and seriously affected (injured) by this noise“.
Finally, a Canadian review of 62 scientific publications appearing in the Canadian Journal of Rural Medicine concluded that industrial wind turbines have “negative health impacts” on people who live in their vicinity.
Mayer praises regulations on distances from homes in Canada and New Zealand, which restrict the construction of wind turbines to 4 and 3 km away respectively.

By Robin Pittwood of the Kiwi Thinker
Having just updated the climate bet, which confirms the lack of recent warming (ie: the ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ as some call it), I thought next we should take a look at global energy emissions on the same time comparative basis.
For those who are not sure of the background, take a look at a few of my previous posts on ‘The Bet’ and you’ll soon catch on. We are comparing two decades; a past decade Jan 2001 to Dec 2010, and a current decade Jan 2011 to Dec 2020. Of course we are only part way through the current decade, so we’re not making a full comparison.
Here’s the (very unexciting … even boring) graph.

The data is monthly outgoing long wave infrared radiation (OLWIR) provided by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). I have totalled the energy emitted (OLWIR) in W/m2 units from each 2.5 by 2.5 degree latitude and longitude area to arrive at a global monthly average for each month. Then, in order to show emitting energy over the decade I have divided each monthly figure by 120 (the number of months in a decade) and produced an accumulating total.

The first four years of the comparison shows hardly any difference. The current decade (green line) sits right on top of the past decade (red line). The blue line zooms in on the difference, which is just the difference multiplied by 100. The heat is going into space in very nearly the same quantity as usual.
It is also worth noting (some would think worth highlighting) that the current decade shows slightly higher emissions, while temperature shows slight cooling. Higher outgoing energy, at the same time as a lower temperature, is exactly opposite to what the global warming models tell us will happen.
Also – all that talk of the missing heat hiding in the oceans. It’s just scary story. The missing energy is speeding away at 300,000,000 m/s, past Alpha-Centauri and beyond … and will never be seen again.

The preliminary report for September weather in Switzerland is out. Hat-tip: Kurt in Switzerland.
According to the Swiss Meteorological and Climatological Office, September was 0.8 deg. Celsius colder than the norm for the month, based on the averages for the period of 1981-2010. A blast of polar air early in the month saw temperatures plunge to as much as 7°C below normal. Snow fell at elevations down to 1800 meters.
Later in the month temperatures fell once again, dropping to as much as 7°C below normal in the Alps. The snow fell to elevations as low as 1400 meters on the north side of the Alps.
Interestingly in Swtzerland this year the autumn crocuses blossomed more than week earlier than the 1981-2010 mean. The Swiss Met office writes that “in many areas the blossoms were already observed in August“. Also foliage colors from a variety of trees were observed to be earlier than normal, writes the Swiss Met.
Holland sees coldest September in 15 years
Also reader Vermeer writes in a comment that the Netherlands had it coolest September in 15 years. The mean temperature in De Bilt was a nippy 13.4 °C , 1.1 °C below average. There were only two days with a maximum above 20°C. Highest only 20.2 °C. This was the lowest high September maximum in 50 years.

Schneefan at German climate science site wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de writes here that the NOAA’s ENSO model CFSv2 saw considerable deficiency with its recent forecasting, which not long ago foresaw ongoing global warming El Niño conditions for 2016.
What follows is the BOM Climate Model Summary from 16 March 2016 with the NOAA/CFSv2 prognosis:


The mean is depicted by the lowest bar. In mid March many ENSO models were already predicting La Niña conditions by August 2016. The NOAA/CFSv2 is a clear outlier. Source: www.bom.gov.au/climatePacific-Ocean
The NOAA/CFSv2 modelers have in the meantime admitted to a cold bias in their programming, foremost at the equatorial in the Atlantic, which led to a false computation of the equatorial Pacific (ENSO) computation, as Dr. Roy Spencer of the UAH reported: Impact of CFSv2 Model Fix on 2016 La Nina Forecast.

The false, overly warm NOAA result is shown in the “Before fix” image below (left). The corrected version is depicted by the “After fix” image (right). Note the huge difference we see in the equatorial Pacific region. The chart below shows the anomaly from the mean:


Screenshot: The charts by Dr. Ryan Maue show the projected SSTA by the NOAA/CFSv2 for September 2016 generated on 29 March 2016 before the error was corrected (left) and after the correction (right). Suddenly a La Niña appears in the forecast. Source: Impact of CFSv2 Model Fix on 2016 La Nina Forecast. 
The Australian BOM Weather Services consequently removed the “warm” NOAA/CFSv2-ENSO forecast from its “ClimateModelSummary” (see chart above) and thus the mean forecast of the remaining ENSO models for August 2016 stands at -0.7°K, thus putting it clearly in La Niña territory:

The mean of all models (bottom bar) – without the NOAA/CFSv2. The forecast is  -0.7 °K deviation in August 2016.  Source: www.bom.gov.au/climate/Pacific-Ocean.
The current CFSv2-ENSO prognosis is now approaching the mean of the other ENSO model forecasts (blue lines). Some models are showing very powerful La Niña conditions close to -3° K hitting later this year. Only the old, too-warm calculations (shown by the bold black dashed line) is falsely in the positive range:

The plot above shows the partially corrected ENSO forecast of 1 April 2016 for the SSTA in the ENSO 3.4 area for the coming months. The current (corrected cold) forecasts (blue lines) are, for some, showing La Niña values of -0.5°K and colder already arriving in June. In autumn 2016 many models are forecasting -2.0°K and colder! Preliminary indications are showing a powerfully cold La Niña is in the pipeline. Every new ENSO forecast is becoming suspenseful. Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov.html.
Schneefan writes that the global satellite data for the lower troposphere (TLT) from UAH are as expected headed down wards after having reached its peak of 0.83°K in February (March: 0.73°K), see: UAH V6 Global Temperature Update for March, 2016: +0.73 deg. C.
The GFS forecast for April 2016 also sees a considerable drop with the global 2m temperatures:

The above plot shows the measured and calculated anomalies from the global mean temperature using the usual modern WMO 1981-2010 climate mean. The computed trend for early April (black line) is steeply downward, even though it is computed using the NASA/GISS “adjusted” (falsified) factor. Source: www.karstenhaustein.com.php.
Schneefan comments that the current unusual weak solar activity and the currently oncoming cold ENSO development will make it clear that the recent claims of a warming planet were more hype than anything else, and that the real trend is cooling over the coming years.
It’s still early to be predicting a La Niña of -3.0°K. Expect that figure to be corrected upwards. One thing is clear: La Niña arriving this fall is becoming an almost sure bet.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA press release by Germany’s Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft reports how offshore North and Baltic Sea wind turbines need to be in operation for 25 years before they become profitable, but that they are prone to shortened lifespans due to rust from the harsh sea environment.
As a result the wind turbine installations need extra and very costly maintenance to ensure that they survive long enough. It’s turning out to be an insurmountable challenge.
Maintenance to turbines cannot be done at a dry dock, rather, because they are permanently fixed out to sea, repair work and maintenance have to be done offshore in raw and windy conditions. Not only is this expensive, but it also puts the lives and limbs of repair personnel at risk.
This is the reason engineers and researchers are trying to find ways to better protect offshore wind power systems from the brutal elements. Protection of vulnerable metal surfaces is planned to be achieved by developing and applying new surface films, but this is still very much in development.
100 times the cost of a new turbine
The figure that is especially astonishing about offshore wind power turbines is that the “maintenance and repair costs of offshore wind turbines over the years add up to be a hundred times the cost of the new turbine itself,” says Peter Plagemann of the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology and Applied Material Science (IFAM) in Bremen.
Plagemann adds (my emphasis):
While a metal coating during the construction of a turbine on land can cost up to 20 to 30 euros per square meter, it can be several thousand euros for offshore turbines.”
This is yet just another huge and costly technical obstacle faced by offshore windparks. It’s going to be an expensive mess come clean-up time.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe following video is really worth taking the time to watch.
It explains clearly how very low frequency sound waves (infrasound) from wind turbines have an adverse effect on some people, making them feel ill.
Like the motion sickness that people experience in a car, plane or boat, infrasound sickness results from “sensory conflict” in the central nervous system (CNS).
Hat-tip: Wolfgang Neumann at FB.

Sensory conflict is when two or more of your senses disagree with each other with respect to your own personal motion. For example when on a boat the inner ear and the sense of touch perceive motion, but your visual system does not. This “sensory conflict” can make some people get ill.

The middle ear and touch of course sense motion by detecting changes in pressure. When you walk, for example, your head bobs up and down, and moves back and forth in rhythm, and the inner ear registers the pressure changes of -0.12 Pa to +0.12 Pa as the head accelerates and decelerates. Your feet (touch) sense the pressure changes, and your eyes perceive the motion as well – so everything agrees and so you do not get sick.
The problem with wind turbines is that they create low frequency infrasound with a frequency of under 20 Hz, which is a cyclic barometric pressure change in the air that gets sub-consciously registered by the inner ear. As a result the brain is fooled into thinking that the body is in motion, when in fact it is not. Sensory conflict is the result and it leads some people to feel ill.
Known back in 1985
Scientific tests confirm the phenomenon: some people are sensitive to infrasound and the sickness linked to wind turbines is real. In 1985 psychology professor David Nussbaum at NASA exposed people to infrasound in an enclosed cabin for 30 minutes as part of an experiment. The result: 15% of the people felt the onset of motion sickness. Now imagine being subjected to the low frequency non-stop for days, which can be the case for wind turbines. Little wonder that some people get extremely sick.
It turns out that the tested subjects responded to the steady, symmetrical waves, and not the random-type asymmetrical waves (see 8-minute mark). Wind generators produce constant symmetrical waves. And the bigger the turbine, the more powerful the infrasound wave. Yet today a number of government officials and green activists refuse to acknowledge these well-known findings and ignore the impacts wind parks are having on the health of people living near them. They continue permitting their installation.
And let’s also not forget the blighted landscape they create.

"The people of Wagga Wagga are famously stubborn. On the north side of the Murrumbidgee river is a low-lying village of homes that once flooded five times a year. The signpost at North Wagga Wagga has for decades served as a warning to town planners: “We shall not be moved.” “We are a very conservative city,” says the local mayor, Greg Conkey. “A lot of people do not accept climate change.”  Last week, the Wagga Wagga city council voted to declare a climate emergency. In sum, 28 local government areas have made a similar declaration – but never before in a place such as Wagga, where they prayed for rain at the scorching height of the last major drought, and where the local MP is the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, who recently told a constituent he disputed evidence of global heating. Conkey, a former journalist who ran the Riverina Leader community newspaper for 25 years, rejects the suggestion that his support for the emergency declaration might be brave or naive, even as local political attacks are being amped up. “I find it unusual that we should be having this debate in the first place,” Conkey says. “The debate regarding climate change was done and dusted years ago. It’s a reality and 97% of scientists agree that climate is changing at a rapid pace. “We believe it’s our job and our responsibility to plan for the future, to look after the future of the city. “Some people you’ll never convert. There are a couple of companies who have come out publicly and said they’re seriously concerned about impacts on their business and I’ll be looking at that. But my argument is that if we don’t have a sustainable and resilient community, we won’t have jobs at all. “It’s not going to be easy, it’s probably not going to be cheap. But we’re trying to mitigate the costs to the community that climate change will bring.” On Thursday morning, Conkey’s face appeared on signs plastered around the town centre, along with those of three others who voted for the climate emergency motion, accusing them of selling out ratepayers. A vote to repeal the declaration will be held on Monday night. Progress won’t be won without a fight. In between two major droughts, about 9,000 people were evacuated from Wagga Wagga when the Murrumbidgee river hit a 159-year high, flooding large parts of the city. “The droughts and flooding rains are part of the mythology of Australia. It’s in our poetry,” says Andrew Wallace, an education professor and climate campaigner, who is also the chair of the Wagga Wagga Conservatorium of Music. Wallace talks about the way historical weather events, which experts say are made more extreme by climate change, often work to entrench beliefs that weather patterns are cyclical. “Families have kept weather records on their farms ... that go back often 100-120 years. And looking back through that they’re seeing the droughts and flooding rains. So over generations, they have experienced this cycle, suffered through the bad times, maybe lose a crop or two, because they know the good times are coming. “But now it’s different, and it’s really dangerous.” Most of the local resistance to the emergency declaration has centred on councillor Paul Funnell, who during the debate last week compared parents taking their children to climate rallies to child abuse. Funnell’s family were among the first European settlers in the district. “I damn well know what’s going on in the climate,” he told Guardian Australia. “If you look back historically, it’s very similar to what we went through right through the 20th century. Every decade there were droughts. “It’s interesting how this is discussed. I’ve never heard anyone say there’s no such thing as climate change. Of course there’s climate change, of course it’s changing. This is not the impact that people are making it out to be, some are calling it a new green religion. “I’d say three quarters of people who speak to me [about the climate emergency declaration] say ‘make sure you get rid of this nonsense’. I go to the store, I go to the car mechanic, it doesn’t matter where I go, people are talking about it. “The majority of people who talk to me say ‘if the experts can’t agree, then what hope have you got?’ It’s a realm where we shouldn’t go.” Wallace says he worries, as the debate becomes hysterical, that the “loaded” terminology about a climate emergency is perhaps “towards the edge for a community like this”. “But just by having the debate, there’s benefit. Bringing it into consciousness means there’s always some people who think about it for the first time. These massive events, catastrophic weather events, those events trigger people to come back to the argument. You come back to God because you need him. This is one of those times, it’s time to move and bring those sorts of things forward.” On the surface, Wagga Wagga has changed very little in the past decade. The coffee shops have improved, and the trees along Baylis Street have grown taller. A few old pubs have gone out of business. At the same time, social progress has crept slowly through parts of the community. This is a place where, in 1993, the editor of the Daily Advertiser newspaper wrote columns attacking “sordid homosexuality” and responded to backlash by branding himself homophobic. Today, Wagga hosts a March Mardi Gras festival, which attracted about 10,000 people to a parade through town, and was embraced by many locals. The newspaper editor is now the local MP and Australia’s deputy prime minister. Michael McCormack has distanced himself from those statements and other columns he wrote backing the death penalty and ridiculing women’s sport, saying they do not represent his current views. And while McCormack, who has hinted at his scepticism about man-made climate change, easily won the seat of Riverina at the May election, there is no longer a sense in Wagga that this is safe political territory for conservatives. The area’s state MP is independent Joe McGirr, a popular local doctor, who has been vocal in his support for the emergency declaration. During his term as mayor, Conkey has marched in support of domestic violence victims, and with the council’s Mardi Gras float. “People said 15 years ago, 20 years ago you’d never have had a Mardi Gras in this city,” Conkey says. “I was one of those people who was marching. I walked with my wife, together with the deputy mayor and his wife, to show that we are an inclusive community. We have something like 112 nationalities represented in this city. We speak 107 languages, we’re a very multicultural city. “We voted 65% in favour of the monarchy in the 1990s. It would be interesting to see what that vote would be now. We voted in favour of same-sex marriage, I was delighted that we did that. Again, 15 years ago, that wouldn’t have happened. This city has changed in recent times for the better.” Labor councillor Vanessa Keenan, who proposed the climate emergency motion, says the past few weeks have shown that climate is not just a fringe issue, even in notionally conservative regional areas. “If you asked a month ago, who are the people in this community who are passionate about climate change, then people would picture someone with dreadlocks, a tree-hugging hippy,” Keenan says. “What we’ve seen are doctors, farmers, parents, business owners, pharmacists, people from all walks of life come out and say they want to see climate action happen at a local level.” Dr Trudi Beck, a Wagga Wagga general practitioner, has spent every Friday for the past few months camped outside McCormack’s office, holding a picnic protest and calling for action on climate change. “There’s people like me who never cared about any sort of political activism who are saying we have to quietly and respectfully start to deal with this at a grassroots level,” Beck says. “We’ve always tried to do what we could in our backyard to have chickens and compost and vegetables, but once you start being interested in those things, the natural progression of that contact with nature is to start being concerned about the bigger picture.” Like many people of her generation, Beck left Wagga Wagga and returned. The city has a growing number of professionals, many working in healthcare and education. Beck’s unique form of regional activism has been effective in bringing debate into the local mainstream. “There’s a lot of people of my generation who have moved away, realised Wagga does have a lot to offer, and who have come back with different world views or experiences that they’re integrating into life here,” Beck says. “Rallies and protests are a bit too aggressive for people in this area. So we thought how can we make this something where average people like us might be able to relate to the idea that climate change is important, and how can we do it in a way that’s peaceful. “Initially it was just me and the kids, over time it’s grown to be more people than that.” Beck says the Fridays for the Future demonstrations garnered “more attention than we necessarily wanted”. “All you have to do is go on to any Facebook page of a local newspaper in an area such as Wagga when any environmental or climate change-related article is published and see the kinds of comments that are made there to realise those sorts of [conservative] sentiments can be deeply held by a portion of the city. I didn’t expect it to become as publicly nasty ... but the opposition didn’t surprise me. “We just need to call it for what it is, say it’s an emergency and deal with it like it is an emergency.”"

"Environmental protesters blocked the path of Boris Johnson’s car on Wednesday as he made his way to Buckingham Palace to officially become Britain’s new prime minister. The protesters said they were aiming to highlight the need to tackle the climate emergency. The Greenpeace activists joined hands across the Mall as Johnson was making his way to meet the Queen. The protest, in which the activists had planned to hand a letter to Johnson that detailed how to end the climate crisis, was quickly broken up by police. The former Green party leader Natalie Bennett said on Twitter that the event was “a reminder for Boris Johnson, in case the air-conditioning was making him forget”. She added that the climate emergency “should be at the top of his in-tray”. The protest came just before the Queen asked Johnson to form a government, after Theresa May’s resignation as prime minister and his victory in the Conservative leadership contest on Tuesday. On Wednesday evening, hundreds of people gathered in Russell Square in London to protest against Johnson’s ascension and the government. The demo, dubbed “fck govt fck boris” after a lyric from Stormzy’s Vossi Bop and billed as a street festival, featured a bus with the words emblazoned on it as a nod to Johnson’s “£350m for the NHS” promise on the side of the Vote Leave campaign bus. The Labour leftwing grassroots movement Momentum, the Women’s Strike Assembly and Guardian columnist Owen Jones were among the event’s organisers. After a DJ set and performances from musicians, the demonstrators began marching through central London towards Trafalgar Square. Later, a group of protesters, more than 10,000 according to organisers’ estimates, marched south to the gates of Downing Street, many of them chanting: “Boris Johnson, fuck off back to Eton.” A very profane protest against Boris Johnson pic.twitter.com/LfqIajFUkZ Downing Street was put into lockdown as the gates were blockaded by about 100 officers and a dozen riot vans, and no one was allowed in and out of that entrance. Meanwhile, the anti-Johnson campaigners set off purple and pink flares as they danced to booming music. Just before 8pm, MP Grant Shapps turned up at the Downing Street gates, where he was promptly turned away by an armed officer on duty. On the other side of the gates, and away from the demonstration, a string of tight-lipped Tory MPs made their way out of No 10 as further appointments were announced. They each walked straight from No 10 to a private exit which took them towards the Foreign Office buildings or a back exit. Shapps eventually used a different route to No 10, where he learned that he had been made transport secretary. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, earlier gave a speech in Russell Square in which he described Johnson as a “racist” and “a liar”. He also warned onlookers not to “fall for his buffoonery”. Lois Ward-Marvin, 23, a tattoo artist, was among the demonstrators. She said: “I don’t want Boris Johnson to be prime minister – the people that did vote for him were all white men. He’s racist, sexist, homophobic, and I don’t think he really wants to bring change for good.” However, Ward-Marvin added that she did not know who in politics would be a better fit for the post. “I’m Jewish, so the antisemitism row has pushed me away from Labour,” she said. Also in the crowd was lecturer Kevin Logan, 54. He said he was protesting against Johnson’s “incompetence”. He added: “He’s going to be awful and I’m really scared of what’s going to happen with Brexit with him in power.” Speaking close to Downing Street, Jay Crosbie said he was at the protest because he believed Johnson’s time in government would be “detrimental” to the country. “I’m here as a queer person – we know we’re the people he doesn’t care about,” he said. Instead of a banner, Crosbie carried a rainbow fan with the words “bum boys” written between the folds as a nod to an infamous comment by Johnson. Crosbie was not only worried that things such as the controversial Gender Recognition Act “won’t be on the table” under Johnson’s premiership, but also that he would not be able to resolve the current Brexit chaos. “The enormity of this just seems lost on Boris Johnson – it’s like a pantomime, like Punch and Judy,” he added.  Despite the anger at the new prime minister, the demonstration appeared overall to be peaceful and there were no arrests. A second protest is planned for 20 September. Earlier in the day, campaigners from People’s Vote UK held banners outside Parliament Square and Buckingham Palace to urge the government to give the public a vote on the final Brexit deal."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUniversity of Magdeburg economics professor Joachim Weimann held a presentation in Brandenburg highlighting the shortcomings of Germany’s Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) and Europe’s climate policy earlier this year.

First Weimann calls the climate issue a debate that is emotionally and ideologically charged, and that the facts are almost always suppressed. He also believes that the real facts on climate change and energy policy are unpopular among policymakers and that they all too often “deny” them.
In the presentation Weimann makes it clear that he is an alarmist, and that he believes something needs to be done rapidly.
The thrust of his presentation, however, is about Germany’s Energiewende and Europe’s climate policies, and whether they are really effective. His assessment in a nutshell: The feed-in acts are a colossal disaster.
Coal plants pay less, consumers pay much more
Weimann says that go-it-alone national CO2 reduction programs aren’t functioning and that emissions trading schemes in combination with energy feed-in acts only result in emissions being sourced out and thus lead to no emissions reductions. In the end the price of emission certificates falls to levels that makes them ineffective. Ironically coal power plants, he says, wind up the ones profiting the most. “Coal is indirectly being subsidized by the feed-in acts,” says Weimann. Everything about coal suddenly becomes cheap, not only its supply, but also the costs of its emissions.
Greater consumption of resources
For the consumer, however, the price of electricity becomes far more expensive. Weimann also explains that the forced feed-in of renewable energies in fact even leads to greater consumption of resources, and not less.
At the 24:20 mark Weimann presents the costs of eliminating 1 tonne of CO2 emissions for a variety of sources: for a coal power plant 1 ton reduction of CO2 costs only 8 euros, for retrofitting a car it costs 100 euros per ton, for onshore wind 150 euros, offshore wind 320 euros and solar 400 euros a ton. This do not include the grid costs. Clearly some CO2 reduction measures make little economic sense.
Feed-in acts lead to zero climate protection
At the 26:30 mark Weimmann slams the German EEG energy feed-in act because it promotes the installation of existing technology rather than research and development in new technology. He says:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




– “For climate protection, we do not need the Energiewende.”
– “It is doing nothing for saving resources”.
– “It is also doing nothing for jobs and new technology.”
Substituting coal and nuclear a pipe dream
Next Weimann shows why it is madness to try to replace 18 nuclear power plants (total output 20 GW) with “extremely volatile” wind energy. He says there’s no chance of accomplishing this feat without storage technology, which is still nowhere in sight. Some 437 pump storage facilities would need to be built to ensure the supply of 18 nuclear power plants – an impossible task he says. He calls stopping nuclear energy and coal energy at the same time a pipe dream.
More coal burned today than in 1990!
Because Germany has already committed to closing its remaining nuclear power plants by 2022, the country will be forced to do 2 things: 1) burn more fossil fuels, and 2) to import more of the unpopular nuclear energy. The stunning result, so far, Weimann points out: “We are now burning more coal than in 1990!”
Weimann summarizes, saying Germany’s Energiewende resulted in:
– “No energy independence.”
– “Negative job creation.”
– “A price tag of up to 1.2 trillion euros.”
Europe: €5.7 trillion “completely wasted”
Moreover global greenhouse gas emissions climbed 35% from 2000-2012, clearly dwarfing Europe’s 11% reduction. He says the 5.7 trillion euros committed by all of Europe so far will be “completely wasted”. He says that what is needed is an international coalition and that here Germany is doing nothing to support it.
At the end (38:00) he hands in his final assessment. Germany’s Energiewende:
– “Is very expensive”
– “Is counter-productive”
– “Has had no effect on climate”
– “Disturbs in the decommissioning of nuclear power”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s DWD national weather service here has published the result of March 2016 weather in Germany – having crunched the data from some 2000 stations scattered across the country.
Although DWD insists March was “mild”, a closer look at the data reveals that it was in fact 0.3°C cooler than the 1981-2010 mean.
How did the DWD conclude that the month was warm? It used the mean of the obsolete 1961 – 1990 period, a time when the globe was gripped in a cool spell and the media was warning of “global cooling”. Compared to that period, March 2016 in Germany was 0.5°C warmer. Why the DWD still uses the 1961 – 1990 reference period while the rest of the world (e.g. NOAA, WMO, etc.) uses the 1981 – 2010 period remains a mystery.
Perhaps it has a little to do with activist science. Schneefan at wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de called the DWD press release an April Fool’s trick, writing:
By using the old climate mean, a warming gets faked – as we see once again in March 2016 in Germany – a realistic look compared to the mean of the last three decades […]  shows that the trend has even switched to some cooling, …”

Indeed on April 1st Central Germany even woke up to a real weather April Fools trick – a blanket of snow on the ground: “Central Germany gets April Fooled with heavy snowfall“.
A plot of March temperatures over the past 30 years shows that 2016 was in fact among the colder ones and that the country has not seen any March warming over the past 30 years.

Source: DWD
Interestingly, the chart above shows that 8 years saw March outside of the shaded normal range: 4 were too warm and 4 were too cold. Clearly the cold ones were more extreme than the warm ones. Where’s the warming?
Finally, don’t be surprised if the March 2016 figure gets revised downward in a few weeks time. Over the past months the DWD has developed a habit of putting out “warmed” press releases on preliminary monthly results, only to quietly revise them downwards later on.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt hasn’t been a good week for the global warming alarmists. Three events have rocked the movement and caused alarmists to go into a state of alarm.
Putin calls global warming “a fraud”
The first event Russian President Vladimir Putin, who used to play along with the issue, has come out and called global warming science “a fraud“, one that is “designed to restrain industrial development“. According to the New York Times, Putin’s skepticism is based on Russian scientists having done “very, very extensive work trying to understand all sides of the climate debate” and that it is “clear that the climate is a complicated system” and that “the evidence presented for the need to ‘fight’ global warming was rather unfounded.”
NASA satellite measurements refute preposterous PIK models
The second event is described at the Swiss online daily Tagesanzeiger which presents a vivid example as to why people like Putin don’t believe the wild climate alarmism: There’s a huge chasm between the scary model projections coming from “leading” climate institutes and the real observations themselves.
The Swiss daily begins by writing that the Germany-based Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) projects that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could “rapidly disintegrate” and cause sea levels to rise 3 meters, all based on “their own model simulations“, which incorporate “feedback effects“. The Tagesanzeiger writes, however, that the PIK was unable to provide “a reason for the loss of stability in West Antarctica“. The Swiss online daily in effect presents a PIK theory that is fraught with assumptions, and is ultra-lean on recorded data.
To illustrate that there is a total lack of consensus with respect to Antarctica, the Tagesanzeiger brings up the latest NASA study by Zwally et al, citing Breitbart: “Antarctica is not shrinking – it is growing”, and writes that the NASA study “completely contradicts” the PIK model projections. The Tagesanzeiger continues:

A satellite survey by NASA tells a different story. It contradicts a number of other studies, which are mostly based on rough estimations and assumptions.”

The third set of bad news to come out over the past week is that Poland’s new president, Andrzej Duda, refuses to extend the UN Kyoto Treaty until 2020 and that this “blocks the ratification process” just a month before the UN climate summit in Paris (COP21). Duda is requesting “a more detailed analysis of the climate matter“, writing in a statement:
Binding Poland to an international agreement that will affect Poland’s economy and the therein connected social costs should require a detailed analysis of the legal and economic impacts. These impacts have not been sufficiently explained.”
Greenpeace Poland called Duda’s announcement a “bad sign” threatens to stall Europe’s movement on emissions limitation. Let’s hope!
Asia moves ahead with coal power plant expansion
Also the news tell us that many, especially poorer, developing countries aren’t taking PIK climate science seriously at all. The London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation here writes that “in Asia alone this year power companies are building more than 500 coal-fired plants, with at least a thousand more on planning boards.”

======================================
Top summer in the Czech Republic: Unexpected heat in 1540
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Temperature measurements as a rule go back one or two hundred years. Thus beyond the thermometer age, one has to work with so-called proxies. In the Czech epublic one team of scientists led by Martin Možný reconstructed the temperature history of the country using the historical data on grape harvests going back 500 years. (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Temperature of the Czech Republic over the past 500 years. From Možný et al. 2016. The blue curve since 1800 AD represents thermometer data.
The harvest time turned out to be a reliable indicator of the April to August temperature. As expected, the warmest 30-year interval occurred from 1986-2015. Interestingly, however, 1540 was identified as the hottest of the last 500 years and was part of an above average period in the 16th century.

What follows is the Abstract of the Paper in the journal Climate of the Past:
April–August temperatures in the Czech Lands, 1499–2015, reconstructed from grape-harvest dates
Viticulture has long been essential to the commercial and social well-being of parts of the Czech Lands (now the Czech Republic), and detailed records have been kept for centuries of the timing and relative success of the grape crop. Using such documentary data from the Bohemian wine-growing region (mainly northwest of the capital, Prague), series of grape-harvest dates (GHDs) were created for the 1499–2015 period. Because the link between harvest dates and temperatures is strong, GHD series, together with instrumental mean temperature series starting in 1801, were used to reconstruct mean April–August temperatures for the region from 1499 to 2015. Linear regression (LR) and variance scaling (VS) methods were used for calibration and compared in terms of explained variance and their ability to capture extreme values. It emerged that LR does not significantly underestimate temperature variability. However, VS shows far greater capacity to capture extremes. GHDs explain 64 % of temperature variability over the full calibration period. The 1986–2015 period was identified as the warmest 30-year period of the past 514 years, an observation consistent with recent global warming. The highest April–August temperatures appeared in a reconstruction for the year 1540, which was warmer than the next two very warm, and far more recent, seasons in 2003 and 2015. The coldest period occurred at the beginning of the 20th century (1900–1929). The series reconstructed for the Czech Lands is in close agreement with other (central) European reconstructions based on other proxies. The series created here makes an important contribution to a better understanding of long-term spatiotemporal temperature variability in central Europe.
It can be observed that the study’s period of investigation did not reach into the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). I t would have been interesting to have compared the the current warm period with the MWP. In general the data in the Czech Republic for the MWP is extremely scant.
Within the scope of the MWP charting project, not a single study has been found to date for this time period. Looking across regions, a warm MWP is highly likely when we look at the studies from neighboring countries (red points). From a hydro-climatological view, the Czech Republic borders on the humid northern European MWP (green points ) and the southern European dry MWP (yellow points).

"Australian insurance giant Suncorp will no longer invest in, finance or insure new thermal coal mines and power plants, and will not underwrite any existing thermal coal projects after 2025. This is the latest in a series of pledges by banks and financial services companies that they will not support projects that mine or burn coal used for electricity generation, in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.  Activists said Suncorp’s announcement meant there were now no Australian insurers willing to underwrite new thermal coal developments. Suncorp, which owns insurance brands AAMI and GIO, made headlines in February when it announced its half-year profit had slumped 45%, mainly because of extreme weather events in Sydney and Queensland. Its then chief executive, Michael Cameron, called on the government to make it compulsory for Australian businesses to adopt climate change action plans to prepare for natural disasters. In a statement on Friday, the $17bn company said climate change posed a financial and strategic risk but was also an opportunity. It said it had applied a shadow carbon price, assuming greenhouse gas emissions have a cost, to its investment decisions since 2017 and had recently expanded that across all its operations. “The practical outcome of this is that we have materially reduced our investment in fossil fuels, including thermal coal,” an official said. “We will seek to increase exposure to businesses that have a positive environmental impact, including renewable energy generation and technology.” Suncorp’s competitor QBE said in March it would no longer insure new thermal coal projects and would stop underwriting existing operations from 2030. Market Forces, an activist group affiliated with Friends of the Earth, lodged a shareholder resolution this week asking Suncorp to set targets for phasing out all fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas. Campaigner Pablo Brait said the company’s announcement was significant. “Any company wanting to run a coal-burning power station past 2030 will now be unable to get an Australian insurer to back it. [Energy companies] AGL and Origin might want to take note,” he said. Brait called on Suncorp to go further. “Without action on oil and gas there is a risk that Suncorp ends up trading one massive climate risk for another over time,” he said. Suncorp said in February its experience with extreme events had prompted it to increase its annual allowance for natural hazards by $100m and to buy another $200m of reinsurance cover. Market Forces said claims to Suncorp for flood, fire and cyclone damage had been $1.7bn more than the group had budgeted for over the past decade."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast month at the University College London, atmospheric scientist Prof. Murry Salby, formerly of Macquarie University in Australia, gave a damning presentation on man-made CO2 and its (lack of) impact on global climate.
Hat-tip: a reader by e-mail.

He begins by reminding that climate is a subject of “limited understanding” and that it one of “limited observation” He tells the audience that carbon in the atmosphere cannot be regulated and is NOT a pollutant. On why CO2 science got to where it is today, he cites Mark Twain: “Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.”
Neither cleaner nor greener
In his introduction he explains how CO2 will be a pollutant to our ecosystem only when the day arrives that water vapour becomes a pollutant – i.e. never in our geological lifetime.
He says that energy sources that circumvent CO2 emissions are neither greener nor cleaner – just different.
IPCC premise impossible
Later he shows that although humans have emitted twice as much CO2 into the atmosphere over the last decade compared to a decade earlier, growth in atmospheric CO2 concentration did not change at all. He states:
The premise of the IPCC that increased atmospheric CO2 results from fossil fuels emissions is impossible.”

Salby says this is “hardly a surprise”.  During the presentation Salby presents the scientific reasoning why CO2 is not the harmful gas it is claimed to be.
Worst agreement in human history
Near the end, the renowned dissident physicist slams the junk-science-based COP21 agreement, which would cost some 359 TRILLION dollars, and that the cost would be borne disproportionately by the disadvantaged in more ways than one.
40,000 people perished last winter alone in Europe due to hypothermia because they could not afford to heat their homes, he reminds us.
At 1:16:00 he concludes that 360 trillion dollars for climate protection will result in literally no benefit at all for citizens of the planet. On this scientific insanity:
My God. What an indictment of this era.”
Pseudoscience comparable to the quackery of bloodletting
In his concluding remarks Salby compares climatology to the medical quackery of bloodletting, which was used to try to treat George Washington’s throat infection. The treatment treated the infection, alright – after it had killed Washington in a mere 72 hours!
An excellent video that’s worth every minute.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe website of the German Employers Association (DAV) has posted a comprehensive interview by Holger Douglas with physicist and climate scientist Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke, concerning the role of CO2 on the world’s climate.
Photo: Professor Horst-Joachim Lüdecke

Lüdecke, who has authored numerous climate science publications in climate science journals, is sure that the role of CO2 on climate is grossly overstated and riddled with alarmist hype.
Polar bear population “growing”
On polar bears, Lüdecke says there is “no trace” of the animal disappearing due to climate change and that the polar bear population has in fact been climbing. Moreover, the polar bear has been around for “hundreds of thousands of years“.
Climate sensitivity much weaker than assumed
On the subject of the greenhouse effect and radiation outwards into space, Lüdecke reminds that the climate system involves countless, poorly understood complexities, such as cloud cover and water vapor. In the interview he tells:
Water vapor is a very powerful greenhouse gas, and acts to enhance the warming effect. We call this feedback, as the warming is magnified more by it then it is alone by the radiation effect. But the other assumption claims: The opposite is correct! More water vapor in the air leads to more clouds that cool.”
On which effect is true, Lüdecke tells the DAV:
The theory of a feedback is not confirmed by measurements. According to the theory, the altitudes over the tropics at about 5 to 7 kilometers are supposed to be showing a clearly measurable heating zone that is referred to as the ‘Hot Spot’. No one has found it. Everything points to the pure radiation effect being weaker and not enhanced.”
No human fingerprint
The retired, independent physicist then tells the DAV that “man’s influence on the climate still cannot be filtered from the climate noise even today” and that today’s climate and weather changes are no different than what was observed hundreds of years ago, citing the IPCC itself:
There is not a single bit of scientific justification to claim: Here we are seeing unusual climate developments that can be only attributed to humans.”
Lüdecke suspects that the cyclic nature of climate natural climate change is caused mainly by the sun’s activity, naming the De Vries/Suess 200-year cycle and the 1500-year Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle as examples.

He also confirms the recent “18-20 year” global warming pause and reminds us that in geological terms, the Earth today in fact finds itself in a ice age period, which is typically defined as one that sees the poles frozen over – as is the case today.
On proxies the retired climate scientist says that care has to be exercised in interpreting the data they yield. The DAQV asks whether there is a relationship between temperature and CO2 concentration. Lüdecke replies:
No, there’s nothing to see there.”
CO2 concentration in fact historically low
Lüdecke also points out that today’s atmospheric CO2 levels are in fact close to historical lows, and that elevated concentration bring a number of advantages to the ecosystems, foremost a greener planet with better plant growth.
Also, man’s CO2 emissions pale against those from the oceans and natural environment.
Ocean acidification “an alarmist myth”
On whether the threat of ocean acidification exists, Lüdecke dumps cold water on that claim:
No, ocean acidification is another myth of the alarmists. Every chemists you talk to on ocean acidification being a result of increasing atmospheric CO2 will roll his eyes. […]
Also the supposed sensitivity of corals to CO2 in sea water is an alarmist myth.”
“Dangerous, undemocratic ideology”
At the very end of the interview, Lüdecke comments on climate protection as a movement:
Here I allow myself to state very clearly: Climate protection has nothing to do with protecting nature. Climate protection is a dangerous, undemocratic ideology.”
In the next post, we will look at what Prof. Lüdecke says in the rest of the interview concerning climate models and the energy trend in Europe.

Claims that sea level rise is 3.3 mm/year are looking increasingly like a grand hoax. David A. Burton runs the sea level rise resource site sealevel.info posts an analysis showing sea level rise is only half of what it is claimed to be.
============================
Sea Level Rise Only Matters At The Coasts
By David A. Burton
Many may not be aware of this, but satellite altimeters are incapable of measuring sea-level at the coasts, among other significant problems.
Coastal tide gauges, on the other hand, measure sea-level at this important location – which is where it really matters. Tide gauge measurements of sea-level are far more reliable than satellite altimetry, and of much longer duration. The longest tide-gauge records of sea-level measurements are nearly ten times as long as the combined satellite measurement record, and twenty times as long as any single satellite measurement record.
No sign of any acceleration
NOAA has done linear regression analysis on sea-level measurements (relative sea-level) from 225 long term tide gauges around the world, which have data spanning at least 50 years. (Note: the literature indicates that at least 50-60 years of data are required to determine a robust long term sea-level trend from a tide gauge record.) There’s no sign of any acceleration (increase in rate) in most of those tide-gauge records.
More than 85% of stations show less rise than 3.3 mm/year
The rate of measured sea-level rise (SLR) varies from -17.59 mm/yr at Skagway, Alaska, to +9.39 mm/yr at Kushiro, Japan. 197 of 225 stations (87.6%) have recorded less than 3.3 mm/yr sea-level rise. At 47 of 225 stations (20.9%) sea level is falling, rather than rising. Just 28 of 225 stations (12.4%) have recorded more than 3.3 mm/yr sea-level rise.
The average SLR at those 225 gauges is +0.90 mm/yr. The median is +1.41 mm/yr.
That appears to be slightly less than the true global average, because a disproportionate number of those 225 stations are northern hemisphere stations affected by post glacial rebound (i.e., the land is rising faster). On the other hand quite a few long-term tide gauges which are substantially affected by subsidence (i.e., the land is sinking), often due to extraction of water, oil, or natural gas, or due to the location having been elevated with fill dirt which is compacting (Ex.: Galveston).
I downloaded the two sea-level measurement spreadsheet files (U.S. and global) from NOAA’s page, and combined them into a single Excel spreadsheet. For ease of sorting I changed the U.S. station ID numbers by adding an “A-” prefix. I also added “average” and “median” lines at the end of the spreadsheet.
The average of all 375 NOAA-analyzed stations is 1.28 mm/yr, and the median is 1.71 mm/yr:
www.sealevel.info/NOAA_AllStations.xls or
www.sealevel.info/NOAA_AllStations.htm
NOAA says that the average is 1.7-1.8 mm/yr. Some of the difference between the calculated average and NOAA’s figure for MSL rise may be due to the addition of model-derived GIA adjustments to the measured rates when calculating the average to account for post glacial rebound (PGR). My guess is that they’re using Prof. Richard Peltier’s figures. Unfortunately, those figures are only very loosely correlated with what is actually happening at the tide-gauge locations.
Prof. Peltier also estimates that melt-water load from the melting of the great ice sheets (~10k years ago) is causing the ocean floors to sink by enough to cause a 0.3 mm/yr fall in sea-level, absent other factors. That number (0.3 mm/yr) is usually added to calculated “global average” sea-level rise rates, inflating the reported average, even though the resulting sum is not truly sea-level, and is not useful for projecting sea-level for coastal planning. It’s an attempt to calculate what the rate of sea-level rise would be were it not for the hypothesized sinking of the ocean floor.
50-60 years of data needed to establish trend
Unfortunately, many of the tide station records in NOAA’s expanded list of 375 are too short to be appropriate for measuring sea-level trends. The literature indicates that at least 50-60 years of data are needed to establish a robust sea-level trend from a tide station record. But the shortest record in NOAA’s list is Apra Harbor, Guam, with just 21 years of data. The text at the top of NOAA’s page says, “Trends with the widest confidence intervals are based on only 30-40 years of data.” But that is incorrect. I suspect they wrote it before they added the gauges with very short records.

So I also made a version of this spreadsheet in which stations with records shorter than 50 years are omitted.
Considering only tide stations with records of at least 50 years, the average and median rates of MSL rise (of the 225 remaining stations) are 0.90 mm/yr and 1.41 mm/yr, respectively:
sealevel.info/NOAA_AllStations.xls or
http://sealevel.info/NOAA_AllStations.htm
I also tried limiting it to stations with records of at least 60 years, with very similar results: average 0.77 mm/yr, and median 1.37 mm/yr.
The average (0.90 mm/yr) is probably unrealistically low, due to the disproportionate number of stations in northern Europe which see low or negative rates of measured sea-level rise due to post glacial rebound. The fact that the average is less than the median also suggests that there are a disproportionate number of low-end outliers.
I also tried another approach, in which I excluded the most extreme latitudes. I started with just the “50+ year” stations, and included only stations within a latitude range of 45 (i.e., I excluded stations above 45 north or below 45 south). The resulting average and median for 137 stations were 2.22 mm/y and 2.02 mm/yr, respectively:
www.sealevel.info/NOAA_AllStations.xls or
www.sealevel.info/NOAAAllStations.htm
That approach largely solves the problem of low-side bias introduced by stations which are affected by PGR (which lowers the calculated average), but it doesn’t solve the problem of high-side bias introduced by stations affected by subsidence (which raises the calculated average). So the average (2.22 mm/yr) is probably unrealistically high. The fact that the average is greater than the median also suggests that there are a disproportionate number of high-end outliers.
So I tried another approach, this time explicitly eliminating “outliers.” I started with just the “50+ year” stations, but excluded the 40 stations with the lowest rate of sea-level rise (including most of those experiencing falling sea-level), and the 30 stations with the highest rate of sea-level rise (including most of those experiencing severe land subsidence, like Galveston, which is built on sinking fill dirt).
The resulting average and median rates of sea-level rise (calculated from 155 stations) are both 1.48 mm/yr:
www.sealevel.info/NOAA_AllStations.xls or
www.sealevel.info/NOAA_AllStations.htm
That figure, 1.48 mm/yr, is the current best estimate of globally averaged coastal sea-level rise. At first glance excluding more low outliers than high outliers might seem to bias the result to the high end. But I think it is justifiable because of the disproportionate number of northern European and North American stations at locations where the land is rising due to post glacial rebound. The fact that the median and average are equal suggests that there aren’t disproportionate numbers of either high or low outliers.
I also tried excluding the low and high 35 stations, and the result was an average MSL rise of 1.36 mm/yr, and median 1.41 mm/yr, which suggests that it includes more low outliers than high outliers.
Note that 1.48 mm/yr is less than six inches per century. Also if you add Peltier’s +0.3 mm/yr GIA to that calculated 1.48 mm/yr global average rate of MSL rise, the sum is within NOAA’s 1.7-1.8 mm/yr range.
It is not possible to torture the tide-gauge data into yielding a globally averaged rate of relative sea-level rise anywhere near 3.3 mm/yr.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterTV station WPTZ here reports that developers planned to build seven 500-foot-tall wind turbines near the town of Swanton, Vermont, near Lake Champlain. However the industrial colossuses are no longer welcome in a state that proudly views itself as green.
Hat-tip: Indomitable Snowman, Ph.D
Vermonters are finding out quickly that wind parks are massively industrial, not environmentally friendly, pose a serious threat to human health and birdlife, and that they are eyesores that ruin the state’s idyllic landscape. Wind parks installed in Lowell and Sheffield have clearly demonstrated that such projects are in fact far more environmental vandalism than they are “protection”.
The latest proposed Swanton wind park went up for a straight up or down vote among the local residents. The Result? “Residents voted 744-142 to support legislation giving towns the ability to oppose future projects.” That’s 83% to just 17%!
Residents be damned
So is this going to impress state officials, led by Governor Peter Shumlin? WPTZ reports:
State officials warned that the results of the two proposals are not binding. […] Townspeople currently don’t have a say in area wind development. […] Even with voting results, the state can still move forward with the development plan.”
In other words: Votes (democracy) are apparently no longer binding in Governor Peter Shumlin’s the kingdom of Vermont. Has he lost it?
Moreover, developers cried that the wording made it difficult to get a fair vote because it focused on the negatives of wind energy and not the positives. However many residents argue that there aren’t really any positive points and that the “clean energy” claim is only a feel-good argument. Wind energy is unpredictable, wildly fluctuating, severely stresses the power grid, and it is NOT cheap.

One resident in Vermont informed me by e-mail that the vote will not impress the state and that it will take a voters-be damned-view and simply steamroll the project through.
Irasburg residents reject wind park 274 – 9!
Meanwhile the VermontWatchdog here reports that the residents of Irasburg, located in rural, scenic northern Vermont, just stone throw away from the now infamous Lowell windpark, also recently voted on a proposed wind park, rejecting it by a vote of 274 to 9 (97% to 3%)! That vote result was so lopsided that the 9 votes probably came exclusively from the landowner and a few of his buddies.
The VermontWatchdog called the result “a stinging rebuke“.
The spirit of Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys is alive again in Vermont it seems. Vermonters must keep up the fight. The VermontWatchdog quotes citizen Paul Drayman:
There are big companies that are right now buying up some very large plots of land, and they’re targeting areas like this. … If we do not stop this, in 20 years you will not recognize this area. It will look very different.”
The “ruralness” that characterizes Vermont will be lost at least for a generation.
Here in Germany we have seen huge debacles in the country’s mad rush to wind energy. Any Vermont resident is welcome to contact me for more information on the failed German model. You can start by looking at all the posts I’ve written under Alternative Energy at the side bar.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEuropean cold update…
German weather site wetter24.de writes that parts of Germany, Switzerland and Austria will see frosty nights in the days ahead, heralding an early start to autumn.
Temperatures in southern Germany dipped to -5°C early this morning, with frost gripping also parts of eastern Germany and the Black Forest region, where in Bernau the temperature dropped to -1°C this morning. The low temperature at the ground surface was -5°C – awfully cold for a region where frost and snow were supposed to be a thing of the past even in the wintertime!
Wetter.24 also forecasts a 65% chance of surface frost in the Black Forest region in the coming nights as well. Also in mid July Central European regions saw frost!
Winter never left Scotland, sees snow yet again this summer!
In some parts of Europe this summer it is turning out to be one that never saw winter leave. The dailymail.co.uk reported here just days ago that Scotland was forecast to get snow on the ground this week – on top of the snow from last winter that never left. This means 2015 will be the year where winter never really left!
The Daily Mail writes:
Big freeze is on the way
Britain is set to plunge into freezing temperatures with heavy snow showers next week.
The cold snap will begin on Sunday in Scotland and is expected to spread southwards, bringing snowfall to parts of England and Wales by Wednesday.”
All this comes on the heels of one of Britain’s coldest summers in years. It seems the warmer the NOAA fudges the temperature data, the more snow and frost we are seeing.
Also in July Scots were forced to endure winter conditions. The Scotsman here reported of “hats, scarves and gloves in July in one of the most dismal summers in living memory“. It added: “It’s the second time this month snow has been forecast.”

Sweden too saw icy, wintry conditions this summer, with older residents in one Sweden’s mountain region unable to remember “seeing so much snow in August since the 1960s“.
WeatherAction News Blog reported:
A very unique situation, say the residents in the area.
The approaching autumn, and still do not have the snow melting away on the mountains. Villagers in Klimpfjäll cannot remember there ever been so much snow left at this time.
‘I’ve plowed this since the 60s and this much snow has never been there. It should have been gone by now but it’s not,’ says Agne Eliasson in Klimpfjäll.”
Swedish Västerbotten site here reported in August:
Snowdrifts in the low mountain should normally be gone now. Go towards the Norwegian border to the west at 1100 meters altitude, then there is more snow than bare ground.”
“Start of a significant cold period”
Earlier NTZ reported here how Iceland had been experiencing one of its coldest summers in 20 years.
Met Office meteorologist Páll Bergþórsson suspected already in April 2015 that the cold was no isolated event, but the start of a significant cold period.
Europe may have to be buried under a kilometer thick sheet of ice before people wake up to the hoax of global warming.
Impressive ice growth in Greenland
Not only Northern Europe has been gripped by cold and ice, but also a large part of North America, Greenland and the North Atlantic has been colder than normal so far this year. German site wobleibtdieglobaleerwaermung wrote that in the 2014/2015 season the daily course and accumulated ice mas development on Greenland measured in gigatons since September 1, 2014 is showing a mass growth of around 200 gigatons, or 200 cubic kilometers.”  Read more here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest hardcopy issue of flagship news magazine Der Spiegel reports how Germany’s green energy revolution has bitterly divided the country’s environmental movement.
Enoch zu Guttenberg, one of Germany’s most prolific environmentalists has become an outspoken critic of wind energy in Germany, and believes children in the future will be able to see Germany’s idyllic landscape only in paintings as developers clear hill-top forests to make way for skyscraper-size industrial wind turbines.
Guttenberg, a symphony conductor, told Spiegel the movement against wind turbines has exploded over the past months and years and that his speeches against wind turbines are attracting ever larger crowds: “When I started 60 or 70 would come, now there are more than 1000.”
Moreover Guttenberg talks of “hundreds of local citizens’ initiatives” that are now mobilizing against wind projects. Spiegel writes of a whole “new quality” of resistance that governments now need to confront as many traditional environmentalists now rail against what they view as a “corruption of green party members, environmental groups, local politicians and city councils“.
So divided the environmentalists have become that Germany’s powerful BUND (Friends of the Erath Germany) launched a slander lawsuit against Guttenberg after he accused the organization of having “merged” with the Wind Lobby. BUND later dropped the suit. Since then Guttenberg has compared the BUND directors to Judas and accused them of having sold out the environmental philosophy for a “dish of lentil”. Leading environmental activists today are now saying: “The color of sleaze is no longer black, rather it is green.”
The environmental movement has become so disunified, Spiegel writes, that once diehard nuclear energy opponents have now switched to protesting wind turbines, as many planning boards ignore concerns of the citizens and attempt to steamroll projects through against the public will.
Often the projects are politically explosive, involving a good old boys network. A typical pattern, Spiegel writes:

Town mayor, local pols, city directors, who at the same time happen to be the managing directors of wind parks and who profit from them. A dubious mesh of community and electricity interests.”
This is how it works at many communities, Spiegel describes. Often the nearby residents and citizens pay heftily through lost property values, health issues from infrasound, and high electricity prices. Invariably only very few benefit at all.
Planners often shoot back and claim nothing is illegal about the business deals. But the public is not having it. Spiegel adds:
Indeed in the meantime resistance is growing. ‘The mood has flipped because people are noticing that it is all about business,’ says anti-wind activist [Manfred] Knake”
At the end of the article Guttenberg, Spiegel writes, calls it the “capitialistic injustice of the Energiewende“.
The money of the little guy, who has to pay billions for renewables,  is diverted into the pockets of some large property owners.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterBook review: “The Fable of a Stable Climate”
By Dr. Hans Labohm
(Edited/condensed by P. Gosselin)
Gerrit van der Lingen has recently published a fascinating book, “The Fable of a Stable Climate, the writings and debates of a climate realist”.
Most of the public information about the climate comes from scientists who studied the weather and weather processes and who consider temperature data of 150 years already a long period. For geologist and paleoclimatologist van der Lingen this is only a heartbeat in the geological history, which forms the only correct context for judging the present climate developments.
Ideology vs pure science
While studying climate change in the past van der Lingen realised that the present belief in man-made catastrophic global warming caused by CO2 emissions is not supported by the science and that it seems the debate is one between ideology and pure science.
The first chapter of his book an overview giving a clear overview of the climate debate, with all its high and low points. It draws attention to important participants, protagonists as well as antagonists. What really surprises Gerrit van der Lingen is how it is possible that intelligent people have been taken in by the AGW hypothesis and seem to have lost all sense of reality as a consequence.
British science delegation misbehaviour
One salient detail in the book pertains to the Russian position in relation to the Kyoto Protocol. The Russians had a few questions on which they never received an answer. In 2004, they decided to organise a climate conference in Moscow, independently of the UN IPCC climate panel, and with the co-operation of a number of climate sceptics. At the end of this conference, Andrei Illarionov, then economic advisor of president Putin, presented his impressions.
Yuri Antonovich and I have mentioned the fact that this is the first seminar of its kind that we have managed to arrange and it was accidental. Over almost a year we have repeatedly asked our foreign partners who advocate the Kyoto Protocol and who insist that Russia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol, and we have invited them to meet and discuss these issues, present arguments and counter-arguments and discuss them jointly. But we have not received any reply for a year. These people persistently refused to take part in any discussion.
Nine months ago, at an international climate change conference in Moscow, ten questions concerning the essence of the Kyoto Protocol and its underlying theory were submitted to the IPCC. We were told that the reply would be given within several days. Nine months have passed since then but there has been no reply, even though we have repeated our inquiries on these and the growing number of other related questions.
Instead of getting replies to our questions, we kept on hearing that replies did not matter. What was important is that whether or not Russia trusts Britain, the European Union and the countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol and that have been exerting unprecedented pressure on Russia to ratify it. This is why it was so important for us to arrange a real meeting and a real discussion of real problems with the participation of foreign scientists who have different views in order not to stew in one’s own juice, as Yuri Antonovich put it, but to hear the arguments not only of our Russian scientists but also the arguments and counter-arguments from scientists in other countries.
We did get such an opportunity and over the past two days we heard more than 20 reports, we held detailed discussions, and now we can say that a considerable number of the questions we formulated and raised have been somewhat clarified, just as some other questions have.”
Andrei Allarionov continued describing in detail the misbehaviour of the British delegation under the leadership of Sir David King, then the most important advisor of the British government, who did his utmost to sabotage the meeting, among others by requiring that climate sceptics not be allowed to present their presentations, and by stalking out of the meeting.

Ideology, not science
Illarionov compared the AGW with an ideology:
The next point brings us directly to the Kyoto Protocol, or more specifically, to the ideological and philosophical basis on which it is built. That ideological base can be juxtaposed and compared … with man-hating totalitarian ideology with which we had the bad fortune to deal during the 20th century, such as National Socialism, Marxism, Eugenics, Lysenkoism and so on. All methods of distorting information existing in the world have been committed to prove the alleged validity of these theories. Misinformation, falsification, fabrication, mythology, propaganda. Because what is offered cannot be qualified in any other way than myth, nonsense and absurdity.”
The Moscow climate conference leaves no doubt that the Russian Academy of Sciences cannot be considered as supporters of the AGW dogma – a thesis that is part of the standard repertoire of the disinformation by climate alarmists.
“Rubbish in – gospel out”
The book also looks at all important themes of the climate debate are discussed in short, clear analyses, and all allegations of the climate alarmists are tested against measurements and observations, and are refuted. In the end all warming hysteria is not based on science, but only on non-validated computer models. As is often said: Rubbish in – gospel out.
At the end of the book, Gerrit van der Lingen sighs:
When future historians will be studying the present global mass hysteria about alleged catastrophic man-made global warming (MMGW), they will most likely shake their heads in total disbelief. They may well compare it with other such historic irrational hysterias, like the tulipomania in Holland in the 17th century. […]
The belief that human emissions of carbon dioxide cause, or will cause catastrophic global warming is a […] totalitarian belief. It does not allow ‘critical discussion’. Those scientists who try are vilified. Over the years I collected the following abuses: ‘climate change deniers’, ‘cashamplified flat-earth pseudo scientists’, ‘the carbon cartel’, ‘villains’, ‘cranks’, ‘refuseniks lobby’, ‘polluters’, ‘a powerful and devious enemy’, ‘profligates’. The list is endless. […]
By saying that the science of climate change is ‘settled’ and not open to further discussion, clearly shows that the belief in man-made global warming is not based on proper science, but is a neo-Marxist, intolerant ideology. It is anti-science, anti-capitalist, anti-democracy, anti-growth, anti-humanity, anti-progress.”
All in all, “The Fable of a Stable Climate” shows a wide and solid knowledge of the subject. Moreover Gerrit van der Lingen has the talent to very clearly explain the complicated problems, which make his writings very accessible for a broad public. In other words: his book reads like a riveting novel.
The book has 418 pages and many illustrations and graphs, as well as extensive reference lists, and is available in both paperback and Kindle, can be ordered at www.book2look.com.

"The scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming is likely to have passed 99%, according to the lead author of the most authoritative study on the subject, and could rise further after separate research that clears up some of the remaining doubts. Three studies published in Nature and Nature Geoscience use extensive historical data to show there has never been a period in the last 2,000 years when temperature changes have been as fast and extensive as in recent decades.  It had previously been thought that similarly dramatic peaks and troughs might have occurred in the past, including in periods dubbed the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Climate Anomaly. But the three studies use reconstructions based on 700 proxy records of temperature change, such as trees, ice and sediment, from all continents that indicate none of these shifts took place in more than half the globe at any one time. The Little Ice Age, for example, reached its extreme point in the 15th century in the Pacific Ocean, the 17th century in Europe and the 19th century elsewhere, says one of the studies. This localisation is markedly different from the trend since the late 20th century when records are being broken year after year over almost the entire globe, including this summer’s European heatwave. Major temperature shifts in the distant past are also likely to have been primarily caused by volcanic eruptions, according to another of the studies, which helps to explain the strong global fluctuations in the first half of the 18th century as the world started to move from a volcanically cooled era to a climate warmed by human emissions. This has become particularly pronounced since the late 20th century, when temperature rises over two decades or longer have been the most rapid in the past two millennia, notes the third. The authors say this highlights how unusual warming has become in recent years as a result of industrial emissions. “There is no doubt left – as has been shown extensively in many other studies addressing many different aspects of the climate system using different methods and data sets,” said Stefan Brönnimann, from the University of Bern and the Pages 2K consortium of climate scientists. Commenting on the study, other scientists said it was an important breakthrough in the “fingerprinting” task of proving how human responsibility has changed the climate in ways not seen in the past. “This paper should finally stop climate change deniers claiming that the recent observed coherent global warming is part of a natural climate cycle. This paper shows the truly stark difference between regional and localised changes in climate of the past and the truly global effect of anthropogenic greenhouse emissions,” said Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London. Previous studies have shown near unanimity among climate scientists that human factors – car exhausts, factory chimneys, forest clearance and other sources of greenhouse gases – are responsible for the exceptional level of global warming. A 2013 study in Environmental Research Letters found 97% of climate scientists agreed with this link in 12,000 academic papers that contained the words “global warming” or “global climate change” from 1991 to 2011. Last week, that paper hit 1m downloads, making it the most accessed paper ever among the 80+ journals published by the Institute of Physics, according to the authors. The pushback has been political rather than scientific. In the US, the rightwing thinktank the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is reportedly putting pressure on Nasa to remove a reference to the 97% study from its webpage. The CEI has received event funding from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and Charles Koch Institute, which have much to lose from a transition to a low-carbon economy. But among academics who study the climate, the convergence of opinion is probably strengthening, according to John Cook, the lead author of the original consensus paper and a follow-up study on the “consensus about consensus” that looked at a range of similar estimates by other academics. He said that at the end of his 20-year study period there was more agreement than at the beginning: “There was 99% scientific consensus in 2011 that humans are causing global warming.” With ever stronger research since then and increasing heatwaves and extreme weather, Cook believes this is likely to have risen further and is now working on an update. “As expertise in climate science increases, so too does agreement with human-caused global warming,” Cook wrote on the Skeptical Science blog. “The good news is public understanding of the scientific consensus is increasing. The bad news is there is still a lot of work to do yet as climate deniers continue to persistently attack the scientific consensus.” • This article was amended on 26 July 2019. An earlier version abbreviated the name of the Competitive Enterprise Institute as CPI, rather than CEI."

"As Europe suffers another summer of record-breaking heatwaves, it is worth reflecting on the group perhaps least happy to benefit from the soaring temperatures – Green parties across the continent, which are, however, in a better electoral position than ever. In May’s European parliament elections, the Greens won 22 more seats and 4.4% more of the vote than in 2014. Domestically, the German Greens participate in a majority of state governments and top national polling; the president of Austria is a Green-Independent and Greens have secured record vote shares in recent elections in Finland, Belgium and the Netherlands. They are also poised to pick up votes in forthcoming Swiss and Austrian elections. Although setbacks in Denmark and Sweden highlight the importance of national context, Greens have been gaining footholds outside their historical strongholds and are surging in polls in Ireland and the UK. The most obvious explanation is found in shifting attitudes to the environment and the climate crisis. Although Europeans lost some belief in the threat during the 2000s, by 2016 large majorities across the continent agreed that global heating was happening, that it was at least partially caused by humans and that its impact would be negative. It is this “salience” that activates emotions and changes voting behaviour. In 2016, only 6% of EU citizens listed the environment as one of the two most important issues affecting their country. Just two years later, this figure had risen to 14% and is still climbing. In the latest Eurobarometer – a survey which monitors public opinion in every member state – 22% of Germans, 41% of Dutch and 39% of Swedes ranked “the environment, climate and energy” as one of their country’s top two most important issues. By contrast, southern and eastern Europeans remain fairly uninterested – just 1% of Greeks picked the issue in 2018, the same as in 2005. The UK ranks somewhere in the middle, at 11%, though this summer has seen a sharp increase. Why is the salience of the environment soaring? Historically, some academics have played down the effects of “real-world” events or citizens’ abilities to deduce which issues matter, instead emphasising strategic manipulation of the agenda by the media and politicians. While these certainly count, the salience of the environment, like that of most other issues, ultimately does reflect real events. Evidence of soaring temperatures is becoming the lived reality of citizens, making scientific findings on the resultant collapse of ecosystems increasingly difficult to ignore. However, there is more to the current Green success than greater environmental concern. The geographical disparities can still be partially explained by the long-term emergence of “post-material values” in affluent western European societies in the 1970s. These saw individuals move beyond materialist, redistributive concerns to quality-of-life matters, including care for the environment. Moreover, the breakdown of postwar western European party systems and the accompanying decline in class voting mean that we are increasingly inclined to vote according to psychological predispositions and less because of social group. Without these social anchors in place, mainstream parties have become more vulnerable to “anti-incumbency” voting and single-issue voting, primarily to new parties. Centre-right parties have had to deal with challenger, anti-immigration parties, while the centre-left has suffered at the hands of, first, anti-austerity parties and, increasingly, environmentalist parties. Although vote switching and electoral volatility have increased in Europe in recent decades, this is almost entirely within ideological blocs. Voters with broadly leftwing or rightwing predispositions now have multiple choices – with similar ideologies but differing priorities – at the ballot box. All of these challenger parties, including the Greens, have displayed a remarkably more professional appearance to voters, mirrored by far more effective internal machinery, all of which has been aided by the arrival of the internet and social media. It is no coincidence that the Green party of England and Wales (GPEW) could maintain its membership and a role in the party system after its 2015 “green surge” receded, whereas it quickly faded into irrelevance after its far larger 1989 European election vote share. The case of the GPEW also highlights both how Green parties can take on different shapes according to national contexts, but also how long-term trends tend to see international party families converge ideologically in certain political conditions. Before 2016, the GPEW was a leftwing, anti-austerity protest party whose surge in many ways foreshadowed the rise of the old left of Jeremy Corbyn. But events since then have shaped it into a far more “European”, post-material Green party, swapping the previous flagship of anti-austerity for environmentalism and pro-Europeanism. This mirrors the previous convergence of far-right parties around their single policy flagship of opposition to immigration during the so-called refugee crisis, cleverly playing down any previous extremism or social authoritarianism. What does all of this mean for parliamentary politics? In particular, how should the major losers of the Greens’ ascent – social democrats – respond? Leftwing parties have been tempted to focus on regaining an often sentimentalised vision of the “white working class”, almost always on the issue of immigration. This is a mistake. Across western Europe, most far-right, working-class voters were usually previously centre-right voters and their conservative value orientations mean their chance of voting for the centre-left are tiny. Centre-left parties should focus on those who share their broad values, whether in terms of environmental quality, material opportunities or rights and freedoms. In the 1990s, social democrats were able to achieve electoral success after adopting the Greens’ environmental message en bloc, essentially halting the progress of Greens for two decades. Today, the demand for greater environmental action goes far beyond what centre-left parties are offering.  If western European social democratic parties want to regain offices of state, I’d suggest they offer ambitious proposals on the environment. • James Dennison works at the European University Institute and is the author of The Greens in British Politics: Protest, Anti-Austerity and the Divided Left"
"If there is a glimmer of light amid the darkness of recent reports from the Brazilian Amazon, where deforestation is accelerating along with threats to the indigenous people who live there, it could lie in the growing power of climate diplomacy, combined with increased understanding of the crucial role played by trees in our planet’s climate system. The deal agreed a month ago between the EU and the Mercosur bloc of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay (Venezuela is suspended) enhances European leverage with its South American trading partners. Already, the prize of access to EU markets is credited with having convinced Brazil not to follow Donald Trump’s lead by withdrawing from the Paris climate deal. Now the EU must strengthen its environmental commitments, as a letter from 600 scientists demanded before the deal was agreed. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, made no secret of his plans to promote development, and drew powerful support from Brazil’s agribusiness and mining interests before last year’s election. He scorns conservation and indigenous rights, claiming recently that his foreign opponents want Amazon tribes to live “like cavemen”. Satellite data shows the message is getting through, with clearances up sharply and this month set to be the first in five years in which Brazil has lost an area of forest bigger than Greater London. Illegal gold mining too is spreading. Last week one of the leaders of the Waiãpi people, Emyra Waiãpi, was found stabbed to death on a remote reserve in the state of Amapá, after armed men raided his village.  The situation is of critical importance, and all the more disturbing given recent climate projections. Protecting the world’s largest tropical rainforest, thought to contain 30% of all species, has rightly been an important focus for Brazilian and global environmental policies for two decades. But less than a year after Mr Bolsonaro’s election, the national environment agency appears significantly weakened, with enforcement actions during the first half of 2019 down 20% on the same period in 2018. Prosecutors and activists have been intimidated, while public opinion is mostly engaged elsewhere (for example, on pension reforms). Mr Bolsonaro’s pitch to domestic and foreign audiences is the same: the Brazilian Amazon is none of anyone’s business but Brazil’s. With this in mind, the forest’s international defenders must tread carefully. Denunciations of the new government’s pro-business policies in the name of biodiversity could prove counterproductive. Instead, environmentalists, including Green politicians, should work through European political institutions, in the knowledge that the EU is the second-biggest market for Brazilian exports. Firm pressure must be brought to bear in the form of strong environmental regulations, and a refusal to compromise on transparency. Beef or soya farmed on illegally cleared land must not be imported to Europe. At the same time, Brazilian civil society organisations need support to challenge and resist illegal incursions, and to champion their country’s existing commitments – including to reforestation of cleared areas. Climate education must be promoted globally, so that people can better understand what is going on (the murder of a journalist linked to rainforest exploitation is already the subject of a drama on Brazilian TV). Forest clearances may produce short-term gains, but in the longer term they can only bring disaster. Brazil is in a strong position, at the next round of UN climate talks (moved to Chile after Mr Bolsonaro withdrew an offer to host), to demand increased international aid for the vast Amazon region. If we claim this tropical wilderness as a green lung for the world, we cannot expect Brazil to conserve it alone."

It is widely assumed that sea levels have been rising in recent decades largely in response to anthropogenic global warming. However, due to the inherently large contribution of natural oscillatory influences on sea level fluctuations, this assumption lacks substantiation. Instead, natural factors or internal variability override the detection of an anthropogenic signal and may instead largely explain the patterns in sea level rise in large regions of the global oceans.
Scientists who have recently attempted to detect an anthropogenic signal in regional sea level rise trends have had to admit that there is “no observable sea-level effect of anthropogenic global warming,” or that the “sea level rise pattern does not correspond to externally forced anthropogenic sea level signal,” and that sea level “trends are still within the range of long-term internal decadal variability.”
Below are highlighted summaries from 4 peer-reviewed scientific papers published within the last few months.
1. Hansen et al., 2016
For the convenience of the readers, our basic results are shown in Figure 1. We identified five individual oscillations (upper panel), including a sea-level amplitude of 70 mm (top–bottom [t-b]) of the 18.6-year oscillation caused by the lunar nodal oscillation (LNO) … Together with a general sea-level rise of 1.18 mm/y, the sum of these five sea-level oscillations constitutes a reconstructed or theoretical sea-level curve of the eastern North Sea to the central Baltic Sea (Figure 1, lower panel), which correlates very well with the observed sea-level changes of the 160-year period (1849–2009), from which 26 long tide gauge time series are available from the eastern North Sea to the central Baltic Sea.  Such identification of oscillators and general trends over 160 years would be of great importance for distinguishing long-term, natural developments from possible, more recent anthropogenic sea-level changes. However, we found that a possible candidate for such anthropogenic development, i.e. the large sea-level rise after 1970, is completely contained by the found small residuals, long-term oscillators, and general trend. Thus, we found that there is (yet) no observable sea-level effect of anthropogenic global warming in the world’s best recorded region.
2. Palanisamy, 2016
Building up on the relationship between thermocline and sea level in the tropical region, we show that most of the observed sea level spatial trend pattern in the tropical Pacific can be explained by the wind driven vertical thermocline movement. By performing detection and attribution study on sea level spatial trend patterns in the tropical Pacific and attempting to eliminate signal corresponding to the main internal climate mode, we further show that the remaining residual sea level trend pattern does not correspond to externally forced anthropogenic sea level signal. In addition, we also suggest that satellite altimetry measurement may not still be accurate enough to detect the anthropogenic signal in the 20-year tropical Pacific sea level trends.
3. Hadi Bordbar et al., 2016
The tropical Pacific has featured some remarkable trends during the recent decades such as an unprecedented strengthening of the Trade Winds, a strong cooling of sea surface temperatures (SST) in the eastern and central part, thereby slowing global warming and strengthening the zonal SST gradient, and highly asymmetric sea level trends with an accelerated rise relative to the global average in the western and a drop in the eastern part. These trends have been linked to an anomalously strong Pacific Walker Circulation, the major zonal atmospheric overturning cell in the tropical Pacific sector, but the origin of the strengthening is controversial. Here we address the question as to whether the recent decadal trends in the tropical Pacific atmosphere-ocean system are within the range of internal variability, as simulated in long unforced integrations of global climate models. We show that the recent trends are still within the range of long-term internal decadal variability. 
4. Dangendorf et al., 2016
The observed 20th century sea level rise represents one of the major consequences of anthropogenic climate change. However, superimposed on any anthropogenic trend there are also considerable decadal to centennial signals linked to intrinsic natural variability in the climate system. … Gravitational effects and ocean dynamics further lead to regionally varying imprints of low frequency variability. In the Arctic, for instance, the causal uncertainties are even up to 8 times larger than previously thought. This result is consistent with recent findings that beside the anthropogenic signature, a non-negligible fraction of the observed 20th century sea level rise still represents a response to pre-industrial natural climate variations such as the Little Ice Age.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German NDR public radio here wrote last week how northern Germany’s power grid had suffered a major bottleneck that led to the overload of the Flensburg-Niebüll power transmission line in Schleswig Holstein last week.

North German transformer stations constantly overloaded by wind power. Photo image cropped here (not a German station, for illustration only).
The overload resulted from a power surge from North Sea wind parks when winds picked up a bit. What is unusual in this case, however, is that there was no storm present and the overload was caused by normal wind fluctuations. Thus the incident illustrates the increasing volatility of wind as a power supply, even under regular weather conditions.
At its limits
It turns out that intervening in power grids to avert a widespread power supply breakdown is nothing new in Germany. NDR writes that nowadays power engineer Stefan Hackbusch at the grid’s control center in Northern German increasingly has to intervene even when there are even moderate breezes. The north German public radio media outlet writes: “Because of the strong growth in wind park installations, the power grid up north is at its limits.”

Intervened 50,000 times in May
As winds pick up with little warning, engineers at control centers constantly have to keep a close eye out and be ready to act at a minute’s notice and intervene if the power surges (or drops) to dangerous limits. To prevent overloading of the grid, control centers often have to shut down wind parks until the power supply moves into a safe range. These unplanned wind park shutdowns are occurring more and more often, NDR writes. “Switching off has become much more frequent the workers at the control center confirm. Transformer stations in Schleswig-Holstein had to have their output reduced 50,000 times in May – a record.”
“Waste electricity” skyrocketing
Not only is grid stability a problem, but “waste power” is also growing astronomically, NDR writes, citing the Bundesnetzagentur (German Network Agency), that 555 gigawatt-hrs of renewable power went unused in 2013 because of overloading and the surplus had to be discarded. The trend of “waste electricity” is skyrocketing, NDR writes. According to the provisions of Germany’s EEG renewable energy feed-in act, waste electricity still needs to be paid for, which means that consumers foot a bill for something that is never delivered. Consumers are also required to pay for the electricity that doesn’t get produced when a wind park gets shut down. Wind park operators get paid whether they feed in or not.
Grid bottleneck dampens new installations
One solution for the German grid overloading from the uncontrollable wind and sun sources would be to vastly expand the German national power grid so that wind power produced near the North and Baltic seas power could get transmitted to the industrial south, where demand is big. But here too the costs of building the such transmission power lines are astronomical and permitting entails a bureaucratic mess. Moreover political opposition against these lines is mounting rapidly. Experts say that the earliest, most optimistic completion date for a major power transmission expansion is 2022. This however is now looking totally unrealistic, as pie in the sky.
With the German grid often becoming hopelessly overloaded and with no real expansion in sight, the future looks bleak for wind and solar power systems suppliers. With no place to send the power, there’s no need for new installations. Orders and contracts for new projects have been drying up and wind and solar companies are now being hit hard.

" A few weeks ago in western Sydney, I fanged around the Eastern Creek racetrack looking to kick the wheels of the electric car revolution. A lot has been written on the viability of the electric car: the price, the availability, the range, the chargers. But this was solely about the driving experience, from the perspective of someone who has only ever driven petrol cars. I tested six cars – from pure electric, to hydrogen fuel-cell, to petrol-hybrids. From the Tesla X SUV, to the fully electric SEA truck, to the one-person, three-wheel Toyota iRoad (which we will never speak of again). As a driver, the first thing you notice is that there is no gearbox. Electric cars simply don’t have them. You shift from park to drive to reverse by pressing a button. And when driving, most models use a fixed-ratio gear. There is no clutch, no gearstick, no transmission. It’s a bit disconcerting for someone used to the physical feedback of driving, and the muscle memory. In the hydrogen Hyundai Nexo, the gears are next to the air conditioning. There’s nothing to physically pull or shift. No clunk to give you certainty. On the Tesla X, the gears are located on a stick on the wheel. The fixed gear and fewer moving parts also means an EV reaches its maximum torque more quickly than a petrol car, making it feel more sensitive to acceleration. It just takes off. It all feels unnervingly easy. Parking an electric SUV, all I needed to do was stop and click a small button. I leave the handbrake, I’m told, to turn on automatically. Stepping out, I half-expected the $100,000 Tesla to immediately roll backwards and crush the other $100,000 Tesla. Thankfully, it didn’t. In a way, this sums up my overall experience with electric cars. They take some getting used to, but it’s an exciting feeling of grappling with something new and different.  Of course, it’s important to separate the elements that are due to their being electric from the standard excitement of the new. Any fancy feature or button from a 2019 car – for which you will pay at least $50,000 – is a massive step up from the 1998 Corolla I was driving until last year. But in many ways it’s a combination – the niftiness of the bells and whistles is enabled by the futurism of the electric zero-emissions engine. On the Telsa X, for example, you can adjust your level of suspension on a touchscreen, with toggle buttons, as if your car was a giant iPad. It’s almost a cliche now to say it, but the other thing you notice is that electric cars are silent. For me, it sank in on the drive home. It’s not the lack of start-up rev that hits you, it’s the silence when you are up and running. And it’s really more impressive for the buses and trucks. It’s something to see the SEA electric truck, loaded up on a delivery, leave the kerb silently and whisper around. It’s something you appreciate from the outside, something that would cut down the noise of a busy road for everyone. The third and final difference, from the driver’s seat, is the braking. Most models I tested have something called regenerative braking. This uses the kinetic energy of braking to recharge the car’s battery as you drive. In short, it makes braking more severe, and a bit of a stop-start affair until you get used to it. The amount of regenerative braking varied from car to car, and can be turned off, but it was always initially on by default – presumably as an energy saving measure. On some models, the most extreme setting was the default. Lifting your foot off the accelerator was the equivalent of tapping the brakes in a petrol car – intentionally so. Some cars can work as a one-pedal drive. One spokesman told me he drove to work without hitting the brakes once, just using the highest setting of his regenerative brakes. So what’s the take-home message? Electric cars do not feel radically different. They accelerate quicker, they have more torque and they slow down more sharply – but that’s all down to your settings. It’s about as shocking as borrowing a friend’s car and getting used to it. They exude a feeling of future-proofing. No gears to crunch and fewer moving parts will make them last longer. And it’s satisfying to think of a world where everyone owns one, no one spreads noise pollution down the street and no one emits carbon dioxide. But for many, it is a waiting game until the prices fall, and perhaps even until a secondhand market develops. They are becoming cheaper every day. Predictions are optimistic. Until then, it’ll be limited to a few laps."
"“I was born and raised beside a roaring fire,” says Yasna Seguel proudly, as wet snowflakes tap against the kitchen window behind her and orange flames warm an outstretched palm. A tobacco-yellow stain soaks into the table cloth as she sets her mate gourd down to select a fresh log for the fire. Every evening through the bitterly cold winter months of June and July, the southern city of Coyhaique, the most populous in the region of Aysén in Chilean Patagonia, is smothered by a thick, fragrant blanket of damp wood smoke that clings to the hillsides. With the city lying between two mountainous ridges – to the west lies the Pacific Ocean and behind the steep rise on the other side of the valley is Argentina – there is very little wind to sweep the smoke down the valley and away. Instead, heat inversion compresses the cloud into a dense shield that suffocates the city. The problem isn’t one that we can solve without a sustained, coordinated effort A 2018 study by the World Health Organization (WHO) looking at 4,357 cities in 108 countries worldwide showed Coyhaique to have the worst air quality in the Americas – and ranked it 139th unhealthiest in the world. “Coyhaique is confined to an area that is incredibly unfavourable in terms of ventilation,” says Nicolás Huneeus, an assistant professor at the University of Chile’s geophysics department in Santiago who works to monitor air pollution up and down the country. “Add low temperatures and cheap firewood to the mix, and the problem isn’t one that we can solve without a sustained, coordinated effort.” Yasna Seguel says she would not change to a cleaner fuel even if it was cheaper than the logs she currently burns In May 2016, the Chilean government declared Coyhaique “saturated” by harmful fine particles (PM2.5) which are linked to cardiopulmonary diseases and lung cancer. WHO guidelines stipulate that the concentration of these PM2.5 levels should not exceed an average of 25 μg/m3 over a 24-hour period. Already this year, Coyhaique has entered the environment ministry’s “pre-emergency” day average range 19 times, set at between 110 and 179μg/m3 concentration of PM2.5 particles, and risen to “emergency” levels of more than 180μg/m3 on 11 occasions. On these emergency days, Coyhaiquinos can only use one heater per home and open fires are banned. Outdoor exercise is also restricted, with school children forced to stay indoors. Despite the pollution many residents are reluctant to move away from wood as a fuel source. A street in the eastern suburbs of Coyhaique shrouded in smoke Having moved to the city more than 50 years ago, Marta Muñoz has developed a chronic respiratory condition and has to be connected to an oxygen supply at all times. Her condition prompted her husband, Luís Espinoza, to remove the wood-burning stove from their kitchen three years ago, replacing it with two paraffin heaters; Muñoz says she misses the warmth of a wood fire. “We used to be able to roast a whole lamb in our oven while warming the house at the same time,” she remembers fondly, gazing out of the window to where the stove now stands in the cold yard. Despite the hazardous PM2.5 levels, Coyhaique is below the national average for incidence of respiratory illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases are only the second cause of death in Aysén behind cancers, whereas they are first overall in Chile. Nonetheless, according to data from the city’s regional hospital, respiratory complaints have been the main cause of admission in Coyhaique every year since 2016 – as well as in the first half of this year. Marta Muñoz and Luis Espinoza. When Muñoz developed a chronic respiratory condition, Espinoza removed the kitchen’s wood-burning stove Shuffling across to sit on a wooden stool beside the open fire grate, her grandson’s woollen clothes drying on a low rack behind the stove and a tin kettle whistling gently on top, Seguel explains that she would not change to a cleaner, emission-reducing fuel either – even if it were cheaper than the sacks of dried logs she buys each day. “The heat from the wood warms the whole house and it’s so pleasing! With other fuels, as soon as they burn out the room goes cold, whereas wood embers burn on for hours,” she says. Seguel has recently applied for a national government grant to insulate her home, which she bought from the state eight years ago but which is inadequately clad for the winter months. Away from Coyhaique’s clusters of social housing, the quality of construction in other parts of the city – which is largely informal and unregulated – is a perennial issue that goes beyond fuel choices. Firewood loaded on to trucks in downtown Coyhaique One of the environment ministry’s flagship programmes involves the exchange of wood-burning stoves for a cleaner alternative that burns kerosene pellets. Residents who have a wood fire in their houses can apply to have their stove taken away and destroyed, replaced with a pellet stove by the environment ministry free of charge. Although take-up has been steady since the programme began in 2011, it has not been easy to persuade Coyhaiquinos to give up their firewood for the slightly more expensive but cleaner kerosene. We need to change attitudes more than anything A number of other programmes and subsidies have also targeted emissions reductions. A scheme to certify the dryness of wood has been renewed for this year, with sellers given a window that closes on 31 July to formalise their businesses and demonstrate that the wood they sell is properly dried. A regional heating system – the first programme of its kind in Chile – will take an initial set of 90 homes to be heated and provided with hot water from biomass heaters, with potential for the project to be expanded to 1,095 homes. Firewood for sale in a truck in Coyhaique Daniela Rauld, who leads the municipal government’s evaluation group, says attitudes must change. “In order to make this cultural shift, we have to find a solution that tackles the root cause of the problem that is both technically and economically viable,” she says. Coyhaiquinos are well aware that their air quality is poor in winter – they get told often enough – but not all are willing yet to make a change to the traditions they have grown up with. Rauld believes regulation needs to be taken more seriously. “If you drive past with a lorry full of fake leather jackets, the police will pull you over and issue a fine, naturally,” she adds. “But lorryloads of wood drive past day after day, that pollute our air and don’t contribute taxes, and nobody says anything!” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"
"In 2015, the United Nations feared that the climate crisis was reaching a point of no return, threatening our very existence. With the Paris summit round the corner and a rare opportunity to get world leaders to commit to meaningful change, it needed a way to get the message out to every citizen in order to save the world from global catastrophe. Its answer? To commission a song featuring Paul McCartney, Fergie from Black Eyed Peas, Natasha Bedingfield and Jon Bon Jovi, artists whom one must presume were chosen because their careers were in similar danger of extinction. Their effort, Love Song to the Earth, has a melody-agnostic chorus that goes: “Looking down from up on the moon, it’s a tiny blue marble / Who’d have thought the ground we stand on could be so fragile?” The song did not chart in any country. It is not Natasha’s fault: artists have long struggled to make environmental activism cool. The climate crisis was, for too long, framed as a scientific issue, one that could be mitigated by small lifestyle changes. It is difficult to make a moving song, art installation or theatre piece about turning off your lightbulbs and using your food-waste bin. But in the past few years, as the climate crisis has become a political emergency, artists have discovered a crucial role for themselves, making an issue that sometimes seems abstract instead feel emotional and urgent. Alison Tickell runs Julie’s Bicycle, a charity that helps the creative community to act on climate crisis and environmental sustainability. It has been running for 12 years, but she says that “over the last two years we’ve seen this wave of creativity and commissioning around climate. We’re seeing many more musicians, many more pieces of theatre, that are creating these links between climate crisis, biodiversity and inequity. The community have had a slow start, but they’re realising that to fix this problem we need to change our culture, and they’re best placed to do that. This is where art really comes into its own.” Few of these new creations feel worthy or scientific; their priority is to make a human connection. Julian Oliver will be talking at Manchester international festival this month about the Extinction Gong, his installation that chimes every time a species is wiped off the face of the Earth (about every 19 minutes). Last year, the conceptual artist Mel Chin created an app, Unmoored, that uses augmented reality to display Times Square flooded and abandoned but for a few boats. And ahead of his current retrospective at London’s Tate Modern, Olafur Eliasson brought blocks of ice from Greenland to the streets of London where they were left to melt. He said he wanted to stop melting ice caps seeming hypothetical, and to “give feelings to things that are otherwise unemotional”. In music, scorched-earth dystopias have been crafted by artists such as Anonhi, whose 2015 single 4 Degrees was from the perspective of a nihilist ready to let the world burn, singing: “I wanna hear the dogs crying for water / I wanna see fish go belly-up in the sea”. Grimes told the New Scientist (yes, in this new era, that’s where Grimes does her interviews) that her forthcoming album Miss_Anthrop0cene explores what an “anthropomorphic goddess of climate crisis” would be like. “Is she sexy and goth and rude?” she pondered. “It’s like, hipster neoclassicism. I think an artist’s role is to weave the collective human experience into a narrative; to distil the most interesting aspects for posterity.” Grimes is tapping into a realisation that, just as comedy has been an effective fundraiser for human rights groups, not every piece of climate activism has to be po-faced. The 2019 answer to Bedingfield’s bleating has been Lil Dicky’s Earth, an all-star environmental awareness anthem that raises money for Leonardo DiCaprio’s foundation, which protects vulnerable wildlife. It includes lines from Lil Jon such as: “What the fuck? I’m a clam”, and Justin Bieber singing, “Hi, I’m a baboon, I’m like a man, just less advanced and my anus is huge.” “We were trying to do it in a way where we could actually get people to listen, and still do something where everyone’s actually learning,” says Benny Blanco, Earth’s producer, who has also worked on Katy Perry and Kanye’s biggest hits. “We really do have to make a huge change or we’re fucked, but if someone comes at you in a fun, accessible way it makes people want to look into it more, research more, because it wasn’t shoved down their throats in some way they can’t understand.” It’s certainly resonating; the video for Earth has been viewed more than 160m times. The message is filtering further through Hollywood, with big stars now toppling over each other to find ways of addressing environmental disasters. Anne Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo are shortly to star in a retelling of the DuPont chemical scandal and the mass pollution of American water by the company. Natalie Portman has executive-produced a new documentary on the horrors of intensive farming. Even the new season of Big Little Lies, where all the characters drive gas-guzzling 4x4s to shepherd their children to and from private school, has a storyline about whether we should teach children that they may see global catastrophe in their lifetime. It would be easy to dismiss this as cultural virtue signalling; pop stars and artists patting themselves on the back for being aware of the climate catastrophe but doing little to actually make the necessary changes to stop us destroying the planet. But already you can see how this way of thinking about the climate is having real-world impact. Artists have begun to get their own houses in order, particularly with regards to the pressure put on the National Portrait Gallery (NPG), Royal Opera House and Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) to end their partnerships with BP. This month, 78 artists including Antony Gormley and Anish Kapoor wrote to the NPG saying BP’s role “in furthering the climate crisis” made it an unacceptable partner. Mark Rylance has already resigned his position at the RSC because of links with the company. But the bigger impact can be felt in how climate activists have engaged with, and pushed back at, popular culture. Extinction Rebellion did not exist a year ago; it is now the fastest-growing activist group in the world. It has understood how art, advertising and popular culture pushes people to consume and waste more – and how it can be exploited to make a quick and permanent change. The group travelled to 2019’s Cannes Lions, the insanely luxurious week-long advertising awards where execs rub shoulder pads with movie stars and rappers. This year, the big winner was the powerful “Dream Crazy” Nike advert starring Colin Kaepernick, widely praised for its support of refugees, disabled athletes and the Black Lives Matter movement. It is reflective of how brands have become effective at commodifying dissent, all while promoting environment-destroying fast fashion reportedly made by underpaid workers and taking advantage of major tax loopholes. Extinction Rebellion wasn’t buying it. Its activists unfurled a banner down the steps of the Palais and quickly became the talk of the festival. “We’re very worried about greenwashing; there’s a big fad around brand activism but the people we spoke to at Cannes said that brands are still concerned with profit over impact,” says Alanna Byrne, one of the protesters. “We were there to tell them: it’s not enough; the impact they’re having on biodiversity is huge and trying to jump on the activist trend isn’t going to change that. They need to relay the emergency rather than continually make people buy things.” Crucially, Extinction Rebellion is not simply decrying advertisers, it is trying to get them onside. “The ad industry has incredibly creative and talented people working in it. We’re saying to these people: use your talents for good instead of selling people crap they don’t need,” says Byrne. “A number of people who were in the advertising industry have left their jobs and are now with Extinction Rebellion.” Adland’s influence on Extinction Rebellion can be seen in the group’s logo, which has all the hallmarks of an agency-led branding. It is simple, clean, immediately recognisable and, most importantly, easily replicated. It can be printed on existing clothes and signage meaning zero waste. It has also partnered with Glastonbury this year, launched a podcast and released a heavily stylised collection of essays with Penguin. Although it is not a tag many of them might choose, they are environmental influencers with a powerful reach. That professional sheen is also present in the work of Doctor Nadine Kuhla von Bergmann, the founder of Creative Climate Cities, an agency based in Berlin that helps bring together different experts to help reduce their climate impact. Its website looks more like that of a Soho marketing agency than an environmental group, and they are specifically targeting governments and big construction and energy firms. She says there is a lot of goodwill towards abstract climate goals – and now they’re pushing to make them happen. A fancy new block of flats, for example, may make big claims about how energy efficient it is going to be, but no one follows up after it has been built. “Grassroots campaigners have fantastic energy and fantastic ideas but they often don’t have the time or the access to be in decision-making moments; that’s what we’re doing,” she says. “But it has to be culturally grounded. We bring people together who have never sat in the same room before so that we can use a language and art and design to help people understand.” Culture is not a panacea: Billy Bragg didn’t save the striking miners, Green Day’s American Idiot didn’t stop an even bigger idiot from becoming president. But environmentalism is a different struggle. In some ways, it is a more organised movement – there are Green parties all over the world, regular summits with the power to make a change; what it needs is the feeling of consistent, perturbing urgency. And so much of that can come from artists."
"Two years after wildfires killed the pigs on his family farms in British Columbia, Scott Kellington is still coming to terms with the destruction. This particular fire had come from the north, its towering flames whipped into a terrible ferocity by strong winds and sustained by the 40C heat. After making sure his wife was evacuated, Kellington and his three sons stayed behind to try to save the neighbourhood homes and livestock.  But while they dug fire guards to protect the 2,000 cows in the neighbour’s farm, they did not notice the flames creeping toward the pig pen in their own backyard. The long, dry grass was perfect tinder. He and his sons watched helplessly as their pigs screamed and the fire engulfed the pen. “It burned down the mountain and burned the house down the street, then burned down our pig pen and [spread] into the trailer park behind us, destroying everything there,” Kellington told the Guardian. The Kellingtons were lucky. There were no human fatalities and the family’s small herd of horses and cows survived. But as wildfires and flooding increase across the US, farm animals are being recognised as being particularly at risk, due to the difficulty of transporting them rapidly. More than 500 breeding livestock are known to have died in wildfires over the past two years in BC alone. There are no global figures available, but in the US, farmers have suffered similar tragic consequences from wildfires. In Oregon last July, one farmer was found dead next to his burned out tractor. It appeared that the fire overcame him as he also tried to do what Scott Kellington did – clear a strip of land to protect a neighbour’s farm. A young couple died from smoke inhalation and burns when they tried to save their cattle from a Texas wildfire in 2017. Canadian agriculture workers tell the Guardian that farmers may appear reckless for putting their lives on the line, but much of the public does not realise how devastating it is for farmers to see their animals and crops – their livelihoods – go up in flames. Last year, more than 1.35m hectares (3.33m acres) of British Columbia’s forests burned, making the wildfire season the worst on record in the province. Canada is home to 10% of the world’s forests and the westernmost province of BC in particular – two-thirds of which is covered in forest – is a leading global lumber producer. “The emotional toll the farmers are feeling is tremendous. The strongest farmers you know broke down when they realised some of their cattle [weren’t] coming home,” says British Columbia’s minister of agriculture, Lana Popham. Meanwhile, the deadliest wildfire in California’s history, Camp Fire, killed at least 85 people and destroyed almost 19,000 buildings in November, 2018. This year’s wildfires could be even worse, Californian officials have warned. Across the US, humans either intentionally or accidentally start the majority of wildfires, according to a 2017 survey of US Forest Service records. In sparsely populated British Columbia, on the other hand, 39% of fires are caused by human activity and 61% are caused by lightning strikes, according to government statistics. Regardless of the instigating causes, the intensity of the “mega fires” that have occurred with greater frequency around the world in recent years has been linked to a combination of complex factors, including climate change, El Niño weather patterns and poor forest management leading to fuel build-up, scientists say. British Columbia’s government will cover the cost of breeding livestock (animals that have not been sterilised) killed in wildfires, and which numbered more than 530 in 2017 and 2018. However, farming groups say many more animals died, with the farmer unable to claim compensation, and that it can take generations for new animals to adapt to pastures. “The benefits of having an older bloodline has nothing to do with taste [of the meat]. It’s just that they adapt to their environment so much better. When you bring in new cows, they are not used to the new types of grass so it takes them time to adjust,” says Larry Garrett, president of the BC Cattlemen’s Association. Garrett is aware that “quite a few” farmers have snuck past police road blocks during previous fires: “Most of these ranchers know their way around. They go in another way to try to find their herds … but it’s extremely difficult in thick smoke,” he says. The impact of the wildfires lasts long after they burn out. Garrett says his ranch was covered with a thick layer of ash last summer that turned into a “black sludge” that prevented cows from grazing. Insurance policies also don’t usually cover the fire’s effects on livestock’s health (such as burned feet and lungs) that may make them unproductive. Marnie and Keith Manders, a married couple in Summerland in the picturesque Okanagan area of BC, had to secure a new spring pasture last year for their herd of 125 cows, bulls and calves. It wasn’t easy because other farmers were in the same boat and much of the viable pasture land was occupied. “The herd won’t be familiar with a new range. It’s just a lot more work, and everywhere you ride there are holes in the ground from the floods that came before the fires,” Marnie Manders says. “Suddenly you’re up to your belly with your horse. It’s just a bog. Really it’s quite scary out there compared to what it was.” Despite the regular devastation from wildfires, people tend to forget about the problems during Canada’s cold and rainy seasons, says John Innes, dean of the faculty of forestry at the University of British Columbia. But people should be planning for wildfires all year round because much more can be done to prevent widespread destruction and deaths. “There are really a lot of ways to manage forests more effectively. Controlled burns done well are a very effective tool for certain types of forest systems, provided they are under control and happen at a certain time of year with fires that stay on the ground and burn off fuel without killing trees,” he says. In areas with leafier trees such as aspen forests, however, controlled burns are risky and not recommended. Brush thinning by hand is too labour-intensive. Farm animals are now part of the solution, too. This summer, the BC government has invested 500,000 Canadian dollars on a new initiative that will use grazing livestock to restrict the threat of fires. The hope is that as cows munch on grasses in dry areas, it will be less likely that fires spread out of control."

Hockey stick inventor Michael Mann makes himself look foolish in an ORF-Interview: “One thing they all have in common: The end of the curve have a steep rise”
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On May 25, 2015 Austrian public broadcaster ORF was compelled to present the inventor of the now fully discredited Hockey Stick chart (Figure 1) in an interview:
The temperature rise is unprecedented
The ‘Hockey Stick’ is the most well-known and controversial curve in climate science: It shows how massively man is impacting the Earth’s climate. Michael Mann is the creator of this chart: In an interview he explains how he arrived at his discovery.”
Nonsense. The curve is false, and so how can it show how much man is impacting the climate? This is a totally faulty logical performance by the Austrian ORF. Ten years later the error was uncovered and more realistic reconstructions were rolled out, for example one by Ljungqvist 2010 (Figure 2).

Figure 1: Hockey stick chart from 1998/2001.

Figure 2: Temperature reconstruction as to Ljungqvist 2010. RWP=Roman Warm Period, MWP=Medieval Warm Period, CWP=Modern  Warm Period, LIA=Little Ice Age, DACP=Dark Ages Cold Period.

It is already quite frightening the nonsense the ORF expects its audience to believe:
science.ORF.at: The Hockey Stick developed from being a level headed temperature curve to a real phenomenon in the Internet. What does the chart show?
Mann: We’ve been measuring the global temperature on the planet with thermometers for about 100 years. In this period the atmosphere warmed up about 1°C. If we want to know just how unusual this warming has been, then we have to look much further back in the past. This can be done only by evaluating the natural archives – tree rings, corals, ice cores and ediments, which help tell us how the climate in the past developed. This is precisely what we did at the end of the 1990s. The result from this: the most recent warming has been unprecedented. The temperature curve of the Hockey Stick begins about 1000 years ago and falls off during the Middele Ages until the so-called Little Ice Age. But starting in the 20th century, the curve suddenly shoots upwards. The temperature is now rising faster than ever before. That’s the blade of the hockey stick.”
Now take a look at Figure 2. Is the warming of the 20th century really unprecendented as Mann claims? Why was it as warm 1000 years ago as it is today? Now comes one of the highlights of the interview:
science.ORF.at: In the 2007 IPCC report in addition to your works there was also a dozen other papers from other teams mentioned. The temperature curves of your colleagues however do not always look like hockey sticks.
Mann: True, but there’s one thing they all have in common: The ends of all the curves all shoot steeply upwards.”
Ha ha. Mann here is right. But this is not what the issue is about. The warming after the LIttle Ice Age is recognized by everyone. Mann is being criticized for his depiction of the 1000-1900 A.D. period, which he claims was pretty much flat. Michael Mann today will not find a single one of his colleagues who supports that.
The ORF is not totally awful when it comes to this issue. They ask the question of all questions:
science.ORF.at: You just mentioned that the recent warming is unprecedented. However there have been periods in the Earth’s history that were as warm, and indeed without the impact of man. Why? 
Mann: Of course that is true. Millions of years ago there was no ice on the Earth’s surface. Back then it was warmer than today. The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere was even probably five times higher than it is now. However that was the result of geological processes taking place on scales of 100 million years. Today’s changes on the other hand are one million times more rapid. It is not about the absolute temperature. It is about the enormous speed at which the temperature is changing. Natural adpatation at this speed simply cannot keep up. That’s worrisome because the seven billion people on this planet are dependent on a stable climate.”
One look at the temperature reconstruction of Figure 2 tells us: Michael Mann can no longer be taken seriously. The ORF had to have known this already. Going back millions of years and large timescales is completely unnecessary. Without blushing Mann simply denies the Medieval Warm Period. The ORF gives Mann a free pass and lets him get by. What an embarassment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning recently sent a letter to daily Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten (PNN), which earlier had reported on dramatic “ice loss” in Antarctica and resulting dangerous sea level rise – the typical bogus climate alarm story we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the Truth Media.
Sadly, the PNN presented only the doom and gloom perspective of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), and so Lüning sent a letter to set the record straight. In his letter he presented by 5 very recent papers that “clearly contradict such a dramatic ice melting at the South Pole.”
In the first paper Lüning cites, NASA states that ice mass gains at Antarctica were greater than the losses.
The second paper states that scientists concluded that sea level rise from the modeled melting of Antarctic ice sheets over the next 200 years will in fact be slower than expected. Yes, the models were over the top again.
The third paper Lüning presents shows that melting of the “West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be slowed by two big factors that are largely overlooked in current computer models“. Yes, more model flaws.
The fourth paper, appearing in the American Geophysical Union, states that “annual snow accumulation on West Antarctica’s coastal ice sheet increased dramatically during the 20th century“.
And the fifth paper examined here writes that the Antarctic ice sheet has stayed frozen over the past 14 millions years, thus suggesting that “the surrounding region, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, or EAIS, has likewise remained intact“, thus lending “new support for the idea that the EAIS did not experience significant melting even during the Pliocene, a period from 3 to 5 million years ago, when carbon dioxide concentrations rivaled what they are today“.
Lüning writes to the PNN that he is getting the impression that “foremost dramatizing climate studies are finding their way” to their newspaper and that he would be happy if they visited his Die kalte Sonne site.

"The blistering heat that last week brought travel chaos and record temperatures to Britain reveal the nation’s vulnerability to changes in weather patterns in regions far from our shores. That was a key message outlined by climate experts after the nation recorded its hottest ever July – thanks to the arrival of heated air carried on atmospheric currents from Africa to the British Isles. “Although the average rise of global temperature is around 1.0C compared with pre-industrial times, we mustn’t forget the rise isn’t even across the globe, as some regions have warmed more than others,” said Dr Peter Stott, of the Met Office. “Temperatures in parts of North Africa, for example, have risen by around 2.0C. This can have a marked effect on UK weather, because the weather patterns, like the one we have seen last week, can bring a stronger signal of climate change with it too, boosting temperatures. The UK receives influences from other neighbouring regions, and as many of these are warming at a faster rate than the UK our climate can receive a greater boost from climate change.” Temperatures passed 25C for three days last week, which means that the hot spell could officially be classified as a heatwave. Fears that rail lines would buckle in the heat led to severe speed restrictions being imposed on many lines, bringing disruption that is still affecting some services. At the same time the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany all experienced record high temperatures last week. In Paris temperatures soared to 42.6C on Thursday, surpassing the city’s previous highest by more than 2C. However, it is still unclear if the UK also experienced its hottest-ever day on Thursday. Provisional figures released by the Met Office on Friday indicated that a peak of 38.7C had been experienced at Cambridge University Botanic Gardens. Britain’s previous high was 38.5C, reached in 2003 in Faversham. The Met Office has refused to confirm the new record UK temperature until it has double-checked its instruments there. This will be done this week, said a spokesman. Most experts expect the reading will stand as a new record, however. “The fact that Thursday’s maximum temperature in Cambridge was the highest ever seen in Britain is an indication of just how dangerous to people these heatwaves can be,” added Professor Hannah Cloke, of Reading University. “At such high temperatures, every extra degree is potentially the difference between life and death to vulnerable people. Last week’s conditions were described as “weather on steroids” by Dr Karsten Haustein, of Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute. “The UK could have reached 40C last week, but cloud cover during the afternoon prevented it. What this short but intense episode has shown is that the potential for 40C is there. “While we don’t know when it will happen for the first time, it is very probable that it is eventually going to happen if climate change continues unabated.” This point was backed by meteorologist Professor Andrew Charlton-Perez, at Reading University. “There are a huge range of physical processes which contributed to the temperature extremes we saw last week. These include both the large-scale weather patterns that brought the warm air mass over the UK and Europe, but also the smaller-scale, local transfers of energy which can be affected by the presence of clouds and the structure of the layer of air nearest to the Earth’s surface.”"

It is apparently regarded as “consensus” science that more than half of the climate changes occurring since the mid-20th century have been caused by humans.  For example, the IPCC’s “consensus” statement from 2013 reads like this:
It is extremely likely more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.
The “extremely likely” designation for this position seems to suggest there is little to no disagreement with this statement in the scientific community, or at least this is what we are apparently supposed to believe.
Only a relatively minor and inconsequential role
Interestingly, since January 2014, the last 2 and half years, 770 peer-reviewed scientific papers have been published in scholarly journals that call into question just how settled the “consensus” science is that says anthropogenic or CO2 forcing dominates weather and climate changes, or that non-anthropogenic factors play only a relatively minor and inconsequential role.
Instead of supporting the “consensus” science, these 770 papers support the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties apparent in climate modeling and the predictions of future climate catastrophes. Furthermore, these scientific papers strongly suggest that natural factors (the Sun, multi-decadal ocean oscillations [AMO/PDO, ENSO], cloud and aerosol albedo variations, etc.) have both in the past and present exerted a significant influence on weather and climate, which means an anthropogenic signal may be much more difficult to detect or distinguish as an “extremely likely” cause relative to natural variation.  Papers questioning the “common-knowledge” viewpoints on ocean acidification, glacier melt and advance, sea level rise, extreme weather events, past climate forcing mechanisms, the “danger” of high CO2 concentrations, etc., have also been included in this volume of 770 papers.
In 2014, there were almost 250 papers that may support a skeptical-of-the-consensus position. see here.

In 2015, there were over 280 papers that may support a skeptical-of-the-consensus position, see here.
240 papers already in 2016
Now updated for the first 6 months of 2016, a review of the literature has already uncovered a list of 240 papers published in peer-reviewed scholarly journals that support a skeptical-of-the-consensus position, see here.
This 2016 list includes 43 papers supporting a Sun-Climate link, which can be added to the 188 papers linking the Sun to climate changes published in 2014 (93 papers) and 2015 (95 papers).
Voluminous evidence
This voluminous evidence of a strong non-anthropogenic influence on climate would seem to undermine the IPCC’s contention that the “consensus” position (e.g., climate change is mostly caused by humans) has been wholly accepted in the scientific community.
Would it be too much to ask for the IPCC to consider this scientific evidence when issuing their next report?

We routinely read about “highest ever” Arctic ice sheet and sea ice melt rates in the Arctic. And about rapid, “faster-than-expected” melting of ice shelves in West Antarctica.  And then, of course, we’re told that sea levels are rising at an accelerating rate — a catastrophically accelerating rate — due to the amplified warming at the poles, or “polar amplification”.
The predominant cause of these alarming climate changes is almost invariably attributed to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, of course. These headlines are now commonplace, designed to grab our attention and stir us to action.  But does the scientific evidence confirm that the polar climate is predominantly determined by the rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions?
A warming and cooling Arctic
As documented in the below Climate4you graph (HadCRUT4), the Arctic climate has followed a roughly 60-year oscillation in the last century. Arctic (70-90 N) temperatures warmed during the 1920s to 1940s, cooled during the 1950s to1990s, and then returned to a warming trend from the mid-1990s onward.

Source: Climate4You 
Back in the early 1990s, the failure of the Arctic region to warm during the previous ~40 years (1950-1990) despite the concomitant increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions was puzzling to scientists publishing in the journal Nature (Kahl et al., 1993: “Absence of evidence for greenhouse warming over the Arctic Ocean in the past 40 years“), leading them to question whether the models for the CO2 greenhouse warming hypothesis  could adequately explain climate fluctuations for the polar regions.
Below are some excerpts from the Kahl et al. (1993) paper.
In particular, we do not observe the large surface warming trends predicted by models; indeed, we detect significant surface cooling trends over the western Arctic Ocean during winter and autumn. This discrepancy suggests that present climate models do not adequately incorporate the physical processes that affect the polar regions.
Conclusion Kahl et al., 1993:
The lack of widespread significant warming trends leads us to conclude that there is no strong evidence to support model simulations of greenhouse warming over the Arctic Ocean for the period 1950-1990.  Our results, combined with the inconsistent performance of model simulations of Arctic climate indicate a need to understand better the physical processes that affect polar regions, especially atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions, ocean heat transfer and cloud radiative effects“
A cooling Antarctica, Southern Ocean since 1979
In contrast to the recent Arctic warming trend, there has been a lack of atmospheric warming in and around Antarctica since the late 1970s according to both the UAH and RSS datasets (as shown in the two graphs below). Scientists have documented a net growth in Antarctic sea ice in the last few decades, and, according to Fan et al. (2014), the Southern Ocean has also cooled since 1979, consistent with the increase in sea ice.  These results are, of course, not consistent with modeled projections.
Key points from the Fan et al. (2014) paper entitled “Recent Antarctic sea ice trends in the context of Southern Ocean surface climate variations since 1950“:
[A]ll of these studies reported a close relationship between [sea ice extent] and sea surface temperature (SST) whereby sea ice gain is associated with lower SSTs and vice versa. … Cooling is evident over most of the Southern Ocean in all seasons and the annual mean, with magnitudes approximately 0.2–0.4°C per decade or 0.7–1.3°C over the 33 year period [1979-2011].”
Also RSS and UAH show Antarctic cooling since 1979:

The unsettled science of polar amplification and CO2 forcing
As the warming in the Arctic has resumed (after decades of cooling), scientists no longer seem to be questioning the theoretical models projecting a polar-amplified warming due to increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Instead, it is presumed to be “settled science” that the dominant cause of the Arctic warming trend since the mid-1990s has been anthropogenic  CO2 emissions.
But is the science of polar amplification due to a rise in atmospheric CO2 really settled? A paper published recently  (2015) by Dr. Schmithüsen (Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany) and colleagues may seriously undermine this conceptualization. The scientists analyze observational measurements (using the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer) of global-scale CO2 radiative forcing and find the greenhouse warming effect for CO2 is “weak” (Greenland) to non-existent (Antarctica) at polar locations, and that the CO2 greenhouse warming effect is instead strongest in the equatorial regions.   Not only is the polar amplification paradigm  rendered questionable by these observed results,  but Schmithüsen et al. (2015) have found that, for central Antarctica, increasing CO2 actually leads to a “negative greenhouse effect”, or a net cooling.
Below are highlighted excerpts from the Schmithüsen et al. (2015) paper entitled “How increasing CO2 leads to an increased negative greenhouse effect in Antarctica“.
For this region [central Antarctica], the emission to space is higher than the surface emission; and the greenhouse effect of CO2 is around zero or even negative, which has not been discussed so far. We investigated this in detail and show that for central Antarctica an increase in CO2 concentration leads to an increased long-wave energy loss to space, which cools the Earth-atmosphere system.”
And:
For most of the Antarctic Plateau, GHE-TES [greenhouse effect as measured by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer] is close to zero or even slightly negative; i.e., the presence of CO2 increases radiative cooling. Over Greenland, the greenhouse effect of CO2 is also comparatively weak but invariably positive. An evaluation of monthly averages of GHE-TES shows that the increased cooling due to CO2 of Antarctica is strongest during austral spring and autumn. … Central Antarctica is the only place on the planet where increased CO2 concentrations lead to an increased LW energy loss to space [cooling]. In the Northern Hemisphere the lowest, but invariably positive, [CO2] forcing values are seen over Greenland and Eastern Siberia.”
An excellent visual representation of the “weak” radiative forcing effect attributed to CO2 for the polar regions is found in Figure 4 (below) from the paper. Notice that, according to Tropospheric Emission Sperctrometer measurements, the radiative forcing values are in the range of only about -1 to +5 W/m2 for the polar ice sheets (Antarctica and Greenland), whereas radiative forcing values average roughly 20 W/m2 for the rest of the globe, with up to 35 W/m2 for the equatorial regions.

Source: here. 
Cloud radiative forcing more than CO2 radiative forcing
To put this relatively “weak” -1 to +5 W/m2 CO2 greenhouse forcing for the polar regions into perspective, consider that the radiative forcing (greenhouse warming effect) for clouds has been found  to be several times  greater (~30 W/m2) over the Greenland ice sheet than for CO2 forcing (~5 W/m2).   In fact, scientists (Tricht et al., 2016) have determined that cloud forcing warmed the Greenland climate by 1.2°C from 2007 to 2010, which is enough heat energy to melt 90 Gigatonnes (Gt) of ice.
Here’s an excerpt from the Tricht et al. (2016) paper “Clouds enhance Greenland ice sheet meltwater runoff“:
Clouds are known to play a pivotal role in regulating the local SEB [Surface Energy Balance], with competing warming and cooling effects on the surface. […] The satellite-based cloud observations allow to estimate the cloud impact on the SEB [Surface Energy Balance].  … The annual mean CRE [Cloud Radiative Effect] of 29.5 (±5.2) W m 2 provides enough energy to melt 90 Gt of ice in the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] ablation area during July and August. … The snow model simulations, which capture the evolution of the GrIS SMB [Surface Mass Balance] from 2007 to 2010, indicate that clouds warm the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] surface by 1.2° (±0.1) C on average over the entire period [2007-2010]. … These results further indicate that not only liquid-bearing clouds but also clouds composed exclusively of ice significantly increase radiative fluxes into the surface and decrease GrIS SMB [Greenland Ice Sheet Surface Mass Balance]”
Not only for Greenland, but on a global scale, cloud radiative forcing has also long been observed to be far more climatically influential than CO2 forcing. For example, in the Ramanathan et al. (1989) paper entitled “Cloud-Radiative Forcing and Climate: Results from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment” — which has been cited over 1300 times in the peer-reviewed literature — it was determined that the greenhouse effect of CO2 may need to be increased by a factor of 100 to approach the greenhouse effect of clouds. What follows is an excerpt:
Water vapour and cloud are the dominant regulators of the radiative heating of the planet. ..The greenhouse effect of clouds may be larger than that resulting from a hundredfold increase in the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. … The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling.”
Summary
The implications of these measurements showing relatively minimal CO2 greenhouse forcing at the poles are enormous. Succinctly, the alarmist insistence of a significant anthropogenic influence on polar ice sheet melting and the consequent impact on sea level rise become highly dubious if observational evidence reveals that the CO2 greenhouse effect is only very modest  (-1 to +5 W/m2) for the polar regions.  For if the Arctic warming trend and sea ice decline that resumed in the 1990s cannot be significantly attributed to increases in atmospheric CO2, this severely undercuts the heart of alarming claims about humans catastrophically altering the polar — and global — climate.
The sensational headlines about melting polar ice and rapidly accelerating sea level rise would be reported with much less exhortative zeal if there wasn’t also a co-existing paradigm that says anthropogenic CO2 emissions are what drive these alleged climate changes. So when science doesn’t corroborate what the alarming headlines say about a significant anthropogenic or CO2 influence on the polar climate, ice melt, or sea level rise, that science is usually glossed over…or dismissed.  After all, the science is supposed to be settled. Right?

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessional engineer Bernd Töpperwien made a presentation (in German) on infrasound and its impacts on human health, specifically addressing the impacts of a wind park proposed to be built in the region he resides.

Though low-frequency infrasound (<20 Hz) is not audible to the human ear, the pressure variations are felt by the inner ear, which plays a major role when it comes to our sense of balance, perception, and orientation.
In his presentation Töpperwien says he used to be a proponent of wind energy. But after having researched the phenomenon of infrasound, he has changed his mind. One problem is that it is very difficult to dampen infrasound and that it travels great distances. A typical infrasound wave from a wind turbine can be measured up to 25 kilometers away he says. They travel great distances.
Moreover, air inversions can even reflect infrasound, and hence act to amplify the waves. Infrasound can also be transmitted to homes via the ground.
The changing pressures ´that infrasound causes in the inner ear lead to the person to believe he is in motion when he actually is not. This can cause the person to experience motion sickness symptoms. Other people may experience feelings of panic or feel discomfort in their organs.

Negative health impacts already confirmed
Other problems persons exposed to infrasound may experience include, insomnia, headaches, depression, high blood pressure, dizziness, tinnitus or even heart problems. All these ailments have been confirmed by a number of German government institutes. The German Army and the Robert Koch Institute have confirmed that persons exposed to infrasound over extended time periods can suffer damage to health, Töpperwien tells the audience.
What does Töpperwien say about wind turbines near homes?
I wouldn’t like to have any such turbine anywhere within 5 kilometers from where I live. I would like to stay healthy.”
What is the result? Increasingly German citizens are mounting ferocious resistance to wind turbines. Today there are hundreds of opposition groups.

"How many wedge-tailed eagles is a black-throated finch worth? No doubt there’s an economist out there willing to have a crack at answering that question, but the right of Australian politics seem to have already figured it out without so much as community survey: eagles are important and finches are not. Australian conservatives mock the idea that the government would block Adani from building a new coalmine on top of the endangered black-throated finch’s nesting grounds, yet it’s the same commentators and parliamentarians who are terribly excited about blocking a proposal to build a windfarm on Tasmania’s Robbins Island. The fact that Bob Brown is worried about both eagles and finches has created even more excitement.  So worried about the eagles is the former Greens leader that he has spoken out against the construction of what would be the southern hemisphere’s largest windfarm. An act so exciting that the Australian newspaper has now devoted three front-page stories to examining the issue. It’s not clear why some species of bird are so important to conservatives and others are inconsequential. The fact that an environmentalist might ever oppose a windfarm is one of the most exciting things to happen to the rightwing commentariat since Yassmin Abdel-Magied used her freedom of speech to defy political correctness and criticise Anzac Day. On 8 July, Brown wrote an opinion piece for the Hobart Mercury outlining concerns about the construction of 270-metre-high wind turbines in the flightpath of endangered migratory birds including the swift parrot, and near the nesting sites of endangered species including the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle. He also flagged the environmental consequences of clearing a path for transmission lines through the Tarkine forest. Barely a week later the Australian ran a story about Brown’s opinion piece under the headline: “Crusader Brown turns against wind farm”. For decades, conservative strategists have painted those who take the science of climate change seriously as “zealots”. Having written Brown off as a zealot, of course the Australian would expect that if he supports investment in renewable energy in general, he should always support every proposal. But does anyone believe that Brown – or anyone else serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions – thinks there is nowhere in our natural or built environment unsuitable for the installation of renewable energy? Put simply, those who want to take no steps to reduce emissions are determined to suggest that those who want to take some steps must want to take every step imaginable. I’m not making this up – rightwing commentators often suggest that environmentalists want everyone to “live in caves” or “the dark ages”. Like most people, those who take climate science seriously take other issues seriously as well – including local environmental effects, economic effects and the distributional consequences of policies to reduce emissions. But the confused attacks on Brown haven’t just come from the right and they haven’t just focused on the importance, or lack of importance, of protecting birds. Some have criticised him for mentioning that the project would be foreign-owned (xenophobia), for caring only about Tasmania (nimbyism) and for speaking out about a topic that was bound to fire up the right (the naivety!). It is amazing how many people one short opinion piece can excite. Pointing out that the proposed windfarm would be foreign-owned isn’t xenophobic – it’s a key part of any democratic or planning discussion about who bears the costs and who receives the benefits. I’ve sat in court and argued on the side of small communities who say that foreign-owned coalmines should be opposed on the basis that their town will incur most of the costs of noise and dust pollution, while most of the benefits will accrue to people who live thousands of kilometres away. No one has, yet, called me xenophobic. As for criticising a former senator for Tasmania for speaking out on behalf of Tasmania, I’ll let others puzzle over that one. But let’s get back to the strategy of attacking Brown. The idea is to present Australians with a false choice between doing nothing to tackle climate change or doing “everything”. The right are betting that such a choice is so difficult that many people will turn away from trying. At the same time, it distracts from the simpler question of whether the Australian government is doing enough to tackle climate change. Democracy requires sensible debate to make sensible decisions. That’s why conservatives work so hard to link issues such as same-sex marriage to bestiality, and supporting renewable energy with the end of modern civilisation. But just because it’s juvenile doesn’t mean it won’t work. There are better and worse places to build coalmines, wind turbines, high-rise buildings and nuclear waste dumps. Australians not only have the right, but should be encouraged, to participate in such debates. But in Australia, if you want to talk about better regulation of the building industry you support “the nanny state”. If you want to talk about the high-quality public health systems in the Nordic countries, you want to “weigh down the economy with the burden of tax”. And now it seems, if you have dedicated your life to the environment but think there are dumb places to build a windfarm, you are a hypocrite who wants to cause climate change. Sigh. But, exhausting or not, democracy needs debate. While arguing with conservative commentators often feels like arguing with a drunk relative at Christmas, the alternative of being silenced is worse. There will always be local concerns associated with the construction of new freeways, new coalmines, new high-rise towers and yes, new wind and solar farms. Democracy doesn’t promise us that everyone will always be happy but it should promise us that everyone has a voice in the decisions that affect them. It’s not Bob Brown and the other environmentalists concerned about the Robbins Island windfarm who are being hypocrites – it’s those on the right who have ignored community and environmental concerns for decades when freeways and high-rise housing were killing the birds and pissing off the locals, and who are now feigning concern about those very same issues. • Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute. He was a strategy advisor to Bob Brown when he was a senator. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Spiegel here writes that India has no plans of cooperating when it comes to CO2 reductions: “In India economic development comes before climate protection. The country is massively embarking on coal-fired power.”
Coal before climate
The German weekly writes that the country has 360 million people suffering under grinding poverty and 400 million people living in homes that are not even connected to the power grid. With such pressing problems it is no surprise that climate change does not have top priority for Prime Minister Modi.
That’s bad news for the proponents of massive global CO2 cuts and (expensive) green energies. Spiegel maintains that India will play a decisive role on whether or not climate protection targets get met. Currently the country is seeing rapid economic growth and its emissions of CO2 are accelerating like never before. Coal burning is set to double by 2019, Spiegel writes. CO2 emissions are projected to almost triple by 2030. That’s huge for a country with well over a billion people.
India rejects requests to cut back
The flagship German weekly also adds that India is not about to accept any requests from prosperous industrial countries that it scale back its coal-burning, especially in view that per capita CO2 emission is India is a mere fraction of developed western countries (see Spiegel’s first chart) and that is the western countries who have burned coal for 150 years and are responsible for alleged climate problems.

Spiegel writes:
India accuses the industrial countries of hypocrisy when it comes the environmental protection – a sentiment that many other developing countries have expressed.”
Industrial countries must pony up 155 billion a year!
Modi’s government is not going to accept any deal unless the industrial countries pony up big time, Spiegel describes. New Dehli estimates that just reducing the intensity of Indian CO2 emissions will cost 155 billion euros – per year! A number that Spiegel says is somewhat overblown and for the purpose of negotiation.
Expect industrial countries in Europe and North America to commit to substantial cuts, but developing countries to get a free pass. Globally CO2 cutbacks remain a distant fantasy and will continue their growth unhindered.

"Britain could bake under record-breaking heat as temperatures could potentially climb to 39C on Thursday. The scorching conditions may spark thunderstorms, which could trigger travel delays, flash flooding, and power cuts.  The dangers of cooling off in lakes, rivers and the sea were highlighted by emergency services after the bodies of three people were pulled from the water on Wednesday after they reportedly got into difficulty swimming. A yellow weather warning is in force for most of England, except the south-west, and parts of Scotland from 3pm on Thursday until 4am on Friday. According to the Met Office, there is a 60% chance the temperature could rise above the current all-time UK temperature record of 38.5C on Thursday. “It will get into the 30s across the country and reach the mid-30s in the south-east,” Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said. “If it is to get to 39C, it will happen somewhere between London and Cambridge. “Temperatures locally could also break July or all-time records.” Lightning storms have already caused fires and rail disruption this week during the heatwave. Network Rail warned that speed restrictions might be introduced in areas where tracks were at risk of buckling. Extreme weather action teams (Ewats) had been activated to keep passengers safe and trains running, it said. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the industry, advised passengers in London and the south-east to consider changing their travel plans on Thursday. London North Eastern Railway (LNER), which runs inter-city services on the East coast mainline, is advising customers against travelling on Thursday. It said some services were likely to be cancelled or delayed as speed restrictions would be imposed between Peterborough and London King’s Cross. The Met Office has warned that heatwaves are on the increase as a result of climate change. The scorching temperatures gripping the UK and much of Europe come against a backdrop of global warming of 1C since the industrial revolution driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Both Belgium and the Netherlands broke their all-time maximum temperature records on Wednesday, reaching 39.9C and 39.1C respectively, the Met Office said. Higher temperatures are making extreme hot spells more likely and more intense, experts warn."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s leading daily in terms of circulation Bild recently featured an op-ed piece that harshly criticizes Germany’s Energiewende (transisition to renewable energies).
Clearly the Energiewende is not even coming close to living up to what is was originally billed to deliver. Despite adding more than 70 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity that will cost consumers some $200 billion, German CO2 emissions have not decreased to speak of. Coal-fired power has actually risen.
In summary German electricity prices have skyrocketed and poor consumers are being hit hard. Energy-intensive industries are off-shoring operations – and jobs!
A number of experts are calling the Energiewende the greatest wealth redistribution from poor to rich scheme in Germany’s history as wealthy property owners cash in with subsidized zero-risk wind and solar installations. The poor consumers are forced to cough up the money.
“Enough with green power!”
So it’s little wonder that major German media outlets are beginning to express doubts. Bild features an opinion piece titled: “Enough with green power!”
The popular German daily calls the promises of cheap power from wind and sun “a fairy tale”. It writes:

Indeed the truth is: The price of power continues to climb. Just in the past five years the power price exploded 29 percent.
The reason is simple: In the energy market, central planning rules and not the free market.”
Disfigured market
Today there is so much installed capacity, Bild writes, that “on days with lots of sunshine and wind, the green power has to be sold to foreign countries” – even if they don’t need it. When that happens the highly subsidized power gets sold at negative prices. The result? Huge losses for power companies. This is how disfigured the electric power market has become.
In summary Bild concludes that the price of power is much more expensive than it needs to be and that it is a product that needs to remain affordable. Germany’s energy policy is on the wrong path.
Unfortunately there are no signs things will change anytime soon in Germany, which now has the world’s second highest electricity prices in the world after Denmark.

"Greta Thunberg has made her musical debut on a single by the 1975. On a track called The 1975, a version of which traditionally opens each of the British band’s albums, the 16-year-old environmental activist restates her position on the need to act on the climate emergency. Thunberg said: “I’m grateful to get the opportunity to get my message out to a broad new audience in a new way. I think it’s great that the 1975 is so strongly engaged in the climate crisis. We quickly need to get people in all branches of society to get involved. And this collaboration I think is something new.”  Over the 1975’s minimal orchestral backing, Thunberg says: “We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed. All political movements in their present form have failed. But homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around.” She continues: “We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly.” Thunberg concludes: “So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel.” Read the full text of her speech below. The proceeds from the track will go to Extinction Rebellion at Thunberg’s request. The environmental group released a statement welcoming the collaboration: “Music has the power to break through barriers, and right now we really need to break through some barriers if we are to face this emergency.” Thunberg is the first outside party to feature on a recording by the band. The track was recorded in Stockholm in late June and is the first song to be released from the 1975’s forthcoming album, Notes on a Conditional Form. The band manager and founder of the label Dirty Hit, Jamie Oborne, said the group and the label were making efforts to minimise their environmental impact. Dirty Hit’s office has phased out all single-use plastic, will no longer produce plastic products including CD jewel cases and is working to minimise the impact of vinyl production. “Rather than ignoring that it’s a pollutant, we’re minimising it by only doing lightweight vinyl from now on,” Oborne said. “That isn’t very trendy, but one heavyweight LP is the equivalent of making two or three [standard thickness LPs].” Dirty Hit’s CDs and vinyl are contained in paper packaging and not wrapped in non-degradable shrink wrap. Oborne said they had sourced a biodegradable shrink wrap which they would integrate fully once their production plants had full access to it. The 1975’s next merchandise line will also be environmentally friendly, repurposing unsold merchandise into new garments. Oborne dismissed peers’ suggestions that the organisation could be labelled hypocritical for taking a stance on the climate crisis before becoming 100% carbon efficient. “That’s why we’re in this situation where everyone’s standing around and it takes a child to point out that we can make these changes,” he said, referring to Thunberg. “We’re not going to have touring worked out in six weeks because everything’s working against you, but we are going to have it sorted out in a period of time, and 50% is better than nothing. If everyone pushes responsibility onto other people because they can’t completely solve [the issue], we’re already fucked.” The track release follows Thunberg’s address to French politicians on 23 July, in which she urged them to “unite behind the science” of climate change. After rightwing legislators said they would not attend her appearance at the National Assembly, she said youth climate activists have become “the bad guys” for stating “uncomfortable things”. “Just for quoting or acting on these numbers, these scientific facts, we receive unimaginable amounts of hate and threats,” she said. “We are being mocked and lied about by members of parliament and journalists.” On 20 September, Thunberg and other young environmental activists will lead a climate strike around the world. The 1975’s new album is the second in their Music for Cars series, which began in November 2018 with A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. The group will headline this year’s Reading and Leeds festivals in August. The full text of Thunberg’s speech. We are right now in the beginning of a climate and ecological crisis. And we need to call it what it is. An emergency. We must acknowledge that we do not have the situation under control and that we don’t have all the solutions yet. Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things. We admit that we are losing this battle. We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed. All political movements in their present form have failed. But homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this. We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don’t stand a chance. We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly. Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that homo sapiens have ever faced. The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases. And either we do that, or we don’t. You say that nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent a 1.5 degree of warming, or we don’t. Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, or we don’t. Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don’t. That is as black or white as it gets. Because there are no grey areas when it comes to survival. Now we all have a choice. We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations. Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail. That is up to you and me. And yes, we need a system change rather than individual change. But you cannot have one without the other. If you look through history, all the big changes in society have been started by people at the grassroots level. People like you and me. So, I ask you to please wake up and make the changes required possible. To do your best is no longer good enough. We must all do the seemingly impossible. Today, we use about 100 million barrels of oil every single day. There are no politics to change that. There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground. So, we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules. Because the rules have to be changed. Everything needs to change. And it has to start today. So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel."
"It’s time to start blaming Generation X for things. In the generational wars, people are sorted into two separate but equally important groups: millennials (AKA Gen Y) and baby boomers (AKA boomers). This has become something of a meme to the point where, strangely, anyone who is older and in a position of power is referred to as a boomer, even if they’re not, while anyone who is younger is called a millennial, again, even if they’re not. For some reason everyone forgets about Generation X, and also whatever we’re calling the generation after millennials. However they are now entrenched in popular usage, for better or worse. If we look at the composition of governments and who is leading countries, it’s clear that Gen X should start shouldering some of the blame. They’ve been in positions of power for a while now, and terrible thinkpieces that fan the flames of generational warfare should start to reflect this. Should Gen X be doing more to address the climate crisis even though it is largely the fault of boomers? I say yes, yes they should. For example, here’s the age distribution for heads of government from OECD companies, using generational definitions from Pew Research: You’ve got Donald Trump (a boomer) on one end, and Jacinda Ardern on the other (she’s almost a millennial). The main thing to note is that there are a lot of Gen Xers there. In Australia, we now have our first Gen X prime minister, Scott Morrison. While the boomers have largely overseen the climate crisis, it’s a Gen X prime minister who now has no effective policies for meaningful cuts to Australia’s emissions. Canada has Justin Trudeau, and New Zealand has Ardern. Ardern and her government have been widely praised for their response to the Christchurch massacre, which included a ban on most automatic and semi-automatic weapons. In the UK, Theresa May is a boomer, but Britain has previously had a Gen Xer in number 10 in David Cameron. And if I understand basic physics, it’s almost certain that Gen X will only continue to become more prevalent in positions of power, so everyone should probably brush up on their knowledge of Nirvana’s back catalogue or start using quotes from Reality Bites in everyday conversation. Finally, these generational terms (iGeneration lol) aren’t really of much use for actual demographic purposes. Aside from baby boomers, the date cut-offs are pretty arbitrary. They’re mostly used by marketing companies to sell cereal or juice machines that connect to the internet and have their own cryptocurrency. Also, If anyone has pioneered a system for classifying generational date cut-offs based on data, I’d quite like to see it, so please email me. Please do not email me to tell me why I am wrong, cheers. Nick Evershed is the data and interactives editor for Guardian Australia"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week the media, led by the Washington Post, screamed and hollered the North Pole was in meltdown as temperatures there rose some “5 degrees above normal”. In Europe some media outlets did not even bother converting the 50° Fahrenheit figure to (the less impressive sounding) 32°C.
It is true that the temperature right at the North Pole was “estimated” by “weather forecast models” to have supposedly reached the melting point – for a period of a few hours. But what the news media neglected to tell readers is that the North Pole region itself is actually a vast area – and one that is extremely poorly measured – as even the Washington Post admits. The Arctic region as a whole in fact did not warm up anywhere near 32°K (50°F) last week.
Only a fraction of the Arctic saw a large warm spike
The reality is that weather charts showed only a minority fraction of the Arctic saw temperatures near the melting point, while the vast remainder remained stuck at its usual 25 – 40°C below zero range.
According to the Danish Meteorological Institute here, which has been systematically tracking Arctic temperatures north of 80° latitude since 1958, here’s what the 2015 “North Pole meltdown” really looked like (far right) once the whole Arctic region got factored in:

Chart: DMI.
The above DMI figure shows that the temperature in the Arctic above 80°N was estimated to have risen only some 13°K during the event, and not 30°K as the WAPO tried having its readers think. Note how also in early March 2015 the Arctic saw a similar rise.
Just a few hours after the local region near the North Pole saw a burst of warm southern air, almost immediately temperatures there dropped back to -30°C.

Has a 13°K spike happened before?
Is a 13°K temperature spike in the high Arctic something weird and totally unusual that we need to worry about? Going back and looking at the DMI charts over the past 58 years, we find that such temperature spikes in the Arctic for the period early November to late March are nothing new.
For example a look at the year 1959, the chart below shows that a similar temperature spike occurred not just once, but twice! (marked yellow).

Chart: DMI.
And examining all the years since 1958 we see that a temperature spike of some 12°K or more in a matter of a few days (during the November to March deep winter period) occurred more than 70 times! And over 100 times for spikes of 10°K and more. 
Clearly we see fluctuations of 10°K (i.e. similar to what just happened) in a matter of days are actually the norm for the North Pole region.
Also taking a look at the wild fluctuations seen in 1964, 1984, or 1990 – back when CO2 was at levels near or below the “safe” 350 ppm – we see they were far more extreme.
What does this tell us about the reporting by the Washington Post, and all the other media outlets who allowed themselves to be duped and irresponsibly played along? It shows that many mainstream journalists are agenda-driven, not interested in digging, and that their sole aim in reporting climate science is to fabricate junk-science-based scare stories that have no journalistic merit.
They’ve degraded themselves to acting as the mouthpieces for a dishonest agenda.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAwhile back I posted before-and-after photos of how wind parks are destroying Germany’s natural landscape.
Those photos have now been put into a video. Send the link to political leaders or communities who may be contemplating wind parks in their areas.

Is this really what you want to see every time you look out the window? How does destroying nature save it?
Meanwhile in Germany the “nature-saving” wind parks have done nothing to curb CO2. Last year Germany’s CO2 emissions rose.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days ago NoTricksZone turned 5. The first post was published on April 2, 2010.
This blog was inspired by Donna Laframboise of No Frakking Consensus after I had been part of a group of volunteers who helped her check the literature on which the conclusions of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report were based on. Those results rocked the IPCC.
The beginnings of NoTricksZone were humble, and my expectations were to perhaps reach a few hundred readers per day after a year or so. I didn’t even have any social media buttons. Yet within a few weeks traffic started coming in, in large part thanks to the big sites like Marc Morano Climate Depot, Anthony Watts WUWT and Tom Nelson who linked to NTZ stories. A year later the site reached 1 million views. Now, 5 years later, the 10 million views has been surpassed. Not bad for something that is a hobby on the side for me.
I’m also proud of having been mentioned by Justin Gillis in The New York Times, getting a link at Drudge, being on the Who’s Who List of Climate denialists” and having worked helped out Dr Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt’s climate science critical book Die kalte Sonne (The Neglected Sun), which shook the German climate science establishment.
The main idea behind this blog is to get stories from Germany and Europe that the world would otherwise never hear about out to the broader public. The progress of Germany’s Energiewende is an important issue and other countries worldwide need to get all the information about it before they uncritically accept its rosy, utopian promises. Germany’s Energiewende arguably has become a debacle of immense dimensions. See the side bar under Alternative Energies.
The German Energiewende has even reached my home state of Vermont, and the consequences are catastrophic to the scenic region where I was born and raised. Entire mountain tops have been permanently blasted, disfigured and deforested to make way for industrial wind turbines that now stand more as monuments to a pathological obsession with a computer-generated fictitious climate Armageddon than they do as a real solution. The damage in northern Vermont is irreversible. It’s going to take the ice sheets of the next ice age (that was the scare 40 years ago) to grind off the scars left behind by Vermont’s green eco-madness.

My hope is that others will take a more serious, unemotional look at the real situation in Germany (as well as Spain and Great Britain) and not repeat the German blunders.
The focus of NoTricksZone is also to keep readers up-to-date on what is going on at the prestigious German institutes such as the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology or the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). Both are highly influential, but in my view highly irresponsible for having adopted a dangerously ideological position that is completely foreign to the discipline of science. Today they are practicing activist-science in its purest and most virulent form.
NoTricksZone will also continue providing stories brought up by EIKE, DkS and Science Skeptical and many other German sites. The main focus of NoTricksZone will be to continue writing about climate news in Germany and Europe so that people can get stories and insights that they might not otherwise see.
Also thanks to the guest writers who contributed, namely Ed Caryl (I know I’m missing a person or two here, so please forgive me) and all the readers for dropping by regularly. Readers are always welcome to contribute as guest writers.
As a final note, this blog is strictly voluntary and has not received any money at all from Big Oil and industry – not a penny. But of course antagonists are more than welcome to waste their time looking for any links.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecently I posted a number of reports on the powerful correlation between solar activity cycles and historical climate change. Clearly the sun is a driver. The question that remains is what is the mechanism that drives climate.
Recently there have been a number of papers showing Danish physicist Henrik Svensmark is on the right path and that global governments, and the hundreds of climate institutes they fund, are hopelessly lost in la-la land.
========================================
The latest on Svensmark’s cloud-solar-amplifier
By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning
[German text translated/edited by P Gosselin]
A few years ago Henrik Svensmark described a mechanism how solar activity could change cloud cover. Was this the long-sought solar amplifier? The proposed process involves a series of steps where the sun’s magnetic field shields the earth’s atmosphere, at times more and at times less, from cosmic rays – thus acting as a modulator. The tiny galactic particles then act as seeds for condensation and cloud formation, which in turn regulate the Earth’s temperature. This mechanism allowed Svensmark to establish a correlation between solar activity and clouds. But later the curves deviated from each other in the 20th century. So indeed it turned out to be more complicated. The IPCC was elated and promptly discarded the model.
But the IPCC appears to have acted too hastily with its curt dismissal because bit by bit it is becoming increasingly clear that it is necessary to differentiate more carefully between various latitudes, cloud levels and seasons. What follows is a summary of the latest publications on the cloud-solar amplifier.
In November 2014 in the journal of Atmospheric Research M. Kancirova and K. Kudela reported on a study on the development of cloud cover and cosmic rays atop a 2634 meter mountain in Slovakia over the 1982–2010 period. Here the authors found a stable correlation between clouds and cosmic rays, even if the signal was weak. The abstract:
Cloud cover and cosmic ray variations at Lomnický štít high altitude observing site
We studied the relation of cloud cover and cosmic rays during the period 1982–2010 measured at Lomnický štít (2634 m above sea level, in the direction of 49.40°N, 20.22°E, geomagnetic vertical cut-off rigidity for cosmic ray ~ 3.85 GV). Daily means are used. It is seen that the correlations are insignificant for averaging shorter than about one year. We have found weak positive correlation for longer averaging times. Difference in distributions of cosmic ray intensity between the days with cloudless and overcast sky level at α = 0.05 is found in the data. In addition to the experiments and clarification of physical mechanisms behind the relations studied here, longer time intervals and analysis at different sites with respect to cut-off rigidity and sea/continents along with the satellite data are important for progress in understanding the cosmic ray–cloud relation questions, at least from the point of view of empirical description of the dependencies.”
In January 2015 Badruddin & Aslam added to this with a publication in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics. They studied the effect of cosmic rays on Indian summer monsoons. They got results: Phases of drought occurred mostly when cosmic rays weakened, and wet phases occurred with increased ray intensity. Moreover they found a relationship with temperature. The abstract:
Influence of cosmic-ray variability on the monsoon rainfall and temperature
We study the role of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) variability in influencing the rainfall variability in Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) season. We find that on an average during ‘drought’ (low ISMR) periods in India, GCR flux is decreasing, and during ‘flood’ (high ISMR) periods, GCR flux is increasing. The results of our analysis suggest for a possibility that the decreasing GCR flux during the summer monsoon season in India may suppress the rainfall. On the other hand, increasing GCR flux may enhance the rainfall. We suspect that in addition to real environmental conditions, significant levitation/dispersion of low clouds and hence reduced possibility of collision/coalescence to form raindrops suppresses the rainfall during decreasing GCR flux in monsoon season. On the other hand, enhanced collision/coalescence efficiency during increasing GCR flux due to electrical effects may contribute to enhancing the rainfall. Based on the observations, we put forward the idea that, under suitable environmental conditions, changing GCR flux may influence precipitation by suppressing/enhancing it, depending upon the decreasing/increasing nature of GCR flux variability during monsoon season in India, at least. We further note that the rainfall variability is inversely related to the temperature variation during ISMR season. We suggest an explanation, although speculative, how a decreasing/increasing GCR flux can influence the rainfall and the temperature. We speculate that the proposed hypothesis, based on the Indian climate data can be extended to whole tropical and sub-tropical belt, and that it may contribute to global temperature in a significant way. If correct, our hypothesis has important implication for the sun – climate link.”
Next there’s also a paper by L.Z. Biktash appearing in the journal Advances in Space Research in December 2014. This study also looks at cosmic rays with their impact on global temperature. For the period of 1965–2012 the temperature maximum occurred during the cosmic rays minimum. The abstract:
Evolution of Dst index, cosmic rays and global temperature during solar cycles 20–23
We have studied conditions in interplanetary space, which can have an influence on galactic cosmic ray (CR) and climate change. In this connection the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters and cosmic ray variations have been compared with geomagnetic activity represented by the equatorial Dst index from the beginning 1965 to the end of 2012. Dst index is commonly used as the solar wind–magnetosphere–ionosphere interaction characteristic. The important drivers in interplanetary medium which have effect on cosmic rays as CMEs (coronal mass ejections) and CIRs (corotating interaction regions) undergo very strong changes during their propagation to the Earth. Because of this CMEs, coronal holes and the solar spot numbers (SSN) do not adequately reflect peculiarities concerned with the solar wind arrival to 1 AU. Therefore, the geomagnetic indices have some inestimable advantage as continuous series other the irregular solar wind measurements. We have compared the yearly average variations of Dst index and the solar wind parameters with cosmic ray data from Moscow, Climax, and Haleakala neutron monitors during the solar cycles 20–23. The descending phases of these solar cycles (CSs) had the long-lasting solar wind high speed streams occurred frequently and were the primary contributors to the recurrent Dst variations. They also had effects on cosmic rays variations. We show that long-term Dst variations in these solar cycles were correlated with the cosmic ray count rate and can be used for study of CR variations. Global temperature variations in connection with evolution of Dst index and CR variations is discussed.”
In the text the paper states:
We demonstrate that the detrended annual means of global surface air temperature in 1965–2012 show the maxima during CRs [Cosmic Rays] and Dst index [of the solar wind] minima. It proves that CRs [Cosmic Rays] play essential role in climate change and main part of climate variations can be explained by Pudovkin and Raspopov’s (1992) mechanism of action CRs [Cosmic Rays] modulated by the solar activity on the state of lower atmosphere and meteorological parameters. Following this we have to seek for another ways of looking for global warming reason, first of all, as a man impact on climate.”

A group of scientists led by Nicolas Huneeus made waves in May 2014 when their study appeared in the Journal of Geophysical Research, which contained a veiled confirmation of the sun-cloud relation. Within the scope of modeling they found an important influence on clouds by solar activity fluctuations. You can read it in the abstract yourself:
Forcings and feedbacks in the GeoMIP ensemble for a reduction in solar irradiance and increase in CO2
The effective radiative forcings (including rapid adjustments) and feedbacks associated with an instantaneous quadrupling of the preindustrial CO2 concentration and a counterbalancing reduction of the solar constant are investigated in the context of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP). The forcing and feedback parameters of the net energy flux, as well as its different components at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface, were examined in 10 Earth System Models to better understand the impact of solar radiation management on the energy budget. In spite of their very different nature, the feedback parameter and its components at the TOA and surface are almost identical for the two forcing mechanisms, not only in the global mean but also in their geographical distributions. This conclusion holds for each of the individual models despite intermodel differences in how feedbacks affect the energy budget. This indicates that the climate sensitivity parameter is independent of the forcing (when measured as an effective radiative forcing). We also show the existence of a large contribution of the cloudy-sky component to the shortwave effective radiative forcing at the TOA suggesting rapid cloud adjustments to a change in solar irradiance. In addition, the models present significant diversity in the spatial distribution of the shortwave feedback parameter in cloudy regions, indicating persistent uncertainties in cloud feedback mechanisms.”
Highly interesting is a study by a team of researchers led by Mai Mai Lam, who published their results in September 2014 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The scientists examined the atmosphere over Antarctica and found clear indications that the solar-modulated cosmic rays were able to influence the clouds of the lower troposphere via the atmospheric electric field. Lam et al see the cloud solar amplifier operating parallel with the UV solar amplifier in the stratosphere. The abstract:
Solar wind-driven geopotential height anomalies originate in the Antarctic lower troposphere
We use National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data to estimate the altitude and time lag dependence of the correlation between the interplanetary magnetic field component, By, and the geopotential height anomaly above Antarctica. The correlation is most statistically significant within the troposphere. The peak in the correlation occurs at greater time lags at the tropopause (∼6–8 days) and in the midtroposphere (∼4 days) than in the lower troposphere (∼1 day). This supports a mechanism involving the action of the global atmospheric electric circuit, modified by variations in the solar wind, on lower tropospheric clouds. The increase in time lag with increasing altitude is consistent with the upward propagation by conventional atmospheric processes of the solar wind-induced variability in the lower troposphere. This is in contrast to the downward propagation of atmospheric effects to the lower troposphere from the stratosphere due to solar variability-driven mechanisms involving ultraviolet radiation or energetic particle precipitation.”
The American Geophysical Union (AGU) found the paper so remarkable that it introduced it in its membership magazine Eos:
How the Solar Wind May Affect Weather and Climate
The Sun’s influence on the Earth’s climate is complicated, but researchers are slowly figuring out how the solar wind can indirectly affect clouds over the poles.
The Sun plays a large role in providing the Earth with light and heat, but its more subtle effects on the Earth’s weather, climate and atmospheric processes are still a mystery. Scientists are especially puzzled by how the solar wind—streams of plasma ejected from the Sun—affects the Earth’s climate system.”
Read more in Eos.
There was a paper appearing in the PNAS in March 2015. Here a group led by Anastasios Tsonis published a study on the relationship between cosmic rays and global temperature. Although the scientists were not able to show a match between the 20th century warming with cosmic rays on a scale covering years, they were able to show an important relationship between cosmic rays and temperature. The abstract:
Dynamical evidence for causality between galactic cosmic rays and interannual variation in global temperature
As early as 1959, it was hypothesized that an indirect link between solar activity and climate could be mediated by mechanisms controlling the flux of galactic cosmic rays (CR) [Ney ER (1959) Nature 183:451–452]. Although the connection between CR and climate remains controversial, a significant body of laboratory evidence has emerged at the European Organization for Nuclear Research [Duplissy J, et al. (2010) Atmos Chem Phys 10:1635–1647; Kirkby J, et al. (2011) Nature 476(7361):429–433] and elsewhere [Svensmark H, Pedersen JOP, Marsh ND, Enghoff MB, Uggerhøj UI (2007) Proc R Soc A 463:385–396; Enghoff MB, Pedersen JOP, Uggerhoj UI, Paling SM, Svensmark H (2011) Geophys Res Lett 38:L09805], demonstrating the theoretical mechanism of this link. In this article, we present an analysis based on convergent cross mapping, which uses observational time series data to directly examine the causal link between CR and year-to-year changes in global temperature. Despite a gross correlation, we find no measurable evidence of a causal effect linking CR to the overall 20th-century warming trend. However, on short interannual timescales, we find a significant, although modest, causal effect between CR and short-term, year-to-year variability in global temperature that is consistent with the presence of nonlinearities internal to the system. Thus, although CR do not contribute measurably to the 20th-century global warming trend, they do appear as a nontraditional forcing in the climate system on short interannual timescales.
N.A. Kilifarska described a complete model on the climate effect of cosmic rays in August 2015 in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics. The process runs on a scale of two decades and covers the sun’s magnetic field, which modulates the cosmic rays, which in turn change the ozone and water vapor in the stratosphere. The abstract:
Bi-decadal solar influence on climate, mediated by near tropopause ozone
The Sun’s contribution to climate variations was highly questioned recently. In this paper we show that bi-decadal variability of solar magnetic field, modulating the intensity of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) at the outer boundary of heliosphere, could be easily tracked down to the Earth’s surface. The mediator of this influence is the lower stratospheric ozone, while the mechanism of signal translation consists of: (i) GCR impact on the lower stratospheric ozone balance; (ii) modulation of temperature and humidity near the tropopause by the ozone variations; (iii) increase or decrease of the greenhouse effect, depending on the sign of the humidity changes. The efficiency of such a mechanism depends critically on the level of maximum secondary ionisation created by GCR (i.e. the Pfotzer maximum) − determined in turn by heterogeneous Earth’s magnetic field. Thus, the positioning of the Pfotzer max in the driest lowermost stratosphere favours autocatalytic ozone production in the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere (NH), while in the SH − no suitable conditions for activation of this mechanism exist. Consequently, the geomagnetic modulation of precipitating energetic particles – heterogeneously distributed over the globe – is imprinted on the relation between ozone and humidity in the lower stratosphere (LS). The applied test for causality reveals that during the examined period 1957–2012 there are two main centers of action in the winter NH, with tight and almost stationary ozone control on the near tropopause humidity. Being indirectly influenced by the solar protons, the variability of the SH lower stratospheric ozone, however, is much weaker. As a consequence, the causality test detects that the ozone dominates in the interplay with ULTS humidity only in the summer extra-tropics.”
A team led by Il-Hyun Cho made an exciting discovery, which they described in August 2012 in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Sciences. They analyzed five solar cycles over 50 years and found that the global temperature when the northern hemisphere of the sun was more active than the sun’s southern hemisphere. The authors suggest a mechanism involving cosmic rays. The abstract:
The global temperature anomaly and solar North-South asymmetry
We investigate whether the global temperature anomaly is associated with the solar North-South asymmetry using data archived approximately for five solar cycles. We are motivated by both the accumulating evidence for the connection of Galactic cosmic-rays (GCRs) to the cloud coverage and recent finding of the association of GCR influx and the solar North-South asymmetry. We have analyzed the data of the observed sunspot, the GCR influx observed at the Moscow station, and the global temperature anomaly. We have found that the mean global temperature anomaly is systematically smaller (∼0.56 in the unit of its standard deviation) during the period when the solar northern hemisphere is more active than the solar southern hemisphere. The difference in the mean value of the global temperature anomaly for the two data sets sub-sampled according to the solar North-South asymmetry is large and statistically significant. We suggest the solar North-South asymmetry is related to the global temperature anomaly through modulating the amount of GCR influx. Finally, we conclude by discussing its implications on a climate model and a direction of future work.

Yes, you read that right. There has been NO warming in 85 years.
There are many surface land stations with records going back more than 100 years. Some records exist back to 1880 and earlier. GISS cuts the records off at 1880. There are many gaps in these records before 1930, and all the 20th Century warming occurred before then.
How do I know this? I scanned the GISTemp web site for locations with long records, that were as continuous as possible, with a variety of satellite brightness indexes. Because the U. S. Weather Bureau was especially diligent in setting up measurement stations, 60% in this study are U. S. Over the rest of the world it was very difficult to find stations with both long, continuous records, and a zero satellite brightness index. I stopped searching after finding a total of 50 stations.
The satellite brightness index is used by GISS as a proxy for population and thus a proxy for urban warming. It is then used to calculate the amount of “homogenization” to apply to cities and towns. Locations with a brightness index (BI) of 10 or less is considered “rural” and no homogenization correction is applied to those with zero brightness. However, Time of Observation (TOBs) and move corrections are still applied to these stations. GISTemp has downloadable temperature data for: Unadjusted temperature, Adjusted temperature (TOBs and move adjustments), Adjusted and Cleaned data (Cleaning removes data considered unreliable in some way) and Homogenized data. For the 50 stations, Unadjusted, Adjusted and Cleaned, and Homogenized monthly data were downloaded. Of these, 20 stations are considered rural, with a BI of 10 or less. 15 are towns with BI between 11 and 32, and another 15 are cities with a brightness index of more than 32. I attempted to select pairs or triplets of locations that had a large city with close by rural stations. This was easy in the U. S., with the high density of stations, but more difficult in the rest of the world where stations might be separated by hundreds of kilometers.
For all the 150 resulting temperature records, the linear trends for each from 1930 to the present was calculated using Excel. This gives the annual trend numbers in degrees C. Here are summaries of that data presented as bar charts for each group of locations, rural, medium sized towns, and large cities; the bars are for summer and winter data. Summer is June, July, and August in the northern hemisphere, and December, January, and February in the southern. Winter is the reverse of that.

Figure 1 is the rural data. Unadjusted data indicates summer cooling at these stations since 1930. Even the adjusted and homogenized data indicate less than 0.125°C summer warming in 85 years. This is statistically NO warming in the summer. Winter warming is about 1° over 85 years. This may all be due to increasing population and home heating around these stations.

Figure 2 is for towns with BI from 11 to 32. For example, towns like North Platte, Nebraska, Godthaab-Nuuk, Greenland, and Bismarck, North Dakota. The Unadjusted summer trend is almost zero, with the adjusted and homogenized summer trends less than 0.4°/85 years. The winter trends are much higher at 1.36° in 85 years. All of the summer trend increase is due to adjustments; as is nearly half the winter increase.

Figure 3 shows the big cities, like Tokyo and New York. It is expected that these locations would have high urban heat island affecting temperatures in summer and winter. Again, adjustments have increased both summer and winter temperature trends, though not as dramatically as for the smaller towns. Homogenization is supposed to correct for this, but has failed to do so for summer trends, and has only made the winter trend slightly less than the rural winter.
This has led to the strange result that medium size towns are supposedly warming faster than large cities by almost 50%.
All of the trend increase in the last 85 years is due to mankind’s desire to keep warm in winter. This inside warmth leaks out into the surrounding environment and is measured by the local weather stations. This, combined with tinkering with the data, has produced all the warming in the last 85 years. There is clearly no warming, and perhaps some modest cooling, in the summer, and all the winter warming is due to direct heating by mankind keeping warm. Shorter term trends, like the 70’s cooling, are due to natural cycles. There is no “hockey-stick”! No “Solution” is necessary.
Here is the list of the stations used. There are nine stations with negative annual temperature trends. They are highlighted in blue. Three of those are large cities. Five more have trends between zero and 0.0025°C/year. Most of those are rural.

There is more analysis to be done on this data for future articles.

"The federal agency that manages the Great Barrier Reef has made an unprecedented call for urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, warning only the “strongest and fastest possible action” will reduce the risks to the natural wonder. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has published a climate position statement that says the reef is already damaged from warming oceans and it is “critical” global temperature rises remain within 1.5 degrees.  The Coalition government has been criticised for overseeing four straight years of increases in national emissions and experts say it will not meet the country’s Paris target under current climate policy. “Only the strongest and fastest possible action on climate change will reduce the risks and limit the impacts of climate change on the reef,” the authority said. “Further loss of coral is inevitable and can be minimised by limiting global temperature increase to the maximum extent possible.” The climate statement was in development for more than a year and published late on Wednesday. It says climate change is the single greatest threat to the reef and points to the “widespread impacts” already felt from back to back marine heatwaves in 2016 and 2017 that caused the mass wipe-out of corals. “Of particular concern are projections that the reef could be affected by bleaching events twice per decade by about 2035 and annually by about 2044 if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase at the current rate,” the authority said. “If bleaching becomes more frequent and more intense, there will not be enough time for reefs to recover and persist as coral-dominated systems in their current form.” The marine park authority’s statement says the reduction in emissions required for the reef to survive requires both national and international effort and an “urgent and critical” acceleration of policies to cut carbon pollution. Any further increase in global temperatures will have “further negative impacts” for reef-dependent activities such as tourism, fishing and traditional use. “These effects are likely to include loss of properties and infrastructure, loss of cultural and regional identity and, unless urgent action is taken, subsequent declines in regional economies,” the authority said. Environment groups said on Thursday that such a clear statement from the government’s own agency should prompt the Morrison government to act faster to address the climate crisis. Australia’s emissions have been rising since the repeal of the carbon price. “The Great Barrier Reef is not dead yet, but the marine park authority makes it clear that it is already under stress from rising temperatures,” Christian Slattery, a campaigner for the Australian Conservation Foundation, said. “As the marine park authority states, any additional increase in temperatures will have further devastating impacts on the reef and flow-on effects for tourism, fishing, recreation and traditional use. “ACF urges the federal government to listen to the experts and treat this call to action with the seriousness and urgency it deserves.” Imogen Zethoven, the strategic director at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the government’s $443m grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation would be “wasted unless the Morrison government takes radical action to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions to save our greatest natural icon and the jobs it supports”. “The prime minister, a former managing director of Tourism Australia, knows how critical the reef is to the tourism industry and to Australia’s international reputation,” she said. “As the caretaker for the reef and a daily witness to its decline, GBRMPA is crying out for immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” After the May election, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, named Warren Entsch the special envoy for the Great Barrier Reef. In an interview, Entsch said he wanted to focus on plastic waste and warned climate activists in northern Queensland had had a negative impact on the region’s economy. Environment minister Sussan Ley said she accepted accept the scientific advice, “both that climate change is the biggest threat to the reef and that there are actions we can continue to take to build a more resilient reef.” “The government is taking meaningful action to reduce global emissions and we investing $1.2bn in addressing threats such as water quality, marine litter and the crown of thorns star fish.” In 2017, Australia avoided an “in danger” listing for the reef from Unesco’s world heritage committee. But its status will be reassessed by Unesco next year and Australia must submit a state of conservation report to Unesco in December. An outlook report for the reef from GBRMPA is also due soon."

====================================
The oceans (SST) have cooled surprisingly over January to February 2016.
While during other El Niño events like in 2015/16 led to a time-delayed warming of the Earth’s atmosphere – as was the case this year, the global oceans have decoupled themselves from this time-delayed warming and are showing a surprising significant cooling from January to February 2016 when compared to the powerful 1997/98 El Nino event:

The plot from BOB TISDALE shows the course of the SSTA during the powerful 1997/98 El Niño and from 2015/16. The monthly mean SSTA from multiple data suppliers show a surprising drop in global SST in February 2016. Source: Global Sea Surface Temperature Responses to the 1997/98 and 2015/16 El Niño Events.
The North Pacific, which since 2014 had been parked off the west coast and known as the warm BLOB, saw the greatest share of the global sea surface cooling. By December 2015 it practically disappeared:

Global temperatures fell in March 2016
In March 2016 the global temperatures have shown a clear retreat after their three to four-month highpoint February 2016 – time delayed after the El Niño peak at the end of October/start of November 2015. This has also been the case in the tropics as well:

The plot shows the measured/calculated temperature deviation global (black curve) and in the tropics (red curve). After a peak in February 2016, global temperatures have fallen sharply as of 28 March 2016. Source: weatherbell.com/temperature.php. 
Therefore it is fully possible that the global temperatures have already begun to gradually ease back from the previous month’s record high in February 2016, although this was not expected to happen until April: Record warmth in the troposphere in February 2016 – Tropical sea surface starts to cool off.
“…With increasing cooling of the tropical sea surface, this means also a gradual cooling of global temperatures will set in by April 2016, which I described here:  ENSO update February 2016: El Niño leaving– La Niña arriving…”
Also see the unfalsified facts n: “Global Warming” Reality Check February 2016: The global warming ”pause” since 1997 continues– RSS 0.94.”
The water masses of the equatorial Pacific over the past months have released a considerable amount of energy into the atmosphere. From the end of October 2015 until the end of March 2016, the upper 300 meters have cooled strongly: by 2.6°K.

The plot above shows the course of the temperature anomalies down to 300 meters at the equatorial Pacific. The powerful positive deviations (orange) of the Downwelling-Phase reached their peak at 2.1°K deviation at the end of October/early November 2015 and have fallen 2.6°K to -0.5° K (blue): El Niño leaves– La Niña arrives! Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/enso.shtml
We will have to wait and see to find out whether the global temperature anomalies will go negative already by the end of 2016, similar to what happened with the El Niño event 1997/98 – though the negative global temperature anomaly did not arrive until March 1999 – which we saw in the UAH satellite data: http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data.txt.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe already know that solar energy refuses to show up for work at night and also for the most part when it’s cloudy or wintertime. Green energy proponents like to tell us that when the sun is AWOL, we can always switch to wind. The wind, after all, is always blowing somewhere, they like to tell us. Unfortunately that is so far from the truth.
The following chart shows Germany’s wind energy output (shaded blue) over the past 7 days compared to the power consumed (curve). As one can see, the country’s 40 GW of installed capacity has gone into the habit of taking afternoon siestas, right when power demand is at a high, delivering a sorrowful a pittance.

Germany’s 40 GW of installed wind power capacity took afternoon siestas 4 times over the past 7 days (marked yellow). So far this month German wind power has failed to deliver even 10% of its rated capacity. Chart source: Agora.
Yesterday early afternoon the 40 GW of installed capacity managed to deliver a puny 0.168 GW, or only 0.4% of its installed rated capacity. That’s like 4 people showing up for work in a company of 1000 employees.
According to Wikipedia here, Germany’s wind turbines have barely put out over just 17% of their installed rated capacity over the period of 2001 – 2013. But that’s the least of wind’s problem. The big headache is the energy’s unpredictability and its wildly fluctuating supply. Often the wind blows when you don’t need the power, or it just doesn’t show up when you could really use it, like midday. Good thing that there are still the reliable coal, nuclear and fossil plants on line.
But the energy can be stored! Wrong. The technology for the scale of storage that is needed to keep a grid running smoothly does not exist. and there are no signs that it will anytime soon. Yet the mad rush to install the siesta-prone energy continues unabated.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn Mike Brakey’s recent post on the NOAA’s 151 degrees of fudging of the temperature datasets for the state of Maine, one reader was “so incensed” that he e-mailed the NOAA and his congressman.
Well, he got a reply from Derek Arndt at NOAA, which he sent to Mike Brakey, who in turn sent me Arndt’s reply – which I post as follows:
Hi Mr. XXXXXXXXX
In early 2014, we changed to a new version of the dataset upon which our US temperatures are drawn. The new dataset took advantage of a lot of older data that hadn’t been digitized (from paper) when the old dataset was constructed. It also took advantage of advancements in quality assurance that detect station moves, changes in observing practices, etc.
We began sharing with the community these upcoming changes as early as 2011: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/GrDD-Transition.pdf  In early 2014 we published a more complete methodological paper:
Vose, R.S., Applequist, S., Durre, I., Menne, M.J., Williams, C.N., Fenimore, C., Gleason, K., Arndt, D. 2014: Improved Historical Temperature and Precipitation Time Series For U.S. Climate Divisions Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-13-0248.1
Maine was one of the states that saw the biggest differences in temperature. This is probably why blogs focus in on it. In addition to the general reasons for changes that other states witnessed:

The new method used stations in neighboring Canada to inform estimates for data-sparse areas within Maine (a great improvement)
In the old dataset, the year 1913 was particularly problematic, resulting from a keying (transcription) error from many years ago that is now corrected. 1913 is often held up as evidence of “tampering” when in fact it is probably one of the biggest improvements in the dataset, and brings our value much more in line with what was observed at the time.

Thanks for contacting us. It is a privilege to serve you.

"Do you remember when the weather was a reliable source of innocuous small talk? “Hot today, isn’t it?” you would observe to a colleague as you stood awkwardly in the lift together. They would reply with something about the garden needing rain, then you would go back to ignoring each other. Talking about the weather was uncontroversial. It was safe. It was oddly soothing. Sadly, there is nothing soothing about the weather any more; every day seems to bring new record-breaking temperatures or extreme conditions. June was the hottest month recorded on Earth; July is on course to break that record. The Arctic is having a sweltering summer that has sparked unprecedented wildfires. According to the World Meteorological Organization, these fires emitted as much carbon dioxide in one month as the whole of Sweden does in a year. As large sections of the Arctic burn, major cities sizzle. New York, where I live, has just emerged from a heatwave that the mayor declared a “local emergency”. The city’s infrastructure, which is held together by chewing gum and rat droppings at the best of times, buckled under the strain of millions of heaving air conditioners, leaving more than 46,000 New Yorkers without power on Sunday. Now it is Europe’s turn to swelter; the Met Office says temperatures could reach 37C (99F) in London on Thursday. What makes this extreme weather even more uncomfortable is the grim realisation that we have done this to ourselves. The climate crisis has made heatwaves the new normal. You can’t turn to a colleague and remark: “Hot, isn’t it?” without thinking about the fact that, unless something drastic is done, it is going to get hotter and hotter. According to scientists at the Crowther Lab in Switzerland, nearly 80% of cities will undergo dramatic climate changes by 2050; London, for example, will feel like Barcelona does today. Residents of cities such as Jakarta and Singapore, meanwhile, will experience “unprecedented climate conditions” characterised by extreme rainfall and severe droughts. As the implications of the climate crisis become impossible to ignore, many of us are growing increasingly terrified. The climate emergency isn’t just damaging the planet; it is also harming our mental health – a phenomenon called “eco-anxiety”. As Alexandria Harris wrote in her 2015 book Weatherland, “small alterations in familiar places can disturb us more than dystopian visions”. I spent every summer of my childhood shivering on damp Cornish beaches and can’t quite wrap my head around England’s heatwaves. I feel a sense of bereavement for an England that seems to be disappearing; on a climate level, the place I grew up in is starting to feel like a different country. Indeed, Harris said in her book that “the years to come … may be the last years of English weather”. Now is the time, she says, to build a “great storehouse” of weather memories. We are going to need a lot more than a storehouse of memories to weather what is coming, of course. We need to significantly change our behaviour and, even more importantly, overhaul our economic system. After all, only 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions. You know all this already; we all do. But our politicians still are not taking meaningful action. Capitalism is carrying on with business as usual. The world is literally on fire – and it feels as though we are fiddling with paper straws while it burns. •Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"
"At sunrise, the misty fields around the village of Guior are already dotted with men, women and children sowing maize after an overnight rainstorm. After several years of drought, the downpour brought some hope of relief to the subsistence farmers in this part of eastern Guatemala. But as Esteban Gutiérrez, 30, takes a break from his work, he explains why he is still willing to incur crippling debts – and risk his life – to migrate to the United States. “My children have gone to bed hungry for the past three years. Our crops failed and the coffee farms have cut wages to $4 a day,” he says, playing nervously with the white maize kernels in a plastic trough strapped to his waist. “We hope the harvest will be good, but until then we have only one quintal [46kg] of maize left – which is barely enough for a month. I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more.” Central America remains one of the world’s most dangerous regions outside a warzone, where a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption has forced millions to flee their homes and head north in search of security. But amid a deepening global climate crisis, drought, famine and the battle for dwindling natural resources are increasingly being recognized as major factors in the exodus. Camotán is a collection of rural communities in the eastern department of Chiquimula, which lies in the rain shadow of the imposing Sierra de las Minas. It forms part of Central America’s dry corridor: a belt stretching south through Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, that receives little rain and is particularly susceptible to droughts and extreme weather. In theory, the rainy season here should last from late April to October, with a drier period in July and August known as the canícula – a regional peculiarity that requires two short harvests. But the past decade has seen frequent, intense droughts and late rains due to unusually hot and dry canículas and prolonged years of El Niño – the warm phase of a complex weather cycle caused by increased Pacific surface temperatures. “Over the past six years, the lack of rainfall has been our biggest problem, causing crops to fail and widespread famine,” said the climate scientist Edwin Castellanos, the dean of the research institute at Guatemala’s Universidad del Valle. The current run of hot, dry years follows a decade or so of unusually prolonged rains and flooding due to the other phase of the cycle known as La Niña, caused by colder Pacific waters. “Normal, predictable weather years are getting rarer,” added Castellanos. On the ground, the impact has been devastating. In 2018, drought-related crop failures directly affected one in 10 Guatemalans, and caused extreme food shortages for almost 840,000 people, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). As a result, entire families have been migrating in record numbers: since October 2018, more than 167,000 Guatemalans travelling in family groups have been apprehended at the US border, compared with 23,000 in 2016. Those who remain, often depend on money sent home by emigres, especially in rural areas, which received more than half the $9.2bn of remittances sent to Guatemala in 2018. Despite the rainshowers in Camotán, el niño is back and the outlook for 2019 is grim: about 2 million people in the dry corridor will need urgent food aid, according Ricardo Rapallo, the head of food security at the FAO. “Without doubt climate and environmental changes impact food security. For those who depend on agriculture the situation is very precarious, they are very vulnerable,” said Rapallo. Local political factors are also important. Water shortages and poverty are causally linked to the country’s skewed land distribution: roughly 2% of the population control 70% of all productive farmland. In Chiquimula, 71% of people live in poverty, and 40% in extreme poverty. Forests mitigate climate change, but Guatemala has lost half its woodlands in the past 40 years – and deforestation rates are rising, in turn causing floods, landslides and erosion of farmland. In the peasant farming communities around Camotán, water storage is scarce, and the Maya Ch’orti’ people who live here mostly rely on rainfall to irrigate their crops. Most houses have no toilets, and low water reserves mean most families drink and cook with contaminated stream water. “We waste and contaminate most of our water through mismanagement. We’re not prepared for climate changes,” said the climate scientist Castellanos. The region’s main cash crop is coffee, and for decades, many campesinos relied on seasonal work at commercial plantations to supplement their subsistence lifestyle. But a global price crash and the deadly rust fungus known locally as la rolla – which thrives in hot and humid conditions exacerbated by the climate crisis – have wiped out about 80% of the region’s coffee in the past five years. This has led to less work, lower pay and more hunger. Gutiérrez lives in a half-finished palm-roofed adobe house with his wife Miriam Ávalos, 22, and their five children aged between seven months and nine years. All of the children are small for their age. For breakfast, they have half a corn tortilla each. At school, they sometimes receive noodles and a high-calorie supplement drink, courtesy of a government programme. Dinner is another tortilla or two with salt or herbs – but no beans as the drought destroyed last year’s entire crop. The family’s chickens died a few months back from a mystery illness, so there are no eggs, and meat and dairy are unaffordable. The adults eat once or twice a day. Guatemala has the sixth-highest malnutrition rate in the world with at least 47% of children suffering chronic malnourishment. Malnutrition rates are even higher among the country’s 24 indigenous communities, rising to over 60% in Camotán. Since 2016, at least 800 children under the age of five in Camotán and the neighbouring municipality Jocotán have been diagnosed with acute malnourishment, according to health centre officials. (Underreporting means the real number is likely to be significantly higher.) “The government strategy [to tackle malnutrition] has good elements, but in practice it has been limited to putting out fires, dealing with emergencies, not tackling structural problems or corruption in public administration,” said Paola Cano, a nutritionist and public policy analyst. “Without international aid, even more people would be dying.” Ávalos was 13 when she had her first child. She weighs 90lb and is breastfeeding her seven-month old daughter who weighs just nine pounds. The two-year-old girl weighs 18lbs; her cheeks and stomach are distended, and her hair is falling out – classic symptoms of acute malnutrition. The five-year-old girl is just recovering from sudden weight loss. Sometimes they wake up at night, crying from hunger. “We’re desperate,” said Ávalos, who looks and sounds exhausted. “There’s no money and no food.” Ávalos’s niece died in 2016 at the age of three months. Her mother was unable to produce enough breast milk, and the family couldn’t afford formula. “This isn’t poverty – or even extreme poverty: this is a famine, and people are dying,” said Rodimiro Lantán from Comundich, a grassroots Ch’orti’ organisation helping communities reforest ancestral lands in an effort to prevent forced migration. Families face an impossible choice: stay and risk starvation, or gamble everything on the perilous migrant trail. “They risk their lives if they stay – and if they go,” said Lantán. One local who took that chance was Juan de Léon Gutiérrez, a 16-year old boy from a nearby village. In April, he died at a Texas children’s hospital just days after he was taken into US immigration custody – one of at least eight Guatemalan children to have died shortly after crossing the US border since May 2018. Juan de Léon was not related to Esteban, but such deaths are deeply felt in these rural communities where would be migrants are well aware of the dangers they will face. Esteban is in tears as he leaves the family home to meet a local people smuggler, or coyote, who may be able to guide him north. He has no savings, but, his godfather has offered the coyote the title to 3.5 acres of land as a guarantee. If Esteban makes it to the US, he’ll pay the $5,000 fee; if he doesn’t, the coyote will keep the land. “Banks don’t help people like us,” he says, through tears. He has been told that families have a better chance at the border, so he is considering taking his scrawny nine-year-old son, Wilson, with him. He knows that taking a chronically malnourished child on a 2,000-mile journey will be tough – but he cannot afford to wait: the food is running out. In these parts, the period between harvests, June to August, has always been hard. But the current crisis is different, said Gutiérrez’s mother Isigra Martínez, 58, as she heated leftover tortillas for lunch. “We grew up hungry, but the past four years have been very hard,” she said. “I don’t want my son to go to America, and it will be terribly hard on Wilson.” “I’ve heard people have died on the journey. But maybe there’s no other way.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo small stories today.
The first is the “heat wave” that has gripped Europe over the past few days. Europe saw weather patterns that were optimum for producing record heat in Germany and other countries. In Germany although a number of cities set new all-time highs, the country’s record high of 40.2°C set during the heat wave of 2003 did not fall.
UPDATE: Spiegel reports that Germany did see a new all-time high yesterday: http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/kitzingen-hitzerekord-in-deutschland-mit-40-3-grad-a-1042198.html
T-online.de here reports that yesterday’s German high was 39.4°C, recorded in Saxony Anhalt, and much to the disappointment of the media and alarmist scientists, who lately have been in the habit of seizing upon any data anecdote as a sign of global warming.
Though many records were set, the heat wave was as short as it was intense, lasting only a few days. For example at a station close to where I live, the temperature rose above 30°C only on three days. The so-called “tropical night” where temperatures don’t fall below 20°C occurred only once here.

Global warming alarmists in Germany have warned that in the future cities such as Hamburg would have to expect more stifling, long-lasting heat waves in the future, with tropical nights become increasingly common. But looking at Hamburg’s temperatures over the past days also shows that the “heat wave” involved only 2 days above 30°C, and not a single tropical night. hardly a heat wave.
Today a cold front with showers and thunderstorms has been sweeping across northwestern Germany, bringing an end to the heat after a mere 4 days. The cold front is expected to continue its sweep across the rest of Germany over the next day, and so end the heat wave there too.
Some locations of course will see the heat linger a little longer, seeing 5 or 6 days above 30°C, but is only a local phenomenon. Overall this heat wave was just a mere midget compared to the 2003 heat wave. And it was certainly nothing compared to what Europe saw back in 1540.
Lying okay if it is for the good
The other short story today comes from the Die kalte Sonne site here, which writes about a former Swiss Minister,  Moritz Leuenberger. The Swiss Tagblatt writes:
“‘The climate conference in Copenhagen just before agreeing to reduce CO2 emissions was disastrous,’ Leuenberger now admits. Yet back then he intentionally did not tell the media this, and thus lied so that the Swiss would vote in favor of it. Leuenberger: ‘Now I believe the lie is legitimate if it is for the good.'”

=========================================
Game over: Dutch scientists refute Rahmstorf’s Gulf Stream alarm story


By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In March 2015 Stefan Rahmstorf (“stefan”) spread a hyped up alarm story at the IPCC-friendly climate blog Real Climate.
A cold anomaly in the Atlantic, off the east coast of Greenland, was alleged to be the proof that the Gulf Stream was gradually weakening – a consequence of man-made climate warming!
“stefan” wrote at Realclimate:
What’s going on in the North Atlantic?
The North Atlantic between Newfoundland and Ireland is practically the only region of the world that has defied global warming and even cooled. Last winter there even was the coldest on record – while globally it was the hottest on record. Our recent study (Rahmstorf et al. 2015) attributes this to a weakening of the Gulf Stream System, which is apparently unique in the last thousand years. […] It happens to be just that area for which climate models predict a cooling when the Gulf Stream System weakens (experts speak of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation or AMOC, as part of the global thermohaline circulation). That this might happen as a result of global warming is discussed in the scientific community since the 1980s – since Wally Broecker’s classical Nature article “Unpleasant surprises in the greenhouse?” Meanwhile evidence is mounting that the long-feared circulation decline is already well underway.
Rahmstorf showed the following chart (“Linear temperature trend from 1900 to 2013″):

In his post the Postdam PIK scientist painted a climate horror scenario, suggesting that it was something far worse than anything ever previously anticipated.
Subsequently international colleagues took it upon themselves to validate the Rahmstorfian horror scenario. One year later we now have the results of the examination.
On June 29, 2016, Femke de Jong and Laura de Steur of the Dutch NIOZ Institute at the OSNAP project site announced the results in a press release: Rahmstorf and his model were totally off. The especially observed North Atlantic cold anomaly in the winter 2014/15 had nothing to do with a weakening Gulf Stream, rather it was much more the consequence of a powerful vertical mixing with cold low level water.
The press release states:
A new record in mixing of surface and deep ocean water in the Irminger Sea has important consequences for the Atlantic overturning circulation

Scientists Femke de Jong and Laura de Steur of the NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research have shown that the recent temperature changes in the Irminger Sea between Iceland and Greenland can be explained through regional ocean-atmosphere interaction during the cold winter of 2014-2015. This rejects a hypothesis that posed that increased meltwater from Greenland weakened deep water formation and caused the cold blob. The article by de Jong and de Steur is accepted by Geophysical Research letters and has appeared online.
Deep water formation is an important process in the global ocean circulation. When high latitude winters are cold enough, the salty surface water of the North Atlantic cools enough to increase its density and mix with underlying deeper waters. This mixing is called deep convection. It forms the vertical link between the warm northward flow near the surface and the cold southward flow along the bottom, which is generally referred to as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The transport of warm water in the overturning circulation is partly responsible for the mild climate in northwestern Europe compared to similar latitudes in North America.
In climate model simulations the strength of convection south of Greenland is related to the strength of the overturning circulation. Some models predict that convection will weaken due to the input of freshwater released from the melting ice on Greenland. Because of the much lower density of freshwater compared to seawater it forms a barrier that isolates the deep ocean from the cold atmosphere. While the majority of the Earth warms as a result of climate change the region around southern Greenland would cool.
In temperature observations of the earth’s surface in 2015 a similar pattern seems to appear. The Earth warmed while the ocean southeast of Greenland cooled. This led to speculation that convection had already weakened as a result of increased melting of Greenland’s icecap. It would mean that the overturning circulation would be affected faster than expected.
Instruments moored in the Irminger Sea, southeast of Greenland, shows that this is not (yet) the case. This mooring, deployed by the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) at 3 km depth in 2003, shows that convection strengthened in recent years. Record depths of convection were observed in the Irminger Sea in the winter of 2014-2015. This strong mixing was caused by an extremely cold and long winter. Two NIOZ scientists, Femke de Jong and Laura de Steur, have shown that the temperature evolution in the Irminger Sea (including the strong decrease in 2015) can be explained through regional interaction between the ocean and atmosphere. The manuscript that describes the convection and explains the temperature changes is accepted in Geophysical Research Letters. This coincides with a publication by a German group in Nature Geoscience this week, in which they use a model to show that it will take some time before freshwater from Greenland enters the deep water formation regions in large enough amount to weaken convection.
The measurements in the Irminger Sea were partly funded by the European North Atlantic CLIMate (NACLIM) project and are part of the international OSNAP (Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program). The goal of OSNAP is to quantify the overturning circulation and its heat transport at high latitudes and to establish a relation to convection and wind forcing. On the 26th of July a research expedition will return to the Irminger Sea to recover the NIOZ and other OSNAP moorings and do a hydrographic survey. This cruise can be followed on the OSNAP blog at www.o-snap.org. A short video documentary of last year’s cruise can be found on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-lhCIQjE4c).
In the paper’s abstract in the Geophysical Research Letters, Femke de Jong and Laura de Steur leave little doubt that the Gulf Stream continues to flow reliably:
Strong winter cooling over the Irminger Sea in winter 2014–2015, exceptional deep convection, and the emergence of anomalously low SST
Deep convection is presumed to be vital for the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, even though observational evidence for the link remains inconclusive. Modeling studies have suggested that convection will weaken as a result of enhanced freshwater input. The emergence of anomalously low sea surface temperature in the subpolar North Atlantic has led to speculation that this process is already at work. Here we show that strong atmospheric forcing in the winter of 2014–2015, associated with a high North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, produced record mixed layer depths in the Irminger Sea. Local mixing removed the stratification of the upper 1400 m and ventilated the basin to middepths resembling a state similar to the mid-1990s when a positive NAO also prevailed. We show that the strong local atmospheric forcing is predominantly responsible for the negative sea surface temperature anomalies observed in the subpolar North Atlantic in 2015 and that there is no evidence of permanently weakened deep convection.”
This is yet another failure for Stefan Rahmstorf and his Potsdam climate alarmism factory.
It is refreshing to see that the international research community is increasingly resisting these dubious PIK creations. It is also time for the German press to report on these results for the sake of balance. The Washington Post showed how to do it on 30 June 2016:

The mysterious ‘cold blob’ in the North Atlantic Ocean is starting to give up its secrets
[…] Stefan Rahmstorf, an ocean physicist with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and author of the study mentioned above, has writtenthat very cold temperatures in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean in the winter of 2014-2015 “suggests the decline of the circulation has progressed even further now than we documented in the paper.” But in a new study in Geophysical Research Letters reporting on deep ocean measurements from this region, two researchers present an alternative interpretation. They say that they found “exceptional” levels of deep ocean convection, or mixing of surface waters with deep waters of a sort that helps drive the overturning circulation, during in the winter of 2014-2015 — the height of the cold “blob.” And they attribute that temperature phenomenon to natural climate variability, driven by local weather and winds. “We find that the observed temperature variability is explained without invoking a trend in the lateral heat transport that would be representative of an AMOC slowdown,” Femke de Jong and Laura de Steur of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research write in the paper.

"On Friday afternoon, two members of Extinction Rebellion, Tamsin Omond and Sara Arnold, spoke at Port Eliot festival in Cornwall to Emily Sheffield, a former deputy editor of Vogue, about the role of the fashion industry in the climate emergency. Addressing an orangery packed with people who looked as if they knew their way round a vintage boutique, Arnold talked of the need for a “complete cultural change around clothes”.  She also listed a number of facts to convince even the most diehard fashion fan that change is necessary: the industry is set to grow by 63% by 2030; 100bn items are produced each year, “far more than we need”; fashion is a contributor to about 10% of carbon emissions; it is one of the biggest polluters, responsible for the release of a huge amount of microfibres and plastics into the ocean. Extinction Rebellion, she said, is promoting a fashion boycott, urging people not to buy any new clothes for a year. “We must curb our consumption very, very rapidly … We already produce enough clothes. We can swap clothes between one another, we can customise clothes, we can upcycle them.” The talk took place as part of the festival’s Fashion foundation, where events are taking place all weekend, including from the likes of designer Alice Temperley, and Turner-prize winning artist Jeremy Deller, as well as workshops in brooch-making and “energetic drawing”. Speaking after the event, Arnold explained more about the boycott’s aims, saying it does not need to mean going without. Indeed, she loves clothes. She trained in fashion design at Central Saint Martins in London and dreamed of being the next Alexander McQueen; she is wearing what Sheffield described as a “frow-ready” outfit – 50s glasses, her mum’s old dress and red lipstick. It comes down to “challenging your relationship with clothes”, she says. Arnold points out that even with secondhand clothes there are problems, such as whether they are being shipped from afar. “With everything you do, you need to ask questions and challenge … The best thing we can do is swap things with the people that are close to us.” Sheffield broadened the discussion by asking environmental questions of the audience, including: “How many single-use outfits will the British purchase this summer?” and “How many of those are for festivals?” The answers are 50m and 7.4m respectively. She followed by asking people to raise a hand if they bought a new outfit for the festival. Predictably, no one put their hand up. There was scope for taking heart, though, given the fact that doubling the useful life of clothing from one to two years reduces emissions by 24%. Extinction Rebellion is planning disruptions for London fashion week in September. It used direct action last time, blocking roads across the city to hinder those trying to travel from one show to another. For the next instalment, it is planning a funeral for fashion week, because, according to Arnold, “that should be where it stops for ever … During this absolute emergency, celebrating new fashion, which is essentially what fashion week is doing, is not relevant.” Arnold looked to the example of fashion during the second world war, when, she says, it was frowned upon to wear ostentatious dress. “Yet we are in an existential crisis and fashion weeks are going on as usual,” she said. For Arnold, it is not business as usual. She was working for a luxury brand when the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report saying there were 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. The sense of emergency took hold and she “walked out of the job leaving a resignation letter that said ‘we have 10 years left to fight for the planet so, goodbye’”. Omond agrees that the conversations the industry has need “to be about how we are dealing with the climate emergency and nothing else. That is the state of the emergency we’re in. We need to focus on how we can transition, not in 10 or 20 years, but today or tomorrow. Into a future where we are regenerating the earth rather than ransacking it.” They looked to the example of the recently cancelled Stockholm fashion week, pledging instead to become a platform that helps the industry be more sustainable. The next London fashion week, she says, “should be a declaration of emergency, not a celebration”. It should “be the death of fashion”, after which there will be rebirth. Omond spoke more broadly about the Extinction Rebellion movement, about its origins and how its rapid growth and success was rooted in the research of two academics, Roger Hallam and Dr Gail Bradbrook, into non-violent civil disobedience. As the black civil rights and Indian independence movements were the defining issues of their era, so climate change, she said, is the defining issue of ours. “What we see is that climate change is not a once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-a-generation or once-in-a-century issue. It is a once-in-a-species moment. It will be our defining moment.” • This article was amended on 29 July. It is Stockholm fashion week that has been cancelled, not Copenhagen."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got a big kick out of the press release that follows below, published by the hopelessly alarmist PIK.
Three times it uses the word “however” to tell readers that things really aren’t like what they just wrote in the sentence before.  The emphasis in the press release is my own.

University of Giessen: Natural Temperature Fluctuations in Antarctica Underestimated
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
What follows is a joint press release from the Justus-Liebig-University in Gießen (JLU), the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the University of Hamburg from 16 April 2015:
============================================
Climate change in Antarctica: Natural temperature variability underestimated – Cold spell superimposes man-made warming
04/16/2015 – The Antarctic ice sheet is one of the tipping elements in the climate system and hence of vital importance for our planet’s future under man-made climate change. Even a partial melting of the enormous ice masses of Antarctica would raise sea-levels substantially. Therefore it is of utmost importance to provide sound knowledge on the extent of anthropogenic warming of the ice-covered continent. A new analysis by German physicists shows that the uncertainties in the temperature trends over Antarctica are larger than previously estimated. ‘So far it seemed there were hardly any major natural temperature fluctuations in Antarctica, so almost every rise in temperature was attributed to human influence,’ says Armin Bunde of Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen (JLU). ‘Global warming as a result of our greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels is a fact. However, the human influence on the warming of West Antarctica is much smaller than previously thought. The warming of East Antarctica up to now can even be explained by natural variability alone.’ The results of their study are now published in the journal Climate Dynamics.
The melting of Antarctic ice shelves is not only influenced by warming air but also by warming oceans, causing ice loss at the coast. However, as there are no sufficient long-term records for Antarctic ocean warming yet, the study focuses on air temperature trends. In collaboration with Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Christian Franzke of the Cluster of Excellence ‘Integrated Climate System Analysis and Prediction’ (CliSAP) of Hamburg University, the physicists of JLU Armin Bunde and Josef Luderer were able to show that there are major and very persistent temperature fluctuations in Antarctica.

‘The climate in Antarctica, just like the global climate, tends to be distinctly persistent by nature – it remains in certain temperature ranges for a long time before it changes. This creates a temporal temperature structure of highs and lows,’ explains Christian Franzke. ‘A low, i.e. a longer cold period, will be followed by a longer warm period, and this natural warming has to be differentiated from the superimposed anthropogenic warming,’ adds Armin Bunde. The scientists did not only analyze data from individual measuring stations but also generated regional averages. The results show a human influence on the warming of West Antarctica, while this influence is weaker than previously thought. However, the warming of Antarctica altogether will likely increase more strongly soon.
For several years temperatures in Antarctica, but also globally, have been increasing less rapidly than in the 1990s. There are a number of reasons for this, e.g. the oceans buffering warmth. The study now published by the German team of scientists shows that man-made global warming has not been pausing – it was temporarily superimposed and therefore hidden by long-term natural climate fluctuations like in Antarctica. ‘Our estimates show that we are currently facing a natural cooling period– while temperatures nonetheless rise slowly but inexorably, due to our heating up the atmosphere by emitting greenhouse gas emissions,’ explains Hans Joachim Schellnhuber. ‘At the end of this natural cold spell temperatures will rise even more fiercely. Globally, but also in Antarctica which therefore is in danger of tipping.’  In fact, in March 2015 two Antarctic measuring stations registered high-temperature records.

Remarks by Die kalte Sonne editors: An excellent press release which brings up the so far under-estimated importance of natural climate functions. The key sentence:
A low, i.e. a longer cold period, will be followed by a longer warm period, and this natural warming has to be differentiated from the superimposed anthropogenic warming,”
The last paragraph bears the signature of the PIK and was likely a requirement for a mutual press release with the other institutes. The desperate remark concerning the recent Antarctic record levels has little climate relevance. At the South Pole temperatures have been falling for more than 50 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday we posted here how Germany’s DWD national weather service reported that September 2015 was cooler than normal. The United Kingdom saw one of its coolest Septembers in decades.
The Austrian ZAMG national meteorological services released the temperature results for September 2015 here. Looks like the country is getting an early start to the ski season. It writes:
The preliminary monthly result of the ZAMG: September 2015 pretty much hit the multi-year mean (0.1 °C below normal). Rain and snow were 20 percent above normal. The sun shone 15 percent less than it usually does over an average September.
A September with wide temperature fluctuations has come to an end. On September 1 the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG) measured the hottest September day in the history of measurements: 36.0 °C in Pottschach. In the second half of September a cold mass of air brought snow down to many valleys. Early on 24 September in Bad Gastein (S, 1092 m), for example, there was 8 cm of snow. At the Rudolfshütte in the Hohen Tauern (S, 2317 m) there was 45 centimeters of snow. ‘On average, however, the extreme temperatures yielded a very average month,’ says ZAMG climatologist Alexander Orlik. “Looking at Austria as a whole September 2015 was 0.1°C below the multi-year normal.'”
Urban heat island effect in Vienna?
Interestingly the ZAMG data show that remote locations saw cool anomalies, for example with Achenkirch (T, 904 m) coming in at
0.8°C below normal. The warmest anomaly was recorded in the city center of Vienna (W, 177 m), coming in at 0.3°C above the long-term mean for September.

"Australia has a responsibility to protect the Pacific region from the impacts of climate change, PNG’s newly appointed prime minister has said. James Marape told the Guardian Australia had “a moral responsibility … to the upkeep of the planet”, particularly given the extreme effect it was having on smaller Pacific nations. “I don’t intend to speak from Canberra’s perspective, they have their own policy mindset, but as human beings I know they will respond to the moral obligation that is prevalent amidst us, that we are environmentally sensitive to the needs of others.” He said the voices of smaller island nations must be listened to. “As big countries in the Pacific – Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand – we have a sense of responsibility to the smaller island countries, because displacement of these smaller communities will first and foremost be our neighbourhood responsibility,” Marape said. In a wide-ranging interview, Marape outlined a vision for his country, to leave behind a history of wasted opportunities and squandered resources, and move towards a healthy and educated nation free of violence. In May, after Scott Morrison led the Coalition to an election victory , Pacific leaders urged him to do more on climate change, saying Australia was “lagging behind”. Marape, who is completing his first official visit to Australia this week, said he would “not be silenced” on environmental responsibility. “We can have our resources but we must have it in an environmentally-friendly manner, so that we leave planet earth to the next generation not in the form we’ve inherited but a better form. He said he believed Australia, New Zealand, and PNG should lead the Pacific as a “bloc” of nations reconstructing their economies to handle resource productions in a more environmentally and socially sensitive way. On Thursday Marape warned foreign companies already in PNG that he intended to crack down on regulatory compliance, and also shake up revenue processing to ensure PNG drew at least 50% in taxes and royalties. He also wanted to see a shift towards an agricultural exports economy, as a “food bowl for Asia” rather than the current dependence on mining. “For the amount of wealth the lord has blessed us with ... the actual translation of this resource into improving peoples life hasn’t happened well in 44 years,” he told Guardian Australia. “I don’t blame the past they lived at the time. They wrote the history, I’m going to write the future for our country.” He said if his government didn’t get the balance right, future generations would blame them. His comments followed an ambitious declaration on Thursday that the impoverished nation would be free of its dependence on Australian aid – more than half a billion dollars a year – within the decade. He told Guardian Australia a prosperous PNG was a “win-win” for Australia. “If we are independent economically, if we are solid and sustaining our own life, your taxes don’t need to come to us,” he said. “We’ll keep the borders up north safe, we’ll have a better, friendly region up there, so the entire region is safe. If we disintegrate up there it affects Australia too.” Marape won the leadership in May after several months of political chaos which ousted his predecessor, Peter O’Neill. O’Neill’s legacy includes numerous crises and controversies, including allegations of corruption and mishandled public policies. In recent years a growing health crisis has been exacerbated by corruption scandals, medication shortages, mishandled medication contracts, and outbreaks of polio and drug-resistant TB. Marape pledged investigations into corruption around the medication supply, and announcements by September of new health interventions. He said he and Morrison had negotiated Australia’s assistance in improving health care. PNG also continues to have some of the world’s worst rates of family and sexual violence, and last week 18 people were massacred in the highlands village of Karida. The murders of mainly women and children were an escalation of worsening tribal violence which shocked the country. Marape denied there was a cultural tolerance of violence in PNG, warningperpetrators they would face prosecution, and said revenge attacks and traditional systems of compensation as a response to violence had to end. “I’ve made it absolutely clear on every occasion I’m asked this question, that whether it’s domestic violence or violence generally in society, culture and custom will not be a place to hide,” he said. PNG police have historically been underresourced, with investigative officers and specialised family violence units effectively grounded because they can’t pay for petrol to attend a crime. Marape said his government would target “hot spots” around the country to improve police resources where they are needed most."
"Since Monday, Britain has felt like a sun-bloated packet of supermarket pasta salad: sweating and smelly, abandoned at the bottom of a dog-waste bin, by turns greasy, hot, unpleasant, swollen and revolting. I have seen topless men resting beaded armpits on bus poles, teenagers dipping their feet in bright-green canals that are so choked with weed they seem hardly wet, parks turned to hay, parents wiping screaming and heat-exhausted children with flannels outside long queues for swimming pools, and car parks littered with ice-cube bags and fizzy drink cans. I have smelled other people’s arse cracks and seen carrier bags of used cat litter create a fiesta of bluebottles around our communal bins. I have left imprints on other people’s furniture. In the words of my mother – who lived through the 1976 heatwave with my newborn sister – “It’s pretty hard to deny climate change in this.” But, my friends, if this week has taught us anything at all – other than that strange, slippery, silvery feel of under-breast condensation – it is that Britain is not ready to live at 38C; we are ill-prepared for our changing climate.  According to a new piece of modelling by the global ecology research centre Crowther Labs, by 2050 London will have the climate of Barcelona. Sure, allow people to burn fossil fuels, farm intensively, drive and fly unnecessarily and waste natural resources like water and gas at the rate we are now and we’ll eventually have the climate of Barcelona. But we’ll have it with the culture of an NCP car park: crowded, threatening, poorly designed and smelling in every corner of someone else’s piss. When temperatures spike at 30C for a few surprising days a year, the UK could feel like a giant summer party. Benches are dragged on to pavements turned moist by recently melted chewing gum; children play out into the golden glow of late evening, hitting balls against garage doors and screaming through the spray of a hose; you’d go to a beer garden on the way home and drink something ludicrous because it was cold and you smelled of suntan lotion and felt you were on holiday; you might text someone you shouldn’t; you might soak your bed sheets as a result. But this week, as our children’s bedrooms still thrum away at 34C by midnight and our mosquito bites turn ankles into hot, stiff tree trunks of infection, people were not smiling. Tragedies occurred as people flocked to unsound bits of dockland, river and coast, desperate to find relief from the screaming sun above us. Parents, employees and trains simply dragged to a halt, like carthorses through liquid concrete. Emotions frayed, gardens withered, pets gently desiccated and children were sprinted from tree to tree by anxious parents trying to find entertainment in the shade for eight hours at a time. Suddenly, selling off all those shady public parks, local swimming pools, cool and quiet libraries, pieces of riverbank and tree-lined playgrounds didn’t seem like such a clever way for councils to claw back some money after years of vicious government cuts. Yesterday, during the hottest July day of my entire British life, I walked past a group of men in long-sleeved, full-length, high-vis worksuits, laying tarmac in the middle of a road junction. Machines pounded, the bitumen steamed, the sun raged down on their sweat-streaked faces. Each one looked, in his own way, like he was about to die. Rushing home, I half-filled my 20-month-old’s baby bath with cold water (to be later poured over our plants), in the middle of our front room, unable to go outside and unwilling to burn more precious resources and thereby increase the climate problem by buying a fan or – ye gads – an air conditioner. I thought of all those people in flats, like mine, with windows designed to open the width of a dildo. I thought of the nappies bulging in ripe bin bags like slow-roast casseroles. I thought of the cars occupied by single drivers, chugging poisonous blue fumes over fields and rivers because profit-crazed, micro-managing, outmoded bosses refused their request to work from home. I thought of all the ice-creams turning soft in corner shops. I have walked down enough fart-warm high streets, watched enough music festival fights and spent enough time on glaze-baked buses to know that Britain isn’t ready for 40C summers. Not in our homes, not in our workplaces, not even in our bodies. You may want to deny the climate emergency, you may want to hang on to the luxury and irresponsibility that denial allows. But my friends, you cannot deny the smell of a twice-cancelled commuter train service, with a blocked and swinging toilet, creeping past a fly-tipped ditch as a sweaty businessperson pulls a tuna mayonnaise sandwich from their heat-soft leather bag. This is the future that climate denial is heading us for. And I, for one, am not cool with that. • Nell Frizzell is a columnist and writer"

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Joe Bastardi also weighs in on March forecast weather here.
Schneefan at the German skeptic site wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de here looks at March weather this year in Europe. Although Europeans have seen a warm winter, the meteorological spring has started out on the bitter cold side and forecasts are showing it could get much worse.

In Central Europe (Germany) snow has been falling down to the flatlands and the cold is expected to stick around – and possibly intensify.
Schneefan writes a massive snowstorm has brought the heaviest snowfall in March in 50 years to the Russian capital city of Moscow, paralyzing the city. The reason was storm low “Zissie”, which also brought the southern and eastern parts of Germany heavy snowfalls.
As of March 4, 2016, a large area of snowfall covered the western part of Germany, bringing snow to the lowlands and traffic disruptions at the higher elevations:

Meanwhile low “Bianca” shown below centered over England has moved over Germany and will start to bring in cold air by Sunday:

An ECMWF analysis of the stratosphere shows a cold trough centered over Siberia extending southwards over Central Europe and into North Africa:

March cold forecast to continue, possibly intensify
Schneefan, who seems to have a very good meteorological background, writes that the March 3 forecast wintry weather will continue because of a polar vortex cold trough extending foremost over Central Europe and an accompanying powerful blocking Atlantic high.

Today the newest model forecast has been crunched out and it shows a cold trough extending well into Central and Eastern Europe even after mid March – thanks to a blocking high over Scandinavia and a low centered over western Russia:

Source: wetterzentrale.de, data from US GFS models.
That’s all it takes. Europeans will recall that the opposite pattern dominated late last year, giving Europe one of the mildest November-December periods on record.
It’s the patterns, stupid! It has nothing to do with global warming. Like local temperature is dominated by atmospheric patterns, global temperature is dominated by the oceanic patterns. It’s warm now globally because of an El Nino.
What follows is the GFS temperature forecast chart for 14 days out, March 19:

Source: www.wetterzentrale.de/topkarten/fsavneur.html
Note that the GFS model forecasts nighttime temperatures to fall to as low as a staggering -29°C for March 19!
Of course forecasts this far out are fraught with much very real uncertainty, and so it is very likely that such cold readings will not be reached. Revisions come daily.

What follows are the forecast noontime temperatures for March 19, where we see widespread freezing:


Source: www.wetterzentrale.de/topkarten/fsavneur.html
Schneefan summarizes by stating that there is even the possibility that the second half of March winding up colder than the first half.
Weather forecasts are indeed fickle, and so only time will tell if it really will get cold. Often times patterns flip unexpectedly and bring the opposite. Let’s hope it does. As mild as this winter has been, most agree that it has been long enough already. An icy March would be brutal and tough to take.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBerlin is Germany’s largest city, and in and around it there are 7 weather stations reporting to the Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD), Germany’s national weather service.
Earlier today Germans and Berliners woke up to one of it’s coolest nights so far this fall with temperatures around the freezing point. If you asked people in Berlin what the temperature was this morning at 6 a.m., you’d get very different answers. Why? Obviously because of the siting of the thermometers.
Website Wetterkontor here showed the readings taken this morning at Berlin’s 7 official weather stations located about the city. Below is a cropped table of these 7 stations:

Source: Cropped from Wetterkontor.
As you can see, depending on where the temperature reading was taken, the temperature ranged from a low of -2.3°C to +3.2°C recorded at Kaniswall and Marzahn respectively. That’s a span of 5.3°C!

Clearly the urban heat island (UHI) effect is very real and thermometer readings taken in urban areas are significantly skewed upwards.
I decided to plot these results on a map depicting the greater Berlin area below. We plainly see that the stations located near the city center are warmer.


In general, the further out you get from the city center, the lower the temperatures become. This gives real meaning to “cooler temperatures in outlying areas“, which we often hear from local weather reports.
What’s the take-home message? Clearly surface readings entail lots of uncertainty, and it’s probably a good idea to fall back on the satellite readings for accuracy. Little wonder that the 20th century showed a general global warming, especially when we consider that most of the stations have been moved next to large airports and big cities made of concrete, steel and asphalt.
Of course the above are readings taken for only one morning. It would be more interesting and telling to compare the overall long-term trend of each station. But I think it’s safe to say that most of us have a pretty good idea of what those results would be.

Then Europe and North America experienced a series of harsh winters and climate scientists, turning on a dime, suddenly declared them the result of global warming.

Flopped hypothesis: Cold winters not the consequence of shrinking Arctic sea ice
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning und Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Do you recall how the experts wanted to tell us that cold winters were linked to global warming? For example Spiegel Online wrote on 27 October 2014:
Weather bridge: Ice melt in the Arctic cooling winters in Europe
Climate scientists have discovered a meteorological remote link: When the sea ice melts in the Arctic, atmospheric currents get shifted – winters in Europe and Asia get cooler.
According to a study, ice melt over the past decades has led to especially harsh winters in Europe and Asia. Observations show that the cold winters could be linked with the retreat in Arctic sea ice, which has been happening over the past decades. Scientists led by Masato Mori of the Japanense University of Tokyo have discovered that the retreat of sea ice in the Arctic Barents-Kara Sea favor atmospheric currents that lend to cold in Europe and Asia. These atmospheric patterns that are called ‘blocking situations’ that serve to convey cold air to Europe and Asia and cause harsh winters there, reported the scientists in the journal “Nature Geoscience”.

A regrettable scientific knee-jerk reaction – as it would be exposed just half a year and half later.
A team of scientists of the University of Colorado Boulder and the NOAA led by Lantao Sun examined the mechanism more closely on 25 May 2016 in a new study in the Geophysical Research Letters. They were unable to confirm the relationship between sea ice melt and cold continental winters. The cold winters were neither explainable by the shrinking Arctic sea ice, nor by anthropogenic factors, the scientists found. A pronounced and underestimated natural climate variability is much more at play here.
The abstract for this important paper follows:
What caused the recent “Warm Arctic, Cold Continents” trend pattern in winter temperatures?
The emergence of rapid Arctic warming in recent decades has coincided with unusually cold winters over Northern Hemisphere continents. It has been speculated that this “Warm Arctic, Cold Continents” trend pattern is due to sea ice loss. Here we use multiple models to examine whether such a pattern is indeed forced by sea ice loss specifically and by anthropogenic forcing in general. While we show much of Arctic amplification in surface warming to result from sea ice loss, we find that neither sea ice loss nor anthropogenic forcing overall yield trends toward colder continental temperatures. An alternate explanation of the cooling is that it represents a strong articulation of internal atmospheric variability, evidence for which is derived from model data, and physical considerations. Sea ice loss impact on weather variability over the high-latitude continents is found, however, to be characterized by reduced daily temperature variability and fewer cold extremes.
This is a nice example of how we should not immediately believe everything our experts say and why critique and skepticism are completely justified.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecord ice melt at the Antarctic Peninsula? Scientists overlooked fluctuations in snowfall
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning / Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Condensed, summarized by P Gosselin)
German journalists, e.g. the Stuttgarter Zeitung’s Roland Knauer, recently reported that ice at the Antarctic peninsula was “melting more rapidly than first thought“, and that “climate change was making its way further south“.
But this seems to be a rather strange claim, especially in light of the fact that the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) recently claimed that ice on the continent would grow over the coming decades as a result of global warming. Somehow Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Knauer never got around to mentioning that.

Instead the Stuttgarter Zeitung (SZ) journalist prefers to narrowly focus on a small region that is melting. In the article he quotes scientist Veit Helm of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven, Germany, who says that at the Antarctic peninsula we are dealing with “small amounts of ice” here.
Moreover the SZ’s Knauer compares the year 2010 to the beginning of the 2000s, a climatically insignificant period. In the same article he also quotes the AWI’s Veit Helm, who claims that the temperature at the northern part of the Antarctic peninsula “is rising rapidly because of climate change“.
Rapidly? We decided to take a closer look at the Antarctic’s Faraday-Station, and here indeed we find a big surprise: Over the last 30 years there has been no noticeable warming (Figure 1). Here we see that Knauer tends to make things up instead of looking at real data.

Also the Stuttgarter Zeitung’s Knauer failed to mention that the post ice age temperature at the Antarctic peninsula was at today’s level for some 7000 years. Surprised?
Criticism of the AWI paper claiming a more rapidly melting Antarctic Peninsula has recently been mounting, for example by IPCC-author Andrew Shepherd of Leeds University, who points out that the AWI authors oversaw the snowfall. In the Irish RTE News:
“But Andy Shepherd, a director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds, said their calculations might have overlooked shifts in snowfall. ‘I think the new estimates of ice loss computed (from the thinning of the ice) are far too high, because the glaciers in this sector just haven’t speeded up that much,’ he said.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal sea ice stable for 38 years
By Kenneth Richard
Everyone knows that climate change is normal occurs naturally, at times rapidly, and that there is really nothing we can do about it. Amazingly, with some climate aspects, there has not been any change in about 40 years.
According to NSIDC sea ice trend data, from 1979 to 2006, the sea ice losses for the Arctic (purple trend line in graph below) were effectively counterbalanced by the sea ice gains in the Antarctic (green trend line), producing a conspicuously flat trend line in global sea ice.

Global sea ice has remained unchanged over the past 38 years, as measured by satellite. Source: woodfortrees.com here.

From 2006 to 2016, global sea ice trends have also been remarkably stable despite a massive increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions during this period. In fact, the sea ice gains in Antarctica have perhaps modestly superseded the losses in the Arctic, resulting in a very slight increasing overall trend in global-scale sea ice during the last 10 years:

Overall trend surprisingly shows slight increase. Source. woodfortrees.com here.
In 1979, global atmospheric CO2 was measured at 337 ppm. In 2016, global atmospheric CO2 has exceeded 400 ppm.
For both hemispheres combined, then, the addition of about 65 ppm of atmospheric CO2 concentration since 1979 has apparently had no overall effect on global-scale sea ice trends.

"The UK’s 10 hottest years on record have all occurred since 2002, the Met Office has said. Its statistics stretching back to 1884 reveal a worrying trend, as the planet as a whole deals with the climate crisis. In a further indication of how the climate is heating up, the records show that none of the UK’s 10 coldest years have occurred since 1963. “The world has warmed 1C since pre-industrial times, meaning that hot years are the new normal,” said Dr Michael Byrne from the University of St Andrews. “Not only is the UK getting warmer, but also wetter, with 13% more summer rain compared to last century. With global emissions of greenhouse gases on the rise, the UK will continue to get warmer and wetter as global warming accelerates. “The science of climate change is now clear. The UK government must ramp up preparations and ensure that our infrastructure and citizens are prepared for what is to come.” The data formed part of the Met Office’s latest annual state of the climate report, published in the International Journal of Climatology. The temperature series for the UK has been extended back by 26 years from 1910, as the data was added as part of ongoing work to digitise historical weather records. Dr Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office’s national climate information centre, said the extra data revealed a “very interesting timeline, with the top 10 warmest years at the most recent end, since 2002”. He said no new warm years were added as a result of the additions, though some years that sit among the 10 coldest are now included. The records now show 1892 was the coldest year, with the average temperature just over 7C, while the warmest year was 2014, with an average temperature approaching 10C, he said. On average, the temperature across the UK between 2009 and 2018 was 0.9C warmer than the average for 1961–1990. Last year joined the top 10 warmest years at number seven, despite the severe “beast from the east” cold snap early in the year. The UK had the most significant snowfall since 2010 in those 12 months, though snow has become less common since the 1960s, the Met Office said. Sunshine also appears to be on the up: average hours of bright weather for 2009-2018 were up 7% on the average for 1961-1990, while the team found the period from May to June 2018 was the sunniest three month stretch since 1929. In a year of extremes, the UK had a heatwave last summer, which the experts said was made 30 times more likely by climate change, and the season was the equal-hottest summer on record along with 2006. The UK data adds to a global picture of a planet that’s heating up, with this July on track to be the hottest month ever recorded on Earth, and 2019 expected to be the second hottest year. The hottest was 2016, which was boosted by an El Niño weather system. Nine of the 10 hottest years ever recorded globally have occurred since 2000. Mike Kendon, a climate information scientist and co-author of the report, said the results reflect the trend in global heating. “What affects the globe also affects the UK,” he said. “Climate change is not some abstract thing in the future that we are predicting is going to happen. The point is that climate change is happening and it is happening now.” Kate Sambrook, a climate researcher at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the report, said the findings should be a wake-up call. “International comparisons of public climate change beliefs indicate that UK residents are unconcerned about climate change and favour the prospect of hotter summers,” said Sambrook, adding that more needs to be done to convey the full implications of the UK’s changing climate. “Understanding what shapes public perceptions of climate change is significantly important, as this could provide scientists, policymakers and campaigners with the tools they need to communicate climate change more effectively and as a result motivate more people to act.”"
"Protecting the environment has overtaken affordable housing and the threat of terrorism in the British public’s policy priorities over the last eight months, polling has revealed. Polling by BritainThinks, commissioned by Engage Britain, found that concern about the climate crisis has risen at roughly the same rate for all age groups, and has emerged as the single most important issue for young people. It comes as the activist group Extinction Rebellion is due to stage another round of protests expected to bring parts of the country to a standstill. The findings also cast at least partial doubt on the image of Britain as a hopelessly divided nation that Boris Johnson has pledged to “unite”. Both leave and remain voters, across the demographic spectrum, consider “funding health and social care” and “providing opportunities for families living in poverty” to be among the top three issues facing the country. The polling revealed there is little support anywhere on the political spectrum for people having to sell their homes to pay for care – a proposal in the 2017 Conservative election manifesto. Further, there is broad support across the British population for the availability of childcare, fair treatment of workers through pay and conditions, and improving training for the unemployed as ways of tackling poverty. The polling was conducted via an online survey of 5,032 members of the public in October 2018. The core questions were repeated with a 2,009-person sample in June 2019. Within both surveys, participants were asked to make a series of choices, ranking core challenges facing the UK from most to least important. Some political divisions remain, however: responses to the 2019 survey showed that poverty is not a priority for those who say they would vote for the Brexit party at the next election. The 2018 survey also found that while immigration, the environment and trade with other countries are not prioritised by the public overall, for each of these issues there is a significant minority who it to be very important. Although these priorities are of higher importance to some groups than others, the 2019 follow-up survey showed a general increase in the prioritisation of the environment (including among older voters) and a decreasing prioritisation of immigration across most groups. The survey also concluded that immigration is felt to be the most divisive of the challenges tested, while terrorism is deemed to be most complicated to solve. Julian McCrae, the managing director of Engage Britain, a policy organisation focused on tackling Britain’s challenges, said: “Too often Britain is painted as a hopelessly divided country, sliding into a US-style culture war. But our findings paint a more complex, potentially positive picture than this. “Our new prime minister takes the reins at a time when the country is at a crossroads. The choices they make in the coming months will shape our nation for years to come. But on some of the biggest issues – such as health, social care, the environment and poverty – there is much common ground from which to pave a way forward.” Trustees of the thinktank include Ruth Hunt, the chief executive of Stonewall; Trevor Phillips, a former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission; and Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies."

"The majority of YouTube videos about the climate crisis oppose the scientific consensus and “hijack” technical terms to make them appear credible, a new study has found. Researchers have warned that users searching the video site to learn about climate science may be exposed to content that goes against mainstream scientific belief. Dr Joachim Allgaier of RWTH Aachen University in Germany analysed 200 YouTube videos to see if they adhered to or challenged the scientific consensus. To do so, he chose 10 search terms: Chemtrails Climate Climate change Climate engineering Climate hacking Climate manipulation Climate modification Climate science Geoengineering Global warming The videos were then assessed to judge how closely they adhered to the scientific consensus, as represented by the findings of reports by UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from 2013 onwards. These concluded that humans have been the “dominant cause” of global warming since the 1950s. However, Allgaier found that the message of 120 of the top 200 search results went against this view. To avoid personalised results, Allgaier used the anonymisation tool Tor, which hides a computer’s IP address and means YouTube treats each search as coming from a different user. The results for the search terms climate, climate change, climate science and global warming mostly reflected the scientific consensus view. Allgaier said this was because many contained excerpts from TV news programmes or documentaries. The same could not be said for the results of searches related to chemtrails, climate engineering, climate hacking, climate manipulation, climate modification and geoengineering. Very few of these videos explained the scientific rationale behind their ideas, Allgaier said. Most of these videos also supported the chemtrail conspiracy theory, which claims toxic substances are sprayed on to members of the public from the condensation trails from aircraft to modify the weather, control our brains, for biological or chemical warfare, or other sinister reasons.  Allgaier noted, however, that although chemtrails videos received a lot of views, it does not mean the people watching them believed what they were told. He said it was important to examine the algorithms that decide which videos to show people, but did not suggest YouTube should remove climate denial material. “Effectively, this would be censorship, and YouTube says they are against censorship,” Allgaier said. “Perhaps they could change their algorithms to prioritise factual information, especially for health and medicine.” A YouTube spokesperson said: “YouTube is a platform for free speech where anyone can choose to post videos, as long as they follow our community guidelines. “Over the last year we’ve worked to better surface credible news sources across our site for people searching for news-related topics, begun reducing recommendations of borderline content and videos that could misinform users in harmful ways, and introduced information panels to help give users more sources where they can fact-check information for themselves.” Allgaier suggested more scientists should start taking YouTube seriously as a platform for sharing information. “YouTube has an enormous reach as an information channel, and some of the popular science YouTubers are doing an excellent job at communicating complex subjects and reaching new audiences,” he said. “Scientists could form alliances with science communicators, politicians and those in popular culture in order to reach out to the widest possible audience. They should speak out publicly about their research and be transparent in order to keep established trustful relationships with citizens and society.” The research was published in the journal Frontiers in Communication."
"Efforts to end fuel poverty and energy waste by making the UK’s draughty homes more efficient have collapsed by almost 85%, according to new government data. The report, published on Thursday, shows that the number of energy efficiency upgrades undertaken each month has fallen to 10,000 on average for the six months to the end of May. This compares with an average of 65,000 a month in 2014. The latest figures show that in May about 10,000 properties benefited from energy efficiency measures, such as loft insulation or boiler upgrades, down sharply from about 30,000 in the same month in 2015 and 2016. At this rate it would take 96 years for the government to reach its own targets to reduce fuel poverty, according to the charity National Energy Action. Peter Smith, a director at the fuel-poverty campaign group, said the progress was “a fraction” of what was required to ensure 1.2m homes are renovated each year until 2035 . “This is exceptionally disappointing,” he said. “Based on this dire progress, it would take over 96 years to help all the fuel-poor households who currently live in homes with solid walls.” The report has emerged following a stark warning from MPs last week that the UK has “no chance” of meeting its climate-crisis targets without a major overhaul of energy-efficiency programmes. A select committee report found that public investment in energy efficiency has shrunk in recent years, even though it is the cheapest way to cut carbon emissions. It said the government risks undermining its own climate targets unless it treats energy efficiency as a national infrastructure priority. Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said ministers have “continued to sit on their hands” despite the consensus support for energy efficiency. “If the government lacks the political will to deliver energy efficiency improvements, how can we expect it to get on with the costlier actions needed to tackle climate change?” she said. The report blamed a lack of public spending for the falling number of home insulation installations, which have plummeted by 95% from 2012. Households in England have been hardest hit since the former prime minister David Cameron reportedly told aides in 2013 to “get rid of all the green crap” levied on energy bills. Energy efficiency is “not only crucial for tackling climate change but are vital for lowering customers’ energy bills and lifting people out of fuel poverty”, Reeves said. The committee said ministers must urgently establish a central national fund to help low-income, vulnerable and fuel-poor households insulate their homes. Ed Matthew, from climate-crisis thinktank E3G, said energy efficiency must be “mission critical” for the next prime minister. “The UK has no hope of reaching net-zero emissions unless the government, including the Treasury, makes energy efficiency an infrastructure investment priority,” he added. The BEIS said: “No one should be cold in their own home. To eradicate fuel poverty, we are driving £6bn into energy efficiency and £300m each year to help 2m low-income households get money off their winter energy bills – while our energy price cap protects households from rip-off deals. “This is part of our wider commitment to achieve net zero emissions while also cutting home energy bills, and to ensure all homes are at least EPC Band C by 2035.”"

The editor-in-chief of the Iserlohner Kreisanzeiger und Zeitung daily Thomas Reunert dedicated an entire page on the topic of wind energy last Sunday, bearing the headline: “The Norwegians Are Giving Us The Finger!”
It is an interview with a former professor from the University of Bielefeld, Dr. Kurt Gehlert, 75, an expert in mining. It focusses on the state of Germany’s Energiewende (transition to green energies), particularly wind power and the illusions of energy storage technology.

The sub-heading reads
Dr. Kurt Gehlert is certain that the Energiewende has already failed. Or we will drown and cover ourselves in wind turbines.”
Germans pushing the Energiewende are aiming to see 80% of Germany’s energy needs being met by green energies by 2050. Some are even calling for doing away with natural gas, in addition to coal and oil.
But the monster-sized insurmountable obstacles loom as German policymakers begin to scramble in a confused state of denial.
Germany’s alternative baseload-capable sources, such as hydro and biogas, are severely limited and account for only 11.5% of Germany’s total energy supply today. Moreover there still does not exist a viable technology for storing the irregular supply of wind and solar power. Gehlert says these technologies are nowhere near being capable of taking on the role of providing a reliable baseload.
The 75-year old professor points out that although there is a huge capacity of wind and solar energy already in place, often both are not available because they are weather-dependent. Gehlert tells the IKZ that the media like to give the public the impression that the technology is not far away, but the reality is that it is nowhere near in sight.
Energy storage concepts such as accumulators, power-to-gas, compressed air storage are plagued by low efficiencies and sky-high costs. He reminds readers that using electric car batteries as a storage media is also a pie-in-the-sky-vision. Gehlert tells IKZ:
It sounds like a good idea and so let us illustrate it using a rough calculation. In 2020 it is planned to have 1 million electric cars on the roads in Germany. If we tap into them and remove 50% of the average 25 kwh charge capacity, then we will extract enough power from them (12.5 x 1000000 =12.5 gigawatt-hours) to cover Germany’s needs each day for 25 minutes and 17 seconds; Germany’s total daily consumption is 712 gigawatt-hours. And then all the electric car owners will have only 50% of the range available for their next trip.”

Gehlert also tells the IKZ that pump-storage is also not a solution for Germany, calculating:
In Germany about 125 times more storage lakes than what exists today would need to be constructed by 2050. This area and topography simply does not exist at all.”
On the idea of using Norway’s, Switzerland’s or Austria’s mountainous regions to build the necessary pump-storage capacity, Gehlert tells the IKZ:
The Swiss are reacting allergically, and the Norwegians are giving us the finger.”
Go ruin your own landscape, and leave ours alone.
And even if it was possible to use pump-storage in foreign countries, Gehlert tells the IKZ that in order to bring the power from the above-mentioned mountainous countries to the big consumption centers in Germany’s industrial heartland, it would require the construction of about 70 high voltage power lines ranging from 300 to 1200 km in length!
Gehlert also scoffs at the idea of using wind-power-to-gas as a method for storing energy, which would be used to fire gas turbines to produce electricity in times of low-winds. And expanding the calculation to 50% constant electrical power from wind energy would require about 470,000 German wind turbines (Currently there are about 25,000). Gehlert elaborates:
The figure is difficult to fathom. Germany has an area of approximately 360,000 square kilometers. That means each of the 470,000 wind turbines would have 0.76 sq km.. The city of Iserlohn alone has an area of 125.5 square kilometers and so would have 165 wind turbines.”
The IKZ asks Gehlert to summarize:
The Energiewende under the given conditions in Germany is a failure […]. The policymakers state in a worried manner: Our predecessors have left behind a disillusioned population.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenowned sea level expert and geoscience professor Nils-Axel Mörner recently published a paper in the Journal of Religious Studies, Buddhism and Living titled: “The New Religion of Global Warming and its Misconception in Science“.

Obviously the retired professor from Sweden believes that today’s climate science is best discussed in a forum reserved for faith a religion.
Exaggerated by a factor of three
As the pictured cover abstract above shows, Mörner concludes that AGW is a “new religion” built on “false premises” and that it violates physical laws. He adds that “the calculated temperature changes from 102 climate models lie above measured values by a factor of three“.
Few scientists have published as much on the subjects of sea level rise, paleo-geophysics and geodynamics as Nils-Axel Mörner has. He is also a co-founder of the Prague-based Independent Committee on Geoethics.
AGW “an illusion”
In a recent article Mörner also called CO2-driven global warming “an illusion” and that scientists “who insist that present climate changes are the function of CO2-driven global warming” place themselves in the “shameful box of anti-science“.

Of course the “before” photos aren’t real photographs but are merely the “after” photos with the wind turbines air brushed off. This is the most accurate method to convey the true difference.

Tax evasion investigation clouds Vestas’s horizon. Image: Vestas
German online SHZ daily here reports that Danish wind energy giant Vestas saw its Hamburg and Husum, Germany, offices raided by German tax authorities earlier this year amid suspicions of tax evasion. Vestas executives deny any wrongdoing and said in a statement that they are cooperating with German authorities.
According to the SHZ, the raids of the German head offices took place on February 9th and involved cases over the time period of 2006 to 2011. Vestas German headquarters in Husum employ 2000 employees. The SHZ writes:
The case is connected to an earlier one involving former Vestas former directors who were accused of bribery in Germany. Over the past years Vestas has replaced almost the entire company management, and for this reason Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen sees little danger for the company’s image.”
Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal here reports that the SEC is investigating solar energy giant SunEdison’s “financial disclosures to investors about how much cash the solar-power company had on hand as its stock price collapsed last year.” The Journal writes:
Officials in the SEC’s enforcement unit are looking into whether SunEdison overstated its liquidity last fall when it told investors it had more than $1 billion in cash, the people said.”
SunEdison shares have collapsed since last summer, with shares down 96% from a July high. “The company’s market value has fallen to around $400 million from nearly $10 billion in July.”
These are just the latest examples of the woes dogging the world’s renewable energy companies. With so many in trouble, it’s hard to see any future for the branch.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat’s going on in Europe this summer?
It seems this summer is getting regularly punctuated by fall-like or even winterlike weather.
Snow is once again in the forecast – during the hottest time of the year!

Wintry conditions forecast for some parts of the Alps next week. Photo: NTZ (not Alps region, for illustrative proposes only).
A couple of weeks ago (mid July!) I reported here how snow had fallen down to elevations of 1600 meters – a “rare event” according to meteorologists, stunning Europeans.
Well, the white stuff may be back! Today meteorologist Dominik Jung here writes that once again snow is expected to fall in the Alps region, possibly even down to elevations under 2000 meters.

Of course caution needs to be exercised here, as this forecast is some days out, and so there’s uncertainty in it.
But the fact that the models could show this happening during the hottest time of the year is already impressive in itself.
What follows is the press release from wetter.net:
================
Wiesbaden (wetter.net) 03 August 2016 – After a few nice days starting Sunday, things could get drastically worse next week. Polar air could even deliver snow to the Alps.
It’s scary what the weather model is calculating for the next 10 – 14 days. After a few nice days with warmth this coming weekend and on Monday and Tuesday, afterwards things could really be falling through the floor! Already yesterday and today many clouds and continuous rain have been the rule. We are a long way from peak summer, even though we are right in the middle of the dog days – the hottest time of the year! Today one year ago in Germany were highs of near 35°C in the shade. Today in some places will not even see 20°C.
On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday there could be a small peak summer event, after that it appears there is going to be a crash over the days that follow. Temperatures will drop considerably. From Northern Europe cold polar air will sweep down to Germany. In January this would bring a peak winter weather pattern. For the current time of the year it is simply going to be cool, wet and overall autumn-like. In may be wintry foremost in the Alps.
After the middle of next week the snowfall elevation could drop at times below 2000 meters. Whoever thought this summer could not be worse, August is poised to show us otherwise.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarly last June I presented here a series of before-and-after photos showing the devastation by wind parkson the beautiful German countryside. The photos were presented by windflut-elpe.de, a site protesting wind parks in forests and natural heritage locations.
That post generated a tremendous reaction, and was shared more than 4000 times in social media. Therefore the site has asked me to post on the following video, made by a drone, with the hopes of getting the message out.

Screenshot of idyllic German landscape that is slated to be destroyed by massive industrial windpark. See drone video here.
The video starts with a view of the idyllic Central German landscape along with an instrument mast, which is for recording the wind conditions at the site in preparation for the wind park that is about to be installed there.
Keep in mind that this wind business is all about a select few, corrupt good-old boys network-type scammers cashing in big time at the expense of the rest of us and the environment itself – nothing more. Wind energy is one of the greatest big-business scams on earth.

We sent a video drone to the 102 meter wind mast at Mannstein in order to film a 360° panorama view from the perspective of the planned industrial wind power park.
The first stop is at the 135 meter height (turbine drive shaft height) where the drones makes a 360° camera sweep of our beautiful homeland. You can even see the tiny 57 meter high Stüppelturm, which is one of the highest viewing points in the Sauerland region. On some days here it is even possible to see the Ruhr region.
The second stop is approximately 200 meters high (rotor height of the wind turbine) where the drone makes a second 360° camera sweep. Here we find ourselves at about 900 meters above sea level. Here we are speechless at just how we are able to look directly down at the villages below. Conversely this is how villagers there will be viewing the huge wind turbines. A total of 14 of these wind turbines whose blades sweep an area the size of a football pitch are planned to be turning here.
At night it will be possible to recognize this large industrial complex for producing subsidized erratic power through the red blinking lamps on the turbines all across the breathtaking Sauerland Region. All this will happen in a protected natural wildlife reserve, where normally even the height of a simple hunting stand is regulated.
This is truly incomprehensible.
We hope many citizens in the towns of Wulmeringhausen, Bruchhausen, Assinghausen, Wiemeringhausen and Siedlinghausen will take the time to look at the destruction of nature that is now taking place.
Who is responsible for this madness?
Ask your elected officials, and boot them out of office!

"The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, has written to all heads of state asking countries to outline their plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, but at this stage the Australian government is only engaging on commitments to 2030. Ahead of a climate action summit in New York on 23 September, Guterres has reportedly asked leaders to flag plans they will set next year for 2030 emissions reduction commitments, and their plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. A spokesman for the prime minister, Scott Morrison, says Australia will respond formally to the UN chief in due course, but when asked by Guardian Australia what commitments would be outlined, only addressed the 2030 target. The spokesman said the Morrison government recognised “the serious challenge climate change presents, which is why Australia’s 2030 target is one of the strongest efforts among G20 countries”. “The government has beaten Australia’s 2020 targets by 367 million tonnes and has already clearly outlined Australia’s plan to meet our 2030 target which will cut the emissions intensity of our economy by two thirds and reduce our emissions per person by half,” Morrison’s spokesman said. Ahead of a climate meeting in Bonn in June, the Morrison government was challenged by the European Union and by China about whether it can meet its Paris commitments given the trend of rising emissions evident since the repeal of the carbon price, including increased pollution from vehicles. The EU pointed out “on the basis of reported projections with existing policies and measures” Australia did not appear to be on track to meet the Paris commitment. It asked whether Australia would need further policies to meet the commitment, given the current trends. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In their responses, Australian government officials defended Australia’s policies, but in defending the status quo, officials also restated a commitment to “review and refine” domestic policies aligned with the five-yearly review process under the Paris agreement. “This approach will provide for integrated consideration of domestic policy and international targets, and provide guidance for industry about future policy review processes,” Australian officials said in June. Under that process, Australia needs to submit a new pollution reduction goal for post-2030 as part of the “review, refine and ratchet” mechanism under the Paris agreement. The EU and Canada ahead of the June talks in Bonn also queried the Coalition’s decision to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto Protocol in the carbon budget it outlined before the May election. The Coalition is counting a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet Australia’s 2030 target. Australia’s carbon budget also factors in emissions reduction from the Snowy Hydro expansion; energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy that the government has not yet unveiled; pollution reduction from the rebadged emissions reduction fund and just under 100Mt of abatement from “technology solutions” which aren’t specified and “other sources of abatement” such as projects under development but not yet contracted. The minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, has found himself under pressure post election for presiding over a clear trend of emissions increases. During the last parliamentary sitting week, Taylor was asked repeatedly whether emissions had risen in recent years, not fallen, with official data showing increases for the past three years. The minister for emissions reduction argued pollution went “up and down” but he acknowledged emissions had risen, arguing the trend was attributable to booming liquefied natural gas exports, which he claimed helped lower global emissions. In sharing that rationale, which experts have contested, Taylor did not mention Australia’s coal exports, which increase global pollution."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo, you have not landed on the wrong site.
NoTricksZone has simply switched to a new WordPress theme. The old hybrid theme was getting too many problems with each WordPress version update and so it was high time to change.
I know the new look will take some getting used to, but as far as function is concerned it should be trouble-free for a good while.
A couple of weeks ago the site with the old theme was inaccessible for some 32 hours. Then about 10 days ago readers were able to write comments, but there was no longer a “Submit comment” button.  These things of course can be fixed, but I just don’t know enough about programming the script, so I said the hell with it.
There will be some slight appearance changes in the future, but what you see is pretty much what you will get.
The good thing is that readers are now able to submit comments once again, and this is what really give the blog life.
Looking forward to hearing from the readers once again!

"James Lovelock, the scientist and writer, is 100 years old on Friday and remains a combination of environmental Cassandra and Old Testament prophet. Unlike them, though, he changes his mind about what the future holds. Foolish consistency, Emerson wrote, is the hobgoblin of little minds, and Dr Lovelock’s mind is not little. More than 10 years before the record high July temperatures, Dr Lovelock flatly told the Guardian that 80% of human life on Earth would perish by 2100 because of the climate emergency. He imagined a dystopian end of humanity where “the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable” by the end of the 21st century. As a scientist (his first letter to Nature was published in 1945, on the subject of writing on petri dishes), Dr Lovelock’s life has been studded with insight. He invented an electron capture detector that could pick up minute traces of pollutants – such as the pesticides that spurred Rachel Carson to write the 1962 book Silent Spring. At home he built instruments that ended up on Mars, helping Nasa to establish that the red planet was lifeless.  Dr Lovelock’s imagination has not narrowed, but his vision has become bleaker with time. His new book Novacene: The Coming Age of Hyperintelligence proposes that the 300,000-year Anthropocene era of Earth’s human domination is ending. Novacene is a new age where our species is doomed to a worse fate than clinging on for dear life at the north pole as previously imagined. Instead we will become lackeys of cyborgs able to think 10,000 times faster than humans. We will be kept on to ensure there are habitable temperatures for these superior intelligences. Novacene’s thesis is a straight-line extrapolation of Dr Lovelock’s breakthrough idea which he began to develop while a consultant at Nasa in the 1970s; the thought that the planet was a superorganism. In 1974, he and biologist Lynn Margulis proposed the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth is in some way alive. The paper suggested our planet metabolises and responds to changes in its environment to survive. In bestselling books such as The Revenge of Gaia, Dr Lovelock argued that humans have exploited Earth and the “old lady” would eliminate us unless we treated her with greater reverence. That is why the Novacene will start, he now reasons: because a superintelligence will recognise that all living tissue will be consumed by climate crisis and will act with Gaia to keep the life going. When it came out, the Gaia theory immediately chimed with the incipient green movement. Tough-minded scientists, though, initially reacted as if – as one critic put it – Dr Lovelock had let off a bad smell at the vicar’s tea party. Its appeal, they wrongly sneered, was to devotees of faith-healing and mysticism. But Dr Lovelock has stuck to his guns and refused to be co-opted by environmentalism. He backs nuclear power and has zigzagged on global heating, saying that some alarmist books – including his own – had made unwarranted predictions. He even told the Guardian: “We’ve got to really make it clear to those very silly people who think we can save the planet to cease and desist.” And what of the Gaia hypothesis? Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould described it as “a metaphor not a mechanism”. Its truth is poetic not literal. That echoes how Dr Lovelock sees himself. “I’m a romantic,” he said once. “I’m much more of a poet by nature than anything else.” He might be best seen then as a 21st-century William Blake – one whose words are no more testable than verse, but no less valuable for that.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s ridiculous enough politicians are blaming the refugee crises on man-made climate change, even though everyone knows they are really caused by foreign policy ineptitude and debacles.
But now climate change hysteria has taken on new, more extreme witch-hunting dimensions that are on par with, if not even surpassing, those of the Dark Ages – a time when bad weather and crop failures were blamed on sorcerers, devils and witchcraft. The very same lunacy is happening today. But this time the responsible witchcraft is even on the other side of the planet!
NTV German public television here reports (and does so seriously) on a Peruvian farmer who is currently suing Europe’s largest power company, RWE, for its emissions 10,000 kilometers away in Germany – claiming that these emissions have caused the nearby Andes glaciers to melt through green-house gas induced climate change.
It is reported that the melting glacier has caused a nearby lake to expand, and it now threatens to burst its dam and flood the town where the farmer lives. NTV reports:
Small Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya is suing Germany energy corporation RWE for 20,000 euros in compensatory damages because of hazards arising from the melting of Andes glaciers.”
The farmer says that the dam needs to be upgraded, and RWE should pay its share of the cost.
Normal people of course realize this is nothing but a rigged enviro-publicity stunt that is designed to look like serious news by the German sensationalist media. This stunt of course likely will hurt the climate movement more than it will help because it is in fact so far-fetched that it is serving to vividly demonstrate just how far out of control the climate activism and hysteria have gotten.

According to environmental group Germanwatch, which helped organize the lawsuit filed in Essen, Germany, the farmer fears a flood from the nearby rapidly melting glaciers, claiming that because RWE is “Europe’s largest coal-fired CO2 emitter”, it must be held accountable for the damage to the glaciers from its emissions, and the hazard posed to local property.
This story is actually being presented (abused) by the German media as a legitimate grievance.
So how can a farmer in Peru claim that a power company some 10,000 kilometers away is responsible for nature not behaving the way he would like it to? After all, when compared to the global total emissions, RWE’s coal-fired emissions are puny. Firstly the suit was arranged at least in part by German environmental activist group Germanwatch, who is likely using it to get attention-grabbing headlines. Here the farmer is cynically being used as a publicity-stunt pawn.
Concerning the basis underpinning the claim itself, Germanwatch cites the IPCC, claiming that climate change is causing the glacier to melt and overfeeding the lake which lies just a few kilometers uphill from the town. The dam holding back the water risks breaking. It wouldn’t be so had RWE not emitted CO2, the suit appears to claim.
NTV writes that because RWE is Europe’s largest CO2 emitter, “the company should contribute to the financing of the protection measures against the growing glacier lake located above the town and correspond to the company’s share on the cause of climate change.”
Gee, now that I think about it, my last vacation was ruined by lousy weather. Shouldn’t it be possible for me to get fossil-fuel power companies to compensate for the damage I had to endure. Also the weather for my wife’s last outdoor birthday party was ruined by rain last June.
Yes, the neurotically hysterical witch-hunting days of the Dark Ages are back. The bonfires are being lit.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe FDP Free Democrat party in the state of Hesse (central Germany) writes in a press release how local utilities and communities are suing wind park development company JUWI, accusing it of “making unrealistic promises” regarding wind energy projects, and calls them “highly speculative business with enormous risks for public budgets“.
Over the years German local utilities and communities have invested tens of millions of euros in local wind parks with the hopes of seeing a ruddy return on investment and making a noble contribution to climate protection at the same time. That dream, it is turning out, has shattered.
The FDP press release in English:
Millions in losses with wind power projects
WIESBADEN – Once again wind projects are producing negative headlines. In the spotlight is “wind energy pioneer” JUWI, which is one of the largest project developers in Hesse. With the Pfalz City Utility and the City Utility of Mainz, two large community electric utilities are suing currently JUWI because the wind prognoses made never came materialized, and thus the returns fell way below the planned budget. Instead of posting profits after more than ten years in operation, community company “Pfalzwind GmbH“ has seen double-digit millions in losses. Pfalzwind operates more than 60 turbines.

‘We see the same result in Hesse as well. Everywhere communities, utilities and energy co-ops were lured by large profits, but in the end most wound up with losses that the citizens will have to cope with. Not only are they stuck with damage to the environment and the landscape, but now they also have a financial disaster to cope with,’ says René Rock, energy policy speaker of the FDP faction in the Hesse state parliament.
Rock adds:
‘The lawsuits by the community utilities once again show that promises made by the wind industry are unrealistic. And due to the falling feed-in rates, the economic prospects are worsening in addition. Also large utilities in Hesse, such as Mainova AG in Frankfurt, are losing money with their stakes in wind parks.
Currently alone in Hesse some 470 wind turbines are in the permitting process. Instead of blindly trusting the promises made by project developers, planned wind power projects involving investment by communities should be halted based on economic sense. In truth wind parks are highly speculative businesses with enormous risks for public budgets.'”
And never mind the industrial blight and environmental destruction they are causing to Germany’s once idyllic landscape, and the threat to human health and wildlife.

"Air passengers may have to pay an extra “carbon charge” on flights as part of a government initiative to reduce CO2 emissions and tackle the climate crisis. Passengers could choose to pay more for travel tickets, which would then be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions. Or the scheme could work on an “opt-out” basis and also be applied to trains, buses and ferries.  Ministers hope the plans will raise awareness about the effects of public transport on the environment. The extra funds could be used to spearhead eco-friendly projects such as planting trees to reduce the carbon footprint. The government said it hoped the initiative would “drive consumer choices towards less polluting journey options”. However, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has launched a call for evidence on offsetting carbon emissions produced by public transport. In addition, the government has expressed concerns consumers may not trust that their payments are supporting worthwhile causes. Grayling said on Thursday: “Climate change affects every one of us and we are committed to ensuring that transport plays its part in delivering net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “An offsetting scheme could help inform travellers about how much carbon their journey produces and provide the opportunity to fund schemes, like tree planting, to compensate for those emissions. However, our focus remains to target the development, production and uptake of zero emission technology across all modes of transport.” A report by the Department for Transport said: “One way to increase uptake could be to follow an opt-out rather than opt-in model, under which the cost of offsetting carbon emissions would be automatically included for consumers.” In the past year, a third of carbon dioxide emissions came from transport alone in the UK."
"Catastrophic news for insect life has inspired communities and councils around the UK to take action, generating splashes of summer colour which hope to have a lasting impact. After reporting a campaign by the conservation charity Plantlife to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges, we asked you to share stories from where you are.  Below, readers share some of their local successes, including thoughts about how leaving nature to run its course by standing back rather than taking action can help – and explain how they have been getting involved in community projects big and small. “Hengrove Way is a 1960s dual carriageway in the south of Bristol. The wide central verge was originally reserved for a tram system but was planted a few years ago with an avenue of purple beech trees. The meadow here is sown annually by the Bristol city council parks. Budgets are tight and so they try and make a little spread a long way – in this case there are over 300 metres of flowers: as a resident they give me much enjoyment.” Richard, Bristol “Three neighbouring families with five children grouped together to care for three unloved grass verges adjacent to our homes in Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire. We planted yellow rattle to compete with the grass annuals to provide colour in year one, and perennials from year two onwards. We lovingly named our patch Flack Wild Heath. “I was mowing the verges myself each week anyway, and over a beer with our neighbours, we decided we should give it a go. We’ve had lots of interest and look forward to new friends in the village extending the Heath from next year. More of us should do the same; it’s easy to sit back and wait for the council or someone else. Actually though, there’s way more pleasure in seeing our own patch develop. Very rewarding. In fact, it’s ace arriving home each day to see what’s popped up.” Marcus Firmin, Buckinghamshire “I planted this wildflower bank earlier this year on the edge of a path which overlooks a meadow outside my home. The idea is to develop areas that give colour to the meadow as well as attracting different types of wildlife, while trying just to manage small areas and keeping things as natural as possible.” David Warr, Jersey “Totnes Gardens is a small Royal Horticultural Society affiliated voluntary group, working around the town. We’ve been sowing wildflowers everywhere this year, and are hoping to rewild and sow the town cemetery next year, and plant more trees. We’re also in future talks with the district council concerning all sorts of what seems to be overzealous cutting taking place. The photo shows our largest area, opposite the hospital, but you can see [from the sign in the photo] some folk just think it’s for them to pick. “It seems that council cuts have resulted in random scalping of verges and open spaces, with what appears to be no real plan, but they seem happy when community groups such as ours, with some skill, take on their sites. We’re sure we can save them money, improve the environment, spread beauty and pollen – there are so many advantages there seems no reason not to!” Diana Cusack, Totnes “Taken this week whilst on my way into the town centre. One of many small urban spaces that have been planted by the local council.” James, Newport “As a gardener, I know the work involved in preparing and maintaining verges. As long as vehicle sight lines are maintained where necessary, I feel this verge on the Kegworth bypass is a superb example of how the natural environment is so much more attractive than the sterile, known alternative. I am a gardener at a nearby university where the campus has initiated a biodiversity scheme to encourage wildlife within its grounds. A number of areas are being left unmown; poorer ground is being seeded with suitable wildflower mixes. The study will try to identify any change in the number of plants animals and insects within campus.” Dave Bicker, Loughborough “This verge on both sides of a wide dual carriageway and on the central reservation was planted by nature. Each year, Surrey county council mows it all flat when the flowers are in bloom, citing safety, although the extent is clearly excessive by common sense standards. This deprives stressed motorists of an uplifting and soothing experience on their journey, as well as disrupting or terminating the lives of countless amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates. Planting verges is good: but don’t forget nature did it first, and all we have to do is respect and wonder.” Jenny Desoutter, Dorking “These are not planted – they’re wild native plants! I monitor two of our local verges for the Yorkshire Dales national park’s Orton Special Verges project: we don’t plant verges and do not think we need to do it. “We need to educate people about what we already have as our native flora. It’s better to conserve the flora that will naturally grow in meadows and verges, for example by not mowing too soon (apart from a safety strip if needed for visibility). Late mowing, to let grassland plants set seed, and taking off the mowings to keep fertility low will allow native plants to regenerate as well as being cheaper for the councils than year round mowing or trying to seed verges with plants that want arable conditions.” Sue Millard, Cumbria “Burleys, Lewes district council and Wildflower Lewes have been planting up verges across Lewes District for three years. There are several different types of meadows, those that are more biodiversity rich – which are perennial wildflowers – are sown once and then left to get on with it, year on year. The other meadows are the annual wildflower seeds chosen for our pollinators – these are much prettier and have to be sown yearly. These mini-meadows are scattered across roadside verges, recreation fields, housing estates and cemeteries. This year all the meadows were teeming with butterflies, bees, grasshopper and crickets. It’s amazing just how many insects benefit from such small areas. “We want to improve the biodiversity of our district, educate and inspire others to do the same and hopefully they will get closer to nature by visiting more green spaces. We plant chalk-loving plug plants in some areas to create mini-downland areas in the hope that residents will get out more, reducing social isolation and improving health and wellbeing. We receive many compliments about how the wildflower verges have make them happy on their way to work and school – the wider impact a small patch of ground can have on people is tremendous and shouldn’t be underestimated.” Karen Rigby-Faux, Lewes"
"Greta Thunberg is to sail across the Atlantic in a high-speed racing yacht next month to attend UN climate summits in the US and Chile as part of a sabbatical year the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist will spend in the US. “Good news! I’ll be joining the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, COP25 in Santiago … I’ve been offered a ride on the 60ft racing boat Malizia II. We’ll be sailing across the Atlantic Ocean from the UK to NYC in mid August,” Greta tweeted. The journey will take two weeks. The campaigner, whose solo protest last year sparked the Fridays for Future global school climate strike movement, said in June she would be taking a year off school to attend the summits, on 23 September in New York and 2-13 December in Santiago, which she described as “pretty much where our future will be decided”. But she said she did not yet know how she was going to get there. “It’s on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean,” she said. “And there are no trains going there. And since I don’t fly, because of the enormous climate impact of aviation, it’s going to be a challenge.” In August 2018 Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden when aged 15. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings. Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. Owned by a German property developer, Gerhard Senft, based in Brittany and sponsored by the Yacht Club de Monaco, the 18-metre (60ft) yacht is a high-speed planing monohull built for the 2016-17 single-handed, non-stop round-the-world Vendée Globe race. The club said on its Facebook page it was “honoured to be able to sail Greta Thunberg emission-free over the Atlantic”. The yacht is fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate zero-carbon electricity. Greta will be accompanied on the voyage by Malizia II’s skipper Boris Hermann, her father Svante, Pierre Casiraghi, the grandson of Monaco’s late Prince Rainier III and the actor Grace Kelly, and a film-maker. Greta told the Associated Press before the announcement that she had not wanted to travel to the US by cruise ship because of their notoriously high emissions, while the Atlantic could be dangerous for sailing boats in August because of the high risk of hurricanes. “Taking a boat to North America is basically impossible,” she said. “I have had countless people helping me, trying to contact different boats.” In a joint Guardian interview with the US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in June, Greta said of her planned visit to the UN climate summit: “I don’t fly for climate reasons so it’s not 100% yet, but we are figuring it out. It’s very hard, but I think it should be possible.” Referring to her congressional district, Ocasio-Cortez said: “If you land in New York, we will give you a Queens welcome!” After New York, where she will take part in several meetings and protests, Greta aims to travel by train and bus to the annual UN climate conference in Chile with stops in Canada, Mexico and other countries. The activist, the daughter of an actor and an opera singer, has spoken to policymakers at last year’s UN climate conference in Poland, to business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, and politicians including the French and British parliaments. She has also met Pope Francis. Greta, who has encountered fierce criticism from climate deniers and some politicians, told AP she was not sure how her message would go down in the US, where Donald Trump leads broad opposition to the radical measures scientists say are required to limit global warming. She said meeting the US president would probably be “just a waste of time”, adding: “I have nothing to say to him. He obviously doesn’t listen to the science and the scientists. So why should I, a child with no proper education, be able to convince him?” This weekend, British Vogue said that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, would be guest editor of its September issue and had chosen Greta as one of 15 women it described as the “trailblazing changemakers” who would feature on the cover."
"Spraying trillions of tons of snow over west Antarctica could halt the ice sheet’s collapse and save coastal cities across the world from sea level rise, according to a new study. The colossal geoengineering project would need energy from at least 12,000 wind turbines to power giant seawater pumps and snow cannons, and would destroy a unique natural reserve. The scientists are not advocating for such a project, but said its apparent “absurdity” reflects the extraordinary scale of threat from rising sea level.  Ending the burning of fossil fuels remains the key to tackling the climate crisis and sea level rise, the researchers said. But the carbon emissions pumped into the atmosphere so far may already have doomed the west Antarctic ice sheet. A series of earlier studies concluded the accelerating loss of ice from the region could not be stopped by emissions cuts any more, meaning the oceans will rise by three metres in the coming centuries. This would leave major cities across the world, from New York to Kolkata to Shanghai, below sea level. “As scientists we feel it is our duty to inform society about every potential option to counter the problems ahead,” said Prof Anders Levermann, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who led the research. “As unbelievable as [the proposal] might seem, in order to prevent an unprecedented risk, humankind might have to make an unprecedented effort.” “The effort needed would be huge, like an Antarctic moon landing,” he said, though the cost would be less than abandoning even one city like New York. “It is up to society to make this choice – it can’t shy away from making decisions.” Scientists are not yet certain that the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet is inevitable, but Levermann said this had to be the working hypothesis. When the Earth has been 2C warmer in the past, sea level was much higher than today, he said. “Even if we keep the Paris agreement [target of 2C above pre-industrial levels], we will get five metres of sea level rise,” he said. “I think people haven’t really entertained the real consequences of this. Either you abandon these coastal cities or millions of people live by a wall behind which is the world’s oceans, above your head, like the sword of Damocles.” The loss of ice from west Antarctica is driven by warmer ocean water melting the underside of the ice sheet at the coast. Pumping snow on to the sheet would replace the lost ice, making it thicker again. This pushes the sheet back down on to the ground and stabilises it. The research, published in the journal Science Advances, used computer models to calculate how much water would need to be pumped from the ocean on to the top of the ice sheet and then sprayed as snow to achieve this stabilisation. The result was 7.4tn tons, or about 7,400 cubic km of seawater, over 10 years – though the scientists said the work was a proof of concept rather than a precise estimation. The area covered would be two-thirds the size of Scotland. Pumping the water alone would need 12,000 powerful wind turbines, but extra power would be needed for heating to stop the water freezing in the pipes and to desalinate it if required. The research did not estimate the cost of the idea, as there are too many uncertainties. But Levermann said the largest pump in the world, in New Orleans, cost about $600m (£481m), and the Antarctic project would need about 90. However, he said less money would be needed to build expensive coastal defences if sea level rise was reduced. Prof David Vaughan, director of science at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and not part of the research, said: “Scientists have an important role in testing, and challenging ‘climate fixes’. I think [Levermann and colleagues] tread the tightrope well, examining and challenging this idea without becoming advocates. Indeed, they are careful to point out the severe side effects.” Robert Larter, also at BAS, said: “I think it is unlikely that cutting carbon emissions to zero will save the west Antarctic ice sheet, as even on that pathway warming is forecast to continue for some time. So, such a geoengineering scheme, even if it was practicable, would be just a very costly way of buying time.” Geoengineering to stop ice loss in west Antarctica has been considered before. In 2018, scientists explored ideas including building a 300-metre-high artificial island to stop the ice sliding into the sea and constructing a 100-metre-high wall to keep warm water out. The new study did not include future global heating of the ocean and atmosphere, and the scientists said bolstering the ice sheet with artificial snow would be in vain unless rising temperatures were checked. They concluded: “The ambitious reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is and will be the main lever to mitigate the impacts of sea level rise.” • This article was amended on 18 July 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said 7.4tn tons of seawater would have a volume of “about 7 cubic km”."
"Unilever has warned it will sell off brands that do not contribute positively to society, with British favourite Marmite and Magnum ice-cream among the big names thought to be vulnerable to a cull linked to the company’s sustainable business agenda. Alan Jope, Unilever’s chief executive, said it was no longer enough for consumer goods companies to sell washing powders that make shirts whiter or shampoos that make hair shinier because consumers wanted to buy brands that have a “purpose” too.  Unilever has tasked its marketers with devising sustainable business plans for its portfolio of more than 400 brands, with Marmite, Magnum and Pot Noodle thought to be among the businesses that will need to find a raison d’être if they are to remain part of the group in the long term. “Can these brands figure out how to make society or the planet better in a way that lasts for decades?” said Jope, outlining the company’s thinking. Unilever is not working to a set timetable but Jope, who took over from Paul Polman in January, said it was possible that a brand or even whole product category “is not going to be able to find its purpose”. His comments raised the possibility of the company selling off profitable brands, potentially hurting the bottom line, but Jope said: “Principles are only principles if they cost you something.” Unilever points to the success of its trophy sustainable brands – a group of 28 that includes Dove, Hellmann’s and Sunsilk – which are growing much faster than the rest of the business. The brands, which accounted for more than half of the group’s €51bn (£46bn) sales last year, are those that are the furthest ahead on meeting the company’s sustainability goals, which include increasing the positive impact it has on communities. Unilever is also looking at ways to respond to shoppers’ concerns about single-use plastic, with the launch of Cif refills (so spray bottles can be reused) and wrapper-less multipacks for its Solero ice-cream lollies. Jope said its sales data had not detected a change in shopper behaviour yet but there was evidence of attitudes changing amid a heightened debate about the environment. Jope’s comments came as Unilever updated investors on its performance in the first six months of 2019. Operating profits were up slightly at €4.6bn (£4.1bn) that fell short of analyst expectations of €5bn. The 3.5% increase in underlying sales for the second quarter was slightly weaker than expected. Although many parts of Europe are experiencing record temperatures, the company said the cool start to the summer season had hit demand for its ice-cream brands, which also include Cornetto. The shares closed down 2% at £48.96. Steve Clayton, the manager of HL Select funds which holds a position in Unilever, said: “Unilever themselves describe their markets as mixed, and most investors will look at these numbers as something of a curate’s egg.”"
"Donald Trump’s leases of public lands and waters for oil and gas drilling could lead to the production of more climate-warming pollution than the entire European Union contributes in a year, according to a new report. The Wilderness Society estimates heat-trapping emissions from extracting and burning those fossil fuels could range between 854m and 4.7bn metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, depending on how much development companies pursue.  The 28 nations in the European Union produced about 4bn metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2014, the last year reported. “These leasing decisions have significant and long-term ramifications for our climate and our ability to stave off the worst impacts of global warming,” the group said. “Emissions from public lands are expected to fall well short of the reductions target suggested by leading climate science, and this administration’s leasing decisions are making that problem much worse.” The US government has offered close to 378m acres (153m hectares) of public lands and waters for oil and gas leasing since Trump became president through April 2019, according to the group. That’s more than any previous administration, according to the Wilderness Society. The government does not regularly track emissions from fossil fuel development on public lands, and courts have rebuked the interior department for failing to consider the climate crisis in granting leases. The Trump administration has also been trying to overturn an Obama-era moratorium on federal coal leasing. Multiple candidates vying for the White House in 2020 have said they would ban new drilling on public lands. They include Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Jay Inslee, Pete Buttigieg and Tim Ryan. David Hayes, who was interior’s deputy secretary under the Obama administration, testified before US lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday that some oil and gas activity can and should continue on public lands “but it should be counterbalanced with the aggressive deployment of our public lands to tackle the climate crisis”. Republicans on the subcommittee holding the House hearing called a witness from the conservative Heritage Foundation to argue that “negligible climate benefits” would come from banning oil and gas production on federal lands."
"The Trump administration’s hostility towards climate science is not new. Interior climate staffer Joel Clement’s reassignment and the blocking of intelligence aide Rod Schoonover’s climate testimony, which forced both federal employees to resign in protest, are just two of the innumerable examples. These attempts to suppress climate science can manifest themselves in many ways. It starts with burying important climate reports and becomes something more insidious like stopping climate scientists from doing their jobs. In February 2019, I lost my job because I was a climate scientist in a climate-denying administration. And yet my story is no longer unique.  This is why on 22 July I filed a whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration. But this is not the only part to my story; I will also speak to Congress on 25 July about my treatment and the need for stronger scientific integrity protections. I have worked at the National Park Service (NPS) for a total of eight years. I started out as an intern during the Bush administration, where I experienced nothing like this. I returned in 2012 after earning my PhD, when the NPS funded a project I designed to provide future sea level and storm surge estimates for 118 coastal parks under different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. This kind of information is crucial in order for the NPS to adequately protect coastal parks against the future effects of the climate crisis. I handed in the first draft of my scientific report in the summer of 2016 and, after the standard rigorous scientific peer review process, it was ready for release in early 2017. But once the new administration came into power, publication was repeatedly delayed, with increasingly vague explanations from my supervisors. So for months, I waited. And waited. I was still waiting when I went on maternity leave almost a year later in December 2017. It was while I was on leave that I received an email from another climate scientist at the NPS who warned me that the senior leadership was ordering changes to my report without my knowledge. They had scrubbed of any mention of the human causes of the climate crisis. This was not normal editorial adjustment. This was climate science denial. A months-long battle ensued. Senior NPS officials tried repeatedly, often aggressively, to coerce me into deleting references to the human causes of the climate crisis from the report. They threatened to make the deletions without my approval if I would not agree, to release the report without naming me as the primary author, or not release it all. Each option would have been devastating to my career and for scientific integrity. I stood firm. And I prevailed. Media inquiries and open records requests about my report eventually led to letters from members of Congress, and the NPS was essentially forced to publish my report as I had written it. The NPS continued to retaliate against me. I was forced to accept pay cuts and demotions while I continued to lead several other projects. By February of this year, the NPS declined to renew my funding, despite common knowledge that my branch at the time had ample surplus funding. When I received this news, my immediate supervisors, who wished for me to stay, asked me to apply to be a volunteer so that I could continue my work. My volunteer application was denied without explanation. If there was any question about whether my termination had to do with legitimate budget constraints or with punishing me for not altering my report to suit the Trump administration’s agenda, that answered it. Politics has no place in science. I am an example of the less discussed methods the administration is using to destroy scientific research. I wasn’t fired and immediately told to leave; instead they sought retribution by discretely using governmental bureaucracy to apply pressure and gradually cut funding. I have been cut off from projects that I created and was working on, including one that would have provided the public with a valuable interactive way to see for themselves how sea level rise will impact our parks. This is why we need to support stronger protections for scientists. Ultimately it will be the taxpayers who will pay the true price for our apathy towards these violations. It will become progressively costlier to alter our infrastructure to accommodate the incoming tides. And we will watch as our historic structures are swallowed by the sea. As these things are happening, remember that there were probably multiple scientists like me who warned of these dangers but were silenced. The current administration may only last a matter of years, but its actions may potentially impact our planet for centuries.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago German website wobleibtdieglobaleerderwärmung (where’s the global warming – hereinafter WBDGE) also looked at polar sea ice.
The site writes that despite all the global warming and ice-melt fantasies circulating through the circles of climate alarmism, “Arctic sea ice extent in July 2015 increased strongly compared to a year earlier.”
Linear trend for Arctic sea ice extent for July. Since July 2006/7 to July 2015 there’s been a brisk rise in Arctic sea ice extent. Source: nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/
The WBDGE site writes:
“Wasn’t Arctic sea ice spposed to be gone already in 2013? Al Gore predicted in 2008 that the Arctic would be completely ice-free by 2013! Such amazing nonsense. The unfalsified reality appears as follows: The polar ice caps are in fact growing– record sea ice in Antarctica.
The upward linear Antarctic sea ice trend has been continuing since 1979! The trend there remained unchanged also in July this year:
For 37 years the linear trend for Antarctic sea ice has been on the rise: This last July was the fourth highest since measurements began in 1979. Source: nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/.
This has been going on despite the repeated data falsifications surrounding global warming, see NOAA study falsifies data: The global warming pause simply gets calculated away. 
Now that it’s clear the Gore fantasies of 2008 failed to materialize, the Arctic now is supposed to be ice-free in the summer of 2016, according to 2013 calculations by the US-Navy: Arctic to be ice free at the latest in 2016.
Anyone ready to bet that it won’t happen? New solar model: “Little Ice Age” already in 15 years – icy winter in Europe and North America.”

"In an airless library in north London, 56 people are trying to help fix not one global crisis but two. There are students and builders, a civil servant, an entrepreneur, a restaurateur, a support worker. There are immigrants and retirees and even a retired immigrant. This is Britain’s first climate assembly, a randomly selected panel of local people convened by the London borough of Camden to consider what can be done to confront the climate emergency. The jurors have been assembled to listen to briefings, pose questions, assess facts, debate and discuss, and then ultimately recommend action to Camden council. The big question before them is what action the district can take to limit global heating and its impact. The hope is that the series of deliberations this summer will have a bearing not just on the climate crisis but on the crisis in democracy too. A national climate assembly is planned for Westminster this autumn and Camden is being closely watched for the dos and don’ts of this relatively new form of public engagement. “I am interested in the idea of citizens assemblies and not just for climate change,” said the local MP Keir Starmer, a Labour frontbencher. “I think they might turn out to be a way to have a different kind of political dialogue to avoid the shouty tribalism of the last few years.”  Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com Things take a while to get going. The opening session, something of a factfinding exercise, is held on a muggy summer night in the semi-basement rotunda of Swiss Cottage public library. The room swelters, as if to make a point. A woman wafts a fan. Facilitators urge brevity, inquiry, civility. One helpful juror draws a smiley face on a paper cup to keep a restless child amused. Climate experts such as Prof Mark Maslin, of University College London, set out the indisputable science of the climate emergency. Participants have yellow and red cards to slow him down or stop him if they get lost. (“It’s the first time I’ve ever been red-carded during a presentation,” he says later.) Not everyone finds it easy. One young woman is on the verge of walking out because progress is slow. For others it’s all a bit fast. And one juror, Neil Chappell, who works in construction, wonders who chose the experts and how they chose the facts. “The people they had talking were good at getting their agenda over but didn’t give us enough information to make informed decisions,” he said. A gulf in knowledge between jurors is exposed when they are invited to pose questions. One wondered: “How many people in Camden die from air pollution each year?”. Another asked: “Can wind farms change the direction of the wind?” But council officials are enthusiastic about the process and adamant they will act on its recommendations in a new environmental plan to be drawn up for 2020. Georgia Gould, the council leader, said she hoped the outcome would be “some concrete action that we can take forward as a council. That’s the idea of it being an open process – you are letting go of that control. There has been a complete breakdown in trust in our political system, we need to create new democratic mechanisms to break through that and this is it.” After an initial fact-finding phase, the 56 panellists get into the nitty-gritty. What is to be done? What works? A pair of local trailblazers talk through their own personal carbon “hygiene” measures: an electric car for their horticultural business; rail travel for holidays; meat as a treat, not a staple; double glazing, solar panels, and – perhaps less convincingly – “warm” wallpaper. They even approach idling cars on the street and tell drivers to switch off their engines. “Most people respond politely,” Stephen Evans tells the audience. Campaigners and experts lay out the pros and cons of certain measures. Refitting all Camden’s buildings with greener heating such as air source heat pumps and insulation would cost at least £1.3bn. Is that a bargain or a burden? Who would pay? What about pedestrianising streets, a zero-emissions motoring zone, greening driveways, grasscrete – would that make enough of a difference? And is there any space to plant more trees? (Answer: not really.) “I think it’s very interesting but I’ve been wondering quite a bit about where it’s going to lead,” said Chris Dunham, the director of Carbon Descent, an eco-consultancy, who spoke as an expert at the sessions. “My concerns are that in the age of austerity it’s a real challenge for councils which don’t have the money or power to do the things that are needed to complete the piece.”  Citizens’ assemblies have been rising to prominence since an Irish experiment in 2016 to convene randomly selected laypeople to thrash out the abortion issue broke the deadlock and paved the way for a national referendum in 2018. Camden has debated social care and its 2025 borough plan. Its climate assembly will be followed by similar exercises in Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Lambeth, Devon and Hertfordshire this autumn, and a national climate assembly is also scheduled to take place. Scotland will debate its future in a citizens assembly. “In the last six months the interest in the idea has risen exponentially,” said Tim Hughes, who helped to facilitate the Camden exercise. As the director of Involve, a public participation charity, Hughes has worked on a range of assemblies. What makes them work well? “You want a good range of expertise, time and space for assembly members to reflect and reach recommendations,” he said. “You are not looking for complete consensus because that could be false consensus. You also want a good sense of where people disagree.” Debate at the six tables in the library rotunda produces plenty of disagreement but participants say it is good-natured. Rupert Cruise, who is originally from Johannesburg and has lived in Camden since 2001, said: “I think it’s fantastic. The only surprise we’ve had is that there are no climate change deniers. There are differing views on where we should focus but it’s done in a respectful tone.” Some have suggested participation in such assemblies could be made mandatory in the same way that jury service is. Simon Burall, an expert in public participation who also helped to facilitate the Camden assembly, said that may be some way off. “There is significant distrust in government already, and if you force people to be here and don’t listen to them you will alienate them even further,” he said. “If you tell them they have to come to learn how to be better citizens, they’ll feel patronised.” Still, the scope for more citizens assemblies on divisive issues seems broad enough. Indeed, a rigorously instituted panel to discuss the pros and cons of leaving the EU might have been useful in the run-up to the 2016 referendum. Perhaps it might still be useful as a tool to elevate debate, restore the primacy of indisputable fact and return civility and respect to political dialogue. “For the past few years we have had two or more groups of people talking past each other, whether on Brexit or climate change,” said Starmer. “I’m supportive of the idea.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSince last week the NoTricksZone site has been experiencing technical difficulties, which all seem to be rooted to WordPress version updates. The new updates just don’t seem to be working well anymore with the Hybrid theme I’ve been using for almost 5 years now.
Last weekend the site was down over 30 hours. This, according to the hosting company, was due to a “faulty htaccess file” in the new WordPress version, which the hosting company thankfully eliminated.
Then a few days ago I noticed the NTZ was not using the latest WordPress version, and so I updated the site to the newest available version: 4.2.1. Unfortunately since then the reader comments function has stopped working. Readers are able to write a comment, but the “Submit Comment” button is missing.
Other sites Using WordPress have had the same problem as well. Normally updates are supposed to improve the sites. Now they seem to be wreaking havoc instead.
Concerning the missing “Submit comment” button, there now appears to be a fix that takes care of the problem.

Unfortunately it involves editing the site code, something I’m very very wary of attempting because I’m not a programmer, and I’m not sure where the piece of code belongs. Surely there is the risk I’d makes things worse.
So for the time being, until I find someone who can safely repair the problem, it will not be possible for readers to leave comments.
Another solution is changing the WordPress theme. This is the one I’m leaning to. I’ve been using the current theme almost 5 years, and now is probably as good a time as any to change to a new, fresher one. I’ve looked into it, but here too the task does not look very straight forward and harbors the potential for major messiness. I’ve previewed several newer WordPress themes, and they all have no problems with reader comments. However, many of my sidebars (e.g. Archives, Blogroll, Categories, etc.) fail to appear in the preview. I need to look into this in greater detail.
In summary, readers have to expect changes coming to the site, and possible potholes along the way. Big Oil hasn’t sent any checks and I don’t have the luxury of bringing in a programming specialist.
Originally I started out doing this with the purpose of getting involved in the climate debate – and not the technical programming of WordPress sites, which now seems to be more and more frequent. If anyone out there has expertise in this and is willing to help out, send me an e-mail (see contact page).

"I am an ordinary mid-career professional. I work a nine-to-five job in the city, and I’m well respected and growing in my career. I have never broken the law. And recently, I joined Extinction Rebellion, blockading traffic. I have never done anything like this before. It was way out of my comfort zone, and I felt like vomiting at the idea. But climate change makes me want to vomit even more. I am a scientist, and I can say with confidence: the science is absolutely terrifying. So I went.  Here’s my reflections on the experience: I found it surprisingly calm, peaceful and friendly. The heavy media and police presence was intense, but I felt safe, and I didn’t feel like I was at risk of being arrested at any point. I just followed clear instructions from organisers and the police. Those who were arrested chose to be arrested, and even that was very calm. I’d genuinely feel safe bringing a child, just like to any other peaceful rally. Also, it was fun! There was lots of chanting, and it felt positive and upbeat. I’m really glad I had courage and went, despite feeling so nervous. I don’t intend to get arrested, but there are a hundred other ways to support and contribute, and I intend to do them. Until recently, I thought that these sorts of tactics are ridiculous and just irritate people and lead to more divisiveness. I thought blocking traffic was no way to develop consensus and get things done. But then I saw the news on Extinction Rebellion blockading London for more than a week, with more than 1,000 arrests. Soon after, the UK government adopted a climate emergency resolution.  I started reading about Extinction Rebellion. I found out that it’s been carefully and deliberately constructed, drawing upon the best research on how to create massive social change, of the kind we need to address the climate emergency. I found out that the suffragettes got women the vote by smashing windows and chaining themselves to railings, facing hate and ridicule in the media. And how Martin Luther King combated racial inequality by rallying people to violate laws and provoke mass arrests, and was arrested 29 times. And this was deliberate, carefully orchestrated and inspired by the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi. I learned how the research shows nonviolent civil disobedience can bring rapid and sweeping changes, and that we’ve never seen an example fail once 3.5% of the population becomes actively involved. I started to hope. Let me tell you a story. Many of us already know the climate catastrophe story, so let me tell you a different one. Right now, we are sleepwalking. We go about our daily lives assuming that buying a house and putting money in our superannuation are appropriate ways to plan for the future. If we hear about the climate crisis, we tell ourselves, surely it can’t be that urgent if no one is doing anything? We need to wake people up, fast. This requires massive, sustained media attention. Disruption is very effective at creating this, especially by blockading major urban centres. The aim is to make people pay attention, and they’re much more likely to do so when it impacts their daily lives. If there are arrests, that’s great too, because that’s also newsworthy. Most people will hate the disruption tactics, and get irritated or angry. They’ll ridicule the people involved and say negative things in the media. A small percentage will join the movement. It’s OK that this is only a small percentage. Remember that we only need 3.5% of people to get active. We do, however, need most people to be sympathetic.  People start by discussing tactics (with lots of hate), but then move on to the issue (“but we really should be doing something about climate, it’s actually quite scary”). More people start to realise that this is an actual emergency. Proper debate starts happening, and people are talking about it everywhere. As more people wake up, more of them join the protests. And there’s safety in numbers, so as it gets bigger, more people feel they can join. Politicians can no longer ignore the issue. More and more people are getting arrested for nonviolent and relatively harmless activities, and they have growing public support for their sentiments. Grandfathers are glueing themselves to roads because they want a safe future for their grandchildren. Economic activity is suffering from longer blockades, and businesses are demanding that the government does something. Politicians are forced to address the issue. And now, we finally start working together in collaboration with other countries. People all around the world have been inspired to rebellion. I have no idea if this story will ever happen but I think there’s a chance. It depends entirely on how many of us get on board. It’s uncomfortable to disrupt people’s lives, but the courageous folks doing it are putting themselves on the line to save us all. I still benefit from the sacrifices of those suffragettes and all the others who’ve fought so hard, at great personal cost. Now it’s my turn. • The author of this article is a scientist living in Australia"

A webcam recorded this image on September 23 at 2:41 p.m. in Austria in Bad Gastein (1000 meter elevation). Source: here.
Listening to the media, I kept getting the impression that September 2015 in Germany had been a warm one (though my heating costs tell a different story). Yes, I kept hearing weathermen saying how mild it was, with summerlike temperatures. But now the reality comes out.
Germany’s national weather service Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) has just issued the preliminary results for September 2015. It turns out the month in Germany was cooler than normal. The results are tabulated from data collected by the country’s approximately 2000 weather stations scattered across the country.
The DWD writes how September was unusually uneventful and just plain normal, after an “extremely hot and dry summer“. It also announced that the drought period that gripped most of the country since since February has ended in the north and central parts of the country, yet lingers on over the east and the south (an area with a size of something like Maine).

The DWD sums up the temperature:
In total the temperature, precipitation and sunshine were below the long-term mean. […] September 2015 had a mean temperature of 13.0° Celsius, 0.3°C cooler than the mean of the 1961 – 1990 international reference period. Compared to the 1981 – 210 reference period the deviation was -0.5°C.”
Especially the northwest part of Germany was cool in September as the temperature failed to reach the 25°C mark during the entire month, with surface frost appearing in many regions late in the month and snow at higher elevations (see photo above). In general Northwest Europe and Scandinavia saw unusually cold conditions this summer, see here and here.
The average temperature for 2015 so far in Germany over the first 9 months of this year has been 10.77°C. By comparison last year (2014) the average temperature after the first 9 months was 11.42°C. 2014 in Germany was the hottest on record.
With October looking to be perhaps dominated by a high pressure over Scandinavia (GFS model), 2015 will fall well below last year’s wild anomaly.
The overall trend for Germany over the past 25 years remains slight cooling. There has not been any statistically meaningful warming since 1990.
UPDATE: And Great Britain has just had its 3rd coldest September in 42 years. See here.

"More than half the US was under excessive heat warnings on Friday amid a brutal heatwave – which experts warned could become the “new normal” because of the climate crisis.  Forecasters warned of “very dangerous heat” as temperatures rose to 100F (37.7C) – particularly in urban areas where the mass of buildings creates “heat islands”. Alerts were in place in states as far reaching as New Mexico and Maine. The worst of the heatwave is expected to be felt in Washington DC, Richmond, Virginia and Raleigh, North Carolina, where air temperatures of about 100F are predicted on Saturday and Sunday, with a heat index – which is closer to what the temperature actually feels like – of 110 to 115F (43.3 to 46.1C). A heat “dome” of hot and humid weather is roasting the midwest. The high humidity makes it more difficult for the human body to cool itself down by sweating, because perspiration does not evaporate easily in the moist air. Organisers of the New York City Triathlon cancelled Sunday’s event, a day after Bill de Blasio, the city mayor, urged them to do so out of concern for racers, spectators and staff. Many horse races are also cancelled. De Blasio announced the cancellation of Ozy Fest, a music and discussion event due for Central Park on Saturday and Sunday, and a moon landing anniversary celebration meant for Times Square. The National Weather Service said 167 million people are under a heat advisory or excessive heat warning. David Roth, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said: “It’s very dangerous heat. It’s not just how hot it’s going to get in the day – overnight temperatures are only falling into the mid 70s to low 80s. So the big problem, of course, is going to be urban areas because of the ‘heat islands’ that you get.” De Blasio declared a “local emergency due to the extreme heat” and issued an executive order from 9am Friday to 11.59pm Sunday that orders tall office buildings to raise their thermostats to 78F to conserve energy, and encouraged residents to raise theirs. Utility giant Con Edison said it has put 4,000 workers on extra shifts following last weekend’s power outage that plunged much of Manhattan into darkness. June was the hottest month in history – a record that could be broken by July. A new study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found the number of extremely hot days in the US could more than double as the impact of the climate crisis is felt. Experts warned that heatwaves are likely to become common as global heating increases their strength and likelihood, with their impact felt by millions of Americans and by agriculture. Deke Arndt, chief of the monitoring branch for National Centres for Environmental Information, said: “That’s what’s happening. And indeed, if that’s what plays out over this coming several days, that kind of reinforces that statistical pattern.” He added: “The long-term increase in these dimensions of heatwaves is directly related to global warming.”"
"Our political system has been hijacked by a cabal of ideologically driven free marketeers with no democratic mandate. Air pollution and climate change, the two most urgent issues confronting society, are nowhere mentioned in the bubbles of bombastic rhetoric generated by our new prime minister. Boris Johnson’s main contribution to air quality as mayor of London was to cancel the western extension of the congestion zone. As for climate change, he presided over a 60% reduction in climate attaches as foreign secretary and subsequently accepted an expenses-paid trip to the US courtesy of the American Enterprise Institute, a fossil-fuel supporting free-market thinktank partially funded by the Koch brothers. I no longer recognise our leadership as embodying British values. I feel I’m living in a foreign dictatorship consumed by profit and self-interest.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the Planet • Your article (Ofgem is out of touch with environmental priorities, say UK’s business leaders, 22 July) ignores the fact that Ofgem’s principal duty, enshrined in statute, is to protect the interests of energy consumers both now and in the future, including from damaging climate change by reducing greenhouse gases. Ofgem’s regulation of Britain’s energy networks has facilitated the huge expansion of renewable electricity generation over the last decade, and we are working with the government and other stakeholders to help decarbonise how we heat our homes, businesses and transport, particularly through electric vehicles.  This month Ofgem published its new corporate vision, which set out our objective of helping decarbonise the economy at the lowest cost to consumers in support of the recently passed legislation enshrining in law the target of net zero carbon emissions for the UK by 2050. Ultimately government is responsible for setting the policy for the energy sector and proposing any changes to Ofgem’s statutory framework.Dermot NolanChief executive, Ofgem • Ian McNicholas (Letters, 24 July) suggests we need a new home once this planet becomes uninhabitable for humans. Why? What is so important about the (often deeply unpleasant) human race that it needs to be continued past its evolutionary sell-by date? What gives us the right for permanence in a constantly changing universe? Any regrets about the extinction of life on Earth might be directed at non-human life, which has at least not accelerated its own demise. Let us not cry for the end of the human race, which exists in the blink of an eye compared with the lifespan and enormity of the universe.

It’s an alarm call, 25 July) but there are worse concerns. As ice sheets melt, they reflect less solar energy, the exposed darker surfaces absorb more heat and previously frozen trapped gases escape. The effects spread to permafrost and could easily swamp even major reductions from human activities. If this seems over-pessimistic, consider how Arctic temperatures have recently soared despite few of the obvious sources of human emissions. One potential solution involves geoengineering to limit solar input above the poles, with some methods mimicking how debris from volcanic eruptions can block sunlight. I mentioned this option to the Department of Energy and Climate Change; they helpfully gave me more details of such methods but then, despite allowing fracking, told me the idea was too risky.

By Kenneth Richard
While many scientists are projecting rapid sea level rise as a result of a warmer Antarctica and consequent ice sheet melting, other scientists are projecting that the surface of the Antarctic ice sheet will gain in mass because a warmer Antarctica means snow and ice accumulation will outpace the melting.

Antarctica ice mass growing. Photo: NASA-JPL, public domain.
For example, Jan Lenaerts and 4 other scientists recently published a paper in the journal Climate Dynamics that projects (via modelling) the Antarctic ice sheet will show a net gain of about 70 billion tons of ice per year for every degree of warming induced by anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Below are the highlighted portions of the Lenaerts et al. (2016) paper.
We present climate and surface mass balance (SMB) of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) as simulated by the global, coupled ocean–atmosphere–land Community Earth System Model (CESM) with a horizontal resolution of ∼1∘ in the past, present and future (1850–2100). CESM correctly simulates present-day Antarctic sea ice extent, large-scale atmospheric circulation and near-surface climate, but fails to simulate the recent expansion of Antarctic sea ice. The present-day Antarctic ice sheet SMB equals 2280±131 Gtyear−1, which concurs with existing independent estimates of AIS SMB. When forced by two CMIP5 climate change scenarios (high mitigation scenario RCP2.6 and high-emission scenario RCP8.5), CESM projects an increase of Antarctic ice sheet SMB of about 70 Gtyear−1 per degree warming. This increase is driven by enhanced snowfall, which is partially counteracted by more surface melt and runoff along the ice sheet’s edges. This intensifying hydrological cycle is predominantly driven by atmospheric warming, which increases (1) the moisture-carrying capacity of the atmosphere, (2) oceanic source region evaporation, and (3) summer AIS cloud liquid water content.”
This warming-causes-ice-sheet-growth-and-sea-levels-to-decline conceptualization is not new. Back in the mid-1980s, when the Greenland ice sheet was still in a cooling phase, Dr. R.K. Klige (USSR Academy of Sciences), concluded that a future rise in temperatures would cause a positive mass balance for both Greenland and Antarctica and “ultimately a lowering of sea level” due to the “increased accumulation on the major ice sheets.” Here is the abstract with key points of emphasis from Klige, 1985.
The author attempts to quantify the amount of water released (by various means) by the world’s glaciers, and to determine the variations in these figures provoked by the warming trend which was observed for the first half of this century, and the cooling trend observed in the 1960s and 1970s. Unfortunately Antarctica has generally had to be excluded from these calculations since data on a number of components of the water balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet are simply not available. Perhaps most significant are the author’s predictions that the anticipated future rise in air temperatures will provoke increased precipitation and hence increased accumulation on the major ice sheets. Even despite increased melting in coastal areas of Greenland and Antarctica the net effect will be a positive mass balance and ultimately a lowering of sea level.”
Observations defy the models
Not only is the Antarctic ice sheet growing in mass and lowering sea levels in modelled projections, it is doing so in observational studies. According to NASA and Zwally et al. (2015), during the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century (1992-2008), the gains in ice accumulation in East Antarctica outstripped the losses in West Antarctica, leading to a net gain of about 100 billion tons of ice per year on the Antarctic ice sheet during this period.

During the last 6 years of the study, the net gain in ice removed -0.23 mm per year from sea levels. The total sea level lowering equivalent was -0.28 mm per year when including the 1992-2001 rates of net ice gain for Antarctica. It should be pointed out that, unlike Lenaert  et al. (2016), Dr. Zwally (and co-authors) prefer to believe in different models that say future warming on the Antarctic continent will produce a net ice sheet loss rather than an ice sheet mass gain. Below are excerpts  from NASA’s press release for the paper.
According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008. […] Zwally’s team calculated that the mass gain from the thickening of East Antarctica remained steady from 1992 to 2008 at 200 billion tons per year, while the ice losses from the coastal regions of West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula increased by 65 billion tons per year. […] ‘The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away,’ Zwally said.”
But it might only take a few decades for Antarctica’s growth to reverse, according to Zwally. ‘If the losses of the Antarctic Peninsula and parts of West Antarctica continue to increase at the same rate they’ve been increasing for the last two decades, the losses will catch up with the long-term gain in East Antarctica in 20 or 30 years — I don’t think there will be enough snowfall increase to offset these losses.'”
Settled science?
So, according to scientists and climate modelling, we have good news from Antarctica. Warming from a rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions causes the Antarctic ice sheet to grow, and this lowers sea levels. In the future, we can expect that more warming due to human activity will cause more ice sheet growth and a further reduction in the Antarctic contribution to sea levels.
And if those models are not preferred, one can believe in the models that say warming from a rise in anthropogenic CO2 causes the Antarctic ice sheet to melt, and this, in turn, will cause sea levels to rise.
Unfortunately, the RSS satellite temperature dataset indicates that Antarctica and the South Polar region has not warmed in the satellite era, but has instead cooled slightly in the last 3 and a half decades.
Therefore, it appears we will have to patiently wait for Antarctica to actually warm due to the increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
If Antarctica does warm in the future, perhaps then we can see which of these projections  — (a) anthropogenic CO2 warming causes ice sheet net growth or (b) anthropogenic CO2 warming causes ice sheet net decline — become settled science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe website of flagship ZDF German public television here writes a very short, well-buried report on a recent fast-track ruling by a German court in Arnsberg concerning the approval of a wind park project in Central Germany. The court found that wind turbines do in fact severely blight the natural landscape and therefore may not be built in areas of particular beauty.
The ruling is the latest development in the rapidly growing public resistance to wind power by German citizens, thus posing another major obstacle for the approval and construction of onshore wind turbines.
The WDR writes:
The case involves 7 turbines, each 200 meters tall, which were slated to be installed at Fischelbach/Sohl in Bad Laasphe. The district of Siegen-Wittgenstein had originally approved them. But the court countered, saying the turbines would lead to a disfigurement of the natural scenery and that the impacted area of the scenic Wittgensteiner region is under protection.”
Recently the German public has been waking up to the host of problems that industrial wind parks bring with them: blighted landscapes, health problems from infrasound, unstable power supply, hazard to birdlife, and deforestation. Wind turbines also have high maintenance costs and short lifespans. The result is high costs to consumers with no benefit to the environment.
150 angry citizens protest wind park in Elpe
Meanwhile the WAZ daily here reports that 150 angry residents turned out to protest plans to install 7 large wind turbines in the area under the motto: “Stop the madness!” It was the first protest the town had seen, and is a loud signal that the public is getting fed up.
Vermont banned billboards already back in 1968
While on the subject of blighted natural scenery, website twistedsifter.com here tells us why Vermont banned billboards way back in 1968: To protect Vermont’s natural beauty. It seems that Vermont environmentalists have forgotten this. Today the state is pushing for the installation of monster industrial turbines atop it’s idyllic rolling green hills.
I hope you enjoy the lovely photos of Vermont scenery, which today is under the threat of industrialization and destruction.

Spring has definitely arrived late this year. Fortunately that is about to change as warm temperatures are forecast for upcoming long holiday weekend.
Germany’s DWD national weather service has published the preliminary weather results for Germany for the month of April 2016. Data recorded by its approximately 2000 weather stations placed across the country show that the month was 0.3°C cooler than the 1981 – 2010 long-term meteorological mean.
The month started on the warm side, but the second half deteriorated as air Arctic plunged across the country, delivering unexpected late April snows and frosty .conditions.
Yesterday, May 1st, even saw half a meter of fresh snow at the Northern Italian Prali Ski Area!

The bitter cold has hit southern Germany’s winemakers hard, so reports the online SWR here:
The cold nights of the past week have damaged the blossoms of the vineyeards across vast areas of Rhineland Palatinate. In unfavorable areas massive losses are feared.”
Precipitation for April 2016, the DWD reports, was exactly normal with 58 liters of precipitation falling per square meter. All in all April was an entirely a normal one with no sign of any climate change. If anything, it was right colder than it is supposed to be.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLittle surprise here: A new paper published by Climate of the Past journal shows that solar cycles indeed play a dominant role on climate change. I touched on this already once before, here. Here’s the front page of the study:

Contrary to what popular science is telling us today, this paper tells us we need to be worried about cooling for the next 65 years….possibly even down to 1870s levels! The abstract (my emphasis):
A large number of investigations of paleoclimate have noted the influence of a 200 year oscillation which has been related to the De Vries/Suess cycle of solar activity. As such studies were concerned mostly with local climate, we
 have used extensive northern hemispheric proxy data sets of Büntgen and of Christiansen/Ljungqvist together with a southern hemispheric tree-ring set, all with 1 year time resolution, to analyze the climate influence of the solar cycle. As there is increasing interest in temperature rise rates, as opposed to present absolute
temperatures, we have analyzed temperature differences over 100 years to shed light on climate dynamics of at least the last 2500 years. Fourier- and Wavelet transforms as well as nonlinear optimization to sine functions show the dominance of the 200 year cycle. The sine wave character of the climate oscillations permits an approximate prediction of the near future climate.”
Figure 1 of the study below shows the global overview of the proxies used in the study, and thus serve to refute claims the study results are only local in nature:

The study looks back 2500 years, and takes a global look. A thorough analysis of the multiple proxies led the authors to find the very pronounced 200-year De Vries/Suess solar cycle. In the discussion part of the paper the authors write:
The Earth’s climate shows a rather regular oscillation of  200 year period during the last millennia. However, frequency, phase, and strength of the oscillation are found to vary in different time series of temperatures and for different times (see Figs. 4–6, and 8). Nonetheless, the relative historic stability of the cycle suggests that the periodic nature of the climate will persist also for the foreseeable future.”
So what will this cycle bring us in the future?
Of course it is not possible to extrapolate directly as the authors hint above. Later in the paper they point out that the cycle is impacted by “terrestrial activities” which “can dominate the solar activity temporarily, e.g. disrupting the sine-like oscillations“. But for the most part, the cycle is likely a reliable indicator of what to expect ahead on decadal timescales. The authors write of the 200 year cycle:
It gives correctly the 1850–1900 temperature minimum and shows a temperature drop from present to AD 2080, the latter comparable with the minimum of 1870, as already predicted in the studies (Steinhilber and Beer, 2013; Liu et al., 2011) on the grounds of solar activity data alone.”
You may want to hold back on purchasing land along Greenland’s coastline, unless that is you or your kids plan to be selling glacial ice in the decades ahead. The warming we saw during the 20th century appears to be in large part caused by the 200-year cycle. But now the peak is behind us. The paper warns that we need to expect cooling over the next 65 years!

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s DWD national weather service has released the preliminary mean temperature for the country for January, 2016.
The data show the month was 1.2°C above the long-term mean.
So far the European winter has been a mild one – thanks to a persistent mild weather pattern that has brought warm and moist Atlantic air over the continent most of the time since early November. That pattern led to December 2015 setting an all-time record for the month for Germany. In January the westerly pattern go interrupted twice by polar air.
Overall the DWD remains silent on the overall trend. The January mean temperature trend continues downward. It’s not warming; it is cooling as the chart prepared by Josef Kowatsch shows:

The chart shows the temperature anomaly from the long-term mean since 1988.
And despite the current massive El Nino, meteorologist Joe Bastardi shows at his weekly Saturday Summary that globally January temperatures failed to set a new record, according to what Joe calls the gold standard for measuring global temperature, NCEP. The month so far is coming in at 0.556°C above the mean.

Warm, but not the warmest. January 2016Source: here:
What’s more, Tony Heller at Real Science here shows us that NASA has been busy rewriting history by adjusting past temperatures data. Back in the 1970s, NASA data were showing a rapid cooling since the 1940s. Over the past years NASA has been busily rewriting the data, and consequently the mid 20th century cooling has disappeared, á la George Orwell.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a recently published study on spring leaf unfolding appearing in Nature a team of scientists led by Fu et al found that spring leaves on trees in Europe are in fact not unfolding much earlier – as we should expect in these times of “global warming”.
Hat-tip: Der Standard
The abstract excerpt of the paper (emphasis added):
Using long-term in situ observations of leaf unfolding for seven dominant European tree species at 1,245 sites, here we show that the apparent response of leaf unfolding to climate warming (ST, expressed in days advance of leaf unfolding per °C warming) has significantly decreased from 1980 to 2013 in all monitored tree species. Averaged across all species and sites, ST decreased by 40% from 4.0 ± 1.8 days °C−1 during 1980–1994 to 2.3 ± 1.6 days °C−1 during 1999–2013. The declining ST was also simulated by chilling-based phenology models, albeit with a weaker decline (24–30%) than observed in situ. The reduction in ST is likely to be partly attributable to reduced chilling. Nonetheless, other mechanisms may also have a role, such as ‘photoperiod limitation’ mechanisms that may become ultimately limiting when leaf unfolding dates occur too early in the season. Our results provide empirical evidence for a declining ST, but also suggest that the predicted strong winter warming in the future may further reduce ST and therefore result in a slowdown in the advance of tree spring phenology.
Strong winter warming?
So why is leaf unfolding not happening as early as expected? The authors here appear to be baffled and thus are left speculating and offering adventurous explanations. Maybe they ought just take a look at the temperature trends for spring and winter in Europe. If they did so, they would find that winters and early springtime have gotten COLDER over the past couple of decades, and not warmer as the authors seem to believe.
Back in early April I posted on this here. Winters have not been warming and spring has been in fact delayed. Spring flowers have also been found to be blossoming later.
For example an analysis by Kowatsch and Kämpfe using data from Germany’s DWD national weather services for the month of March in Germany over the past 26 years shows a pronounced cooling trend:

//-->




 March mean temperature for Germany has fallen more than a degree Celsius over the last 27 years.
That would hardly promote earlier leaf unfolding. The same is true for the February trend over the past 22 years:

The 22-year February trend for Germany also shows a marked decline in temperature. Cold weather acts to delay the onset of spring.
Little wonder leaves aren’t unfolding earlier. The Kowatsch and Kämpfe summarize:
Winter and pre-spring have gotten somewhat cooler since the late 1980s, especially February. The temperature trend lines are negative. Therefore the start of spring is currently being delayed and is coming later than the relatively warm 1990s.”
Austrian and German winters have also gotten COLDER over the past 25 years, read here and here.
Moreover the European Alps have gotten “considerably colder” over the last 26 years. Also read here. It’s truly stunning that the authors seemingly never bothered to look at the temperature trends.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi at his Weatherbell Analytics presents an excellent Saturday Summary that looks back at earlier El Nino events.
Today’s El Nino is being hyped and many are preparing to say that July 2015 will be among the warmest, if not the warmest, on record.

Chart: NCEP
However the veteran meteorologist tells us in the video that according to NCEP at least 9 other Julys have been warmer, among them: 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2009.
According to NCEP, which Joe Bastardi calls the gold standard of temperature because it is based on real time measurement, comes in at 0.145°C anomaly.
What happens after the current El Nino will tell us a lot about the global warming trend, Bastardi says. Should the subsequent La Nina come in cooler than the previous ones, then global warmists will have a tough time explaining it.
Joe reaffirms that he thinks that the globe will cool modestly by 2030 and that the sun and oceans play a far greater role in climate than CO2 does.
But when it comes to the sun’s impact on global temperature he cautions that some are putting too much emphasis on solar cycles and that the coming low solar activity cycles will not play that large a role.
“The heat is not going to get erased by 3 sunspot cycles.”

"The chief executive of the world’s largest mining company has endorsed drastic action to combat global warming, which he calls “indisputable”, and an emerging crisis. “The planet will survive. Many species may not,” the BHP chief executive officer, Andrew Mackenzie, told a business breakfast in London on Tuesday. “This is a confronting conclusion but as a veteran geologist once said, ‘you can’t argue with a rock’.”  Mackenzie endorsed carbon pricing but said it was not enough to combat the looming threat of mass extinctions and major sea rises. He announced BHP was spending $US400m ($A570m) to create a climate investment program to reduce emissions from its own operations as well as those generated from its resources. BHP has been working to reduce its emissions since the 1990s but still directly produced 16.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in the 2017/18 fiscal year, mostly from energy and diesel use at its operations. That’s the equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 3.5m cars or 4.2 coal-fired power stations for a year, according to a calculator on the US Environmental Protection Agency’s website. But when one adds to the equation customers’ use of BHP’s products – most notably the processing of iron ore and the burning of coal and crude oil – BHP’s indirect emissions dwarfed that, totalling 596.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide for the fiscal year. That’s equivalent of the emissions produced in a year by 126m cars or 153 coal-fired power plants, according to the EPA calculator. “Use of emissions-intensive products from the resource industry have contributed significantly to global warming,” Mackenzie said, while noting that BHP’s emissions in 2017 were less than those in 2006. BHP has a short-term goal to cap 2022 emissions at 2017 levels, and a long-term goal of achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century. It is also strengthening the link between emissions performance and executive renumeration from 2021, and has invested $6m in Carbon Engineering Limited, a Canadian company focused on developing ways to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Mackenzie said that “like most scientists” he believes that global warming will tend to the upper end of forecasts, while conceding there was a chance it would not. But he said prudent risk management meant BHP was planning to protect against the downside. Global warming required a “coordinated global response” and no single solution could combat it, Mackenzie said . “While we endorse a carbon price this is not enough in isolation.” Electric vehicles, renewables, reforestation and replacing single-use plastics all have trade-offs, such as simply moving fossil fuel emissions up the chain if energy production is not also decarbonised. “An ‘all of the above’ solution barely gets us there,” Mackenzie said. “All emitters, resource companies, customers, consumers must play their part together with governments to meet the climate challenge.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterPaul Dorian of the excellent weather science site Vencore Weather here brings us up to date on the latest on one of the most powerful natural cycles driving our North Atlantic climate: North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) cycles.
Here I’ll sum up the main points. Of course do read the entire post at Vencore for all the details.
In a nutshell the sites writes that the North Atlantic “is now showing signs of a possible long-term shift back to colder-than-normal sea surface temperatures (SST) and this could have serious implications on US climate and sea ice areal extent in the Northern Hemisphere”.
Vencore supplies the following chart of North Atlantic heat content (0 – 700 meters deep):



Global monthly heat content anomaly (GJ/m2) in the uppermost 700 m of the North Atlantic since January 1955. The thick line represents the simple running 37-month (c. 3 year) average. Data source: National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), climate4you.com. Last period shown: October-December 2015.


The next chart Vencore provides below is one of Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) since the 1870s.
Clearly we see that huge climate driver has been cyclic and that the past 20 years have been marked by very warm SSTs.

Little wonder the North Atlantic region has been seen warmer than normal conditions over the past 2 decades.
But that warmth appears to be waning as the North Atlantic is now heading toward its cool phase. That cooling down is confirmed by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC).  Note how the transitions take place quickly, in a matter of just a few years.
Serious impacts on sea ice and winters
Vencore writes that the North Atlantic cooling is likely going to have some “significant impacts on Northern Hemisphere (NH) sea ice areal extent over the coming decades“, and thus could be a major blow to climate science forecasts of a melting Arctic. If the North Atlantic cooling continues, then Vencore warns we should expect Arctic sea ice to return to 1990s levels, if not even greater.
The cooling North Atlantic will also have serious ramifications for North America’s climate. Vencore reports that winters over large parts of North America are much colder during cool North Atlantic phases, and significantly warmer during the warm phases. So if these trends should continue, it means that the days of the global warming scare are numbered, or they will have to move to the other hemisphere.

"Extreme climate events such as heatwaves, floods and drought damaged 45% of the marine ecosystems along Australia’s coast in a seven-year period, CSIRO research shows. More than 8,000km of Australia’s coast was affected by extreme climate events from 2011 to 2017, and in some cases they caused irreversible changes to marine habitats.  The study collated all the published research by leading scientists, who have examined the effects of marine heatwaves, heavy rainfall from tropical storms, cyclones and droughts on coral, kelp, mangrove and seagrass communities. It paints a bigger picture of the extent to which the climate crisis is fuelling widespread change across Australia’s marine ecosystems. The study found that big climate events were exacerbating the effects of human-induced climate change. Heatwaves, for example, compounded the effects of the underlying global heating trend and left little time for organisms to adapt. “All of the people around the country working on these systems for years have done a great job of documenting the impacts and repercussions,” Russ Babcock, the study’s lead author, said. “If you stand back and have a look at how many [climate events] have happened between that period of 2011 to 2017, it really backs up that it’s not just the Great Barrier Reef that we have to think about. It’s all around the country.” The team of scientists looked at events, including the 2011 marine heatwave in Western Australia, cyclone Yasi, the back-to-back mass bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, and the mangrove dieback in the Gulf of Carpentaria in 2015-16. They also examined what the longer term repercussions of these events could be, given some areas had shown little, if any, sign of recovery. “Some of our models showed it can take 15 years to recover from impacts like this,” Babcock said, noting that during that timeframe it was likely that more extreme events would occur. He cited the large areas off the Western Australia coast where kelp canopies had not recovered since the 2011 marine heatwave. Babcock said the long-term effects of such events affected other species, such as large animals that fed off sea grasses, which could lead to changes in the composition of entire marine communities. “So things that we value about those habitats – the diversity of plants and animals there and the amount of things like fisheries you can harvest from them – can be affected,” he said. “I think one of the important things is going to be to study the factors that make a difference in terms of the recovery of these habitats and therefore learn what we might be able to do to help them recover more quickly.”  Coral reef scientist Terry Hughes is one of the researchers whose work was referenced in the CSIRO study. Hughes said the paper showed how serious the outlook was for all marine systems, not just coral reefs, which typically received more public attention. “Other marine systems – kelps, seagrasses, mangroves – are just as vulnerable as reefs but they’re not the poster child,” he said. “I wasn’t surprised ... but it’s good to have the big picture and make the point that it’s a huge issue for all coastal areas of Australia. It’s not just a Barrier Reef issue.”"
"About 350m trees have been planted in a single day in Ethiopia, according to a government minister. The planting is part of a national “green legacy” initiative to grow 4bn trees in the country this summer by encouraging every citizen to plant at least 40 seedlings. Public offices have reportedly been shut down in order for civil servants to take part. The project aims to tackle the effects of deforestation and climate change in the drought-prone country. According to the UN, Ethiopia’s forest coverage was just 4% in the 2000s, down from 35% a century earlier. Ethiopia’s minister of innovation and technology, Dr Getahun Mekuria, tweeted estimates of the number of trees planted throughout the day. By early evening on Monday, he put the number at 353m. The previous world record for the most trees planted in one day stood at 50m, held by India since 2016. Dr Dan Ridley-Ellis, the head of the centre for wood science and technology at Edinburgh Napier University, said: “Trees not only help mitigate climate change by absorbing the carbon dioxide in the air, but they also have huge benefits in combating desertification and land degradation, particularly in arid countries. They also provide food, shelter, fuel, fodder, medicine, materials and protection of the water supply. “This truly impressive feat is not just the simple planting of trees, but part of a huge and complicated challenge to take account of the short- and long-term needs of both the trees and the people. The forester’s mantra ‘the right tree in the right place’ increasingly needs to consider the effects of climate change, as well as the ecological, social, cultural and economic dimension.”"
"Your editorial (If organised mainstream Christianity is on the way out, what will replace it?, 16 July) poses a question of profound importance concerning the kind of society and culture we hope our grandchildren’s children will live in. Perhaps a hint of the direction of travel is to be found on the letters page (13 July), where the Director of Cafod (Catholic Agency for Overseas Development) describes recent practical action and political campaigning by thousands of members of faith communities who, in face of the climate emergency and the threat of ecological collapse, “hear the cry of the earth, and of the poor who experience the injustice of climate change”. She cites the spiritual leader of the largest Christian community, Pope Francis, who in Laudato Si’: On Care for Our Common Home, his 2015 message to the peoples of the world made clear that the mission of the church now includes an urgent priority to support efforts to prevent further environmental deterioration and to achieve a sustainable lifestyle. Developments in the academic fields of ecology and religion and “spiritual environmentalism”, especially in North America, give an advance glimpse of a future in which humankind rediscovers our capacity to wonder at the “sacred” mystery of the emergence and evolution of life in the universe, and reinstates our neglected relationship with the natural world on which our survival as a species ultimately depends. Perhaps an “eco-theology” is the future to which the last 2,000 years of history have been pointing?Michael BarrettOxford  • That organised religion continues to decline is tough news for the faithful few, but the bigger question is how do we evaluate such facts? Is life in Britain better for all because not so many go to church, synagogue or mosque? Or is that question also too simple when we can all see that there is good and bad in all faiths and in those who are not religious? Guardian readers will also know that more people read the tabloids and the rightwing press than the Guardian. Is the value of everything to be determined by a show of hands or would God still care about us even if more and more people are unaware of Him? And do we still believe in the Guardian because of its simple faith that facts are sacred and better than fake news if it is not popular to say so?Rev Dr Donald NorwoodOxford • Humanism certainly has the potential to fill the gap left by organised religion with a robust grounding in moral philosophies stretching back to the Greeks, via the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and modern British philosophy (something we should be proud of). Although only about 6% of UK adults identified as “humanist” in a 2014 YouGov poll, 36% said they shared humanist values. However, humanism faces an uphill struggle when the government insists on funding yet more single-religion faith schools. I only discovered humanism in my 50s. Nobody ever told me about humanism at school – a situation I am trying to remedy through school volunteering for Humanists UK. As to whether irreligion should be “organised”, the established religions have amply demonstrated that such organisations are more concerned with their own survival than the welfare of their participants. It seems unlikely to me that young people will turn back to such outdated institutions when they have failed to provide global leadership on the pressing issues of inequality, human rights and climate destruction. Hopefully, the next generation will learn to think for themselves and become capable of recognising that it is the responsibility of humans alone to make the world a better place.Richard GilyeadSaffron Walden, Essex • By far the biggest factor in the long-term decline of organised religion in western Europe has been the rise of moral autonomy. Attitudes to same-sex marriage, homosexuality, women’s rights, abortion and assisted suicide have shifted in a generation. There has been a groundswell of public opinion in favour of more liberal approaches towards the rights and freedoms of the individual. The result is religion-free morals. Three things only remain to be dealt with. The Church of England remains the established religion, automatic places are granted to 26 Anglican bishops in the House of Lords, and the state funds religious groups to run discriminatory schools that inculcate children with their beliefs.Doug ClarkCurrie, Midlothian • Your leader comments on the latest BSA survey and the continuing decline in organised religion, not least in the Church of England. On Sunday last, in most mainstream churches, the gospel story of the good Samaritan will have been read. Here is a story familiar and indeed loved by most of the population of non-churchgoers and believers alike. The outsider who shows love and compassion is exalted above the representatives of organised religion whose rules forbade them risking being in contact with the man lying in the gutter. Jesus preferred love in action to “good religion”, with its rules about who was (and was not) included in the household of God. Organised religion – “Church”– might still need to learn the lesson that its founder seems to have wanted people to be more compassionate, not more religious. Let’s strive for goodness in our present society and perhaps godliness will follow.Rev Adrian AlkerChair, Progressive Christianity Network Britain • It is very surprising that your editorial makes no reference to agnosticism, the conviction that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God. Is its omission part of human arrogance?Tom SwallowKenilworth, Warwickshire • Your editorial notes that the latest British Social Attitudes survey records just 1% of under-24s now identifying as Anglican. This statistic alone shows what nonsense it is that the Church of England can still be regarded and treated as the “established” church, yet 26 seats in the House of Lords are reserved for its archbishops and senior bishops. I think Iran is the only other country whose legislature grants such privileges to the leaders of its state religion. We still like to present ourselves as a “modern democracy” – hoping others don’t notice this anomaly (or the 92 hereditary members of the House of Lords).John BoalerCalne, Wiltshire guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"The first of Iceland’s 400 glaciers to be lost to the climate crisis will be remembered with a memorial plaque – and a sombre warning for the future – to be unveiled by scientists and local people next month. The former Okjökull glacier, which a century ago covered 15 sq km (5.8 sq miles) of mountainside in western Iceland and measured 50 metres thick, has shrunk to barely 1 sq km of ice less than 15 metres deep and lost its status as a glacier.  Researchers from Rice University in Houston, Texas, a leading Icelandic author, Andri Snær Magnason, and the geologist Oddur Sigurðsson will lead the unveiling ceremony at the site in Borgarfjörður on 18 August, local media said. “In the next 200 years, all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path,” the plaque reads, in Icelandic and English. “This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.” The memorial is dated August 2019 and also carries the words “415ppm CO2”, referring to the record-breaking level of 415 parts per million of carbon dioxide recorded in the atmosphere in May this year. A glacier is defined as a persistent mass of compacted ice that accumulates more mass each winter than it loses through summer melt and is constantly moving under its own weight. When this ceases to be the case, the remains are known as “dead ice”. Cymene Howe, an associate professor of anthropology at Rice, said the plaque “would be the first to a glacier lost to climate change anywhere in the world”. Marking the moment should draw attention to what is being lost, she said. With her colleague Dominic Boyer, Howe has been studying the economic and cultural impact of global heating and ice shrinkage on Icelandic communities. “These bodies of ice are the largest freshwater reserves on the planet,” she said. “Frozen within them are histories of the atmosphere. They are also often important cultural forms that are full of significance.” Boyer said Okjökull’s fate “will be shared by all of Iceland’s glaciers unless we act now to radically curtail greenhouse gas emissions”. The far north of the globe has been warming twice as fast as the rest, helping this June become the hottest ever recorded. Scientists have said a sharp rise in Arctic temperatures is inevitable, potentially creating a climate “tipping point”. With the former mayor of Reykjavik Jón Gnarr, the two US researchers produced a documentary, Not Ok, about the glacier’s disappearance last year, in an effort to show how the climate crisis is affecting ordinary people’s lives. “An Icelandic colleague said: ‘Memorials are not for the dead; they are for the living,’” Howe said. “We want to underscore that it is up to us, the living, to respond to the rapid loss of glaciers and the ongoing impacts of climate change. For Ok glacier it is already too late.”"
"Britain’s first climate assembly has agreed on 17 proposals for action to tackle the climate crisis, including installing solar panels on all available roofs and cutting fossil fuels out of local government developments. The assembly, convened by Camden council in north London, brought together more than 50 residents and a team of climate experts to develop proposals that could be taken up by the council to reduce carbon emissions and increase sustainability.  The proposals focused on housing, transport and green space, and included a community energy scheme to remove fossil fuels from home heating, widespread cycle lanes and car-free zones, and programmes to ensure that all new homes in Camden are built carbon-neutral. The group also recommended that community input on the crisis become permanent, calling for a climate emergency group made up of experts and residents to be set up to oversee the shift to eco-friendly initiatives. Suggestions came from across the community, with local businesses and institutions such as the Roundhouse, British Museum and University College Hospital collaborating to address Camden’s carbon footprint. Residents, workers and commuters contributed more than 600 ideas through an online platform. Tim Hughes, the director of Involve, a public participation charity that facilitated the event, said demand for citizens assemblies had surged in the past year. “They’re really good processes for dealing with conflict and contested opinions on issues, and really help to bridge some of the divides we’re seeing in democracy and politics at the moment,” he said. Last month the House of Commons announced plans to hold its own climate assembly to inform government policymaking. A representative from the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, Chris Shaw, attended the Camden event to learn about the process and its potential for Westminster. Farhana Yamin, who as a board member of Greenpeace UK and a Camden resident was observing proceedings, said: “Many of the problems that we’ve had on the climate and issues such as Brexit are because decision-making has been too remote and citizens haven’t had enough of a say. “It’s ironic that the theme of Brexit was ‘take back control’ but actually this is what taking back control really looks like in practice – it’s citizens being given the information and being asked to decide.” Members of the assembly were broadly positive about the process. Anna Pick, 23, a researcher, said: “The process of engaging people with the council, making people feel that they’re a bit more empowered at the community level, making people get together and talk to each other, I think those are all really powerful things.I feel much more optimistic about Camden council’s power to do things and my ability to shape what they do.” Climate Emergency Camden, a group of residents, called on the council to take meaningful action on the proposals, warning that some residents were cynical about the impact of the process. Their concern was echoed by many members of the assembly. “There will be a lot of very good ideas suggested by people, but the crucial thing is that these ideas will be acted upon rather than be forgotten. It’s very important that they’re followed up and put into practice,” said Hamid Reza Aghaei, an Iranian refugee living in Camden. The council leader, Georgia Gould, emphasised her commitment to doing so. “We declared a climate emergency and that can’t just be a statement or a piece of paper, it has to be real action,” she said. Councils are embracing people power to take on the #ClimateEmergency while national govt flounders. Today Camden citizens are making recommendations for new climate action plan to take us to a zero carbon future, reported by @markriceoxley69 in @guardian https://t.co/oc4lVp3DZU pic.twitter.com/wTbBI8dus8"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe last two posts were getting a lot of traffic, and so yesterday I decided to take the day off and let them run. Today I’m back with the next post, which is also about the wind energy folly.
Resistance to the junk green energy is growing in Germany.
Last month a print edition of Germany’s Braunschweiger Nachrichten featured a commentary by the head of a German wind protest organization, Dr. Thomas Carl Stiller. The title:
“Madness With Wind Turbines”
Hat-tip K.E. Puls, European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE).
In the commentary Stiller says that Germany’s once highly ballyhooed Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) “cannot and will not function“, and what was once only a few single protesters voicing opposition to wind parks, is now an entire nationwide umbrella organization of protest groups against the “subsidy-robbing empire” of wind energy industry.

Stiller describes a technology whose produced energy cannot be stored and which depends on random, unpredictable winds. The technology is so inefficient that builders are now forced to erect 800-foot tall monster size machines in a desperate effort to extract real power. He also writes that “wind energy has done nothing to combat climate change”.
Despite increased wind energy installation, CO2 emissions in Germany have risen. […] Climate protection and reliable power supply by wind turbines installed on the land is thus a lie.”
Stiller also writes that the maximum output of a wind turbine “is far below its rated capacity” and that the German citizenry is paying 20 billion euros annually for a “misconception“. To illustrate the folly of wind energy, Stiller writes that Germans are paying 20 billion euros a year for a commodity that gets sold on the power exchange for only around 2 billion euros.
What’s encouraging is that Stiller writes: “German citizens are waking up to this insanity“. He comments that “wind energy would not be able to supply the country even if the entire country were covered with wind turbines“.
Stiller also calls for more research for the health impacts that wind turbines are having and that the energy source has got to be for the good of the public and not profit a few opportunists. He adds:
Us organized citizens are demanding independent feasibility studies and calling for more transparency during the planning process and that man and nature be put back in the focus.”

"Buckle in, Britain: it might have been late getting started, but it looks like we’re set for another sweltering summer, with record-breaking highs of 37C forecast for Thursday. By this point, you know the drill: swap the duvet for a sheet (and a shared bed for a single), wear shorts if your employer allows, carry water with you on the train, and get off at the next stop if you’re feeling unwell. The temperature will drop eventually; in the meantime, the spirit is broadly one of keep calm and carry on. We’ve been here before. Last year was marked not just by England’s rocket-fuelled run through the football World Cup, but the concurrent six-week spell from late June to mid-August, when daytime temperatures in parts of Britain consistently topped 30C (86F). Even climate deniers were perturbed. That summer was  the joint hottest on record. But then the mercury dropped, bringing with it relief – from the discomfort of the sweltering heat, yes, but also having to confront the visceral threat of climate crisis.  In Britain we are lucky. Our temperate climate has given us the option of ignorance for so long. In Australia, Asia and the Middle East, the apocalyptic vision that the Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts and I described in our piece on “the city at 50C” is already a reality. Britain is not immune. Exactly one year ago the Met Office issued a heatwave warning on the hottest day of 2018 – but for many, the arrival of autumn quite literally took the heat out of the issue. We can’t afford to let that happen again – to let it keep happening. We cannot slide into record-breaking summer after record-breaking summer, sedating ourselves with Mr Whippy ice-cream, until the crisis reaches a point where it will occur to no one to suggest a lower-tog duvet as the solution. When we talk of these ever-increasing temperatures, we tend to talk of treating the symptoms, not the cause: wear breathable fibres, freeze your water bottle, head to a beer garden. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change. Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America. When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage. Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK, it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather. The trouble is – unless you are elderly or otherwise already vulnerable – it is just so easy, even enjoyable, to weather the hot temperatures. You raise your hemlines, you buy a fan, then the temperature drops and the fan goes away until next year. The problem of heat is, to a large extent, swept from view with the change of the seasons (or what passes for them these days). But – out of sight, maybe out of mind, but very much still the backdrop – the problem continues to grow. Even under the most optimistic predictions for emissions reductions – which it is almost unimaginable that we will be able to achieve – we face many more decades of intense heat. Experts say that almost half the world’s population will be exposed to potentially deadly temperatures for 20 days a year by 2100. We reckon with the flicker of this possibility every summer – nearly 700 more deaths than average were recorded in the 15-day peak of last year’s heatwave in England and Wales – yet we are still slow to act to mitigate those of the future. We continue to build housing designed to keep heat in, creating “death traps in hot weather”, and leave cooling measures to those who can afford them. We privatise precious green spaces that help to reduce the impact of heat and we build with asphalt, brick, concrete and glass, which exacerbate it. We have learned to change our behaviour in response to rising temperatures – lingering in the frozen goods aisle of the supermarket, organising our lives around air conditioning – when what urgently needs to change is the structure of society. Not now – but yesterday. Yes, tackling wider climate change by reducing emissions should be the pre-eminent priority. But – in the knowledge that heatwaves will be worse even under the (unlikely) best-case scenario – at the same time we need to be making practical, structural changes to ease the impact of prolonged periods of extreme temperatures on our systems and society. Introducing measures to protect against overheating in planning regulations would be an obvious step, as would protecting access to green spaces, if not increasing their number. An analysis today from the Office for National Statistics found that there was more concrete than greenery in the average urban residential garden, inevitably compounding the “heat island” effect. For that to happen, we need to keep heat front and centre, even when the weather is cooler; and we must recognise that it can’t be left to individuals to find ways to cope. The issue may recede with the seasons, but it is not going to go away. Look to Asia, Australia and the Middle East for a glimpse of what the future might hold – we may reflect on this period and wonder why we did not act while the sun merely shone. In the meantime, recognise this heat for the harbinger that we know it to be. Feel the sweat drip off your elbows, the heat pummel your skin. It may be uncomfortable now, but it can’t be simply endured for ever. • Elle Hunt is a commissioning editor for Guardian G2"

Unbeknownst to most Mainers, on May 6 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) admitted to introducing Canadian weather stations to dramatically lower Maine’s past temperature averages over a 120-year time period.
In the federal government’s hysteria to preserve the mantra of continuous global warming, NOAA carved out a summed total of more than 2540F from annual mean temperatures of Maine climate past between 1895 and the present.
Shock! NOAA makes southern Maine colder than northern Maine!
NOAA’s computer reprogramming scheme accidentally made southern Maine appear colder than northern Maine. Oops! This serves as yet one more example of fantasy climate manipulation. Common-sense Mainers can verify this at NOAA’s latest website, or see addendum at the end of this report.
Bangor 2015 sees coldest 6-month period on record!
There are several inconvenient truths that fly in the face of NOAA’s altered data. In 2015, Maine’s Penobscot Bay froze completely over for possibly only the sixth time since 1893. The Bangor’s Daily News just reported that Bangor set a record for low temperatures, experiencing a teeth-chattering average of only 340F (approximately 6,023 Heating Degree Days) over the first six months of 2015!
Lewiston likely to break 111-year record
Local Lewiston climate records indicate the southern interior region will likely break a 111-year old climate record established in 1904 of 41.20F.  In the first six months of 2015, Lewiston has recorded 5,368 HDD.  The Lewiston region only requires 3,332 more HDD by December 31, 2015 to break the 111-record old record for cold temperatures.
Recent volcanic eruptions by Iceland’s Bardarbunga (August 16, 2014-March 2, 2015) will continue to have a cooling effect on Maine weather for the balance of 2015 and all of 2016, assuring the likelihood of a climate cooling record this year.  Temperatures could challenge the 1904 Lewiston, Maine record as the coldest year based on local records kept since 1893.

By the spring of 2014, NOAA had eliminated all possibility of Maine establishing cooling climate records (To be explained in an upcoming post). If the Lewiston region were to even hit 41.20F (8,700 HDD), NOAA could proclaim 2015 to be Maine’s 101st warmest year in history.
Mainers urged to dismiss NOAA on energy decisions
Local climate data confirms we have been experiencing regional cooling since 1998. Mainers should be encouraged to insulate and seek less expensive sources of residential and business heating, such as natural gas, heat pumps, geothermal and future technologies associated with thorium and hydrogen.  However, based on NOAA’s revised data, indicating a continuous warming trend, out-of-state lobbyists are encouraging Federal funding of more expensive electric generation with wind and solar.
Corrupted science
In my opinion, NOAA has been corrupted by politicians with expensive climate agendas. Maine decision makers must first verify my claims and upon being proven valid, avoid NOAA climate data for setting present and future energy policy. Until NOAA is purged of corrupted political appointees, it is important to gather climate data from other non-governmental sources to make sound energy decisions.
Addendum
COLOSSAL oops on NOAA’s part.
The information below was taken from NOAA’s climate website found at: www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/true.
Below we entered identical parameters for Maine, 2015 with the exception that the left hand column requests “Statewide” Heating Degree Day (HDD) data whereas the right hand option requests CD2 South Interior Maine Heating Degree Day (HDD). Higher HDD values reflect colder temperatures. Over the last 119 years, NOAA data now indicates southern Maine has brought down Maine temperatures by 109 HDD or about 1/3 0F per year.  This is a colossal error that can only happen with computer algorithm errors.  NOAA, just present us raw, unfiltered data.

========================================
Collapse of the IPCC AGW theory
by Kyoji Kimoto
Dr. Syukuro Manabe was given many prizes for the discovery of greenhouse effect with Fig. 16 in Manabe & Wetherald (1967) utilizing one dimensional radiative convective equilibrium model (1DRCM) with the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5°K/km for the atmospheric CO2 of 300 ppm (1xCO2) and that of 600 ppm (2xCO2).
It gave the zero feedback climate sensitivity CS (FAH) of 1.3°K under the fixed absolute humidity for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2, which was the starting point of the modern anthropogenic global warming (AGW) theory. The Manabe method was followed by Hansen et al. (1981) and Schlesinger (1986) to obtain the similar results that the CS (FAH) is 1.2-1.3°K with the radiative forcing of 4W/m2 for 2xCO2.

Fig. 16 in Manabe & Wetherald (1967)
The lapse rate of 6.5°K/km is defined for 1xCO2 in the U.S. Standard Atmosphere (1962).There is no guarantee, however, that the same lapse rate will be maintained in the perturbed atmosphere with 2xCO2 because it depends on radiation, convection, large scale dynamics and moisture etc. Therefore, the lapse rate for 2xCO2 is a parameter for which a sensitivity analysis is needed. 
From Fig.4 in Manabe & Strickler (1964), below, we can calculate the sensitivity of the surface temperature (Ts) with the variation of lapse rate (LR) in 1DRCM as follows:
Radiative equilibrium     LR=17°K/km   Ts =332°K

Thermal equilibrium      LR=10°K/km    Ts=311°K
Thermal equilibrium      LR=6.5°K/km    Ts=300°K
Sensitivity: dTs/dLR = 3°K/1(K/km) = 0.3°K/0.1(K/km)

Fig. 4 in Manabe & Strickler (1964)

As shown above, the CS (FAH) greatly changes with a minute change of the lapse rate for 2xCO2, while it varies from 4°K/km to 10°K/km generally. Therefore, the CS (FAH) of 1.2-1.3°K is theoretically meaningless in Manabe & Wetherald (1967), Hansen et al. (1981) and Schlesinger (1986), furnishing a theoretical basis to the 14 GCMs studies for the IPCC AR4 in Soden & Held (2006).
Thus, the AGW theory of the IPCC is collapsed due to the lack of parameter sensitivity analysis of the lapse rate for 2xCO2 in the 1DRCM studies with the fixed lase rate assumption of 6.5°K/km for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2.
It is a standard procedure to check the validity of obtained results in scientific studies.
