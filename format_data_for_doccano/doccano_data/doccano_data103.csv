"Despite what it says on the desk calendars at Kinkos copy shop, there are really only two seasons in New York City: summer and winter. They’re both completely unbearable, sadly, with an all-too short reprieve between them. “Spring” and “fall,” we call those fleeting dreams, laughing at ourselves for momentarily believing in them. Then we sigh. As you know from watching Seinfeld, New Yorkers are a famously complainy lot. One detects a type of civic pride in the kvetching you hear here. (“You think you’re schvitzing? I schlepped all the way from Brooklyn, and the AC on the F went kaput!”). In choosing to live in New York, we choose, for some reason, to live in unpleasant conditions: traffic, crowds, extreme weather conditions and catastrophic amounts of dog poop. Why do we do this to ourselves? A masochistic streak perhaps. Or something about wanting to build character: “If I can make it here,” etc.   Enduring it all is worth it, apparently, as long as we get to gripe. This past weekend marked the official start to summer. But we hit 80F (26.6C) degrees on 18 April this year and we’ve been complaining about the heat ever since. I have at least. I’ve been singing “Hot Town Summer In the City” to myself for more than two months already. The back of my neck stays dirty and gritty. I go from sweaty to sweatier. It’s miserable. The other day I was standing on a fetid platform deep within the underground toilet bowl that is our subway system. My shirt was soaked, my train was late, it had been a long day. A horde of fellow perspirers were encroaching on my personal space. I was wondering why God made us suffer so when the train came.  After the few departing passengers pushed their way through the doors, the inward crush swept me aboard and I ended up pinned between the middle-aged mother and twenty-something son of a family of four visiting from what I guessed to be the Midwest. I couldn’t reach a handrail or a pole: it was only the other human bodies keeping me upright as the train lurched forward. As my chest pressed against the woman’s back, I could feel my sticky skin rub against the sticky cloth of my shirt, and through that, the sticky cloth of her shirt, and through that, her sticky skin, wet with her own sweat. If this sounds at all sexy I am describing it poorly. My face was a grimace. The woman, though, was remarkably chipper (this is why I guessed they were visiting from the Midwest) and she laughed and turned over her shoulder and said to her son and her husband and her daughter: “It’s a good thing we’re a close-knit family!” This is a joke I might have found funny in slightly different circumstances. If I had been in their family, say, or if my sweat was not currently commingling with theirs. Summers weren’t always like this. According to long long time New Yorkers, those folks who remember when bagels were smaller and crustier but far better tasting than those of today, the old fogies who paid 50 cents to see Joe DiMaggio play center field for the Yankees and a nickel for an egg cream, there was a time when summer was associated with happiness and fun, and spring and fall lasted their allotted three months each. But those days are long gone.  Thanks to global warming (a phenomenon aggravated by a human population explosion represented all too well by our packed subway cars) our summers are getting longer and longer and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter. Not just here in New York, but everywhere. We set a new global heat record last year. This year, we’re on pace to blast ourselves past it.  Climate change is making winters more extreme, too. The last two winters in New York have been legendarily bad. Record cold and snow, accompanied by record complaining about cold and snow. All rational conversation in our bars and around our water coolers seemed to stop midway through February, with every argument or joke or bit of commentary on world news replaced by a monotone gasp: “When will it end?” Funny. Right now, as I sit here with my back stuck to my t-shirt stuck to my chair, the smell of urine and rotting garbage still in my nostrils from my morning walk to the corner store, I long for those days! Make me an icicle again, please! I can’t wait to be able to complain about snow and ice and restaurants not having adequate space for everyone’s stupid big giant Canada Goose parkas again.  Anything would be better than this."

"Natural gas has been touted as an environmentally friendly substitute to coal and oil production, but a new report estimates enough gas is leaking to negate most of the climate benefits of process. The report, commissioned by the Environmental Defense Fund and carried out by environmental consulting group ICF International, estimated the amount of leaks from natural gas and oil production on federal and tribal land in the US. It also looked at venting and flaring, processes in which drilling sites purposefully let gas go into the atmosphere for a variety of reasons – usually for safety.  The claim that natural gas is environmentally friendly hinges on how much methane leaks into the atmosphere during the production process. But the EDF report adds weight to those who say methane leaks at natural gas sites can make the process nearly or as carbon-intensive as coal. The EDF found that 65bn cubic feet of natural gas was released into the air on federal and tribal lands in 2013 – amounting to about $360m of lost gas. That, the EDF says, is not only an economic loss, but an environmental problem. Methane, the main ingredient in natural gas, is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over short periods of time and 30 times more potent over the long term.  The leaks are the equivalent to the greenhouse gases produced by 5.6m cars. Local pollution is also concern, according to the EDF: in Pinedale, Wyoming, emissions from fracking and other drilling operations produced smog levels rivaling inner-city Los Angeles; while in New Mexico, a methane “hot spot” was so large it could be detected by NASA satellites. The report also has national implications for fracking and other natural gas production. Natural gas drilling only has environmental benefits over other processes like coal and oil production if producers can keep a tight lid on leaks, and previous studies have suggested that enough gas is leaking across the country to negate most of those impacts. Scientists generally agree that within the entire production process – from drilling, to transportation through pipelines, to distribution – no more than 3% of the gas can leak for the country to see a net benefit over dirtier energy production technologies.  According to Hugh MacMillan, a senior researcher at nonprofit Food and Water Watch, the EDF’s numbers suggest that about 2.2% of the gas produced on federal and tribal lands is leaking – though that’s only at the drilling site. Leaks during the transportation process could push the total amount over 3%, but even at that level MacMillan said the benefits of natural gas production are negligible. “With 3% leakage, we’re being sold climate benefits when what we are really getting is marginally less climate damage,” he said.  There are ways to drastically reduce those leakage rates – some operators of natural gas sites manage to get their leaks down to under 1%. And the Bureau of Land Management, which oversees drilling on federal lands, is currently implementing stricter standards for drilling. The question is whether all drilling operators can meet those standards quickly. “There are better practices that drilling operators can use,” said Seth Shonkoff, the executive director of environmental consultancy PSE Healthy Energy. “But they need to be done now or yesterday as opposed to at the current pace to make this even close to climate neutral.”"

"Tackling climate change risks must become a top foreign policy priority if the world is to combat the global security threat it poses in the 21st century, according to a new study commissioned by the G7 countries. Multiple conflicts have taken the government systems for dealing with them “to their limits”, according to one of the authors of the report, which was launched at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) on Tuesday.  Written by an international consortium including peacebuilding NGO International Alert and the European Union Institute for Security Studies, it calls climate change “the ultimate threat multiplier” in fragile situations.  Citing conflicts in Syria and Mali and land grabs in Ethiopia, it warns that problems exacerbated by climate change – such as food insecurity, competition for water and land, migration and displacement – could leave fragile states unable to provide for their citizens.  Speaking at the launch, Baroness Anelay, the UK’s minister of state for the FCO, agreed that climate change should become a top foreign policy priority.  “Climate change is not only a threat to the environment but to global security and economic prosperity. That therefore makes it a top priority not only for environment ministers but foreign ministers too. It’s a cross government issue – and if it’s not, it should be,” she said. “The scale of the security risks are potentially enormous,” said Dan Smith, secretary general of International Alert. “You can see the climate threat in the narrative strand that lead to Tahrir Square, you can see it in Nigeria leading to Boko Haram, you can see it in the Horn of Africa potentially unfolding much more seriously.” But Smith was quick to criticise the concept of a “climate war”, which he said had emerged in recent years, such as around the conflict in Darfur.   “It leaves out everything else – the history of rivalries, the effects of Sudan’s civil war. It reduces the relationship between climate and security to being – at its worst – the relationship between last year’s weather and war ... There is a link but the complexity of it must be faced up to. We have to think about this in terms of managing the risks, not solving the problem – because the problem is already unfolding,” Smith told the Guardian.  Lukas Ruttinger, co-author of the 150-page report, warned that global systems for dealing with conflicts are reaching breaking point. “Multiple crises have taken the coping capacities of the systems we have to their limits. Take a look at the foreign office in Germany for example – half of the office is just busy with Ukraine – and then there is Syria.”  Smith also called for a more integrated response at local, national and international levels. “Government ministries need to come out of their silos and smell the coffee. Business as usual is not an option,” he said.  The report, called A New Climate for Peace, makes a number of recommendations and calls for leadership from the G7 countries – France, Germany, the UK, US, Japan, Italy and Canada – to bring together approaches to tackling climate change with development and peacebuilding efforts. Recommendations include the introduction of a global risk assessement, limits to food price fluctuations, increased reserves of food stocks, and greater management of water across borders.  The study also says there are significant benefits to be gained from taking action, such as improved health, increased employment, greater co-operation and equality.   The study was welcomed by G7 members at the summit in Germany last week, where ministers agreed to create a working group to respond to and implement the recommendations. "
"More than 50 environmental, charitable and farmers organisations have written an open letter to the government urging it to adopt a zero carbon emissions target by 2050. The letter, signed by groups such as Greenpeace, WWF, Oxfam and Save the Children as well as agricultural organisations and unions, stressed the economic benefits of moving towards renewables.  “Australia and Australian people stand to lose so much from the impacts of climate change; it is in our national interest to be amongst the leading nations to ensure the world limits warming to well below two degrees,” the letter said. “A zero carbon pollution future is possible, and it is all of our responsibility to make that future a reality for our children, and their children.” The groups are capitalising on the international pressure already mounting ahead of the Paris conference on climate change later this year. Several world leaders have called on Australia to build on its its 2020 emissions targets. “It’s critically important that Australia go very strong at the Paris agreement at the end of the year,” Marc Purcell from the Australian Council of International Development said. He is optimistic about the strengthening of the targets, saying public concern for climate change is making parliamentarians “wake up” to the issue. The head of the Australian Council of Social Services, Cassandra Goldie, said the poorest were the hardest hit by climate change, due to disaster management and food source uncertainty. She believes cutting emissions is a matter of fairness and equity. “If we don’t do this we will become a deeply divided globe with people who are left behind and those who have the resources to buy their way out,” Goldie said. The chief executive of the Climate Institute, John Connor, met the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the environment minister, Greg Hunt, when the government held roundtable consultations on its carbon target. He put forward the group’s goals – a 40% reduction in emissions by 2020 and a target of net zero emissions by 2050. Connor said targets were only as good as their outcomes. “It’s very important that these targets ... are backed by strong policies,” he said."

"The Encyclical Letter Laudato Si’ released by Pope Francis last week has generated a wide range of reactions ranging from enthusiastic praise to uneasy criticism. For some, the Pope’s key message was about climate change, for others about the downsides of economic growth, and some saw in it a reconciliation of science and religion. But the Encyclical also lays bare a debate much larger than each of these perspectives, one that is fundamentally about what kind of world we want to inhabit. The Pope’s message is just the latest intervention in a debate over technologies that has been going on for centuries. Pope Francis writes of the “human roots of the ecological crisis” defined in terms of deference to a “technocratic paradigm” which contains “the deepest roots of our present failures, which have to do with the direction, goals, meaning and social implications of technological and economic growth.”   The Pope’s choice of language is evocative of historian Lynn White, Jr.’s classic essay, “The Historic Roots of our Ecologic Crisis,” written almost 50 years ago in Science. White argued that technological innovation was a “realization of the Christian dogma of man’s transcendence of, and rightful mastery over, nature.” A consequence of this mastery, White suggested, is to “give mankind powers which, to judge by many of the ecologic effects, are out of control. If so, Christianity bears a huge burden of guilt.” White’s proposed alternative to the dominant Christian narrative anticipated the Pope’s Encyclical: “we should ponder the greatest radical in Christian history since Christ: Saint Francis of Assisi” (from whom the Pope took his name). White continued: “the present increasing disruption of the global environment is the product of a dynamic technology and science which were originating in the Western medieval world against which Saint Francis was rebelling in so original a way. Their growth cannot be understood historically apart from distinctive attitudes toward nature which are deeply grounded in Christian dogma.” What Lynn White was pointing to in the 1960s and Pope Francis writes of today can be viewed as a struggle over the meaning of humanity on planet Earth. What is our role? Do we dominate nature? Or are we of nature, even subservient to it? What kind of world do we want? What should we together value? These are not questions that can be answered with science or technology. They are ultimately religious. But our answers to these questions shape how we view the roles of science and technology in society. For many scientists, especially those who outwardly eschew religion, to learn that their battles over technological adoption or restriction are fundamentally religious may come as a bit of a surprise. But as White explained , “The fact that most people do not think of these attitudes as Christian is irrelevant.” For instance, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the scientist who helped Pope Francis prepare the Encyclical Letter, wrote in an accompanying essay in explicitly Biblical terms, warning of “having eaten from the fruit of fossil fuel burning.” Schellnhuber’s association of the Fall of Man from the Garden of Eden with technological innovation is exactly the sort of counter-narrative to conventional Christianity’s tale of human dominion over nature that White and Francis (both the Saint and the Pope) have proposed. It is also compatible with a dominant strand of contemporary Western environmentalism that has scientists in roles that Church leaders used to play. But for many, embracing an overt religious framing for existential debates over technology can quickly become problematic, or at least deeply inconsistent. Consider technologies of family planning. Consistent with Catholic history, Pope Francis largely dismisses concern about global population as a contributor to environmental problems, “To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues.”  Yet, in an earlier Encyclical Letter from the Church (Humanae Vitae 1968) Pope Paul VI appealed to scientists to help develop technologies consistent with Church doctrine to allow for a “sufficiently secure basis for the chaste limitation of offspring.” Pope Paul VI, clearly not a Franciscan, applauded “man’s stupendous progress in the domination and rational organization of the forces of nature,” and looked to science and technology to help reconcile religious values with global problems. But like Francis today, Paul also asked for moral and spiritual change among people. Despite this admonition, across broader society among Catholics and non-Catholics alike, birth control technologies have not come to be viewed as a forbidden fruit, but as a technology of empowerment, especially for women. Scientists offered little support for developing methods of birth control compatible with Church strictures. Today, I suspect that many of those who are celebrating Pope Francis criticisms of science and technology are just as likely quick to dismiss the church’s views on reproductive technologies. Our views on whether certain technologies are good or bad are a reflection of what kind of world we collectively want.  Nuclear power? GMOs? Birth control pills? Fracking? Human germline editing? Solar thermal stations? Vaccinations? Coal power? Good luck finding someone, anyone, with a consistently pro- or anti- technology position across just this small set of innovations. People around the world show a remarkable degree of inconsistency when applying religious principles to technological innovation. Of course, one person’s inconsistency is another’s pragmatism, and the pragmatic way to settle conflicts in through the difficult and frustrating process of politics. The lesson of birth control technologies since Pope Paul VI issued his 1968 Encyclical offers a cautionary tale for those who think that Franciscan Catholicism will somehow result in fundamental change in our contemporary environmental debates. Pope Francis asks that we “replace consumption with sacrifice, greed with generosity, wastefulness with a spirit of sharing.” He asks for “asceticism.” He warns that “The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.” On the one hand, one does not have to look far to find Earth looking like an immense pile of filth. For example, several weeks ago the city of Accra in Ghana experienced massive flooding, killing more than 150 people, many in a massive petrol fire. The flooding was a consequence of storm drains clogged with trash, the detritus of growing wealth. But on the other hand, Ghanaians do not appear to be looking toward any sort of “asceticism” as a response. Rather the President has said that the nation is “looking to set up silt traps in Ghana’s rivers, dredge sewers, relocate neighborhoods occupying floodplains and replace storm drains” – in others words, to technologies to address the problems caused by technology. More broadly, Ghana is going full speed ahead with a program of economic growth, much of it focused on exploiting fossil fuels, viewed not as a forbidden fruit but as a technology of empowerment, just as women have viewed birth control. Western debates over technologies are indeed grounded in and even sometimes a proxy for deeper religious conflicts that go back centuries. At the same time, despite these roots, decisions about technological innovation, adoption and limitation are made based on far more prosaic considerations. In a world where 2 billion people lack basic access to electricity and an even greater number desire continued economic growth, it is difficult to imagine that either technology or economic growth will be reconsidered anytime soon. Of course, the essentially religious debate over these issues will not be going away anytime soon. With his encyclical Pope Francis has done the world a service by helping us to see that our choices about technology and economic growth are part of a deeper set of questions focused on what kind of world we wish to live in together. Answering such questions collectively through action will be messy, inconsistent and deeply political. If history is any guide, religious teachings will inform these answers but not determine them. That will mean disappointment for fundamentalists of all stripes."

"High-carbon lifestyles are desperately unhealthy, according to Hugh Montgomery, director of the UCL Institute for human health and performance and co-chair of the Lancet commission.  Cutting red meat and dairy consumption would lead to a big saving in methane, which is 23 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide “from essentially belching cows. That saves a lot of strokes, heart disease, bowel cancer and so forth,” he said.  Big savings are possible from “active transport” – more cycling and walking. Reductions in vehicle particulates improves respiratory health and reduces cardiovascular disease, as well as making people healthier and happier.  There are very big savings from people using more calories to move around, reducing obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular risks. The European commission says savings of well over €30-35bn (£22-£25bn) per year in healthcare costs could be made from quite modest reductions in greenhouse gases.  Many cities in North America and Europe have started to go green. “All the surveys show that 80% of people want this. Let’s accelerate that. Let politicians catch up with the appetite of their citizens and mayors,” said Anthony Costello, director of the UCL Institute for global health and co-chair of the commission.  He cited Melbourne which has set itself to become zero carbon, San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, Minneapolis, Zermatt and Vancouver. “Bogota has set itself very aggressive targets for becoming low emission and investing hugely in buses and electric transport,” he said.  In the UK, Newcastle, Leicester, Brighton, Bristol, Edinburgh and even London, which has introduced a lot more cycle pathways, are moving in the same direction. It’s not just about cycling, but also green infrastructure for flood mitigation and fresh water control, and having more parks for recreation with direct benefits on people’s health. There are also indirect benefits – trees buffer, wind and noise. The cost of air travel might have to rise, but one proposal is that one cheap family package holiday per year would be allowed.  “The growth in air transport is short hop, short term leisure travel,” said Paul Ekin, professor of resources and environmental policy at UCL. “Stag parties in Barcelona over the weekend – that sort of thing might become quite a bit more expensive so people might think twice about doing that. But at the kind of carbon prices we’re looking at – $200 per ton perhaps by 2050 – that would not translate even to a doubling of current airfares. One mustn’t exaggerate, but it would become more expensive.” "
"Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment was delivered to the entire world, but much of what he wrote was important for those of us in the US – especially our political leaders. It is a strong wake-up call that market-driven approaches to climate change and environmental degradation are not sufficient. Strong government action is needed, but most people, including political leaders, really don’t like a call to conversion. Pope Francis was right when he asked politicians: “What would induce anyone, at this stage, to hold on to power only to be remembered for their inability to take action when it was urgent and necessary to do so?” He was referring to continued reluctance by leaders in the US and elsewhere to effectively tackle these crises.  Contrary to what many of our politicians maintain, Pope Francis stated that human activity is most responsible for global warming. And his strong criticisms of technology and other profit-driven “solutions” to environmental problems were not welcomed by many of our political and business leaders. Moreover, his historic encyclical goes far beyond climate change and technology. His repeated reminders that all of life is interconnected mean that piecemeal approaches to worldwide problems are doomed to failure. Throughout the document, he powerfully integrates issues of economic and ecological justice. The pope’s frequent criticisms of consumerism run counter to much of what is considered part of US lifestyle. We Americans especially prize freedom, but he notes that although many believe they are free when they have the “supposed freedom to consume”, in reality, the only free ones are “the minority who wield economic and financial power”. There was a telling moment during the Vatican press conference on Thursday marking the release of the encyclical. A journalist asked about politicians, especially in the US, who insist that the pope should stick to religion and not delve into areas such as science, politics and economics. Cardinal Peter Turkson, a key Vatican spokesman who helped draft the encyclical, replied that such a “claim … is not worth sustaining.” He added: “I would imagine that when they themselves become politicians without being scientists they will not say another word about science.”  Both sides of the political aisle will find some nourishment in the encyclical, but progressive leaders will find more to fuel their arguments. He wrote people have a fundamental right to water, food and housing. We need to address inequality. We need to create a system of living where nothing is wasted and all serve the common good. And we need to listen to indigenous people when decisions are made about them. This last argument has special resonance in current congressional debates about US trade policies.  Pope Francis calls us to be converted from a “throwaway culture” and an economy of exclusion, to solidarity and care for those who are most vulnerable. We must all be engaged in making that happen, with a vital role played by our leaders, many of whom happen to be Catholic. This will be a hard lesson for some to hear. But, as the pope also reminds us, people are capable of change so there is hope for a better world for this and future generations."
"It all came about as the result of an online discussion. We have a platform on our website that acts as a sort of thinktank for sustainability experts. One of the users was Roger Cox [one of the lawyers in the case]. He had been reading all sorts of books and reports on climate change and thought that the politics will just never move quickly enough to reduce emissions or stop temperatures rising.  He was thinking about what action you could take that would still be a part of normal society, and the only invention he thought might work was to let a judge speak – if you gave a judge all the details he would surely decide that climate change is an urgent and serious problem, and that the state should protect its citizens as part of its duty of care. We’re an NGO that tries to make the Netherlands more sustainable as quickly as possible, and I’ve studied law so I saw what he was hinting at and I said: “Let’s do it!”. Roger and another lawyer made up the legal part of the case. We discussed everything in public and garnered a great deal of free publicity because this was the first time that citizens had tried to go through a judge to ask the government to take action on climate change. We called it ‘crowdpleading’. We asked everyone in the Netherlands to share their expertise and knowledge and to tell us about any similar court cases they knew of that we could use as a framework. People wanted to join the case and in the end we had 900 co-plaintiffs. The Urgenda Foundation sent in the legal procedure on their behalf and after a year and a half of back and forth, we were finally, physically in court in April of this year. The co-plaintiffs were people from all parts of society: there were teachers, people working in care, Joos Ockels (the wife of the Netherlands’ first astronaut), DJ Gregor Salto, a few people from the art world like architect Thomas Rau, and front runners from the sustainability world. But more than half of the co-plaintiffs were normal people who had read our newsletter and said “I’m going to join.” There were more than 100 co-plaintiffs in court with us when the judge announced his verdict – housewives, pensioners and the one next to me was an 11-year-old schoolkid who had asked to be let out of school for the day. I thought that Roger and Dennis did such an extremely good job of presenting all the information that it would be impossible for the judge to disagree with us. I didn’t think the state lawyers were very good – they just kept saying that it was not a matter for a judge, but for politics – I was kind of disappointed. I don’t think they knew much about climate change before this case. Our lawyers argued that the situation of the state’s commitment to climate change was so bad that as a citizen, you could go to a judge and say: “Please protect me.” This part of the argument was not really covered by the state so everything was there for the judge to agree with us. Right after the verdict, the lawyers and I were hugging with tears in our eyes. We had been working on this for two and a half years and here we had the first sentence saying that climate change is urgent and important. The ruling that the state should reduce emissions by 25% in five years was the best we could hope for. We were euphoric. I had a bombardment of emails saying congratulations. We had interviews with newspapers and radio stations from China to Canada – it didn’t stop until after midnight. When I got home last night I looked at my messages and so many of them said things like: “Mrs Minnesma, I don’t know you but I was in front of the TV with tears in my eyes.” It is so nice for people to have that hope again. This was not only a legal process, but a process of hope. We haven’t had time to celebrate yet - I told my three children that we’ll do that this weekend. I think plaintiffs in Belgium and Norway [where similar cases are pending or in preparation] will look to our case and bring it in front of their own judge to show how the Dutch verdict was structured, Many things in our verdict are general that they can copy for example, 80% of all our arguments and supporting documentation can be used in any country. Other aspects will depend on the different legal systems. With cases around asbestos poisoning, in the beginning all the cases were lost, but at a certain point the system changed and people starting winning. I think our case is like that, it’s very special, and now hopefully more people will win climate liability suits. Hopefully our case will give people the courage to do the same because they can see what a judge can do with a good legal system in a normal country like the Netherlands.

" Activist, co-editor of openDemocracy’s OurKingdomUK, adviser for BrightGreen. When I was a student at Edinburgh, we used to protest at the career fair every year. One time, Esso [ExxonMobil] had got someone to set up their stall, but their staff failed to show up. My sister and I put on our best suits and staffed the stall for the morning, giving students an honest appraisal of what it was like to work for a company whose work is bound up with brutality, corruption, murder and planetary destruction the world over. After hours of these conversations with students, the poor Careers’ Service manager realised we weren’t really from Esso. The look on her face stays with me to this day. There was a generation of climate activists who wasted a huge amount of time trying to get people to change their consumer behaviour. All this did was make us sound preachy and annoying, and like we blamed ordinary people for a planetary problem. When I look at a new generation of climate activists focusing their energy on big oil companies and those who fund them, occupying their universities if they refuse to divest from fossil fuels, talking about how we change the system rather than how we change a few lightbulbs, that fills me with hope.

A few years ago I had quite a high flying academic career, a PhD and a government job, and I quit it all to get involved in New Dawn Traders – to jump on a zero carbon motorless ship and sail to the Caribbean and back to trade rum, chocolate and spices. I’m living the life I never thought would be possible until I started it. And if someone out there does care about the environment and has a dream of what the future looks like, and they’re depressed that their current reality doesn’t match that dream yet, they should make sure keep taking baby steps towards it. Keep communicating the future that they want and describing how it might work, and it can happen. That is what will change the world. It’s not about defining how things have been done in the past by other people, it’s about keeping people hopeful and empowering them to keep following their dreams.

My most memorable campaign story was probably watching activists sneak a longboat into the British Museum as part of a protest against BP sponsoring the Viking exhibition. The activists had advertised publicly that they were going to do this, so the museum had a lot of security checking bags to try to stop it. But the activists got in anyway (the “boat” was made of people and cloth, so it snuck in gradually under security’s eyes). It was beautiful. I want the climate movement to grow in size and power, and to appreciate its diversity to give more space to voices that are currently marginalised. More pragmatically, I hope it manages to get through the end of this year shining, ready to take on whatever the outcome of the Paris talks.

Honour sadness. If you aren’t sad, even utterly depressed, at the gut-wrenching environmental and social destruction going on all over planet Earth, something is up.

"A court in The Hague has ordered the Dutch government to cut its emissions by at least 25% within five years, in a landmark ruling expected to cause ripples around the world.  To cheers and hoots from climate campaigners in court, three judges ruled that government plans to cut emissions by just 14-17% compared to 1990 levels by 2020 were unlawful, given the scale of the threat posed by climate change.  Jubilant campaigners said that governments preparing for the Paris climate summit later this year would now need to look over their shoulders for civil rights era-style legal challenges where emissions-cutting pledges are inadequate.  “Before this judgement, the only legal obligations on states were those they agreed among themselves in international treaties,” said Dennis van Berkel, legal counsel for Urgenda, the group that brought the suit.  “This is the first a time a court has determined that states have an independent legal obligation towards their citizens. That must inform the reduction commitments in Paris because if it doesn’t, they can expect pressure from courts in their own jurisdictions.” In what was the first climate liability suit brought under human rights and tort law, Judge Hans Hofhuis told the court that the threat posed by global warming was severe and acknowledged by the Dutch government in international pacts. “The state should not hide behind the argument that the solution to the global climate problem does not depend solely on Dutch efforts,” the judges’ ruling said. “Any reduction of emissions contributes to the prevention of dangerous climate change and as a developed country the Netherlands should take the lead in this.” After a legal campaign that took two and a half years to get to its first hearing in April, normally dispassionate lawyers were visibly moved by the judge’s words. “As the verdict was being read out, I actually had tears in my eyes,” Roger Cox, Urgenda’s lead advocate, told the Guardian. “It was an emotional moment.”  Young activists in court said that the ruling had gone some way to restoring Dutch national pride, which has been dented as Denmark, Germany and even the UK overtook the Netherlands, once seen as a European climate leader, in the green economy race.  The Dutch Socialist party MP Eric Smaling cautioned though that “some people will feel proud but others are more unhappy about the influx of refugees. So far climate action has too much been the last baby of a relatively leftist elite.” He called for a wide coalition to spread the climate action message before elections in early 2017.  The Dutch government has not decided whether to appeal the court’s decision yet, but opposition politicians are steeling themselves for the prospect.   Stientje Van Veldhoven, an MP and spokesperson for the D66 Liberal opposition in parliament noted that the government had yielded to a comparable, if more limited, ruling ending gas extraction in part of the giant Groningen gas fields earlier this year.  “The government has never ignored a court ruling like this one before, but there has never been a ruling like this before either,” she said. “Everybody has a right to appeal.” Veldhoven has requested a parliamentary debate on Wednesday’s court ruling.  In a statement on behalf of prime minister Mark Rutte’s cabinet, the Dutch environment minister Wilma Mansfeld said that the government’s strategy was to implement EU-wide and international agreements. “We and Urgenda share the same goal,” Mansfeld said. “We just hold different opinions regarding the manner in which to attain this goal. We will now examine what this ruling means for the Dutch state.”  Some 886 plaintiffs organised by Urgenda had accused the Dutch government of negligence for “knowingly contributing” to a breach of the 2C maximum target for global warming.  Their legal arguments rested on axioms forbidding states from polluting to the extent that they damage other states, and the EU’s ‘precautionary principle’ which prohibits actions that carry unknown but potentially severe risks.  A UN climate secretariat article obliging states to do whatever is necessary to prevent dangerous climate change was also cited. So was the UN climate science panel’s 2007 assessment of the reductions in carbon dioxide needed to have a 50% chance of containing global warming to 2C.  Several legal sources said that ideas outlined in the Oslo principles for climate change obligations, launched in the Guardian in March, appeared to have been influential in the judge’s reasoning.  James Thornton, the chief executive of the environmental law group ClientEarth, hailed what he said had been a “courageous and visionary” ruling, that would shape the playing field for future suits. “There are moments in history when only courts can address overwhelming problems. In the past it has been issues like discrimination. Climate change is our overwhelming problem and this court has addressed it. The Dutch court’s ruling should encourage courts around the world to tackle climate change now.”  Serge de Gheldere, the president of Klimaat Zaak, which is pursuing an almost identical case to Urgenda’s in Belgium said: “This gives us a lot of hope as it sets an incredible precedent. The government in Belgium will take a lot of notice of whats happened here today. This could be the first stone that sets an avalanche in motion.”   Professor Pier Vellinga, Urgenda’s chairman and the originator of the 2C target in 1989 said that the breakthrough judgement would have a massive impact. “The ruling is of enormous significance, and beyond our expectations,” he said.   The court also ordered the government to pay all of Urgenda’s costs. "

"In his encyclical on climate change, Laudato Si, Pope Francis emphasises overconsumption and the individual responsibility everyone has to our ‘common home’. Here’s a selection of what Catholics on social media were saying."

"Pope Francis has released an unprecedented encyclical on climate change and the environment. The 180-page document calls on rich nations to pay their “grave social debt” to poorer countries and lambasts the UN climate talks for a lack of progress. Here are eight things we learned: While renewable power from wind and solar gets up to speed as a solution to our energy needs, it’s worth considering gas over coal, he said: We know that technology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels – especially coal, but also oil and, to a lesser degree, gas – needs to be progressively replaced without delay. Until greater progress is made in developing widely accessible sources of renewable energy, it is legitimate to choose the lesser of two evils or to find short-term solutions. He says more than 20 years of summits have produced “regrettably few” advances on efforts to cut carbon emissions and rein in global warming. The encyclical says: It is remarkable how weak international political responses have been. The failure of global summits on the environment make it plain that our politics are subject to technology and finance. There are too many special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will not be affected. In this passage he seems to be referring to the only current global carbon trading scheme, the CDM: The strategy of buying and selling “carbon credits” can lead to a new form of speculation which would not help reduce the emission of polluting gases worldwide. This system seems to provide a quick and easy solution under the guise of a certain commitment to the environment, but in no way does it allow for the radical change which present circumstances require. Rather, it may simply become a ploy which permits maintaining the excessive consumption of some countries and sectors. From Francis’s point of view, small and local is beautiful: In some places, cooperatives are being developed to exploit renewable sources of energy which ensure local self-sufficiency and even the sale of surplus energy. This simple example shows that, while the existing world order proves powerless to assume its responsibilities, local individuals and groups can make a real difference. It is difficult to make a general judgement about genetic modification (GM) ... The risks involved are not always due to the techniques used, but rather to their improper or excessive application ... This is a complex environmental issue Perhaps unsurprisingly given the church’s stance on birth control, and in common with many environmentalists, he thinks consumption rather than overpopulation is the bigger environmental problem: To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. Real relationships with others, with all the challenges they entail, now tend to be replaced by a type of internet communication which enables us to choose or eliminate relationships at whim, thus giving rise to a new type of contrived emotion which has more to do with devices and displays than with other people and with nature. We may well be leaving to coming generations debris, desolation and filth. The pace of consumption, waste and environmental change has so stretched the planet’s capacity that our contemporary lifestyle, unsustainable as it is, can only precipitate catastrophes, such as those which even now periodically occur in different areas of the world. The effects of the present imbalance can only be reduced by our decisive action, here and now."

"Q. Encyclicals. Are they the top level of papal declarations? A. Second from top. An apostolic constitution is the highest form of papal decree. Only one has been issued so far this century – by Pope Benedict to give Anglicans a way of joining the Catholic church without having to forgo their liturgy and so on.  Q. So what is an encyclical? A. Originally, it was a circular letter; the term comes from the Greek word for a circle. The earliest papal encyclicals were sent by the pope of the day to members of the Catholic hierarchy, and sometimes only to those in a particular country. So they could be about quite mundane issues of ecclesiastical organisation. Q. When did encyclicals come into fashion? A. The man who first seems to have gone big on them was the genial and unpretentious Benedict XIV, who was pope in the mid-18th century. He wrote his first encyclical – Ubi Primum, which was about the duties of bishops – four months after being elected and issued the last of 44 in the year before he died in 1758. The all-time encyclical writing champion, though, was Leo XIII who sat on the throne of St Peter from 1878 to 1903. He penned more than 80, including one of the most influential, Rerum Novarum, published in 1891. Q. Why was it considered so important? A. It was the papacy’s – long overdue – response to a changed world of industrial conflict and class warfare. Rerum Novarum laid the foundations of Catholic social teaching, condemning both Marxism and unfettered capitalism.  Q. Other landmark encyclicals? A. Probably the one that has had the greatest impact on humanity is Humanae Vitae, the encyclical that reaffirmed the Catholic church’s ban on artificial birth control back in 1968. But Humanae Vitae is also probably the papal diktat that has been most widely ignored by Catholics themselves, notably in Italy, which nowadays has one of the world’s lowest birth rates.  Q. Do encyclicals have to have Latin titles? A. No, though most do. There have been French and Italian titles. And one of the most famous encyclicals was written entirely in German. Q. Why? A. Mit brennender Sorge – With Burning Anxiety – was Pope Pius XI’s denunciation of the ideas of the Third Reich. It was smuggled into Germany and read out from the pulpits of Catholic churches on Palm Sunday 1937. Q. But wasn’t the pope a bit soft on the Nazis? A. That’s the accusation levelled against Pius XI’s successor, Pius XII. Q. Are encyclicals really written by popes? A. Not these days. Leo XIII was said to have written his. But nowadays they are a team effort. In the case of Francis’s encyclical on the environment, much of the work was delegated to the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, the Vatican department that most closely resembles an overseas aid and development ministry in a secular government. Nevertheless, it is the pope who does the final editing.  Q. After which the encyclical goes to be translated … A. Yes, and that can be a story in itself. Because of the importance attached to the words used by a pope, it is crucial that what he says in each language should be understood in the same way. Publication of Pope Benedict’s third encyclical, Caritas in Veritate, was held up for a week because of the difficulties of reconciling certain passages. Q. Understandable if what the pope says is held to be infallible. No? A. No. Pronouncements held to be infallible are very rare and limited to matters of faith and doctrine. The last papal declaration indisputably regarded as falling into this category was in 1950. Whatever Pope Francis has to say about climate change or fossil fuels will carry great moral weight. But neither he nor the Vatican would claim his views on the environment are infallible."
"The first time Helianti Hilman visited the indigenous farmers of the West Java town of Garut, she was asked to remove her shoes before entering their fields. Her surprise grew when the farmers quizzed her on her mood – they didn’t want her upsetting the plants.  “That’s when I realised that their approach to agriculture was much more than just growing organic,” says 44-year-old Hilman, an Indonesian entrepreneur and former lawyer. “It was a whole way of life. That’s when my perspective changed.” That was eight years ago. Hilman’s efforts to protect and promote traditional agricultural practices in Indonesia since then saw her named an Asian social entrepreneur of the year by the Schwab Foundation at the World Economic Forum in March.  The social enterprise that Hilman helped to establish in 2009 works with around 50,000 smallholder farmers across Indonesia. Called Javara (which means champion in Sanskrit) the organisation oversees the marketing and distribution of more than 640 artisanal products, from organically grown vegetables and gluten-free flour to gourmet salt and coconut cooking oil. According to Indonesia’s national indigenous people’s organisation, Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara (AMAN), around one fifth of the country’s 250 million people classify as indigenous. With statutory efforts to establish collective rights to customary lands yet to be officially sanctioned, rural communities remain vulnerable to the frequent land grabs made by palm oil producers and other forest users. Given that most Indonesian farmers live in abject poverty, there is a clear moral and developmental case for supporting them. But there are compelling sustainability reasons too, Hilman insists.  During Indonesia’s “Green Revolution” of the 1970s, farmers were encouraged by the government to adopt commercial agricultural practices. However, many indigenous people avoided this wave of modernity and still use traditional methods, and so-called heritage or heirloom seeds.  “Back in the 1960s in Indonesia, we used to have over 7,000 different rice varieties. People have forgotten this today. They are used to buying just red, white or black rice,” says Hilman. The heritage plants grown by Javara’s network of farmers offer a wide range of distinctive nutritional properties. And with their greater diversity comes greater resilience. Hilman cites rice varieties, for example, that can grow everywhere, from forest shade and swamps to inland lakes and saline coasts. “This isn’t just for the foodies,” she argues. “These varieties are very relevant for climate change [but] we are losing them before our eyes without even knowing it.”  Her sense of urgency is echoed by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFR), an Austria-based nonprofit group. In a report released in May, the IUFR emphasised the role that indigenous communities can play, both in protecting forests and enhancing food security. “Working with farmers to combine the best of traditional and formal scientific knowledge offers tremendous potential [and] this contribution needs to be acknowledged and incorporated into management practices and policy,” the report states.  In Indonesia, that is easier said than done. For a start, its indigenous communities often live in remote areas – the country comprises nearly 1,000 permanently settled islands. Years of marginalisation has also left them distrustful of outsiders and unfamiliar with how mainstream markets work.  Hilman’s entry point came by way of the Integrated Pest Management Farmers’ Association, a nonprofit network representing more than 1 million indigenous and smallholder farmers in Indonesia. She was invited by a group of rice growers close to her parents’ home in central Java to help with marketing their produce. She struck lucky in 2009 when she persuaded Ranch Market, a premium supermarket in Jakarta, to stock two-dozen varieties of the farmers’ rice. Orders from high-end hotels and restaurants quickly followed. Over time, Javara has sought gradually to overcome the knowledge gaps of its affiliated producer groups through basic management training and production advice. For the large collectives in its network, it also provides assistance with organic certification and credit for the purchase of equipment. Volume is the biggest sticking point. Indonesia’s indigenous farmers traditionally have small plots and grow mixed crops. The notion of mono-crop production or intensive cultivation is anathema to them. One community even forbids the sale of its rice varieties, permitting only barter instead.  Hilman’s solution has been to take the farmers’ specialty crops and use them to create inventive, value-added products. “A buyer might ask us for a container of turmeric, and we simply don’t have that much,” she explains. “But we have enough turmeric to blend it with heritage rice to create turmeric-infused rice.” “And we’re not just selling the products,” she adds. “We’re selling the story and benefits behind the products.” Take the tale of “bee whispering”, for instance. Practitioners of this ancient art herd bees towards particular flowers to influence the final taste of their honey. Clove, cotton and rambutan (a tropical fruit) are just some of the single blossom flavours in Javara’s honey portfolio.  Volume is also an issue on the demand side. Indonesia’s premium domestic market is limited, so four years ago Hilman shifted the organisation’s focus to exports. Javara’s international sales, which include Japan, Korea, the US and 11 European countries, now comprise around 85% of its total revenues. “All of a sudden, we realised that indigenous products meet the trend in the world market,” says Hilman. “They are low-glycaemic, organic, gluten-free and sustainably produced.”  And they can be enjoyed whatever your mood – or footwear."
"“You have been negotiating all my life”, cried out 21-year-old Anjali Appadurai from the lectern of a UN climate change conference four years ago. The activist, speaking on behalf of her nation’s youth, could have been speaking for anyone who has taken a mild interest in more than two decades of international negotiations on climate change and stood aghast as world leaders have failed to protect the most basic of human rights – to exist. But today, thanks to 886 Dutch citizens who decided to sue their government, all of that may change. We may not have to wait for the politicians to save us – the lawyers may step in instead. In the first successful case of its kind, a judge in the Hague has ruled that the Dutch government’s stance on climate change is illegal and has ordered them to take action to cut greenhouse gas emissions by a hefty 25% within five years.  Lawyers say the precedent it sets could trigger similar cases all around the world. Already, in Belgium, 8,000 citizens are preparing for a similar court case, with others pointing to another possible lawsuit in Norway. Although the case is only binding within the Netherlands, lawyers say that it will inspire lawyers and judges considering similar cases in many other countries. “It is remarkable,” said James Thornton, chief executive of environmental law organisation ClientEarth. “A major sophisticated European court has broken through a political and psychological threshold. For the first time a court has ordered the government to protect its citizens from climate change.” Thornton says that by using the principles of tort law, the case “returns to the fundamental power of the court to prevent harm – it is of great relevance to courts in other countries – every country in the world has tort law.” Thornton says that many others are currently considering climate litigation cases, including ClientEarth themselves. In April, a group of prolific judges, advocates and professors launched the Oslo principles on global climate change obligations. Created by a group of prolific judges, advocates and professors, they argue that in failing to introduce adequate policy to tackle climate change, governments have already broken existing human rights, environmental and tort laws, regardless of agreements brokered at the international level. But does a judge – generally appointed, not elected by citizens – have the right to order a policy change? It is a question that goes back to 1950s America and the fight against segregation in schools. In 1951, parents in the state of Kansas decided to file a lawsuit on behalf of their children. Others elsewhere followed suit and three years later the courts ruled that it was “inherently unequal” and therefore unconstitutional for the state to maintain separate education facilities. It was a major win for the civil rights movement and triggered integration in US schools. Unfortunately for climate change campaigners in the US, the constitution does not hold the same protections for citizens’ environmental rights and it is this separation of powers that has prevented similar cases taking hold in the US, says Michael Gerrard of Columbia Law School. He points to examples elsewhere where courts have successfully changed policy on environmental issues,such as cases against deforestation in the Philippines and a supreme court ruling in India that paved the way for Delhi’s buses to switch from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG) to cut air pollution. Nevertheless, he says the victory “will embolden lawyers in other countries, where active judiciaries are willing to issue rulings based on constitutional and human rights doctrines.” The verdict will likely not only inspire lawyers, but the environmental movement, which is tired after 23 years of international negotiations. The multiple successes of the fossil fuel divestment campaign have provided a new, hopeful narrative of international relevance in recent years – and this court case could do the same. Like the UK’s mass climate change lobby last week, this David and Goliath case shows that the climate change movement is not just made up of lentil-eating, sandal-wearing idealist liberals. All of the plantiffs who successfully sued their government today are Dutch citizens, crowdsourced by Urgenda, the environmental foundation behind the case. Among this group of entrepreneurs, teachers, students, children and grandparents, are the famous Dutch DJ Gregor Salto, Dutch national weatherman Reinier van den Berg, and the wife of the late Wubbo Ockels, the first Dutch citizen in space. This case hasn’t been won by one David, but 886. Let’s hope there are many more."

"A group of high-profile health practitioners, including the editors of the Lancet and the British Medical Journal (BMJ), have called upon the Wellcome Trust to divest from fossil fuels in an open letter published on Thursday in the Guardian. Among the signatories are Anthony Costello, director of the University College London (UCL) Institute for Public Health, Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health, Fiona Sim, chair of the Royal Society for Public Health, Richard Horton, editor of medical journal the Lancet and Fiona Godlee, editor of the BMJ.  Costello said that divestment was necessary because of the potential for climate change to cause “extremely serious health effects and catastrophe” and to signal to the public that “transition to a zero carbon economy is a global priority”. The letter calls upon the Wellcome Trust – the world’s second largest health funder – to show leadership on divestment in the name of the age-old principle of medical ethics: “do no harm”. So far it has been signed by 73 doctors, nurses and academics. It reads: “divestment rests on the premise that it is wrong to profit from an industry whose core business threatens human and planetary health, bringing to mind one of the foundations of medical ethics – first, do no harm.”  Writing in the Guardian in March, director of Wellcome Trust Jeremy Farrar argued that divestment is “a grand gesture” and that engagement with fossil fuel companies is a more effective way to tackle climate change.  The letter rejects this argument; it reads: “we believe that, in aligning organisations’ investments with their aims and values, it goes beyond a “grand gesture”. The question is not only one of direct, short-term impacts, but of leadership. Health organisations such as the Wellcome Trust have considerable moral and scientific authority, and a decision to divest has the potential to influence policy-makers, other investors and the public, in the UK and internationally. The letter was co-ordinated by the global health NGOs MedAct and the Climate and Health Council, who are also inviting other global health practitioners around the world to sign the letter on the Guardian’s website.  David McCoy, director of MedAct, said: “All those who’ve signed would be supportive of Wellcome’s aims, but firmly believe that the Trust has got it wrong on this issue. We’re inviting doctors, nurses, midwives, psychologists, dentists, pharmacists, physiotherapists, allied health and community health workers, health researchers and lecturers from around the world to add their name to this letter and join the growing global health divestment movement. If you’re part of a professional association, university, hospital or other health organisation, this is a way to pressure your own institutions from within, to divest.” The move follows the publication on Tuesday of the major new report on health and climate change by the UCL/Lancet commission. The letter has been signed by co-chairs of the commission, Prof Hugh Montgomery, director of the UCL Institute for Human Health and Performance and Prof Anthony Costello, director of the UCL Institute for Global Health.  Montgomery said: “I think the Wellcome Trust are essentially a great organisation ... For me, the argument that such a small stockholder can really influence the direction of travel of a large fossil fuel company doesn’t appear credible. Some such companies are saying that they ‘accept that reserves must stay in the ground’, but then drill for more reserves beyond that. Shell is an example. Those two positions don’t add up. I do understand that divesting is to a degree symbolic – but its a really big symbol when an organisation as noble and credible as the Wellcome Trust takes such action.” Costello said he was signing the letter for “political” reasons: “divestment sends a signal to the public to reduce the social licence of the fossil fuel industry. Given what we know of the current science and trends – the potential for extremely serious health effects and catastrophe – we need to send a signal to the public that the transition to a zero-carbon economy is a global priority,” he said.  The publication of the letter also comes on the first anniversary of the decision by the British Medical Association (BMA), the representative body of doctors in the UK, to divest from fossil fuels.  Robin Stott, co-chair of the Climate and Health Council called upon the Wellcome Trust to follow their leadership. “We feel strongly that the time for stepping up to the plate in the health profession is now here. We must acknowledge the BMA’s leadership – they have been extremely helpful in galvanising the rest of the profession. It would be marvellous if the Wellcome Trust committed to divestment and joined the growing body of health professionals tackling climate change.” In March, the Guardian launched a campaign calling on the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – the world’s largest charitable foundations – to divest from the top 200 coal, oil and gas companies.  Current research shows that in order to meet the target to keep the rise in global temperatures to 2C – agreed by international negotiators as necessary to avoid catastrophic and irreversible levels of climate change – between two-thirds and two-fifths of current fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground.  Farrar said in March: “We consider individual companies on their merits, including the extent to which they meet their environmental responsibilities, when we decide whether or not to invest or stay invested ... when we are not satisfied that a company is engaging with our concerns, we are perfectly prepared to sell.” In April, a group representing one million medical students worldwide published an open letter calling upon the Wellcome Trust to divest from fossil fuels, on the basis that the fossil fuel industry poses a greater risk to human health than tobacco.  A spokesperson for the Wellcome Trust said: “The range of individuals and organisations working to improve health is wide and it would be surprising if this community did not contain a diversity of opinion about how best to reduce carbon emissions. The Wellcome Trust believes that engagement with the small number of energy companies in which we invest gives us the best opportunity to contribute to change, but we understand and respect the views of those who disagree.”"

"The first time Michael Fedak told other researchers he wanted to study climate change by fixing satellite-connected sensors to the heads of deep-diving ocean mammals, the University of St Andrews biology professor was laughed at. But for the past decade, elephant seals have been collecting data from the depths of the ocean via sensors and transmitters stacked on their heads – not unlike fascinators at ladies’ day at the races. Collectively, the sensors have gathered 400,000 data profiles on the temperature and density of sea water, which is being shared globally via an open web portal in the hope it could help the world better understand how oceans are being affected by climate change.  Researchers initially tried working with beluga whales, but when that proved too hard they started working with elephant seals. Such research is only possible thanks to the combination of cheap sensors and ubiquitous connectivity which allows Fedak and his colleagues to build low-cost sensors that can “tweet” data from the heads of elephant seals, via satellites. It’s not the first time the internet of things (IoT) has helped researchers collect data about our world. Writing in Science magazine, researchers at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute said “a golden age of animal-tracking science has begun”, predicting that “the upcoming years will be a time of unprecedented, exciting discoveries”. While the Smithsonian project’s researchers have tracked monkeys, bats, sloths and bees, Harvard researchers have also set out a network of sensors throughout a forest in Massachusetts, giving the trees ears and eyes to collect data about weather, animals and more. All of that could be done before the IoT, though it was harder. Before the advent of smart, connected trackers, researchers would have to stand in a jungle with an antenna to capture the signal from an animal’s radio collar – often disturbing their subject. Now, tracking can be done from a safe, non-disruptive distance.  But that’s animals on land. Before connected trackers, animals such as elephant seals were almost impossible to follow carefully – they dive to depths of 2,000m and traverse the globe from Arctic to Antarctic. So when Fedak came up with a “tag” for the seals and an adhesive to fix it to the heads of the animals, biologists welcomed it – though others didn’t immediately see the potential. Fedak admits the idea was “outlandish”. Elephant seals weigh as much as two tonnes, dive 2,000m below ice and have a habit of rolling around on shore, so it’s easy for the glued-on tag to be knocked off. “The challenge was to get long-term data from a small package in a very harsh environment,” he said. The tag itself includes sensors, storage memory, and a computer loaded with software to manage the whole process, from capturing data to compressing and transmitting it to the satellites. The package also includes the battery. “To be most informative, tags must collect data for up to 11 months or so to capture seasonal changes,” Fedak noted. “How often do you have to charge your phone?” To get around that, Fedak and the others in the team turned to specialised software that uses the on-device computer to make smart decisions about when to collect data and when to transmit – there’s no point in trying to send a text message via a satellite from 2,000m down in the depths of the ocean, after all. The sensors try to collect a few readings each day, and have been programmed to favour data from the deepest dives. “You don’t want a little profile of just the top layer,” Fedak explained. “You want to know what the entire water column is doing.” Every six hours it resets: at the beginning of that period, it will collect data from 1,500m or deeper, but as the time progresses, it degrades its demands – it’s programmed to settle for less. “The tag is selectively trying to make sure that when it turns the sensors on and uses that energy, it is the best possible situation to meet those criteria of getting a profile spread across the day in an even and regular way,” Fedak explained. The tag has the ability to transmit to a satellite up to 250 times a day, but if the seal is below surface, it doesn’t bother sending in order to save energy, instead holding its backlog of data until it’s a good time to transmit. However, the uploads are one-way transmissions – the satellite can’t let the tag know that it’s successfully received the data. To address that, it sends the same message multiple times, taking into account interference; it’s easier to find success with the message in empty polar regions than in busy areas such as the Mediterranean. “The idea of a tag just sort of sending out a tweet is – it’s a lot more involved than that,” Fedak said. “And that’s one of the interesting developments for us, you see – trying to really get those data collections … [and] data transmission strategies to optimise.” Such lessons are surely useful to anyone developing IoT systems, regardless of whether ocean-faring animals are involved or not. However, Fedak noted that his own project has benefited from improvements in consumer technology, too. “We’ve actually been really helped by the general consumer electronics revolution,” he said. “Whenever possible we climb on the back of some other development.” For example, the tags can now send their messages via mobile phone networks, which is not only power efficient but offers higher bandwidth and more coverage. There’s good coverage “because of consumer demand for having cell phone towers every place you go,” said Fedak. If you’ve ever sat along a beach checking your text messages, there’s a fair chance a local seal has done the same.  While Fedak’s instrumentation room built the hardware, it’s been used around the world, with different teams of seal experts attaching the sensors and monitoring the data. It’s a truly communal, global project – with technologists, biologists and more from around the world – and of course the seals themselves. “It has depended on all of these different people,” Fedak said. That global network is at the heart of the new data portal, dubbed MEOP for Marine Mammals Exploring the Oceans Pole to Pole. “This project is a consortium of more than ten nations, and each has its own source of funding and [base of operations], so by having a single portal we are making things very simple for the user,” said Fabien Roquet, the Stockholm University researcher who helped set up the MEOP portal . “All the data that comes from very many places is all in one single database, with a level of quality of the data that is standardised. That is very important for scientists but also for operational oceanography, which aims at forecasting the ocean state in a very similar way to meteorology.” That portal will hopefully convince more people of the value of the data, too. Fedak noted the seal project started with a focus on biology – tracking seals to find more information about the animals themselves – but around the millennium he attended an oceanography meeting, explaining how the data could be applied so much more widely. “At that stage, they laughed,” he said. “I mean literally.” Since then, the many papers that have come out of the data has helped convince detractors. “The more data that gets utilised, the more that’ll happen,” said Fedak. “I think we’ll have an even greater positive feedback situation with the utilisation of these tags going up, as well as more people being able to use that data.” He reminisces about one project that was studying ice cells in the Arctic, key to understanding future sea levels. In one seven-week study, a ship with 20 scientists managed to collect hundreds of ocean profiles. The lead researcher also brought along Fedak and a colleague to tag seals, however. They managed to set up only 14 animals, but those seals collected 12,000 profiles throughout the next year, covering a much wider area throughout the seasons. That sort of result not only helps move forward climate change research, but shows the utility of the internet of seals.  Next, researchers are looking to add more sensors to the seals’ tags, said Roquet. One will look for fluorescence, which lets researchers measure a specific type of phytoplankton, currently studied by satellite, but that doesn’t let researchers see far enough below the surface. “That’s the first step in the food chain, so that’s the most fundamental type of life in the ocean,” he added. “It’s extremely important to observe.”  Fedak is frequently asked about the welfare of the elephant seals. Don’t worry, they’re fine: the sensors are attached with adhesive to the hair on their heads or neck, but as the seals shed their hair annually, the sensors fall off. It’s easy to know how the seals with the tags are doing, as they’re being studied in such detail. One was tracked travelling 1,500 miles to the Arctic where she had her pup before rushing back down to the Amundsen Sea. “They do very well and the tags don’t harm them,” Fedak said. Plus, the data is used to help seals. The sensors not only collect climate data, but information about the animals: how long they spend diving or at the surface, where they migrate to and so on. “We can see what kind of water they are in when they get fat, for example, and where they are doing well and what kind of water masses they do well in,” Fedak explained.  Plus, the data can be used to analyse the rate of climate change and its effect on the oceans – key to the seals’ own survival, let alone our own. “It’s not just using the seals,” Fedak said. “We’re actually trying to get information that will help us be better protectors of what the seals require from the ocean as well.” And who among us wouldn’t wear a silly hat to fight back against climate change?"

"Even to a long-term student of political ventriloquy, the Abbott government’s capacity to speak out of both sides of its mouth on climate policy is astonishing. It claims to run a credible environment policy while pandering to those who would prefer to do nothing. It spends $660m, mostly to continue projects started under the former government’s carbon market or its state precursors, while maintaining as its chief business adviser Maurice Newman, who claims climate change is a UN-led ruse to bring about a new world order.  Greg Hunt continues to claim he has achieved “certainty for the renewable energy sector” with a revised renewable energy target while the prime minister admits the whole point of of the review (headed by self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton) was to reduce the number of “ugly … noisy” wind farms as far as the Senate would allow, and that he’d really like to cut them further. As the well-funded, virulently anti-wind website “Stop These Things” boasted this week, possibly quite accurately, the prime minister’s words could actually achieve what he was unable to get through the Senate. The site (its authors don’t name themselves and went to some lengths to register their domain name anonymously on Christmas Day 2012 through Arizona-based domainnamesbyproxyit) says that from its perspective, “the more attention the better. You see, the wind industry’s ability to roll out the 2,500 giant fans [it means turbines] needed to satisfy the latest [RET] … depends upon commercial lending institutions [i.e. banks]. “With all the sound, fury and bloodletting taking place in the media on a daily basis, no banker in touch with their earthly senses is going to lend so much as a penny to a wind power outfit to build any new wind farms from here on. The insurmountable obstacle to that event can be summed up in a single word: RISK.” And if the prime minister’s public declaration that he’d really like to reduce “these things” even further wasn’t enough to kill the industry, a group of anti-wind senators are doing their best to impose enough red tape and regulation and RISK to finish off the job. As revealed in a letter leaked to Guardian Australia this week, Hunt has already agreed to establish a new “wind commissioner” and a new scientific committee to investigate, again, claims that turbines harm human health. With the vote on the RET not scheduled until Monday, the senators are using the weekend to try to win even more anti-wind concessions. The Senate inquiry into the wind industry has heard evidence from people who genuinely believe their health has been harmed by wind turbines and some of the senators may be motivated by concern for them, but no scientific study has yet backed any asserted health claims, and many of the senators just want to shut down wind. They just don’t want to say so because renewable energy is popular, and in the case of the Coalition members, that is not supposed to be their policy, except if it happens to be a day when the prime minister is talking to Alan Jones. Nor is it credible for the government to pretend they wanted more renewables – just not wind power. If that was their aim they would have “reserved” some of the RET target for different technologies when they came into office, instead of appointing a self-professed climate sceptic to conduct a review, stalling investment and starving the whole sector into submission. Yes, along with the wind commissioner, the government has agreed to ask the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to do more to fund large-scale solar, but that’s the same CEFC the government is committed to abolish, so one could be excused for not finding that promise hugely reassuring. Hunt also can’t tell the chief UN climate negotiator, Christiana Figueres, that Australia is going to cut greenhouse emissions from industry and electricity generation when the prime minister made sure the only mechanism he had to do this – the so-called “safeguards mechanism” in Direct Action had no teeth. He can’t pretend his Direct Action policy is capable of meeting whatever target Australia signs up to in Paris at the end of the year without some cap on industrial or electricity sector emissions. And the prime minister can’t claim “climate change is real, humanity does make a contribution to it and we’ve got to take effective action against it” and at the same time say emissions trading is “a so-called market in the non-delivery of an invisible substance to no one.” Whatever policy a political party proposes to reduce Australia’s emissions, it has to be a real one, an effective one, that solves a problem that party actually believes is real. Labor says it remains committed to a market mechanism to reduce emissions but has not yet taken even basic decisions about the policy it will propose at the next election. The government is utterly convinced it will be able to annihilate the ALP with a rerun of its “great big new tax on everything” anti-emissions trading scheme campaign. The only reason the Coalition is talking out of both sides of its mouth is because it knows it can’t come right out and say “we don’t really believe this stuff, and even if we did, we don’t think Australia should have to do much about it and we don’t propose that our policy will force much real change”. The latest Lowy poll shows Australians’ concerns about climate change are rapidly growing. Voters know doing nothing is not an option. The Coalition’s contradictions may soon become so obvious the ventriloquy act will stop working."
"Last year, the CEO of Fortune 250 energy provider NRG wrote a letter to shareholders about the lack of innovation in the energy industry. “There is no Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Google in the American energy industry today,” David Crane wrote. “NRG is not that energy company either, but we are doing everything in our power to head in that direction – as fast as we can. But we need to pick up the pace further, and that is what we intend to do.” Although NRG’s portfolio still includes 30% coal-generated power, it is repositioning itself and its business model to guide energy users from a grid-based power system to a distributed generation system. It’s also developing products and services related to electric vehicles, rooftop solar and home energy efficiency.   As business leaders begin to see themselves as part of a larger system that is grappling with challenging business conditions – in NRG’s case, climate change risks, the possibility of a price on carbon, and disruptive innovations in renewable and distributed energy – many recognize the need for dramatic shifts in the way they do business. They also see new opportunities to help their customers adapt to and thrive in a more sustainable future.  In a forthcoming report on business model innovation, Model Behavior II: Strategies to Rewire Business, SustainAbility tells the stories of four multinational companies that have shifted their business models to become more sustainable.  For Novelis, rather than continuing to source virgin, primary aluminum, it moved to recycled aluminum because it made more financial sense and would position the company to be resilient to climate change.  To differentiate itself from competitors at the high and low end of the market, Starbucks realized that green building provided more value to numerous stakeholders.  Fibria acknowledged that while demand for its traditional paper products would remain strong for years, it was risky to depend on historic patterns of demand and began to shift its mindset about how to use its forest and land assets differently.  And as part of a larger effort to retain its core customers – farmers – Syngenta changed its sales approach to focus more on what farmers needed to capture extra value from their yields.  The new models adopted by these companies are more financially sound in the long term. They also provide increased value to communities, employees, the environment and future generations. Ideally, the business case for a shift towards greater sustainability is clear for large companies. But the link between sustainability and financial gain may be murky for some companies or industries, especially when those industries have historically externalized costs. Nonetheless, part of the appeal of system-level transformations, including business model shifts, is reconsidering the economic landscape so that new, radical and more sustainable developments also make financial sense. What might the future hold? What if pharmaceutical companies contributed to disease prevention alongside treatment, or if food and beverage companies profited based on improved nutritional outcomes? What if entertainment companies educated their audiences as much as they amused them? Could oil and gas companies take the lead in the transition to a low-carbon economy, becoming the key to rapid scaling of renewable energy? Or might agricultural companies become profitable by prioritizing the value chain livelihoods and ecosystems upon which they depend? These are the kinds of business model shifts towards sustainability that we need to see to ensure a sustainable future.  In the past, sustainability innovation has been focused on creating new products or processes that incrementally enhance an established business or brand. But companies must be more ambitious in their innovation aims, and business model innovation provides a path forward for companies that wish to prepare for and succeed in a more resource-constrained future.  For any one company, business model innovation for sustainability will derive from a confluence of three key factors: evolving external conditions; the company’s underlying culture and capacity to innovate; and the actions and intentions of the sustainability innovator.  The companies and innovators that focus on these factors will create business models that can initiate and thrive in a more sustainable future. This will require ambitious leadership from inside companies: both CEOs and individual sustainability innovators must stick their necks out to create and support a vision of what a new business model might look like.  NRG and its CEO have set the bar high for other companies in the energy industry. In a series of upcoming posts, we will examine how each factor drives business model innovation for sustainability."

"The Obama administration is issuing new rules intended to improve fuel efficiency for medium and heavy-duty trucks and cut pollution blamed for global warming. The proposed standards are expected to lower carbon dioxide emissions by about 1bn metric tons, cut fuel costs by about $170bn and reduce oil consumption by up to 1.8bn barrels over the lifetime of vehicles sold under the rule.  The long-expected rules were announced on Friday, one day after Pope Francis issued a teaching document calling for the world to take action to slow climate change. The transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx, said the new rules would help the environment and the economy, as trucks use less fuel and shipping costs go down. He called the rules “good news all around”."
"Activists have occupied Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall with the aim of giving an all-night performance criticising BP’s sponsorship of the gallery. The group intend to cover the hall’s 152-metre sloping floor, which once housed the oil-fired turbines of the Bankside power station, with thousands of charcoaled words of warning about climate change.   The performers said the art work would take 25 hours to complete, if they manage to remain inside the building, and is timed to coincide with a full tide cycle. Eva Blackwell, of the arts activism group Liberate Tate, said the protest was “a textual intervention”.  “We’re filling the Turbine Hall with a tide of ideas and narratives of art, activism, climate change and oil,” she said.  The words were sourced from a range of books and reports, including Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel Oryx and Crake, the UN’s latest climate science report and Naomi Klein’s This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate. The Tate has tolerated the group’s performances in the past, including a naked man being doused in oil at Tate Britain, extracts from the court case against BP’s Gulf of Mexico oil spill whispered throughout their galleries and a public exorcism of the “evil spirit of BP”. There have been 14 events in all.  The Turbine Hall performance, however, is the first to defy the gallery’s opening hours, and a showdown with the Tate’s security team is likely before it closes at 10pm.  Protester Yasmin de Silva said the group was compelled to adopt a more antagonistic attitude by the looming climate talks in Paris in December. “Oil companies like BP are trying to carry on pretending its business as usual, but time is running out to act on climate change. We’re already seeing the impact of climate change globally, and companies, foundations and institutions around the world are turning away from the fossil fuel industry that’s driving us to climate disaster,” she said. The group began protesting against the Tate’s links with BP in 2010. In January, after a three-year legal battle over a freedom of information request, it was forced to reveal the extent of BP’s support, which amounts to an average of £224,000 a year.  The gallery has described BP’s contribution as considerable, but according to campaigners from Platform, which made the FOI request, it represents just 0.3% of the Tate’s 2013-14 operating budget. They have described the sum as “tiny” and questioned why the Tate has clung so hard to the funding. Elisabeth Monro, a Tate visitor who used to work in art sponsorship, said the performance was “as valid an installation art piece as anything else here. The whole reason to have modern art is to have dialogue.”She said she did not necessarily agree with the protesters’ call for the Tate to drop BP’s money, but that it was a “surprisingly low” amount. “We all benefit from corporate sponsorship of the arts. Without corporate sponsorship we wouldn’t have buildings like this, because the government doesn’t give enough,” she said. “I think it’s very difficult where you draw the line about which company is acceptable.” Glen Tarman, a member of the Liberate Tate movement since its inception, said: “Art museums are places where we make sense of the world. We make meaning from our lives and they contain what we most value. We shouldn’t be complicit in climate change just because we appreciate great art.” He said the group was increasing its calls for the Tate to drop BP’s sponsorship because the deal was due to expire in 2016. He said the growing divestment movement, which has seen the Rockefeller Foundation, the Church of England and dozens of universities drop fossil fuel investments, was an example of the mounting view that public institutions should not be tied to the companies that drive climate change. “We wanted to do a performance that confronted them more fully. This year public institutions are breaking links with fossil fuels every week. This work is about calling on the Tate to make their decision [about whether to renew their contract with BP] earlier, preferably by the Paris climate talks in December.” Many visitors to the Tate Modern were initially unaware that the performance was unsanctioned. Frances O’Neill, an artist, said she had viewed the work from the balcony above and, without knowing it was a protest was nonetheless “really, really moved”. “I was just mesmerised by the visuals of it. I didn’t know what they were writing, I just got filled with a deep sadness,” she said. Once she read the interpretation signs laid out by the group she said she was supportive of the action. “Someone’s got to do these sort of things. Someone’s got to say our planet’s being damaged. It may not be sponsored [by the Tate], but they are doing what the Tate does,” she said. Another visitor, Audrey Valentine, said she thought it was wonderful the Tate was allowing the protest to unfold, but she that she did not agree with its message. “If these big boys didn’t do these things, are you suggesting that government should pay? They should put some money back,” she said. Liberate Tate’s campaign against the Tate’s relationship with BP is part of a wider drive to rid the art world of oil patronage. The British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and National Theatre are among many major UK cultural institutions that receive support from fossil fuel companies."

"Beekeepers, surfers, nuns and children were among thousands of people who lined up outside the Houses of Parliament on Wednesday to speak to their MP about climate change.  Some had woken up in the early hours to travel from as far as Polzeath in Cornwall and Aberdeen to take part in what organisers believe is the UK’s biggest ever lobby on climate change.  Around 9,000 constituents took part in person, lobbying around 250 MPs according to the Climate Coalition, the group of charities, unions and faith groups that organised the event. London mayoral hopeful and Conservative MP, Zac Goldsmith, Caroline Lucas of the Green party and Labour leadership contender Jeremy Corbyn were among the MPs meeting with constituents. The event came the day before Pope Francis is due to deliver a historic encyclical on climate change. Organisers said they hope it will build public pressure and political momentum in the final months before a landmark Paris conference on climate change in December. Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, said that the lobby sent out a strong message to parliament. “A lot of people have said how disappointed they were that climate change didn’t feature more highly in the election campaign. This shows how much people care about the issue.” Groups formed in the sunshine along the river stretching from the House of Commons down to Lambeth Palace. Liz Crew woke up at 2am to travel to Westminster from the Somerset Levels where her farm was flooded last year. “I was very badly affected by the flooding in 2014 with lots of our village being completely inundated with water – up to 7ft in places. Life is still not back to normal. We really don’t want to go through it again. It’s important that someone speaks out on climate change.  “In my part of Somerset we have been very remiss at dealing with this for various reasons – cutbacks and local authorities turning a blind eye. It really does seem to be impacting on the amount of water there is around us.” Called Speak Up for the Love Of, the mass lobby encouraged participants to share something that they love that will be threatened by climate change. MPs were transported to their constituents on bicycle taxis and grilled on a variety of climate issues from food security to conservation to sport. Schoolchildren also took part: Ava and Ruby, both aged eight, from London, met their MP, Labour’s Vicky Foxcroft, of Lewisham Deptford. Ava said: “I’d miss chocolate – if climate change occurs it will be too hot for cocoa beans to grow. Ruby would miss London because if it gets too hot the polar ice caps will melt and London will be submerged beneath the waves. We think Vicky Foxcroft should tell people to stop drilling for oil and make sure they have 100% clean air and energy.” Ava also said she wanted to become an MP. Jeremy Corbyn, MP for Islington North, who turned up to meet constituents by the river on his bicycle, took questions about bees, global inequality and biodiversity. Corbyn said that if elected Labour leader he would push the sustainability agenda. “We’ve made a lot of progress on environmental policy in the Labour party. I now want us to look at the whole question of sustainability and to set that into a policy change.” The mass lobby was followed by a rally outside parliament with comedians Arthur Smith Olympic rower Andy Hodge and the indie band Stornoway. A reception with Amber Rudd, secretary of state for energy and climate change, was later hosted at Marks & Spencer headquarters, where supporters were shown a video message from Mary Robinson, the UN’s special envoy for climate change.  But it was longstanding environmental campaigner Asad Rehman of the Climate Coalition who gave the most impassioned speech: “We are in a time of crisis,” he said. “All around the world we can see the reality of climate change: the droughts, the floods and the famines. We see it in the dead bodies in the Mediterranean and in the typhoons. We know the names of the companies responsible for their deaths.  “All around the world we are seeing an unprecedented movement of people in its breadth and diversity: it spans the communities in the Amazon fighting to stop deforestation and Bangladeshi fisher folk protecting their mangroves. It includes men, women and children in Nigeria protesting against Shell and the oil spills.” The mass lobby comes as the pope prepares to deliver a historic encyclical on Thursday about the “grave consequences” of climate change in absence of a radical global change in lifestyles and energy production and consumption. In a draft of the document leaked to L’Espresso magazine, the pope calls for a new global authority to tackle “the reduction of pollution and the development of poor countries and regions”. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, arrived at Westminster complete with wetsuit and surf board. “We represent the interests of surfers and other sports enthusiasts who love our coastline and particularly love our surfing habitats. They are at the forefront of the impacts of climate change – whether that’s sea level rises, ocean acidification or increased rainfalls.” A “bunting petition” stretched along the River Thames, on which lobbyists had written what they love that will be affected by climate change. “For the love of bikes”, read one. “For the love of our home”, read another. Chris Bain, director of the Catholic development charity Cafod, said: “I think [the pope] feels that given 2015 is such a critical year for development, poverty and climate change, he wants to signal that this is a moral issue of our time and he wants politicians all over the world to take it seriously. He estimated that more than 800 Catholics from parishes around the country and from dozens of schools had made the journey to Westminster. At a service in Westminster ahead of Wednesday’s lobbying event, the Bishop of Salisbury, Rt Revd Nicholas Holtam, said: “This is not just our individual concern. It is our Christian concern together as the church. It is the concern of people of all faiths. It is our human concern in solidarity with all people. The world is our home.” In December, negotiators representing more than 190 countries will meet in Paris for a conference designed to create a new global climate change deal largely focused on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Any deal would come into force in 2020, when current commitments are due to expire. The Guardian has launched a campaign, Keep it in the Ground, to shine a light on the impacts of climate change and the barriers to action. As part of this, it is asking the world’s largest charitable foundations – the Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation – to divest from fossil fuel companies. "

"Pope Francis’s encyclical, subtitled Care for our Common Home, has created a global news event. The question now is whether it will become a historic news event, by galvanising real action to avert catastrophic climate change. There’s a chance it will, for two reasons. First, the moral force the pope brings to bear may kindle that most fragile necessity: political will. Second, his declaration of the atmosphere as a common good, owned by all for all, may help settle the enduring argument about which nations have the responsibility to act. The rich owe the poor, he says. Climate change, the mass extinction of species and the poisoning of the oceans have been unfolding like slow-motion disasters for decades and universally damage the lives of the poor for the benefit of the rich. The science is now beyond any reasonable dispute and the economic benefit of acting is clear.  Yet for many people these planetary crises have not felt, deep down, like moral issues. They are too distant in time and space, affecting people we don’t know and creatures we have never heard of. As coal, oil and gas continue to be burned, and emissions rise, the risk of floods, famines, heatwaves and refugees that will affect us all rises. And yet so little has been achieved to curb the use of fossil fuels. The pope provides the clearest and loudest moral case yet for action now, firmly rooted in justice for the world’s poor.  “We have to realise that a true ecological approach always becomes a social approach; it must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor,” he writes. “Leaving an inhabitable planet to future generations is, first and foremost, up to us. The issue is one which dramatically affects us, for it has to do with the ultimate meaning of our earthly sojourn.”  This moral leadership is important, says climate economist Lord Nick Stern, because of “the failure of many heads of state and government around the world to show political leadership”. But it also matters in the very worldly pursuit of getting a strong, workable climate change agreement at a crunch UN summit in Paris in December. “You should never underestimate the soft power of moral arguments,” says Professor Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, a Catholic and who met Pope Francis in July 2014 to brief him on climate change. “It does not provide you with an immediate bargaining chip in the negotiations, but in the end when global agreements are not perceived as fair and just, they are very hard to implement.” Edenhofer points to a single, short sentence in the encyclical as profound: “The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all.”  From this simple statement follows radical consequences, Edenhoder says. It means that the last carbon emissions we can afford to leak into the atmosphere before disaster strikes must be distributed equitably among all the people of the world - and the rich nations have already had their fair share. As the pope puts it, “a true ecological debt exists, particularly between the global north and south”. The woman charged with delivering the global climate deal, the UN’s Christiana Figueres is in no doubt of the encyclical’s importance: “It will have a major impact. It will speak to the moral imperative of addressing climate change in a timely fashion in order to protect the most vulnerable.” That is the positive case. There are numerous argument as to why the pope’s carefully timed intervention may in the end prove to be little more than a passing distraction. Of the biggest polluters – China, US, India, Russia, Japan – only the US has significant Catholic population and that is riven by partisan division. On the other hand, some south American nations have been obstructive in the global climate negotiations and may be swayed by the pope. Some may think the pope’s moral authority is overstated, given the Catholic church’s differences with much of the modern world on contraception and homosexuality and the corrosive child abuse cover-ups. Yet Pope Francis is more often seen in a positive light than a negative one. Only time will reveal the true impact of the encyclical on the greatest long-term challenge facing civilisation. But if the moral argument it presents moves the problem from one that “should” be tackled sometime to one that “must” be tackled now, it will have performed a remarkable act.  Perhaps one might even call it a miracle."
"Xiuhtezcatl Roske-Martinez was six when he gave his first speech about climate change.  “I wanted to go to all the factories with my brother and shut them down. And when I turned six, I found out that it was us that were supporting the factories. We’re the ones fuelling the destruction of our environment with our money.” Now he is 14, Roske-Martinez, indigenous environmental eco hip-hop artist and activist running the environmental organisation Earth Guardians. He raps, he lectures and when he has the time, he speaks at the UN.  But Roske-Martinez is just one of the young voices we’ve been showcasing in the past fortnight as part of #GroundUp, our series on the generation most affected by climate change.  Finn Harries, film-maker and co-founder of video blog JacksGap, opened the series; he told us why his generation must save the planet. We found the young climate activists to watch in the run up to December’s landmark conference in Paris and heard from the world champion freerunner Tim Shieff on why going vegetarian will save the planet. If you’re a fan of Minecraft, we hope you dived into the world of Climate Hope City – where hydrogen powered boats glide through the freshest crystal waters and natural fruit and vegetables grow on multi-storey farms.

Don’t worry – take a tour in the video below.  “Our Earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth”: these are the words of the Pope, published on Thursday in his historic encyclical on climate change. In the 180-page document, Pope Francis blamed the indifference of those in power for the “grave social debt” owed to the poor by rich nations.  On Tuesday we launched the fourth in our series on carbon bombs: the world’s biggest fossil fuel reserves, that if exploited will take us significantly closer to a 2C rise in global temperatures. This week, we saw energy correspondent Terry Macalister visit one of Earth’s most harsh yet vulnerable landscapes: the Arctic, where warming is occurring at twice the rate of the rest of the planet.  It’s now been two weeks since Alan Rusbridger, who launched Keep it in the Ground in March, stepped down from his role as Guardian editor-in-chief. So as the first phase of the campaign draws to a close, we launch the final episode in the first series of our behind the scenes podcast, the biggest story in the world. The team gather and ask: what has been the impact so far? What is the political state affairs six months from the landmark climate change conference in Paris? And what does the new editor-in-chief Kath Viner think? Download the latest episode here.  If you went down to London’s Tate Modern museum last weekend, you might not have recognised the famous Turbine hall. Activists in occupation for 25 hours charcoaled its 152-metre floor with words of warning about climate change in protest at the museum’s sponsorship by oil giant BP. It’s been quite a week for climate activism. On Wednesday thousands of people – from beekeepers to surfers to schoolchildren – from across the UK turned up at the Houses of Parliament to participate in the country’s biggest ever climate climate change lobby.

"Life on Earth is in trouble. That much we know. But how bad have things become – and how fast are events moving? How soon, indeed, before the Earth’s biological treasures are trashed, in what will be the sixth great mass extinction event? This is what Gerardo Caballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and his colleagues have assessed, in a paper that came out on Friday. These are extraordinarily difficult questions. There are many millions of species, many elusive and rare, and inhabiting remote and dangerous places. There are too few skilled biologists in the field to keep track of them all. Demonstrating beyond reasonable doubt that any single species is extinct is arduous and painstaking (think how long it took to show – to most people, at least – that Loch Ness probably does not harbour a large monster).  And it’s not just a case of making a head-count of modern extinctions. This needs to be compared with a long-term “baseline” rate of extinctions in our planet’s long geological history. This can only be extracted via the equally painstaking and difficult work of excavating and identifying millions of fossils from the almost endless rock strata. Not surprisingly, different studies made so far on different fossils have yielded different baseline rates. Caballos and colleagues have thought through these difficulties, and come up with probably the most robust estimate yet of how severe the modern crisis is. They have been deliberately conservative – they’re well aware of the dangers of crying wolf on a topic of such importance, and where passions run so high. For a start, they limit themselves to the best-studied group of organisms, the vertebrates. Then, they take a high estimate of background extinctions to compare with, to make the modern figures as undramatic as possible. And then, they either consider only those animals known to be extinct (the “highly conservative” scenario), or they add in those extinctions in the wild that are likely to have happened, but are not yet verified. Even with this caution, the figures are still shocking. Rather than the nine extinctions among vertebrates that would be expected to have occurred in normal geological circumstances since 1900, their conservative estimate adds in another 468 extinctions, spread among mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. Examples of lost species would include the Yangtze dolphin and the Costa Rica golden toad. Depending on the group, extinction rates are 10 times to more than 100 times higher than normal. A sixth mass extinction, therefore, is beginning. They estimate that it would grow to rival the last great catastrophe of the past, when the dinosaurs and much else died out 65m years ago, in as little as three human lifetimes. Once more, this is a conservative estimate. It simply considers the kill mechanisms operating today, of habitat loss, predation, pollution and so on. The Caballos projection does not try to factor in, for instance, the effects of global warming, or of ocean acidification. Once these kick in in earnest, they will sweep many species out of their habitability zones, and ratchet up the extinction rate still further. In terms of scale, we are now living through one of those brief, rare episodes in Earth history when the biological framework of life is dismantled. It is in every sense a tragedy – but, in itself, it might be viewed as just one more episode of biological destruction in our planet’s history. The Earth has been here before – and will be here again, before its life is completely extinguished a billion or so years into the future. This particular perturbation to the biosphere, though, has some very special features. Indeed, there has been nothing remotely like it in our planet’s history. By coincidence, one of the authors of the Caballos study, Anthony Barnosky of the University of California at Berkeley, was involved in another study published the same week, a study that sought to put its finger on exactly what is so different – and so weird, in planetary terms, not to put too fine a point on it – about what is happening to the biosphere right now. This second study, led by Mark Williams, a palaeontologist at the University of Leicester, identified some quite extraordinary novelties at the heart of current events. First, past extinctions have been driven by what are now becoming very familiar horsemen of a planetary apocalypse: massive volcanic outbursts to choke the atmosphere and poison the seas; the mayhem caused by major asteroid impact; and the wrenching effects of rapid climate change. None of these has really figured in the current biological crisis – not even climate change, which is still only in its early stages. Instead, the extinctions are being driven by the effects of just one single species, Homo sapiens. Such a mass extinction has not occurred before (with the possible exception, 2.5bn years ago, when a type of microbe evolved photosynthesis to spew out oxygen, a gas that would have been highly toxic to the other microbes living then, and these would have been pushed to the fringes of life on Earth – where they still remain). Even more extraordinarily, this single species is land-living, but has managed to become the top predator in the oceans too, causing populations of whales and fish to collapse. In all, our single species now commandeers somewhere between 25% and 40% of primary productivity on Earth. It is a productivity, that over large areas of land, is “hyper-fertilised” by the extraction of millions of tons of nitrogen from the air, in the Haber-Bosch process, and by digging comparable amounts of phosphate from the ground. These super-fed crops are fed, highly efficiently, to farm animals, that we eat in turn. The scale of this operation is a large reason for the scale of the ongoing mass extinction of other organisms. The scientist Vaclav Smil, of the University of Manitoba, has calculated that simply measured by mass, humans now make up a third of land vertebrates, and the animals that we keep to eat – cows, pigs, sheep and so on – make up most of the other two thirds. All the wild animals – elephants, giraffes, tigers and so on – are now less than 5% by mass. It’s a measure of how they have been pushed to the fringes by humans. Humans change things in other ways – they now direct the evolution of the animals that are useful to them, by breeding and by genetic engineering: again, it’s a planetary novelty. The energy our species obtains from photosynthesis is not enough, and so we mine stored photosynthetic energy from the ground, as hydrocarbons, in enormous amounts, and use that to power our machines. These machines – cars, planes, computers and much else – have, together with their human software, been termed the technosphere by the geologist Peter Haff of Duke University. He views it as an emergent system with its own internal dynamics (and which humans currently drive but don’t really control) – in effect an offshoot of the biosphere. Whatever it is, it is evolving at lightning speed by comparison with biological evolution. The changes to the Earth’s biology do, therefore, include a rapidly developing mass extinction event, as charted by Gerardo Caballos and his colleagues. But this may be seen as part of a much more thoroughgoing transformation. Fundamental new patterns are emerging that may be compared, say, with the change, half a billion years ago, when a biosphere consisting only of microbes gave way to one dominated by multicellular animals. Could this new planetary pattern develop – perhaps well enough to help prevent a mass extinction? Currently, the technosphere is more a parasite than a partner of the biosphere – it is terrible at recycling, for instance. But some aspects might help alleviate the worst effects of global warming. For instance, humans have caused the greatest trans-migration of species in history. Some of these invasive species may be well adapted to new higher temperatures. And better use of energy and materials can reduce pressure on remaining natural ecosystems. Averting a mass extinction is still possible – but we don’t have much time. The author is professor of palaeobiology at Leicester University Geological history includes many periods when species have died in large numbers. In each of the following, more than half the Earth’s species disappeared: This coincides with very rapid glaciation; sea level fell by more than 100 metres, devastating shallow marine ecosystems; less than a million years later, there was a second wave of extinctions as ice melted, sea level rose rapidly, and oceans became oxygen-depleted.  A messy prolonged event, again hitting life in shallow seas very hard, and an extinction that was probably due to climate change.  The greatest of all, ‘The Great Dying’ of more than 95% of species, is strongly linked with massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia that caused, among other effects, a brief savage episode of global warming. This has been linked with another huge outburst of volcanism.  This killed off the dinosaurs and much else; an asteroid impact on Mexico probably did the damage, but the world’s ecosystem may have been weakened by volcanic outbursts in what is now India. "

"Giles Fraser (Loose canon, 20 June) is far from alone in welcoming the pope’s encyclical Laudato Si’, but it seems that many politicians are not as concerned as the Holy Father. On 17 June I attended the mass lobby of parliament (Report, 18 June) to talk with my MP about climate change. Those of us from Central Devon constituency had informed our MP, Mel Stride, of our intention and asked to see him. None of us received any response then, or on the day, despite him being in the house. To date we have still not heard anything from our representative. Putting aside personal feelings about our treatment, I suggest that this is indicative of many politicians’ laissez-faire attitude to climate change.  Thankfully, religious leaders are now speaking out. The pope has written in his encyclical of the urgent need to reduce climate change gases. On 17 June the Lambeth Declaration on Climate Change – signed by representatives of the Church of England, Muslims, Sikhs, the Catholic Church in England and Wales, the Methodist Conference and Jewish communities – spoke of the same urgent need for action. The scientific evidence that climate change is exacerbated by our activity is utterly compelling. It matters not where your political allegiances lie: climate change threatens us all. It is a threat to the whole of the natural world and we are just one species among thousands, but we are the only species that has the power to do something about it.Dr John AdeyChristow, Devon  • The Guardian’s good coverage of Pope Francis’s encyclical (Francis issues passionate call for action on climate change, 19 June; Analysis, 19 June; Editorial, 19 June) missed a crucial theological point that could prove vital in rebuffing the arguments of climate sceptics and those with vested interests. The book of Genesis is frequently used to justify man’s “dominion” over the Earth, and hence exploitation of its resources for our own needs. Yet Pope Francis is unequivocal in the encyclical that “this is not a correct interpretation of the Bible as understood by the church”. He could not be clearer that we must respect the laws of nature and protect the Earth for future generations. Humans are part of nature, not its overlords, and caring for ourselves and for nature is inseparable in caring for our common home.Neil ThornsDirector of advocacy, Cafod • Pope Francis’s encyclical “on care for our common home” introduces two terms buried by modern economics: “need” and “greed”. These represent two opposing worldviews. One seeks to satisfy our wants or preferences, which are limitless, non-satiable, substitutable and amoral. The other prioritises meeting universal human needs, which are limited, sufficient, non-substitutable and with clear ethical grounding. By counterposing these and putting them centre-stage, he has clarified the egregious moral dilemma inherent in climate change in a way that can unite both religion and humanism. The pope also takes issue with the arguments of green growth, which is the current dominant strategy to handle climate change. Yes, we must support the fastest possible decarbonisation of the global economy through eco-efficiency, as Nicholas Stern persuasively argues in his new book, but at some point, very soon, we will need to switch to post-growth strategies. This revolutionary encyclical challenges both current ethics and economics.Prof Ian GoughLondon School of Economics • George Monbiot is sending an important message (The pope can see what many atheist greens will not, 17 June). A deep love of Nature is the thread that binds together all the different Pagan spiritual paths, without necessarily enjoining any belief in specific deities. Pagans not only feel a love for Nature but are aware that we are part of Nature: all life is connected and is miraculous. This sense of connectedness gives rise to deep feelings of love, awe, humility and reverence that are truly spiritual and feed the inner being, but followed by shame at humankind’s heedless arrogance and shortsightedness.Jean WilliamsLondon • It is impossible not to welcome Pope Francis’s concern for the future of our planet, but he is only looking at one aspect of the problem (Francis to target climate change deniers in encyclical before visit to US, 16 June). Emissions of CO2 are a function of carbon emissions per capita and world population. It is illogical to concentrate on the carbon footprint of individuals while ignoring population growth, an issue where the Catholic church could make a real difference. The pope will lack credibility until he acknowledges that contraception is a vital component in the fight against climate change.Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • Regarding Simon Jenkins’ article on the global refugee crisis (The human tide the west doesn’t want, 19 June), all this is before the coming tide of climate refugees has even started.Pam LunnKenilworth, Warwickshire"
"European Union politicians have written to US members of Congress pleading for them to remove a last-minute amendment that would bar Barack Obama from making action on climate change a condition of international trade negotiations. A climate provision included at the eleventh hour in a bill to be voted on by the US House of Representatives on Friday would ban Obama from acting on climate or immigration while engaged in trade negotiations. The manoeuvre has been denounced by Democrats, environmentalists and European allies, including a number of members of the European parliament. The climate provision was inserted this week into a related trade bill also being voted on today by Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican and former vice-presidential candidate who, in an unlikely partnership, has been shoring up votes in the House of Representatives for the president. Ryan’s provision was intended to appease rightwing members of his party, who claim that Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) plans are a backdoor way of expanding governmental action on immigration and climate without consulting Congress. Hours before the US House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on whether to give Obama “fast-track” authority – known as trade promotion authority – on trade deals, which would make such deals easier to pass by forcing them to go to an up/down vote without amendment, several members of the European parliament (MEPs) sent a letter to their American counterparts asking them to remove the amendment. Trade promotion authority would give Obama authority to negotiate both the TPP and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which is the planned trade agreement between the US and EU.  But EU representatives who want to take action on climate change say they cannot do it on their own.  “Our capacity for showing leadership together is enormous,” the MEPs wrote to US lawmakers on Friday, pointing out that US and EU together account for “over half of world trade”.  “You will be aware that the protection of the environment is a major priority for the people of Europe and the European parliament. Ruling out any action to protect the planet from global warming and climate change would deal a major blow to the prospects of reaching agreement on the TTIP which the parliament is due shortly to consider, and which we have been told should become a ‘gold standard’ for international trade agreements.” Among the signatories of the letter urging US lawmakers to exclude the climate change amendment were Italian MEP Gianni Pittella and British Labour MEPs Glenis Willmott, Paul Brannen, Judith Kirton-Darling, Seb Dance and Lucy Anderson. The European parliament has the power on behalf of its member countries to block trade measures like the TTIP or the Trade in Services Agreement (Tisa), a deal being negotiated between 51 countries including the EU and the US. Earlier this week MEPs threatened to block the Tisa deal over concerns that it might limit their rights to set carbon emissions limits for airlines and ships.  “There is a real risk that our ability to set our own climate laws based on our own values will be made impossible,” the Green MEP Claude Turmes said at that time. “Both TTIP and Tisa are jeopardising European democracy.” The main complaint raised by the MEPs is that the climate amendment would leave Obama powerless come December when he is set to take a leadership role at a United Nations climate change conference in Paris. “Tackling climate change is essential for everybody’s prosperity,” the MEPs wrote to US Congress on Friday. “As the global community prepares for the UN climate conference in Paris this December we do not believe that it is anyone’s interests to be seeking to limit or restrict the scope for international agreements to help us make progress on addressing global warming and climate change.” The UN conference is theoretically aimed at bringing countries – led by the US – to legally binding agreements on greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  With Obama no longer able to mix trade and climate, his leadership role would ring “hollow” and “hypocritical”, Congressman Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona and a vocal opponent of TPP, told the Guardian. “We will be going into these international meetings with our tails between our legs,” Grijalva said. But Grijalva said that even indirectly conceding to the right wing of the Republican party in order to help pass TPP put Obama in the same boat as climate deniers and extremists. Having to bow to the needs of politicians who did not believe in climate change would have long-term devastating impacts on efforts to address global warming, he said. “To sign the treaties that are binding, that put restraints on our nation’s ability to enter into climate negotiations internationally, is hypocritical and certainly does not do anything in terms of enhancing our reputation as a leader on the issue of climate change,” he said. Obama has found more allies among Republicans on the TPP than Democrats. The deal between the US and 11 other Pacific Rim countries – the contents of which have not been made available to the public – is widely acknowledged as being in big business’s interest. Unions and green groups have warned of resulting job losses and the possibility of an enhanced global fossil fuel market that could in turn increase greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate global warming. Bill Waren, a trade policy analyst with Friends of the Earth, called the climate provision “a cynical ploy to try and pass fast-track legislation at the cost of addressing climate change”. Even without the extra silencing climate provision, Waren said, the TPP was set to wreak havoc on the environment. Through deregulation the TPP would help facilitate fossil fuel companies’ business operations around the word, Waren said. Chevron and Exxon Mobil were two vocal advocates of the deal, he said. Under TPP and TTIP the US would probably increase, not decrease, its production of coal and natural gas and become a major exporter, Waren said, and tribunals probably headed by private corporate lawyers, not judges, would enable corporations to sue governments if they introduced new legislation that constrained their profit. This meant an oil company could sue a government that introduced environmentally conscious legislation."

"Australians’ sunny optimism is dimming, according to an annual snapshot of the country’s attitude, which recorded the lowest feelings of safety and gloomiest economic outlook in the poll’s 11-year history. Concern for climate change rose again, Indonesia was on the nose, and Islamic State dominated Australians’ fears, according to the 2015 Lowy Institute poll. Fewer than one in four (24%) of the 1,200 people surveyed said they felt “very safe”, down 20% from 2009. The emergence of Isis – described last week by Tony Abbott as “coming if it can for every person and every government” – ranked as the highest threat. Comparatively fewer (20%) saw a military conflict between the US and China as “high risk”, while 77% saw China as “more of an economic partner to Australia” than a “military threat”.  Warming sentiments towards the Asian giant had limits, however, with seven in 10 agreeing the government allowed “too much” Chinese investment in residential real estate.  Economic optimism fell 13%, the largest drop in the poll’s history. It came off a high base: 63% of Australians remain at least optimistic about Australia’s economic performance over the next five years. With a UN climate change conference looming, 63% also said the country should “commit to significant reductions” in carbon emissions. A plurality, 43%, believed solar energy would be Australia’s primary source of energy in 10 years. The next highest was coal, with 17%. Tension over the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran saw feelings towards Indonesia cool to 46/100, in the doldrums with Egypt (48) and Russia (45). Vladimir Putin was the least admired world leader, followed by Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo. Jokowi shouldn’t take it personally: 42% of Australians didn’t know who he was, and only about a third knew Indonesia was a democracy, a consistent finding across the past decade. As in past years, young Australians (aged 18-29) are sour on democracy, favoured only by 49%, though substantially fewer (23%) than in past years agreed “in some circumstances, a non-democratic government can be preferable”. The full report, including results from past years, is available here."
"What is the significance of the Paris climate talks? In 30 years, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will have risen to such an extent that temperatures will be 2C higher than in pre-industrial times, scientists say. Beyond that temperature, there will be devastating environmental consequences: worsening storms, extreme heat waves and rising seas. The most important decision to be taken in Paris will therefore be to agree, through a binding commitment, that 2C is the highest acceptable limit of global warming on Earth. All other decisions taken in Paris will follow as a consequence of that agreement.  What are the problems that lie ahead for delegates in making that commitment work? To keep any temperature rise to a 2C limit, delegates will have to call for pledges from countries and power blocks (such as the European Union) and then settle individual targets. That will be extremely tricky. In addition, once particular cuts have been agreed in carbon outputs, a commission will have to be set up to monitor nations’ emissions in order to check that they are keeping to their pledges. What will be the cost? The high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today are the handiwork of the industrialised developed nations. Developing countries will therefore demand a clear commitment from them to provide financial support to help them to adapt to a hotter planet and to militate against the worst effects of global warming. By 2020, the amount of money needed for this purpose is expected to be around $100bn a year. Pledges to reach such a funding level will be another key milestone that will have to be reached in Paris. What other issues will have to be faced? Some nations face more than damaging impacts from global warming They can foresee complete devastation. Large tracts of Bangladesh coastline, the Maldives and some Pacific archipelagos face inundation, for example. Some form of compensation for populations who could lose their homelands will therefore need particular attention and a mechanism will have to be agreed in Paris to ensure that these people are properly recompensed for future generations. In addition, new forms of tide, wave and wind power plants will have to be developed to replace generators that rely on fossil fuels. A method to allow systems created in one country to be shared with other countries in an equitable manner will have to be agreed to ensure the rapid take-up of technologies that will be crucial to efforts to keep global warming within bearable limits. Will the pope’s intervention make a difference? At times the debate over climate change has suffered from being forbiddingly technical and arcane. A high-profile and impassioned intervention by a popular pope, who has already managed to win admiration from non-Catholics as well as inside the church, is bound to focus minds ahead of Paris."

"Climate aid to developing countries is likely to be the biggest sticking point hindering a global deal at the UN climate talks in Paris later this year, according to the UK’s energy and climate secretary.  Amber Rudd, who will lead the UK’s negotiating team, said that creating a meaningful financial package for developing countries is “absolutely essential” for brokering an agreement.  She affirmed the UK’s commitment to meeting the global goal of making $100bn (£65bn) a year available by 2020 to help developing countries adapt to and mitigate the worst effects of climate change.  Rudd said: “I think the most challenging element of getting a deal in Paris is demonstrating that we have corralled sufficient climate finance. I’m very involved with making sure we work with other governments to make sure that the [$100bn] commitment is in place so that we can give countries the confidence to sign up to the Paris deal in order to get the growth they need to take people out of poverty. Having evidence of that and being able to show we can mobilise it from 2020 is absolutely essential to getting a deal.”  Speaking on Wednesday evening at an event hosted by the Climate Coalition following the UK’s biggest ever mass climate change lobby, she promised to push for a strong deal in Paris. “I am absolutely committed to making sure we get this ambitious deal – and as legally binding as possible in December. The UK has been a leader in this area ... I am picking up the baton and will run with it.”  Negotiators from more than 190 countries will meet in Paris. The conference will focus on getting commitments from both developed and developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to take effect from 2020 when current commitments expire.  Rudd’s focus on climate aid follows recent interventions by the French foreign and environment ministers and a joint statement published by French president Francois Hollande and German chancellor Angela Merkel.  December’s landmark climate change conference in Paris was high on the agenda at G7 meetings in Germany last week in which Merkel urged for the end the use of fossil fuels by the end of the century. French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who will chair the conference said that climate finance for developing nations would be “decisive” to securing a global deal.  The $100bn target was first promised at the previous major climate change conference at Copenhagen in 2009 but so far only around half of that amount has been met.  “The promise of Copenhagen must be kept, absolutely – it is the basis of trust, and for many countries it is the condition of reaching agreement. Therefore, it is a priority as president [of the negotiations],” he said. Environment minister Segolene Royale told the Guardian two weeks ago: “developing countries are not hostile [to an agreement]; I would say that they are positive, but they are waiting to see. We have to meet their expectations.”  Rudd’s comments come as the Pope delivers a historic encyclical on climate change, a 180 page document on the issue in which he pointed the finger of blame at rich countries, calling on them to pay “the grave social debt” they owe to the poor.  Rudd said: “The people who are really suffering are those in the poorest countries. The pope is making that point. The answer is that we can’t expect poorer countries to miss out on industrialising because we want to everybody to address climate change and so we have to address it with climate finance.”"
"With the historic People’s Climate March taking place in cities around the world last year, the landmark US-China deal, as well as record carbon-dioxide levels and the hottest year on record, awareness of the potential devastation of climate change continues to grow. Now, even the Pope has spoken about it – and yet, public concern over the issue remains low. There once was a time when climate change was very popular to discuss. Al Gore made that movie, Leonardo DiCaprio snuggled polar bears, there was a potential green economy and even dumb ol’ Congress debated carbon cap and trade. Then, somewhere along the way, our focus shifted to a crap economy, fighting terrorists and the government seeing our dick pics. So climate change took the back burner as people had more important things to worry about. And who could blame them? Frankly, if you do believe in the realities of climate change, the future seems pretty scary. Of course, if you don’t – well, your life is probably great! The worst part about climate change is the longer we don’t do anything about it, the more likely it is to be as bad as scientists say. We’re at the point in human history when our population is rapidly expanding and our resources are being exhausted. And as the science continues to show, burning fossil fuels and filling the atmosphere with chemicals is still a horrible idea. The only glimmer of hope is that if we all start making better choices as a species, the worst parts of climate change could be avoided. It’s naturally hard to see that glimmer of hope behind the giant shroud of depressing facts, so maybe it’s time to make the facts a little less depressing. A fantastic way to do this is with humor (or as some of you call it, “humour”).  By interjecting some ‘funny’ into the climate change debate, we can prove the science true, make fun of its objectors and make it easier to understand at such an imperative time. Because while the battle to save our planet must be won with action, we need to make the topic of climate change more approachable for people to take that action – and humor is a pretty good tool. Luckily, people are embracing the potential of the funny for communicating about climate change. On The Daily Show last year, Jon Stewart took aim at the idea that global warming is a hoax. Meanwhile, Stephen Colbert discussed a UN climate change report on The Colbert Report. John Oliver held a debate about the issue featuring three deniers versus Bill Nye and 96 other scientists on Last Week Tonight. And Funny or Die has contributed poignant videos starring environmental celebrities like Ed Begley Jr, such as this one on “climate change denial disorder”. Even environmental organizations have caught on, with examples such as this fake pro-coal ad. And Keegan-Michael Key of Comedy Central’s Key & Peele helped President Obama work climate change into his White House Correspondents’ Dinner speech in April.  Humor can resonate with all kinds of people to bring climate change to the forefront, and people are – fortunately or unfortunately – key to the future of the planet. Today marks the launch of the Guardian’s “Too hot to handle” series, sponsored by Ben & Jerry’s, which will feature videos, memes, quizzes and opinion pieces about climate change from some of the best comedians and activists around. We already cover climate change extensively, and have taken action with our “Keep it in the ground” divestment campaign. But if we want more people to care, it’s got to be all over the internet, it’s got to be interesting and it’s got to be funny. Cue the sneezing kittens!"

"With an immense scientific consensus that manmade greenhouse gases cause climate change, there is pressure to reduce carbon emissions, but little sign that governments can reach a binding agreement to cut back sufficiently. The answer may be a new material that is a thousand times more efficient at capturing carbon dioxide than trees. This substance, a synthetic resin, is a part of diverse attempts to make carbon capture and storage (CCS) practical. Mercedes Maroto-Valer, professor of sustainable energy engineering at Heriot-Watt University, defines CCS as “a portfolio of technologies that aim to separate carbon dioxide from other gases, then capture and store them in a permanent situation”. CCS is a pragmatic solution, recognising that we will continue to emit CO2, and so need to remove the gas from the atmosphere and store it away where it can do no harm.  There are two primary strategies for capturing carbon dioxide. The natural mechanism is absorption by plants, which use CO2 to build their carbon-based structures, emitting oxygen as waste. Trees absorb a considerable amount of carbon and lock it away for much longer than smaller plants. However, trees take decades to reach a state when they absorb significant quantities of carbon. Trees, like the new resin, take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere wherever they are located. This makes for easy deployment, but limits the rate at which the gas can be removed. The alternative strategy is to take CO2 directly from the exhausts of power stations and carbon-intensive industries such as steel and concrete production, where the gas is much more concentrated. Maroto-Valer notes “these provide percentage levels rather than parts per million levels. A gas-fired power station might produce around 5% carbon dioxide and a coal fired station 10 to 12%.” Whatever the source, when the CO2 has been extracted, the most common storage technique is to pump it along a pipeline to be injected into an underground reservoir, often formed by layers of porous sandstone lying underneath shale, which helps keep the heavier-than-air gas in place. This process, called sequestration, which has undergone wide field studies, experimental verification and modelling should store carbon for millions of years. In other places, though, the suggestion is that the CO2 could be used to extract oil from dwindling reserves by pumping the gas into the well to maintain pressure. Unsurprisingly, this is considered a backward step by green groups. Mike Childs, head of policy for Friends of the Earth, said: “Places where [CCS] is being trialled are talking about taking the carbon dioxide captured and then injecting it into oil wells to extract more oil. It’s pretty nonsensical to try to address climate change by taking carbon out the atmosphere to try to get more oil out of the ground.” Capture processes come in three forms, pre- and post-combustion, and oxy-fuel. Pre-combustion converts fuel into hydrogen and CO2 before it is used. In principle it could produce highly efficient turbines, but as yet is the least tested option. Post-combustion is easiest to use with existing power plants and the only approach appropriate for collecting CO2 from industrial sources, while oxy-fuel is attractive for new purpose-built coal power plants, as it produces a particularly pure CO2 output and is flexible in operation, able to store energy by producing liquid oxygen during periods of low demand. In post-combustion, the exhaust gas is taken through a scrubber, where chemicals react with the carbon dioxide to produce a compound that can be moved as a solid or liquid before heating it to extract the pure CO2 for storage. However the new resin, the best so far of a number of such possible materials, is much simpler to use, as it is a passive absorber that sits in a flow of air, directly extracting the gas. The resin, developed at Arizona State University’s centre for negative carbon emissions, is an “ion-exchange” substance where positively charged ions in the resin attract and hold on to carbon dioxide molecules. Rather than requiring chemical reagents, the process is simply reversed by humidity. If the air is dry, the resin absorbs carbon; in humid air, CO2 is released. The downside is that the system will operate best in dry climates, though this doesn’t totally rule out use in the UK. Dr Klaus Lackner, director of the Arizona centre says: “My rule of thumb is that it will work if you can dry a towel on a clothes line. It’s a process that just like wind and solar energy will be affected by weather. So it would work in the UK, but not as well as Australia. But keep in mind that the air mixes well, so CO2 emitted in the UK can be collected in Australia.” A panel made up of layers of the material would collect between 10 and 50% of the carbon dioxide that passes through it – around a thousand times more efficient than the equivalent amount of CO2 collected by a tree in its lifetime. Each panel becomes saturated with carbon in about an hour, so a system based on this material would need continuous recycling of collectors, moving them to a humid location where the gas can be pumped away, then returning them to collect more. Like all CCS techniques there is an energy cost, which Lackner suggests will be 20-30% – similar to existing CCS technologies. While such imaginative schemes are at the early stages of development, conventional capture from power stations is further advanced. In the UK, three demonstration projections are planned – White Rose, a new coal-fired power plant in Yorkshire, Peterhead, retrofitting an existing gas-fired power plant with CCS in Aberdeenshire and a possible third plant at Grangemouth near Edinburgh. Each is a full-scale power plant intended to produce 380- 440 megawatts, able to power 500,000 to 650,000 homes while capturing around 90% of the carbon. These projects should come online around the end of the decade, but they have been beaten into action by Boundary Dam power station in Saskatchewan, Canada, the first major CCS installation worldwide, which went online in October 2014. Although smaller in scale, this rebuilt coal-fired station has already shown that it is practical to capture over 90% of carbon and is producing valuable data for future developments. The amount of energy used in the capture process reduces the efficiency of the station. The expectation had been that around 50MW of the 160MW total output would be used, but in practice only 40MW were lost, leaving 75% of output for consumers. Not even the most enthusiastic supporter of carbon capture and storage suggests that it should replace renewable sources like solar and wind, but renewables alone aren’t enough. Mike Childs says: “If we want to keep global warming to below two degrees we need to make very drastic reductions in carbon emissions. Given the situation at the moment it probably looks as though we will have to find some way of taking carbon out of the air and storing it. Now that can be tree planting, but it can also involving trying to capture carbon from the air and storing it underground. In terms of reducing emissions quickly, in some areas we probably need carbon capture and storage technology. Particularly, for example, steel or cement production. In energy, even with carbon capture and storage, emissions from coal-fired or gas-fired power plants would still be much higher than they are for renewable energy.” Dr Sarah Mander, research fellow at the Tyndall climate change research centre in the University of Manchester emphasises the need for CCS and the existence of a significant barrier to success: “If you think globally, coal and other fossil fuels will continue to be used for a long time… but political will has to be matched up by a policy regime to drive it… The world of CCS is full of a lot of people who want to make it happen, but ultimately there has to be money there.” Capturing carbon increases the cost of energy production, and someone has to pick up the bill. CCS has its detractors. Organisations that doubt the existence of manmade climate change regard it as a waste of money. Meanwhile, some green groups, while expressing support for the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, feel that it provides an excuse to continue using energy sources they consider untenable. As Mike Childs puts it: “Whichever government had been elected, they would still see carbon capture and storage as an opportunity for UK economic development. Both parties want to keep fossil fuels as part of the energy mix.” The three British demonstration power plants are arguably required because fossil fuels will not be removed from the equation in the immediate future, whilethe potential to install similar collectors at industrial sites like steel plants reflects that even with carbon-free generation, CO2 would still be pumped into the atmosphere elsewhere. Meanwhile carbon reduction projects, perhaps using the new resin collectors, could enable us to deal with carbon from sources unsuited to direct CCS such as transport, and to address the reality that even if we stopped CO2 production tomorrow, levels are already too high. Carbon capture and storage has broad support, and is integral to the UK’s strategy to meet the 2050 emission reduction target. Progress is being made. As Mercedes Maroto-Valer remarks: “Compared to other technologies CCS is a relatively new kid on the block, and the others have subsidies. We are asking CCS to mature very quickly, and it has come a long way in only 10 to 15 years. And CCS is something we learn by doing.” The Drax power station in North Yorkshire was once the target of environmental demonstrations, but is now the planned home for a demonstrator CCS power station, White Rose, built from scratch to use the oxy-fuel process, capturing carbon dioxide to be pumped through a 90km National Grid pipeline for storage a kilometre beneath the seabed. The White Rose plant, operated by Capture Power, is expected to produce up to 448MW, which would support 650,000 households, with 90% of CO2 emissions captured, based on evidence from existing projects like Boundary Dam, a total of 2m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Although the plant could run on coal alone, the intention is to use around 15% biomass, material such as willow grown locally for burning, which would counter remaining emissions with the CO2 taken out of the atmosphere during growth. As well as providing energy and valuable data, White Rose would be the “anchor project” for the CO2 pipeline, which could carry a further 15m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Dr Leigh Hackett, CEO of Capture Power, said: “The Humber region is widely recognised, alongside Rotterdam, as representing the best opportunity for CCS development in the whole of Europe, given the proximity of secure North Sea storage sites and the high concentration of both power generation and industrial emitters in the region.” National Grid estimate that the planned site should hold more than 20 years of emissions. Begun in 2013, the project is in a final consultation and risk assessment phase. Assuming planning consent and funding, it is hoped that construction will begin in the first half of 2016, with the plant coming online in 2020."
"Washington’s notorious snowball-thrower was at it again – even on a June day with forecast highs of 92 degrees – as the Senate’s most powerful environmental leader delivered a pep talk to activists who deny the science behind climate change. Oklahoma senator James Inhofe, who now chairs the Senate environment and public works committee despite famously calling global warming “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people”, took a star turn on Thursday at the Heartland Institute, whose conferences function as a hub for climate deniers. His message – that “God is still up there” and that Pope Francis should mind his own business – sent a clear signal to his fellow conservatives: climate sceptics have a loyal – and newly powerful – friend in Congress. Actually, there was more than one: Lamar Smith, the Texas congressman who heads the science, space and technology committee, raised cheers from the room when he said he proposed a 40% cut in Nasa’s budget for earth sciences last week. In the world outside, anticipation was building for the pope to deliver his much-awaited encyclical next week, when he is expected to cast climate change as a moral issue. On Thursday, Democratic senators Sheldon Whitehouse and Brian Schatz launched a carbon-fee bill – and got a respectful hearing – at the American Enterprise Institute, the leading conservative thinktank, in a possible sign that the uniform opposition to political climate solutions may be softening. And on Monday, leaders of the G7 industrial countries committed to phasing out fossil fuels by the end of the century. For Inhofe, however, steeped in an oil industry that has contributed nearly $2m to his lifetime political career, it will always be that winter day in the Senate earlier this year, when he tossed a snowball across the Senate floor as evidence there is no such thing as climate change. He reprised the stunt with an image repeating over and over on the screen behind him here on Thursday. The senator, in the company of friends and fellow disbelievers, handed out a page of 12 talking points for those confronted by evidence of climate change. He urged Heartland activists to go out and fight against what he called “the myth of global warming”. He stood by his claim that climate change was a hoax, he told reporters later, even though it is not. The pope could do little to change his mind, he said – although the Catholic leader’s position on climate science certainly seemed to be a sensitive point for Inhofe. “Everyone is going to ride the pope now. Isn’t that wonderful,” he said. “The pope ought to stay with his job, and we’ll stay with ours.” A few moments later, Inhofe said: “I am not going to talk about the pope. Let him run his shop, and we’ll run ours.” As for the suggestion that world leaders were beginning to move on climate change, Inhofe argued there would be no real follow-through, from the G7 or at the negotiations in Paris at the end of the year, which are aimed at reaching an international agreement to limit warming to 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F). “They talked about it - very good,” he said. “Now they say it is all going to come together in Paris, and I don’t think it is.” In any event, Inhofe said Republicans were showing no indication that his party is ready to fall into line. “If you look at Republican candidates, they are all denying this stuff with the exception of Lindsey Graham,” he said. Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina who is considered a long shot for president, told an interviewer over the weekend that, if elected, “we’re going to address climate change, CO2 emissions in a business-friendly way”. Back at the hotel full of deniers, Inhofe – after essentially telling the pope to butt out of his business – could not resist trespassing on that of the Vatican. Calling on those at the Heartland Institute to fan out and fight the Environmental Protection Agency rules for carbon pollution on power plants, due to be finalised this summer, and other environmental measures, he said: “If we do it as a team you will be doing the lord’s work, and he will eventually bless you for it. Amen.”"
"The first time I met Ron Naveen was in the dining room of an Antarctic cruise vessel. Most passengers on the Akademik Ioffe were dressed for the south pole; two or three base layers, lots of high-quality goosedown. Naveen was wearing a very old pair of jeans, a baseball cap emblazoned with images of hairy penguins, a disintegrating T-shirt and a pair of sandals. I reckoned, with his afterthought hair and warm eyes, he must have been in his mid-70s. He looked, frankly, like a bum. Over the next few days, I watched Naveen in penguin colonies throughout the Antarctic peninsula. All the time, he talked to camera about the different breeds and the survival issues that they faced. He talked about corners of the Antarctic continent where few people had ever been, the challenges posed by increased tourism and the temperamental life cycle of the penguins’ main food source, krill.  He talked about adélies and gentoos, he talked about chinstraps and emperors. He talked without ever losing enthusiasm or reaching the edge of his knowledge. All the time, he wore those jeans and that baseball cap with the hairy penguins beneath his parka. If we hadn’t reminded him, he probably would have worn the sandals too. Naveen counts penguins for a living. He and his colleagues spend a significant chunk of each year reaching difficult bits of the Antarctic and walking round with manual clickers, ticking off nests, one by one. He has spent the last 30 years compiling a definitive record of the geological, botanical and oceanographic features on 40 islands surrounding the peninsula, and without him, this place would most probably have remained a scientific terra incognita. Unsurprisingly, his profession is not a crowded one. In fact, since penguins can now be counted from space, Naveen and his colleagues pretty much hold the worldwide monopoly on manual nest-clicking. Over a 30-year period, he calculates that he has probably spent more time in the Antarctic than almost anyone else, about five years in total. Partly because of that, he’s become the man who provides the data on which governments rely. Why? What’s he doing this for? Ron’s belief, borne out by the data, is that penguins are the canaries of global warming. Since their populations are unusually sensitive to changes in the natural world, whether it be a decline in krill stocks or an increase in sea temperature, rises or falls in the numbers of penguins within one or other colony can give us clues to changes further down the line. Some breeds of penguin (gentoo) seem to be thriving under the altered conditions; some (adélie, chinstrap) are in steep decline. The thing with seeing things the way Naveen sees them is that it’s all very stark. More or fewer penguins means more or less climate change, means more or less time for us and everything else on Earth. And the penguins may be cute, but as far as Naveen is concerned, the rise and fall of their population numbers is a warning. He can’t force the hand of governments, he can only offer up 20 years of hard-earned scientific knowledge and let it tell its own tale. Naveen’s style of campaigning is very persuasive. Partly because he doesn’t do it with threats, he does it with evidence and a baseball cap: the 21st-century’s Ancient Mariner, out in the pack ice. (You can watch him at work in an award-winning documentary film The Penguin Counters, directed by Peter Getzels and Harriet Gordon.) So far, Naveen has done 23 seasons in the Antarctic. Which in turn means he’s made the trip across the Drake Passage more times than he can count. Every year in November, he escorts several box-loads of unwieldy scientific kit on to a plane from Washington to the port of Ushuaia at the bottom of Argentina, loads it on to whichever cruise ship has agreed to take him and spends three weeks in the company of passengers laughing at jokes about elephant seals he has heard countless times before. Eventually, he reaches a small, hostile speck of land at the end of the world, loads all his stuff on to a smaller and more uncomfortable boat, spends a further two weeks standing in a blizzard with a notebook and a one-two-three clicker counting penguins. Or else he stares out of a steamed-up porthole at weather so filthy he can’t go on deck, let alone on shore, before then getting back on the same ship for another week of seasickness and bad jokes. It’s a hard job both physically and mentally since all the penguin counters have to remain hyper-aware of changes in temperature or pressure. When the weather changes, it changes fast. “It’s a dangerous place, the Antarctic. You see the best and worst of humankind and you see the best and worst of the weather – storms, gales, howling winds. But you also have these quiet moments on the beach when a gentoo penguin crawls into your lap.” Over the years, Naveen has spent enough time there to see the variations between penguin breeds. “It’s anthropomorphic, but I believe there are differences. Chinstraps are very noisy, adélies will bite your leg off – I’ve grown to like them and I’ve especially grown to like gentoos. They’re very gentle, curious. I’ve had them run up and sit down in my lap. The adélies will just attack you and the chinstraps just make a lot of noise. They’re like all bluster but no fight.” Year after year, he is pushed back and back to the Antarctic by a swelling sense of urgency. Partly because he is aware that at some time in the future he will have to stop. Partly because all the data he has collected so far seems to point towards global warming on a catastrophic scale. “People keep asking me if I’m going to retire. And I say no, I’m not going to retire. I’m not ready to let go.” Of what? “Of the Antarctic. It charges up my batteries and keeps me thinking I’m on the right track. “The best thing about it is that you’re totally on your own – no radio, no TV, no politicians, no noise, just you and the environment and the animals. You can feel your own heart beating through your parka. It gives you a chance to think a little more expansively about who you are, what your place might be in the scheme of things.”"
"Plans for a “frequent flyer” tax to curb demand for leisure flights and make a new runway in south-east England unnecessary have been unveiled by an influential group of transport campaigners, environmentalists and tax experts. Ministers, and candidates seeking to be the next mayor of London, including Tory hopeful and green campaigner Zac Goldsmith, are being urged to back the proposals, which supporters argue in a letter to the Observer would relieve ministers at a stroke from having to make the invidious choice between expanding Heathrow or Gatwick airports.  Sir Howard Davies, former leader of the CBI and head of the Airports Commission, will report within a fortnight on how he thinks capacity can best be expanded in the south-east. He is expected to make a recommendation to develop either Heathrow or Gatwick, but may insist on tough environmental conditions being met by the “winner”. These could allow ministers room to judge which option they believe would achieve the best balance between the economic benefits and environmental impact. The decision is one of the most controversial and politically difficult facing the new Tory government. Expansion of Heathrow is being resisted by several Tory cabinet ministers – including international development secretary Justine Greening and foreign secretary Philip Hammond –whose constituencies would be affected, as well as by London mayor Boris Johnson. A group of Tory MPs is also campaigning against an expansion of Gatwick. With debate intensifying, green campaigners, transport groups, economists and tax experts have joined to propose the radical plan, which they say would reduce costs for once-a-year holiday travellers, while hitting those who choose to fly regularly. They say it would also ensure the UK could comply with its obligations under the Climate Change Act. Under the plan, backed by the Campaign for Better Transport, the New Economics Foundation, the Tax Justice Network, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth among others, air passenger duty would be scrapped and replaced by a new frequent flyers levy. Everyone would be able to take one flight a year without paying any levy, but for subsequent journeys the levy would rise each time. Using accepted methods to calculate the effect of price on demand, experts say the number of flights taken by the better-off for leisure purposes – which account for much of recent growth – would be cut to a level that would make extra airport capacity unnecessary. In their letter they say: “Britain’s skies are already some of the busiest in the world, and Howard Davies knows that these expansion plans cannot be made to fit with the UK’s long-term commitments under the Climate Change Act. Contrary to aviation lobby rhetoric, a new runway is not needed to allow more international business flights, which have been declining steadily since the turn of the century. “The hub airport argument is a smokescreen. In reality, growing demand for air travel is concentrated in the short-haul leisure sector and among a small, wealthy minority of the population. It is more of these flights that a new runway will in practice service. “This growth in flights is driven by air fares that are kept artificially low through generous tax subsidies; aviation is exempt from fuel duty by international treaty and zero rated for VAT, alongside wheelchairs and baby clothes. Yet these tax breaks almost exclusively benefit the richest section of British society. Our analysis of passenger survey data shows that 15% of the UK population are taking 70% of all our flights, while half of us don’t fly at all in any given year.” They argue the new levy would shift the burden “away from families flying to their annual holiday and on to the frequent fliers who are driving expansion. Our research shows that this would let the UK meet our climate targets without making flying the preserve of the rich – and without needing to build any new runways.” Stephen Joseph, director of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Replacing air passenger duty with a frequent flyers levy could, on the evidence so far, make it unnecessary to build any new runways. As the politics of airport expansion get more difficult, we think the government should look seriously at the levy proposal, to ensure that the richest who take the most flights pay the most tax.” John Stewart, chair of Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise, which campaigns against expansion of Heathrow, added: “The beauty of this proposal is that it ticks both the equity and green boxes. It is a way of controlling the growth of aviation but still allowing ordinary families a holiday in the sun.” With business leaders impatient for a decision, the government has said it will not comment on airport expansion until Davies has reported. Sources have indicated that a decision on which option to back is unlikely until the end of the year. Some government insiders believe it will then be difficult to back expansion of Heathrow in the runup to the mayoral elections next May."
"Indonesia is home to the largest tracts of mangrove forests on earth – but they are disappearing at a rate of up to 2% a year, faster than anywhere else in the world. A study by Conservation International (CI) in West Papua province is trying to determine the potential value of these mangroves, both for Indonesia - the world’s third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases – and for the Papuan communities that live among them.   Threatened mangroves and coastal marine ecosystems in general get far less attention than tropical rainforests in climate negotiations, despite the many useful services they provide. Mangroves are highly efficient carbon sinks, absorbing up to five times as much carbon dioxide as tropical forests. They are also important ecosystems, providing spawning grounds and habitat for hundreds of species, many of them commercially important. They are natural barriers to tropical storm surges and even contain chemicals effective in fighting cancer.    Aquaculture and agriculture – shrimp farming and palm oil in particular – are the biggest threat to Indonesia’s mangroves. CI estimates emissions from mangrove, sea grass and tidal marsh degradation are equivalent to the total annual emissions of the UK. The current study’s long term aim is to develop coastal management models that harness and monetise the carbon sequestering potential of Indonesia’s mangroves, which translates as somewhere in the region of 30m tonnes of carbon dioxide not entering the atmosphere.  The CI survey, which is taking place in Arguni Bay in the remote south eastern part of West Papua province, has already identified high levels of carbon in the mangrove plants and soils, with an average of 595 megagrams of carbon per hectare, equivalent to around 300,000 gallons of petrol. This could be enough to prove the viability of Indonesia’s mangroves on the carbon market.  “As a whole, Indonesia has one-third of the world’s total coastal carbon content,” says Jennifer Howard, marine climate change director at CI. “The idea is to get the country’s mangroves into the policy fold and start monetising them.” Such a model is already in place for Indonesia’s rainforests through the UN’s Redd+ initiative, which offers financial incentives for tropical forest management programmes that help mitigate the impacts of climate change. With sufficient data and proper economic evaluation, mangroves could be included in the initiative. “Blue carbon is an additional ecosystem service that allows communities to have access to international funding mechanisms such as carbon markets and other funding opportunities,” says Howard.   It may be some time before a viable market can be established at the global level, and there are currently no voluntary carbon trading schemes in Indonesia. The third option would be to pay a third party auditor, though this could prove costly. But beyond the hoped for macro economic and environmental benefits, the pilot project in Arguni Bay is working with communities to try and establish a more immediate incentive for keeping mangroves intact, in the shape of a sustainable crab fishery. CI estimates the industry could deliver a tonne a month of product if the right market can be found, possibly on the resort island of Bali. "

"It was not exactly the modern-day equivalent of Martin Luther’s 95 theses, but a letter posted on the wall of the Vatican press office excoriating a journalist for publishing a leaked papal letter has created a stir nonetheless.  Father Federico Lombardi, Vatican head of communications, criticised Sandro Magister of L’Espresso magazine for publishing a draft of Pope Francis’s highly anticipated encyclical on the environment.   Lombardi wrote that the story released three days before a planned rollout of the nearly 200-page statement was an “obviously inappropriate initiative” that had been a source of major inconvenience for other journalists and caused serious disruption. He added: “I therefore inform you [Magister] that your accreditation to this press office has been suspended from tomorrow indefinitely.” Sandro Magister of @espressonline loses his @HolySeePress credentials for disclosing embargoed draft of Encyclical. pic.twitter.com/CAe3OGZRdW The leak of the draft document on Monday afternoon sent journalists in Rome into a frenzy, disrupting the elaborate plans of many news organisations on how they would cover the papal statement  – the first of its kind. Some media outlets hesitated to report details of the draft after an email from Lombardi explicitly stated that doing so would be a breach of professional practices. One correspondent, the National Catholic Reporter’s Joshua McElwee, aired his frustration and reluctance to publish a story about the leaked draft on Twitter on Monday night. By Tuesday, he was tweeting about how “another screaming match” had broken out within the press corp, where there was intense disagreement over how the leak should have been handled. ...And we've broken out into another screaming match @HolySeePress on ethics of writing on leaked encyclical. While the church has been infused with high drama for 2,000 years, the leak has horrified the Vatican, with one official calling it an act of sabotage against the popular Argentinian pontiff. L’Espresso’s publication has also spurred a flurry of anxious questions as to who leaked it, and why? The intrigue has been deepened by the fact that Vatican insiders consider the journalist at the heart of the controversy a conservative critic of Pope Francis and his reform agenda.  “He is more of a traditionalist,” one Vatican official said of Magister. “He loved Benedict and is very, very critical of Francis … he has got an agenda.” “I don’t think this is about the issue of climate change. It is about change in the church – it is about the dynamism, about the way of looking at reality and calling it reality. It is about not having a judging church, which threatens some people.” Austen Ivereigh, a biographer of the pope, said: “The pope and his close collaborators will be horrified by this leak. It is hard to know what the intention behind it was: to damage Francis, or for money, or both.” Magister distanced himself from the situation, saying it had little to do with him. “To be honest, it’s not me that got the text, but the editor of L’Espresso, who informed me about it after he decided to put it online,” he said in an email exchange with the Guardian on Monday night. He said he had merely added a few sentences of introduction to the text, which included his byline. “I have not the faintest idea … why the text was passed on to the editor of L’Espresso. I think it was random. There are dozens of copies of the encyclical that have been floating around over the last few days. This was bound to happen,” he wrote. John Allen, a close follower of the Vatican and associate editor of the Crux, agreed that leaks of Vatican documents are quite common in the Italian press. “In some ways, I’m surprised it took this long,” he said in an email. “Some have suspected an effort to sabotage the encyclical, but it’s hard to see how an advance look at what everyone already knew the pontiff was going to say accomplishes that. I’d read it instead as par for the course – whenever there’s a document coming out that’s generating intense interest, somebody’s going to try to get an early peek, attracting a massive online audience in the process.” But another media outlet, Italian newspaper La Stampa, seemed to have no doubt that it was an act meant to hurt Francis. It said the leak had served two purposes: to weaken the message of the encyclical, which La Stampa said was “harshly critical” of the environmental policies of some superpowers, and to hurt efforts by the pope to change the church from within. From the Vatican’s perspective, it was just the last in a long line of embarrassing press leaks. Earlier this year, L’Espresso also published the internal meeting minutes and expenses of Cardinal George Pell, which showed that the Vatican’s economics minister had spent about €500,000 (£360,000) setting up the church’s new economic ministry. In 2012, Pope Benedict’s butler, Paolo Gabriele, was arrested after Vatican investigators found documents – including some that belonged to the pope – in his flat. Gabriele is believed to have leaked documents to investigative journalists, possibly to undermine efforts by the Vatican to become more financially transparent, though his alleged motives were not clear."
"China is the world’s excuse for cruelty and barbarism. If we don’t behave atrociously, politicians and columnists assure us, China will, so we had better do it first, before we are outcompeted. You want holidays, collective bargaining rights and fair conditions in the workplace? Forget it. When Chinese workers have none, such fripperies would “hamper British/US/Australian/Canadian industry”, making it uncompetitive.   Columnists like Thomas Friedman at the New York Times, gleefully regaling us with tales of Chinese workers being turfed out of their dormitories at midnight, marched to a workstation and obliged to perform a 12-hour shift to meet a last-minute order from Apple, insist that we either compete on these terms or perish. France, he once claimed, is doomed if it seeks to preserve a 35-hour week, while people in Asia “are ready to work a 35-hour day.” In fact French workers are doing fine: it turns out that European countries with shorter working hours (France, the Netherlands and Denmark for example) have higher productivity per hour than those whose workers have to spend longer at their desks (such as Germany and Britain). And a country whose people have both decent wages and time to relax can support millions of jobs – in leisure and pleasure – that don’t exist where workers are treated as little more than slaves. You want your rivers, air and wildlife protected? What planet are you on? China, we are told, doesn’t give a damn for such luxuries, with the result that if we don’t abandon our own regulations, it will take over the world. On no topic are these claims made more often than on climate change. What is the point of limiting our greenhouse gas emissions, a thousand bloggers (and a fair few politicians) insist, if China is building a new power station every two weeks (or days or minutes or whatever the latest hyperbole suggests)? Taking action on climate change is useless and stupid in the face of the Chinese threat. China is not just a country. It is whatever powerful interests want us to be. It is, they suggest, a remorseless, faceless, insuperable threat to civilisation, to which the only rational response is to abandon civilisation. So often is the threat invoked to justify the latest round of inhumane proposals that it needs a name. Perhaps we could hijack one: China Syndrome. China Syndrome is the 21st century extension of the Yellow Peril myth. First formulated by Kaiser Wilhelm II, whose extreme militarism, racism and anti-Semitism prefigured the rise of Nazism in Germany, the term reflects a long-standing apprehension about the people of Asia, dating back perhaps to the Mongol invasions of eastern Europe. It invokes an uncaring, undifferentiated horde of philistines, possessed perhaps with supernatural powers, but without moral limits or human qualities like empathy, pity, love or self-restraint. Unless we took extreme measures to defend ourselves against this threat, Wilhelm and others insisted, this human swarm would outbreed and overrun the nations of the west. The myth became a staple of schlock literature and films, spawning such characters as Fu Manchu and Ming the Merciless. The idea that the people of China might “steal our jobs” is also deep-rooted. It triggered a number of pogroms in the United States during the later decades of the 19thcentury, during which many Chinese immigrant workers were murdered. It is, of course, true that China contributes substantially to the threat of climate breakdown: it is now the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is also true that its diplomats often prove to be a hindrance during international negotiations on the subject. That was certainly the case at the UN climate conference in Bonn that ended on Thursday, where they refused even to discuss the crucial issue: how much global warming the policies adopted by each nation will cause. This stands in apparent contrast to the agreement struck this week, as a result of Angela Merkel’s diplomacy, at the G7 meeting, calling for “a decarbonisation of the global economy over the course of this century”. But to suggest that China is an inherent and insuperable threat, as many of my correspondents do (mostly those who alternate between insisting that man-made climate change isn’t happening and insisting that we can’t do anything about it anyway), is grievously to misrepresent the people of that nation. First, of course, much of its energy use is commissioned by other nations. As manufacturing has declined in countries like the US and Britain, and the workforce is mostly engaged in other activities, the fossil fuel burning caused by our consumption of stuff has shifted overseas, along with the blame. Even so, when China’s total greenhouse gas production is divided by its population, you discover that it is still producing much less per head than we are. Partly as a result of a massive investment in renewables, the Chinese demand for coal dropped for the first time last year, and is likely to drop again this year. Perhaps because of the bureaucratic chaos of China’s centralised, unwieldy government, there is a gulf between the energy transition rapidly taking place within China and its negotiating positions in international meetings, which are “in the hands of completely different sets of bureaucrats.” But perhaps the biggest surprise for those who unwittingly invoke the old Yellow Peril tropes is that the Chinese people care more about climate change than we do. A survey released on Monday reveals that 26% of respondents in the UK and 32% in the US believe that climate change is “not a serious problem”, while in China the figure is only 4%. In the UK, 7% don’t want their government to endorse any international agreement addressing climate change. In the US the proportion rises to 17%. But in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, only 1% want no action taken. Of course, the question that arises in undemocratic countries like China is the extent to which public desires can shape government policy. But what’s clear is that China’s failure to act decisively on climate change does not arise from any national characteristic. The paternalistic assumption that only the rich nations can afford to care is also based on myth: a myth that – like the Yellow Peril story – dates back to the colonial era. As the Greendex survey of consumer attitudes shows, people in poorer countries tend to feel much guiltier about their impacts on the natural world than people in rich countries, even though those impacts might be far smaller. Of the nations surveyed, the people of Germany, the US, Australia and Britain felt the least consumer guilt; while the people of India, China, Mexico and Brazil felt the most. The more we consume, the less we feel. There is no scope for moral superiority in the climate talks, least of all a moral superiority based on unfounded national stereotypes. Collectively, we are wrecking the delicate atmospheric balance that has allowed human civilisation to flourish. Collectively, we have to sort this out. And it will happen only by taking responsibility for our impacts, rather than by blaming other nations for what we don’t want to do. Monbiot.com"

"Leaders of the Catholic church in America took their “marching orders” from the pope’s encyclical on Thursday, fanning out to Congress and the White House to push for action on climate change. The high-level meetings offered a first glimpse of a vast and highly organised effort by the leadership of America’s nearly 80 million Catholics to turn the pope’s moral call for action into reality.  “It is our marching orders for advocacy,” Joseph Kurtz, the president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Archbishop of Louisville, said. “It really brings about a new urgency for us.” Representatives of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops said they would hold two briefings for members of Congress on Thursday and visit the White House on Friday to promote and explain the pope’s environmental message. Those efforts will get a new injection of urgency, when the pope delivers a much-anticipated address to Congress during his visit to the US in September, church leaders said. Church leaders rejected the accusations from some conservatives – including the Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush – that the pope had trespassed into the political realm. Within the US, the pope’s call for climate action brought an outpouring of support from religious leaders, environmental, social justice and public health groups, scientists, and Democrats.  Religious leaders said the message from an extremely popular Pope Francis would add new urgency to the church’s existing support for a number of environmental measures in Barack Obama’s climate plan – including the new rules limiting carbon pollution from power plants, due to be finalised this summer. “I believe this is potentially the game changer we have all been waiting for,” said the Reverend Canon Sally Bingham, founder of Interfaith Power & Light, which campaigns for action on climate change. “I really think it will change enough minds to get the critical mass we need to get our house in order and cut greenhouse gas emissions.”  The advocacy group, Presente.org, said the pope’s message hit close to home for Latinos in the US and elsewhere, who often live in poor and heavily polluted neighbourhoods.  The pope’s message also resonated strongly among activist priests and nuns, who have lobbied oil companies and called on their own parishes to divest. The encyclical puts the Vatican’s stamp of approval on years of effort, often at the side lines, and that on its own had galvanised campaigners, said Sister Joan Brown, a Franciscan in New Mexico who has worked on climate change for more than 20 years. “I’ve never seen anything like this in the faith community or otherwise,” she said. The release of the much-awaited climate message puts a trigger on a series of events that were more than a year in the planning.  In Atlanta, the archbishop’s office used the encyclical to sign up scientists and engineers to help parishes, and parishioners, reduce their carbon footprint. The bishop of Des Moines is planning to hold a press conference at a wind farm. Meanwhile, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Catholic Climate Covenant were producing primers to help parish priests incorporate the pope’s environmental message in their Sunday sermons, church officials said.  Religious leaders deflected criticism from Bush that the pope had strayed too far from the pulpit. “I don’t think he is presenting a blueprint for saying this is exactly a step-by-step recipe,” Kurtz said. “He is providing a framework and a moral call as a true moral leader to say take seriously the urgency of this matter.”  Richard Cizik, who was dismissed as lobbyist for the National Association of Evangelicals after calling for climate action, said the pope was simply doing his duty as a religious leader. “It is our responsibility to do what is right, even if it is unpopular,” he said.  Francis included a handwritten note on the embargoed copies of his letter that were distributed to bishops around the world – putting a further weight on the sense of urgency. The text also began with scientific data.  “It saves the encyclical from being dismissed simply as an abstract impression,” said Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington. “What our holy father is lifting up is a series of acts that beg for some coherent moral analysis, some direction for the good of all on the planet and for the planet itself.” The push for the pope’s climate message – as already defined by the US Conference on Catholic Bishops – includes support for three specific policy measures. These include the Environmental Protection Agency’s rules for new power plants, which are vigorously opposed by the fossil fuel industry and Republicans, the Green Climate Fund for developing countries, also opposed by Republicans, and an energy efficiency bill before Congress, which has bipartisan support. “That there ought to be a national carbon standard we think is a good thing because it would help protect the poor people who live near the power plants,” said Stephen Colecchi, director of the office of international justice and peace at the US Conference of Bishops.  Those efforts in the US could also boost prospects for the climate negotiations in Paris, he noted. “Adopting a national carbon standard and funding a Green Climate Fund are two things the US could put on the table which would help achieve a climate agreement,” he said. Erniz Moniz, the energy secretary, said the pope’s call to action would also spur other countries to act on the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.  “Pope Francis should inspire all countries to redouble the deployment of clean energy technologies and energy efficiencies and find the international will to significantly cut global emissions of heat-trapping pollution,” he said. The World Coal Association – while refraining from the direct attacks on Francis made by coalmining companies in the US – called on the pope to endorse research on cleaner coal technologies. Campaign groups said they hoped the pope’s intervention would reset the parameters of the discussion surrounding climate change, from narrow political agenda to broader morality.  “The pope’s message applies to all of us,” said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “He is imploring people of goodwill everywhere to honour our moral obligation to protect future generations from the dangers of further climate chaos by embracing our ethical duty to act,” she said. Andrew Steer, the chief executive of the World Resources Institute, said the message was a call to action for world leaders ahead of the Paris climate talks. “The pope’s message brings moral clarity that the world’s leaders must come together to address this urgent human challenge,” he said. Ray Bradley, the climate scientist, said: “He has no political agenda. He speaks from the heart. Who else can address this issue without the taint of politics.” The Evangelical Environmental Network also came out strongly behind the pope.  More than 300 rabbis signed a letter calling on Jewish institutions and individuals to divest from “carbon Pharaohs” or coal-based electric power, and buy wind power instead."

"Today, the government fulfils one of its most perverse manifesto pledges – to end the subsidy for onshore wind turbines a year early, in April 2016. This is cavalier and contrary policy-making, designed to please the nimbys in its shire heartlands, regardless of wider energy policy, regardless of climate change. As the Tories plunge ahead with far more expensive, disruptive and unpopular fracking, onshore wind energy is the cheapest of all renewables, and Britain one of the most wind-rich spots on earth. What a long journey Cameron has travelled since the days when he fixed a symbolic turbine on his own roof.  This is a very particular political payoff to small groups in key Tory seats, a payback to key climate change-denying windfarm-haters in the Tory press and an appeaser for restless Tory backbenchers after their first EU rebellion. As for the public, polls show two-thirds of people strongly in favour of onshore wind, including in areas where turbines are planned, while only a quarter support fracking. This is another sign of Cameron’s recklessness towards to the union: Scotland was not consulted before this announcement, and yet has 70% of planned windfarm sites. What an odd moment to announce this in-your-face attack on environmentalism on the very day the Pope issues his climate change encyclical, calling it a moral challenge to global indifference. “This home of ours is being ruined and that damages everyone, especially the poor,” he said yesterday. He has triggered a furore ahead of his trip to the US, inflaming Republican climate change sceptics as his encyclical is unequivocal in affirming that climate change is mostly man made, and calls for an end to the use of fossil fuels as a source of energy. Odd timing, too, when we have just had the hottest May on record, according to Nasa’s global temperature data, and the past 12 months have reached record levels. There is, they say, no pause in global warming – it’s a rising staircase instead of a ramp: we are now taking another upward step. An odd day, too, for secretary of state for energy and climate change Amber Rudd’s provocative act, an aggressive riposte to yesterday’s lobby of parliament bringing people from all over Britain, from Polzeath and Aberdeen to press MPs on the urgency of action against climate change. Among those who came were some from the Somerset Levels, including a farmer who talked of her land still suffering from the damage done by the severe floods of the 2013/14 winter when the River Parrett overflowed. In all of Somerset, there is only one wind turbine, due to small groups of protesters. But you might think the proposal of Ecotricity to put up just four turbines in the Parrett valley would have a fair wind. You would think the area had suffered so severely that it would be the obvious place. If not there, then where? I visited the aptly named Black Ditch site, no beauty spot, but a scrubby piece of land beside the busy M5 motorway, by a demolished Royal Ordnance factory. The valley is crisscrossed in all directions by enormous pylons bestriding the countryside, carrying electricity from the nearby Hinkley Point nuclear power station. The turbines would have powered 6,769 homes but they were opposed by a small group and former department for communities and local government  secretary Eric Pickles stopped it. In his last year, Pickles blocked 85% of windfarm projects, which lost over £500m in income and 2,000 scarce rural jobs, killing off investment in an industry providing the cheapest renewables. The EU reports that onshore wind is cheaper than coal, gas and nuclear energy when the cost of pollution is factored in, especially the high cost of climate change. But the government will not only stop the subsidy for onshore wind projects, just as it is on the verge of becoming sustainable, but will also now let local councils and residents veto them. The likelihood is that small, vocal groups will stop them, regardless of wider local opinion, let alone national opinion. Renewables UK, speaking for the industry, warns that energy prices will rise as the governments cuts off the cheapest renewable energy supply, chilling future investment. This, remember, was going to be “the greenest government ever” until Cameron changed course and said “cut the green crap” instead. So, here goes the green crap."

"It sounds like a scenario from a fantasy dinner party: the most powerful man on the planet interviewing one of the world’s most beloved naturalists about his life story, about climate change and the future of life on Earth. But in May, it has emerged, this encounter did happen, when Barack Obama invited Sir David Attenborough to the White House for a televised discussion – in which he, the US president, was to ask the questions of the broadcaster, not the other way round. In the interview, to be broadcast simultaneously in the UK and US on BBC1 and BBC America on Sunday, Obama tells Attenborough: “I’ve been a huge admirer of your work for a very long time … you’ve been a great educator as well as a great naturalist.” But it is Attenborough, on the day in which he marked his 89th birthday, who poses the most probing questions of their encounter, asking the president why he cannot show a commitment to tackling climate change in the same way previous presidents had strived to put people on the moon. Challenged by the naturalist, Obama says: “We’re not moving as fast as we need to and part of what I know from watching your programmes, and all the great work you’ve done, is that these ecosystems are all interconnected. If just one country is doing the right thing but other countries are not, then we’re not going to solve the problem, we’re going to have to have a global solution to this. “What we’re seeing are global trends that depends on the entire world working together, and sadly we haven’t made as much progress as we need to on climate change.” Attenborough says that being invited to meet the president on his 89th birthday – the first time in his long career he had ever visited the White House – had been “a considerable surprise”. He says he found the president “friendly, hospitable and genuine”.  The president tells Attenborough that he grew up watching his programmes. Attenborough presented his first natural history programme for the BBC in 1954. The pair discuss the broadcaster’s career, his recent trip to dive in the Great Barrier Reef, (which he has called “the most magical thing” he has ever seen), and what he believes needs to be done about pressing issues such as the rising population, climate change and renewable energy. “I believe [if] we find ways of generating and storing power from renewable resources we will make the problem with oil and coal disappear,” Attenborough tells the president, “because economically, we’ll wish to use these other methods. If we do that, a huge step will be taken in solving the problems of the Earth. I think what’s required is an understanding and a gut feeling that the natural world is part of your inheritance. This is the only planet we’ve got and we’ve got to protect it. And people do feel that, deeply and instinctively, it is after all where you go in moments of celebration and in moments of grief.” Obama, in turn, talks about his paternal roots in Kenya as well as his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, and how travelling across the world throughout his life had shaped his thoughts on the environment.  Attenborough has previously said he believed Obama was “very much in favour of tackling climate change … [but] of course, as we also know, he is coming to the end of his last presidency”. The broadcaster recently helped launch the Global Apollo Programme, which aims to double the amount of money being spent on research and development of renewable energy, calling on world leaders to spend 0.02% of GDP on developing clean-energy technologies."
"Asia has made huge strides in developing clean energy over the past decade but must boost investment and its use of energy efficiency technology to meet rising demand and cope with climate change, Asian Development Bank officials and other experts said on Wednesday. Renewable energy has become cheaper as technology progresses and governments must seize the chance low oil prices present to eliminate costly fuel subsidies and level the playing field for renewables, said Bindu Lohani, an ADB vice-president.  He told the Asia Clean Energy Forum that gathers around 1,000 business leaders, government officials and experts that the ADB sees coal remaining a dominant energy source in Asia despite a leap in renewable energy use including solar, wind and geothermal power. Use of coal is forecast to rise 50% by 2035 from 2010 levels. Coal is cheap but is highly polluting and blamed for contributing to climate change. Global investment in renewable energy rose 17% last year to $270bn (£172bn) from 2013. Nearly half of that amount, or $131.3bn, was investments in developing countries, according to a UN Environment Programme report released in March. China accounted for the lion’s share of developing world investment in renewables at $83.3bn, up 39% from 2013. Lohani said even if the UN achieves its goal to make renewable energy 36% of the world’s energy supply by 2050, two-thirds of global energy needs would still be met by fossil fuels, where coal is dominant. “Asia’s renewable resources are still under-utilised despite enormous demand for energy,” he said. He said Asia has not sufficiently tapped commercially available technologies for energy efficiency and needs to retrofit ageing power plants. Robin Dunnigan, the US State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for energy diplomacy, said renewables represent around 17% of the power mix, and the country is on track to double its 2009 numbers by 2020. The US has also made big strides in energy efficiency measures, she said According to the International Energy Agency, “if we realise full energy efficiency potential we can shave off up to 15% of demand globally by 2040,” Dunnigan said. “Energy efficiency measures are particularly important in cities so if migration to cities occurs at increasing rates in Asia, energy efficiency can really be a game changer,” she said."

"On the rooftops, there are endless luscious gardens, so that the skyline of the city looks almost like the tree tops of a vast rain forest. Beneath them, lining the roads, are multi-storey farms, producing fruit and vegetables for the local populace. There are strange sail-shaped constructions that suck CO2 out of the air, and along the canals, hydrogen powered boats glide silently through crystal clear waters. This is Climate Hope City – and for now, it exists only in Minecraft. When the Guardian launched its Keep it in the Ground campaign in March, editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger, and other senior staff, spoke about the challenge of finding new ways to discuss and report on climate change – to break out of traditional journalism and explore fresh ideas.  “We carry on flogging a load of dead horses, in exactly the same way, with exactly the same whip,” wrote columnist and environmentalist George Monbiot. “We have to constantly be reinventing our storytelling capacity.” One answer to that challenge is to envisage a future zero carbon city in Minecraft. The hugely successful block-building game allows players to construct complex and fascinating models of everything from medieval castles to giant space cruisers. Climate Hope City is not a fantasy world but a vision of a green urban environment which uses technologies that either already exist around the world or are at the prototype stage. The project was overseen by expert Minecraft modeller Adam Clarke, who makes his own YouTube videos about the game, as Wizard Keen. Clarke recently worked with the Tate Modern gallery to produce the Tate Worlds project, a series of Minecraft maps based around art works such as André Derain’s The Pool of London. Recently, he has started Wonder Quest, a new educational series of YouTube videos co-written with Minecraft superstar Stampy Cat.  Together with James Delaney and his BlockworksMC team of builders, as well as experienced map maker and designer Dragnoz, Clarke took various real-life urban climate technologies and spent a week constructing them into a Minecraft environment. Features include vertical farms, kinetic pavements that convert footsteps into electricity, driverless cars and green roofs.  “James and his team had recently built a Minecraft map called Tomorrowland,” says Clarke. “We wanted Climate Hope City to feel positive and futuristic yet at the same time rooted in what is going on in architecture and climate change science today. Our research led us to the very latest in building design, featuring radical shapes and forms. “We also wanted to see some older buildings so that the city felt realistic and built upon. We added the spiral walkway to help players explore the various features as quickly as possible, but its also became a very beautiful design motif too.” Delaney and his team of five builders, started out by sketching a rough layout, based on emerging technologies and architectural models, before spending over 100 hours building the model itself. “We needed to use existing green technologies and prototypes to create a positive image for sustainable living, which also seemed achievable and not too far off reality,” says Delaney.  “We decided to form the city around natural looking curves and spirals rather than the grid layout of many of the world’s modern cities: Zaha Hadid’s architecture was one inspiration, the new biodome concept for Amazon’s new Seattle headquarters was another. We then proceeded to lay it out in Minecraft and slowly build upwards, adapting and accommodating that plan to the city as it developed.” The result is a rather beautiful and elegant Minecraft city, filled with intriguing buildings, and criss-crossed with canals and kinetic walkways. Guardian readers will also be able to spot the newspaper’s own office. The map is now ready to download and is available for free to anyone who has the PC, Linux or Mac version of Minecraft installed on their computer. It can be found at the Climate Hope City Planet Minecraft page. You can freely explore the city, read signposts and listen to audio recordings that tell you more about what each building and feature represents.  “Despite climate change being the biggest story of our age, journalism has largely failed to get to grips with it,” says the Guardian’s assistant national news editor, James Randerson. “In our mission to tell this story differently and reach new audiences, we have enlisted the help of artists, poets, comedians and composers to name a few. Now we’re harnessing the creativity of some talented Minecraft designers to imagine a future low carbon city – and crucially one that is not far out of reach.” The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign is highlighting the global fossil fuel divestment movement. In particular it is calling on the world’s two largest health charities – the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust – to move their endowments out of those firms. "
"Pope Francis has called for his encyclical on the environment to be received with an “open spirit”, saying the unprecedented ecological statement should be seen as an appeal for responsibility. In the essay to be released by the Vatican on Thursday, the pontiff is expected to issue a moral challenge to the global indifference to climate change, stating in stark terms that humanity is failing in its God-given role to be a responsible steward of Earth, and time is running out to fix the problem. He is expected to say that climate change is mostly man-made and people must stop relying on fossil fuels as a source of energy.  “This home of ours is being ruined and that damages everyone, especially the poor,” he said at his weekly general audience on Wednesday. “Mine is an appeal for responsibility … I ask everyone to receive this document with an open spirit”.  The encyclical could be viewed as the ultimate test of Francis’s role as one of the world’s most influential diplomats, after he helped thaw relations between the US and Cuba earlier this year. The release of the document was timed to precede the pope’s visit to the US, where he will address the United Nations and seek to encourage climate-change negotiators in the leadup to the November climate summit in Paris. He will also address a joint session of the US Congress in September.  The encyclical has already been criticised by conservative Republican politicians who staunchly oppose action on climate change, and was politely but firmly dismissed by the presidential candidate Jeb Bush. In a campaign speech in New Hampshire, the converted Catholic said he respected Francis, but “I don’t get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope”. According to a draft of the encyclical that was leaked by L’Espresso magazine on Monday, the roughly 200-page statement will include a theological examination of environmentalism, as well as a practical and technical evaluation of ways the church believes global warming should be tackled. For example, Pope Francis is expected to criticise cap and trade programmes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, saying that such “easy solutions” simply give rise to market speculation. The encyclical is not just a statement about global warming. It is expected to touch on themes that have been at the heart of Francis’s papacy, including a critique of the culture of consumption, in which rich nations have exploited poor countries. Although the Argentinian pontiff has said the encyclical is designed to appeal to everyone as a statement on our “shared home”, it is expected to include a section that will speak primarily to Christians based on their faith: namely that the story of creation calls on people to serve the earth, not dominate it. The encyclical has largely been praised by progressives and climate activists before its release, but it is also expected to contain statements that speak to the church’s conservative beliefs, including its objection to abortion and contraception, which the draft encyclical said contradicted nature. Bernd Hagenkord, a reverend who heads the German-speaking section of Vatican Radio, emphasised the transformative impact the encyclical would have on the church’s social teaching. “Yes, we talk about justice and poverty. And now we also talk about ecology. There is now an added element to the official teaching of the church, and it is not something Francis has made up. It is in the Bible,” he told the Guardian."

" The world needs a “peaceful divorce” between economic growth and the rise in greenhouse gas emissions, one of the world’s leading energy economists has said – but this will only happen if a crunch climate conference in December sends a strong signal that governments are serious about tackling global warming. Fatih Birol, incoming executive director of the International Energy Agency, said the UN conference in Paris would be “the last chance to put the energy sector on the right course”.  In an interview with the Guardian, Birol added: “If we do not get a strong signal from Paris, this [reform of the energy sector] will take a very, very long time to put right.”  Until now, more energy availability has been linked to rising prosperity but also increasing emissions. That link must be broken, Birol said, adding that this would cause economic hardship unless the world could uncouple those factors by encouraging energy companies to invest in low-carbon generation and banning the most inefficient practices. In Paris, governments intend to sign up to a new global agreement binding all countries to limiting their carbon emissions after 2020, when current commitments end. Developed countries are expected to agree to absolute cuts in their emissions, while developing countries will place curbs on the future growth of theirs. But current pledges from more than 30 countries imply global emissions will continue to rise until at least 2030, according to IEA analysis. That would put the world on track for dangerous levels of warming, defined as more than 2C above pre-industrial temperatures. For the world to have a good chance of staying within the 2C limit, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible, global emissions need to peak by 2020, scientific advice says. The IEA is proposing four measures that would allow the world to meet that target. These include the phasing out of inefficient coal-fired power stations; a large increase in investment in renewable energy; and forcing oil and gas companies to extract their fuel resources without releasing methane into the atmosphere – a technically feasible feat, at a low cost, but one which most companies ignore as they are not penalised for the release of the powerful greenhouse gas. The IEA’s list of proposals could achieve such a timetable. The most controversial items on the list are the phasing out of inefficient coal-fired power stations, which are used in many parts of the developing world, and the recommendation that no new ones should be built. The global energy watchdog said the reforms were necessary as a “bridging strategy” to bring down carbon output before 2020, when any agreement arising from the Paris conference would kick in. Old designs of coal plants waste much more energy and produce far more carbon per unit of electricity than more modern technology. But they are cheaper to build and so are often preferred in rapidly emerging economies, particularly in south Asia. At present, among Asia’s most prominent economies, at least half of all new power plants use the inefficient old technologies. If modern designs were used instead, the savings in emissions would be equal to the savings from the European Union’s new pledge to cut emissions by 40% by 2030, according to the IEA. The extra cost would be more than made up for in greater energy produced for the same amount of fuel. “Coal-fired power plants are our biggest challenge,” said Birol. “So this is the first thing we have to implement.” He warned that if inefficient plants continue to be built, the world will be locked into future high-carbon growth, because those plants could continue to operate for half a century. He conceded that some developing countries could still need to burn coal, if they had few alternative indigenous resources and needed cheap energy to lift people out of poverty. But he said only these countries should be permitted to build any new coal-fired plants, which should be the most efficient possible. The energy sector must be the focal point of the Paris conference, Birol said. “Two-thirds of emissions come from energy. We cannot be successful without this sector.” Another key proposal from the IEA is to increase the amount of global investment in renewable energy from $270bn (£173bn) in 2014 to $400bn by 2020. This is feasible, the agency has said, if policies are adapted to phase out the subsidies many governments give to fossil fuels, by 2030 at the latest, and if investors are encouraged that governments are serious about climate change. Oil and gas companies must also take action to eliminate the release of methane, a greenhouse gas more than 20 times as powerful as carbon dioxide, which is set free in operations such as fracking. Most companies fail to do this, even though it is technically possible and costs on average only 1% more than extraction without the right technology. Birol said that if energy companies – several of which recently pledged to tackle global warming through a carbon price – were serious about climate change, they would take this action urgently. All of the IEA’s proposals use only existing technology, rather than relying on potential innovations. Amber Rudd, the UK energy secretary who will lead the country’s delegation in Paris, said: “This report from the world’s energy authority clearly shows we need to seize the economic opportunities and urgently tackle climate change. The UK has been at the forefront of global efforts by driving innovation to create a thriving low-carbon economy at home and pushing for an ambitious global climate deal.” But when asked how the government’s decision to remove subsidies for onshore wind farms would enable the UK to “be at the forefront” of the IEA-advised push for greater investment in renewables, the Department of Energy and Climate Change did not answer."

"Pope Francis’s encyclical on climate change, Laudato Si’, is the most astonishing and perhaps the most ambitious papal document of the past 100 years, since it is addressed not just to Catholics, or Christians, but to everyone on earth. It sets out a programme for change that is rooted in human needs but it makes the radical claim that these needs are not primarily greedy and selfish ones. We need nature, he says, and we need each other. Our need for mutuality, and for giving, is just as real as the selfish aspects of our characters; the need for awe and stillness in front of nature is just as profound as any other human need. The care of nature and the care of the poor are aspects of the same ethical commandment, and if we neglect either one we cannot find peace. The environment, in the pope’s use of the word, is not something out there: nature as opposed to the human world. The term describes the relationship between nature and humans, who are inextricably linked and part of each other. It is that relationship that must be set right. Starting from that premise, he launches a ferocious attack on what he sees as the false and treacherous appetites of capitalism and on the consumerist view of human nature. For Francis, there is a vital distinction between human needs, which are limited but non-negotiable, and appetites, which are potentially unlimited, and which can always be traded for other satisfactions without ever quite giving us what we most deeply want. The poor, he says, have their needs denied, while the rich have their appetites indulged. The environmental crisis links these two aspects of the problem. This criticism attacks both kinds of defenders of the present world order: the deniers and the optimists. The document is absolutely unequivocal in backing the overwhelming scientific consensus that anthropogenic global warming is a clear and present danger. It blasts the use of fossil fuels and demands that these be phased out in favour of renewable energy. But it is also explicitly opposed to the idea that we can rely on purely technological solutions to ecological problems. This may be the most explicit break with the liberal and broadly optimistic consensus of the consuming world. There will never be a technological fix for the problem of unrestrained appetite, the pope claims, because this is a moral problem, which demands a moral solution, a turn towards sobriety and self-restraint and away from the intoxications of consumerism. In this he is drawing partly on the tradition of Catholic social teaching, and partly on moral thinking popular in the 1960s, when moral philosophers were first grappling with the implications of nuclear weapons and the sense that humankind had not grown up but reached its toddler stage, where the capacity for destruction far outweighed our capacity for judgment. Once again we find that we possess the power to destroy the planet and most of the multicellular life on it, but this time there is no argument from enlightened self-interest that is as clear as the argument against nuclear warfare was in the days of the cold war. The balance of terror no longer exists in the same form as it did when the use of nuclear weapons would be punished by nuclear retaliation: the poor world will now pay for the crimes of the rich, and our children and grandchildren must pay for their parents’ self-indulgence. This is what he means by an “ecological debt”. The sometimes apocalyptic tone, with the threats of resource wars as well as the more obvious forms of ecological catastrophe, arises from the sense that this debt must at some time be terribly repaid. Will anyone listen? The pope is scathing, and rightly so, about the lack of action that has followed high-minded declarations in the past. Why should this time be different? The answer, not entirely reassuring, is that we cannot go on as we are. Self-interest alone will not avert the catastrophe. Without a moral and imaginative structure that links our wellbeing to that of others, so that their suffering feels as urgent as ours, or is at least measured on the same scales, we will render our planet uninhabitable. The pope is trying to change our understanding of human nature. Many people will disagree with his understanding. But he is right that no smaller change will do."

"Jeb Bush officially took to the campaign trail and immediately pitched himself to voters on Tuesday as the most seasoned executive among the Republican party’s now dozen presidential hopefuls, declaring himself one of the few candidates who “actually did things”. One day after officially launching his presidential bid, Bush took on Barack Obama over the Islamic State, the pope over climate change and even his brother. But he mostly stuck with a tone of optimism, touting his own record as the governor of Florida, beginning to build the case for why he is best suited to steer the country away from what he dubbed failed Democratic priorities. “People are stuck. The progressive agenda – it sounds good and it’s alluring, but now we see what it looks like and it’s ugly,” Bush said at an opera house in the south of this early battleground state, before some 340 attendees at a town hall-style meeting. “How do we create a high-growth strategy so that people can be lifted up again?” he added. “I know how it’s done, because I’ve done it. I did it as governor. I cut taxes every year. I reduced the government workforce by 13,000 – that’s kind of hard to do, but I did it by reforming how government works.” Despite a rocky build-up to the formal launch of his campaign – including staff changes, uncertainty over meeting his own lofty fundraising goals, and the ghost of his brother’s Iraq war – Bush appeared poised, relaxed and jovial. Sporting a light blue button-up shirt, rolled up at the sleeves, he even cracked jokes at the expense of George W Bush while selling his managerial experience. “If you ever see my good friend Rick Perry or even my brother, George W, tell them we created more jobs in Florida,” Bush said, drawing laughter from the crowd. At times the younger Bush sounded a lot like Perry, the former Texas governor who is seeking the Republican nomination once again after a failed bid in 2012. Perry has spent recent months taking swipes at a group of first-term Republican senators running for president, calling for “less talking and more doing”. This president has literally said twice in the last year that we don’t have a strategy. Really? Bush struck a similar tone on Tuesday, pointing out there were “a lot of people that are really good at talking” in the ever-growing Republican field. (Billionaire Donald Trump joined moments before Bush took the stage.) “I didn’t file an amendment and call that success. I actually did things as governor,” said Bush, whose rivals include a man he once mentored – Florida senator Marco Rubio. Bush and Rubio have insisted they remain good friends, although Bush acknowledged in an interview with Fox News before the town hall that it was “a little awkward” to be running against each other. “But that’s just the way it is. He’s a great guy,” Bush said. After brief remarks, Bush spent nearly an hour answering a wide range of questions – 16 in total – at length and with a willingness to be candid if necessary. Bush told one woman concerned about the growing influence of money in politics that he would not support the idea of providing a tax credit for small-dollar political donations. I don’t get economic policy from bishops or my cardinals or my pope Unlike many of his Republican opponents, Bush noticeably did not spend much time criticizing Obama – choosing instead to promote his own self-described “provocative” ideas for reforming the tax code and peeling back government regulations. His biggest critique of the current administration was in response to a question on how to stop Isis militants. “This president has literally said twice in the last year that we don’t have a strategy. Really? Well, who’s supposed to be in charge? That’s what presidents do: presidents create strategies,” Bush said, calling the emergence of Isis “a long-haul threat” that would require the US to be engaged in Iraq and Syria – although not combat troops, he was quick to note. Bush was also asked about a threat of an entirely different nature: climate change, namely Pope Francis’s upcoming encyclical on the issue. “I hope I’m not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don’t get economic policy from bishops or my cardinals or my pope,” Bush said. “I think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting into the political realm,” he said, while adding that “the climate is changing, whether men are doing it or not”. The response resonated well with Ernst Kastning, a 71-year-old retired geologist who attended the town hall and told the Guardian after that he was impressed by what he heard. “As a geologist, I’m very concerned about the global climate issue. The other candidates see it as a battle between the Environmental Protection Agency and business,” said Kastning, who said he was pleased to see Bush showing up with more than an anti-Obama pitch. “I think a lot of the other candidates right now are getting sound bites. They’re grandstanding, they’re grousing about what Obama has not done,” he said. “[Bush] did a little of that, but that’s natural. I favor a candidate that’s willing to talk about getting things done with the other side … I heard details here that really impressed me – specifics.” New Hampshire is known for voters like Kastning – pragmatic and independent-minded, to the point that license plates on cars here bear the state’s “Live Free or Die!” motto. It’s precisely why political watchers say Bush, a candidate who has cautiously tested the waters in these early primary stages without doling out much red meat to conservatives, could do well if he sticks to a more conciliatory tone. The issue of same-sex marriage proved to be one such tricky area, twice emerging as a topic of discussion during Bush’s visit. He was first pressed on the subject during a pre-taped interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity ahead of the town hall – and ahead of a US supreme court decision expected this month that could legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. “I believe in traditional marriage. I hope the supreme court rules that way,” Bush said, while adding that Americans should not be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation. An audience member later asked Bush about so-called “religious freedom” laws, which sparked controversy in Indiana and Arkansas earlier this year and saw the former governor then struggling to stake out a clear position. “It got ugly because the world is ugly today. It’s really hard to have a deeper conversation in the public square these days,” Bush said of the national outcry after Indiana passed a law that opponents said effectively allowed businesses to refuse services to LGBT individuals. “I think we can protect religious freedom and not create a society that is intolerant ... I think that we’re a big enough country, a tolerant enough country, to allow for both to exist.” Bush is scheduled to visit other key early voting states this week, including Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, is also on a swing through the same states this week and stopped in New Hampshire on Monday. Bush did not mention Clinton during his remarks at the town hall, but sharply criticized the former secretary of state’s foreign policy record during the interview with Hannity as “a complete failure”. Pointing again to his experience at the helm of Florida, Bush said: “I’d put that record up against Hillary Clinton’s any day of the week.”"
