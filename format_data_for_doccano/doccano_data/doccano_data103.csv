"Only half-jokingly, some residents of a progressive city 300 miles north of the Mexican border have adopted the “build the wall” slogan in the face of a wave of newcomers. But these perceived interlopers are starkly different from Donald Trump’s imagination. They are American, mainly white and are fleeing the unlivable heat. Arizona’s vast sweep of landscapes stretches from the scorched western movie backdrop of the Sonoran desert in the south, past rusty red sandstone outcrops further north in Sedona until you ascend to Flagstaff, a pleasant city carved into the largest expanse of ponderosa pine trees in the world, at an elevation of 7,000ft. Flagstaff, population 70,000, has long been a destination for people in southern Arizona looking for a cooling respite in summer or a spot of skiing on the nearby San Francisco Peaks in winter. But rising temperatures, driven by human-induced climate change, mean that many in Flagstaff fret they are now being overrun by those fleeing sweltering cities such as Phoenix and Tucson. A pattern of climate-driven gentrification is taking hold across the US, as those who are able to retreat from floods, storms, heatwaves and wildfires shift to safer areas, bringing soaring property and rental values with them. “As it gets hotter, we are getting a lot of climate refugees,” said Coral Evans, Flagstaff’s mayor. “We don’t mind people moving to Flagstaff at all. But about 25% of our housing is now second homes. The cost of living is our number one issue. “We don’t talk much about what climate change means for social justice. But where are low-income people going to live? How can they afford to stay in this city?” There are usually a tangle of reasons – jobs, love, education – as to why people decide to move, but Flagstaff’s agreeable climate is jostling towards the front. Last summer, Phoenix was so hot that road signs and mailboxes melted. Planes couldn’t take off or land. On a recent July day this year, when Phoenix hit 116F (47C), Flagstaff, a two-hour drive and a world away, was 80F (27C). Amanda Ormond moved to Phoenix in 1985, first working in bars after leaving college before becoming a clean energy consultant. Ormond recalls stuffing her children into thick coats when trawling houses for trick or treating at Halloween. By the time the family moved permanently to Flagstaff three years ago, wearing anything warmer than shorts and T-shirts at that time of year was unthinkable. It will get worse – Phoenix, the fastest-warming large city in the US, could spend close to half of its year in over 100F (37C) heat within 30 years. “If you choose to live in the desert you have to learn how to live in the desert,” Ormond said. “You worry about your car breaking down and so you have tons of food and water in it. “But the heat used to break around September. Now, it’s October, sometimes November. We literally have six months of above 90F (32C). Mentally, you need a break. You can’t leave your house. It’s fatiguing.” Ormond still owns her house in Tempe, which adjoins Phoenix. “We had this home and when I look around I think, ‘I just can’t see how this is gonna be a good investment for 20 years with climate change.’” Phoenicians able to move, or even vacation, in cooler climes such as Flagstaff are usually older and wealthier. Those who still work can often do so remotely. The influx has aroused concerns in Flagstaff, where rents and property values have soared. “The tenor in the town is ‘Stop building. Build a wall,’” said Jenny Niemann, a climate and energy specialist at the city of Flagstaff. “People joke about that. But I think it’s fair to say the town feels incredibly stressed by the increasing prices, as well as the development.” While the western US is increasingly baked by heatwaves and choked by smoke from wildfires, the pressing concern in eastern states is that their coasts are being redrawn by sea level rise and pummeled by ever-stronger hurricanes. More than 300,000 homes near US coasts face being chronically flooded within 30 years. This unfolding scenario is reshaping previous lines of segregation in coastal cities. As investors shift capital to higher ground and shoreline properties become costlier in terms of insurance and repairs, low- to middle-income people are squeezed out from both areas. A recent study of the greater Miami area shows this process is already under way – properties at high elevations are experiencing rising values, while those situated just 3ft above sea level have declined in value, even when other factors are accounted for. This trend has largely taken hold since 2000. “It’s a pretty clear signal and there’s evidence it’s happening across the US,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard who authored the Miami report. “The very wealthy can afford to throw money away but moderate- to low-income people can’t, so there’s an inequality to living immediately on the coast.” According to Keenan, climate gentrification is not just a supply problem – real estate developers actively marketing elevated areas as safe investments – but also a demand one – buyers are starting to swarm to higher ground. “This is happening neighborhood to neighborhood, city to city, state to state,” he said. “It’s such a huge spectrum of geography that we are going to have make moral judgments about what to protect and what to let go. There’s not enough money to protect everyone. We need a complete mobilization, similar to the effort of putting a man on the moon, to adapt our coasts.” Residents of the Miami districts of Liberty City and Little Haiti, traditionally African American and Hispanic areas, are seeing their neighborhoods transform around them. The districts, which sit a relatively safe 15ft above sea level, are currently having holes punched into them by bulldozers to make way for half a dozen apartment developments. “We are already seeing low-income homes and businesses being evicted, the new developments are popping up everywhere,” said Valencia Gunder, a Liberty City resident turned activist who grew up hearing warnings about gentrification that are now being realized. Previously blighted by poverty and crime, Liberty City is now seen as an attractive base for those worried their beachfront properties will soon be swamped. In 2000, no one in Liberty City paid more than $1,000 a month in rent – now it’s roughly one in six. Property prices have also risen sharply. “People are being forced out to places like Georgia and Alabama, where it’s more affordable,” said Gunder. “It’s becoming so expensive. These developers aren’t making Liberty City better for the people who already live here.” Even cities with cerebral approaches to climate change are at risk of upheavals that cut deepest in poorer, minority communities. Norfolk, Virginia, has reacted to some of the fastest sea level rises in the world with an ambitious plan that cedes some territory to the tides, while breaking up some housing projects and relocating residents. Local activists worry this will mean low-income, black communities will be displaced as their coastal neighborhoods are gentrified. “This is a red alarm issue,” said Mustafa Ali, who spent 25 years at the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of environmental justice. “We need to make better decisions around resilience and vulnerable communities need to be brought into that conversation. A whole lot of folks are being left behind.” In Flagstaff, the city is already straining to keep up. “Town gets crazy on the weekends when it’s 115F [46F] in Phoenix,” said Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s head of sustainability. “Are we building our systems in a manner that can support a massive influx? No. Can our existing infrastructure support that? No.” Flagstaff also faces its own climate change threats – increased wildfires in the surrounding Coconino national forest, the associated risk of flooding rains washing freely down treeless slopes on to the city, pressure on the water supply. Growing numbers of homeless people are traveling to Flagstaff to camp in the woods, heightening local fears over unintended conflagration. Antonopoulos, who has helped develop a draft climate plan for Flagstaff to confront this new reality, recalls the sky turning black from ash after the nearby Schultz fire, in 2010. “I was walking to work with a bandanna on and literally chunks of burning trees were falling everywhere,” she said. “When we’ve got climate refugees it’s going to put more stress not only on our infrastructure but also our natural resources.” The hand of climate change is everywhere – from water availability to insurance markets to housing pricing – while rarely being identified as a culprit. As temperatures continue to escalate, prior inequities are likely to be exacerbated, injustices risk deepening. “Whether it’s happening already is unclear but I think more and more people are going to be moving because of climate change,” said Brian Petersen, a climate change and planning academic at Northern Arizona University. “The people marginalized already in society will bear the brunt of this. Poor people in Las Vegas or Phoenix who can’t get away from the heat are not going to be leaving to go to beautiful, expensive mountain towns.” Even those who do make it to Flagstaff and other refuges, such as Oregon or near the Great Lakes, won’t be shielded from the transforming climate. Enough future warming has been locked into the world’s climate system to touch everywhere on Earth. “At some point, Flagstaff’s going to be in the rear-view mirror,” said Petersen. “We’re going to be going to farther north places or other continents.”"
"The social cost of carbon is a measure of the economic damages caused (via climate change) by each ton of carbon pollution that we produce today.  It’s difficult to estimate because of physical, economic, and ethical uncertainties.  For example, it’s difficult to predict exactly when various climate tipping points will be triggered, how much their damages will cost, and there’s also a question about how much we value the welfare of future generations (which is incorporated in the choice of ‘discount rate’). In 2013, the Obama administration set the federal social cost of carbon estimate at $37 per ton of carbon dioxide (up from the previous estimate of $22).  That was a conservative estimate – in recent years, research has pegged the value closer to $200 because recent research has shown that global warming slows economic growth, which makes it quite expensive.  A majority of economists in a 2015 survey believed the federal estimate was too low, but Republicans have recently been trying to dramatically lower it anyway.  The Republican argument is twofold.  First, that we should only consider domestic climate costs (the federal estimate is of global costs, because our carbon pollution doesn’t just hover in the air above America).  Second, that instead of trying to stop climate change now, we should just save our money and let future generations pay for its costs (by using a high discount rate). A new study led by UC San Diego’s Katharine Ricke published in Nature Climate Change found that not only is the global social cost of carbon dramatically higher than the federal estimate – probably between $177 and $805 per ton, most likely $417 – but that the cost to America is around $50 per ton.  That’s the second-highest in the world behind India’s $90, and is also higher than the current federal estimate for the global social cost of carbon. That’s a remarkable conclusion worth repeating.  Ricke’s team found that the cost of carbon pollution to just the United States is probably higher than its government’s current estimate of costs to the entire world.  And the actual global cost is more than 10 times higher than the federal estimate.  And yet Republican politicians think that estimate should be much lower. I asked Ricke to describe her team’s approach in this study: To calculate social cost of carbon, you need to answer four questions in sequence: 1. How would the economy change with no climate change (including GHG emissions)? 2. How does the Earth system respond to emissions of carbon dioxide? 3. How does the economy respond to changes in the Earth system? 4. How should we value losses today vs. in (for example) 100 years? The team answered these questions using four ‘modules’: a socio-economic module to answer the first question,  a climate module to address the second, a damages module to investigate the third, and a discounting module to tackle the fourth. Ricke further described the team’s approach in a ‘behind the paper’ article for Nature: The idea was to combine an approach to analyzing the climate effect of a marginal emission of carbon dioxide that Ken Caldeira and I had recently developed, with a climate damages model described in what was then a working paper by Marshall Burke and collaborators. My co-author Massimo Tavoni pointed out that by combining these two tools, we could produce the first comprehensive, country-level estimates of the social cost of carbon. I wrote about the referenced Burke paper in 2015.  That study detailed the relationship between a country’s average temperature and its per capita GDP, finding a sweet spot around 13°C (55°F).  That’s the optimal temperature for human economic productivity.  Economies in countries with lower average temperatures like Canada and Russia would benefit from additional warming, but it would slow economic growth for nations closer to the equator with hotter temperatures. The United States is currently right near the peak temperature, whereas many European countries like Germany, the UK, and France are 3–5°C cooler, and a bit below the ideal economic temperature.  So, continued global warming is worse for the US economy than Europe’s.   China’s social cost of carbon is lower despite a similar temperature and GDP to America’s because its economy is growing fast, meaning that it would benefit from investing its money now rather than spending it on cutting carbon pollution, at least relative to a more developed country like the US.  But China’s social cost of carbon is still about $26 per ton.  India’s $90 is the highest because of its combination of a hot climate, high GDP (6th in the world), and anticipated continued growth leading to large future damages. Our paper out today in Nature Clim. Change calculates the economic impact of a ton of CO2 emissions – ie, the social cost of carbon – for all countries: https://t.co/Mn0s6PMl1u pic.twitter.com/IJHt65h5ut The high US carbon cost is also a surprising result because research has shown that poorer countries are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts.  But the US has the highest GDP of any country, so it has the most to lose.  This conclusion is also consistent with the recent Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond paper finding that global warming will significantly slow American economic growth.  As Ricke explained, the US would therefore benefit from a carbon tax: In the United States, there sometimes seems to be a misconception that investments in climate change mitigation are charitable acts. Because climate change presents a more existential threat to developing countries, the argument is that having historically contributed the most CO2 to the atmosphere, the US should reduce its emissions in order to reduce the impacts of these past actions on others.  On the other hand, our analysis demonstrates that the idea that the biggest beneficiaries of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by the US would be other countries is a myth.  Our results suggest that based on pure self-interest, the US should be willing to pay around $40/ton to avoid an emission of CO2. What’s more, the US is very consistently in the top 3 of country-level social costs of carbon – by this metric one of the biggest losers from climate change. So, America is the country with the largest historical carbon emissions (and thus the most culpability for climate change), is among the countries that would benefit most from slowing global warming, and yet is the only country whose government rejects the Paris climate agreement."
"The familiar phrase “the wrong kind of snow” was originally used as an excuse for severe disruption on British Rail in the 1991 winter. A very small amount of unusually soft and powdery snow had found its way into the electrical systems of locomotives, causing short circuits and engine failure. It now seems that with climate change we are getting the wrong kind of rain – the sort that causes flooding. Europe has been suffering an increasing number of floods, and predicting where and when they will occur is important in reducing the damage they inflict on people and property. There are apparently three kinds: flash floods caused by sudden downpours; floods brought on by days of steady rain causing rivers to burst their banks; and floods following snow melt. The good news is that difficulties caused by a sudden thaw, which brought such devastation to Britain after the great freeze of 1947, is less of a threat now because heavy snow is such a rarity. However, instead of the steady drizzle that the UK once experienced at any season, the country now has a seasonal mixture of cloudbursts and spells of heavy rain. This, plus the extra hard surfaces being constantly added to ever-larger urban areas, makes other flooding much more likely. "
"The world’s governments are “nowhere near on track” to meet their commitment to avoid global warming of more than 1.5C above the pre-industrial period, according to an author of a key UN report that will outline the dangers of breaching this limit. A massive, immediate transformation in the way the world’s population generates energy, uses transportation and grows food will be required to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C and the forthcoming analysis is set to lay bare how remote this possibility is.  “It’s extraordinarily challenging to get to the 1.5C target and we are nowhere near on track to doing that,” said Drew Shindell, a Duke University climate scientist and a co-author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which will be unveiled in South Korea next month. “While it’s technically possible, it’s extremely improbable, absent a real sea change in the way we evaluate risk. We are nowhere near that.” In the 2015 Paris climate pact, international leaders agreed to curb the global temperature rise to 2C above the era prior to mass industrialization, with an aspiration to limit this to 1.5C. The world has already warmed by around 1C over the past century, fueling sea level rises, heatwaves, storms and the decline of vulnerable ecosystems such as coral reefs. Shindell would not share exact details of the IPCC report, but he said that the more ambitious 1.5C goal would require a precipitous drop in greenhouse emissions triggered by a rapid phaseout of fossil fuels, particularly coal, mass deployment of solar and wind energy and the eradication of emissions from cars, trucks and airplanes. Even then, emerging technology will be required on a global scale to capture emissions at the source and bury them in the ground or remove carbon directly from the air. “The penetration rate of new technology historically takes a long time,” Shindell said. “It’s not simple to change these things. There aren’t good examples in history of such rapid, far-reaching transitions.” The fading prospect of keeping the global temperature rise to below 1.5C has provoked alarm among leaders of low-lying island nations that risk being inundated should the world warm beyond this point. “Every country must increase the ambition of their existing targets,” said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, which announced a plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the UN general assembly in New York this week. “If we can do it, so can everyone else.” The UN general assembly has again pitted the world’s countries against Donald Trump when it comes to climate change, with the US president using his keynote speech to praise “clean coal”. Trump has vowed to exit the Paris accord, a stance that Emmanuel Macron, the French president, told the UN should be met with consequences such as a refusal by countries to enter into trade deals with the US. “It’s a lot more difficult without the US as a leader in climate change negotiations,” Ola Elvestuen, Norway’s environment minister, told the Guardian. “We have to find solutions even though the US isn’t there.” Elvestuen said countries, including Norway, which is one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers, need to transition away from fossil fuels, embrace electric cars and halt deforestation. He admitted these changes had not happened quickly enough since the Paris deal. Last year, global greenhouse gas emissions rose slightly again after a short period of stasis. “We are moving way too slowly,” Elvestuen said. “We have to do more of everything, faster. We need to deliver on policies at every level. Governments normally move slowly but we don’t have the time.” “The 1.5C target is difficult, but it’s possible. The next four to 12 years are crucial ones, where we will set the path to how the world will develop in the decades ahead. The responsibility in doing this is impossible to overestimate. To reach the goals of the Paris agreement we need large structural changes.” A difference of 0.5C in temperature may appear small but the IPCC report, which is a summary of leading climate science, is expected to warn there will be major impacts if warming reaches 2C. “Even 1.5C is no picnic, really,” said Dr Tabea Lissner, head of adaptation and vulnerability at Climate Analytics. Lissner said a world beyond 1.5C warming meant the Arctic would be ice-free in summer, around half of land-based creatures would be severely affected and deadly heatwaves would become far more common. “0.5C makes quite a big difference,” she said."
"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, fuelled by the expansion in gas exports and production, according to new figures published by the Department of Environment and Energy. The government quietly published its quarterly emissions figures on Friday afternoon, a public holiday in Victoria and the day of the release of the interim royal commission report into the banking sector.  The figures show that Australia’s policy vacuum on climate continues to drive emissions upward and further away from the country’s Paris targets. The data show emissions climbed 1.3% in the year to March 2018. The March quarter for which the data was published recorded a 0.3% increase. Emissions were up across all sectors except electricity, which fell 4.3% in the year to March, and land use, which the government is continuing to record as a 5.2% carbon sink. Fugitive emissions in the energy sector rose 13.7% in the year to March. The Climate Analytics director, Bill Hare, said the numbers showed Australia was still not on track to meet its Paris commitment to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2030 from its 2005 levels. “While emissions from the national electricity market continue to decrease due to increasing renewable electricity, Australian emissions as a whole continue to increase,” he said. “On present trends, with virtually no policies apart from the renewable energy target, which will expire in 2020 and not be replaced, emissions are set to gallop way past the Paris agreement target.” He said the figures also showed the decline in per capita emissions was beginning to flatten out “at a time when this should be accelerating”. Matt Drum, the managing director of NDEVR environmental, which tracks emissions and publishes its own quarterly reports months ahead of the government, said the absence of climate policy meant emissions were going up. “All the figures show emissions are increasing because they’ve got no policy,” he said. “What I’m really interested in is what policy is Labor going to reveal in the coming weeks? “The current government have made it very clear they’re not interested in doing anything about emissions.” The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, said it was “embarrassing” that climate pollution was continuing to rise in a wealthy country like Australia. “This latest pollution scorecard casts extreme doubt over the Morrison government’s claim that Australia will meet our 2030 emissions reduction targets ‘in a canter’ without strong new action. “This latest result is also flattered by falling emissions from power generation, driven by the construction of solar and wind energy under our national renewable energy target. “The Morrison government has declared it will not replace this target after 2020, meaning Australian climate pollution is at risk of growing even further.” The environment minister, Melissa Price, did not respond to questions about the increase in emissions. She said in a statement that emissions were currently 11.2% below 2005 levels. The statement said the latest report on Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory clearly showed the country was on track to beat its 2020 emissions target."
"The world will soon have a much clearer picture of how quickly humans are melting Earth’s ice and expanding the seas, with data collected by a sophisticated satellite launched by Nasa. Every 91 days, the $1bn, decade-in-the-making creation will orbit over more than 1,000 paths. The satellite, about the size of a Smart car, will point six lasers at ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica. It will then calculate how long the beams take to bounce back. Nasa will be able to more accurately measure the heights of ice sheets and the thickness of remaining sea ice. “With sea ice, we’ve been able to measure the extent (or area) really well since about 1980 … but what we haven’t been able to measure is the thickness,” said Tom Neumann, Nasa’s deputy project scientist for the mission. “Thickness is a key piece of the puzzle because thinner sea ice is broken up more easily by storms. It melts faster. So it gives you some insight into why the area is changing the way it is.” Melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica has increased the global sea level more than a millimeter per year, a third of the overall increase, according to Nasa. Sea-level rise is getting faster, and seas could be several feet higher by the end of the century. The IceSat-2, launched Saturday, replaces an original satellite that has been out of commission since 2009. Between 2003 and 2009, the measured sea ice lost 40% of its thickness, Neumann said. Since then, Nasa has used a plane to take more rudimentary measurements of ice melt for about a month per year in the Arctic and Antarctic. That covered less ground but allowed Nasa to monitor the fastest changing parts of the ice sheets and sea ice. Neumann said it’s possible the satellite will find ice loss beyond what Nasa has measured so far. Gaps in data, including in east Antarctica, could show ice shrinking or growing. The new satellite will provide more complete coverage and measure to within a centimeter. “In the time it takes someone to blink, sort of half a second, IceSat-2 is going to collect 5,000 measurements in each of its six beams, and it’s going to do that every hour, every day … it’s a tremendous amount of data,” Neumann said. While Donald Trump doubts the scientific consensus around man-made climate change and his administration is rescinding standards to stall warming, Neumann said multiple federal agencies want to see the satellite data when it starts coming back in October. The US Geological Survey is interested in the elevation data, and the navy would like to look at how changes will affect shipping channels, he said. With ice melt, new routes are expected to open through the Arctic, significantly reducing shipping times. Nasa has an entire fleet of satellites observing Earth, including for signs of climate change. Trump this year proposed cutting the budget that funds many of the others. Private companies and public interest groups and even the state of California have announced their own plans for climate-related satellites. A collaboration between the Environmental Defense Fund and Harvard University is expected to launch in 2021 and as will pinpoint methane leaks from oil and gas operations. Steven Hamburg, chief scientist for EDF, said researchers realized they could build the satellite faster and cheaper than the government. EDF research suggests oil and gas companies in the US leak 60% more methane than environmental regulators estimate. Methane traps far more heat than the more common carbon dioxide. Because it is short-lived, cutting emissions would have a rapid impact on temperatures, Hamburg said. The European Space Agency has a satellite that measures greenhouse gases, but it doesn’t specify in detail where leaks are happening. GHGSat, a private company, expects to launch a second greenhouse-gas-monitoring satellite soon."
"If you don’t fully appreciate the complexity of rural communities, farmer Peter Schmidt is not the sort of bloke you would be expecting in the Mulga Lands. His place is 21,000 hectares – 52,000 acres in the old money – and his family have been there since his grandfather selected blocks in the 1890s. The closest town is Wyandra, a blip on the highway on the way to Cunnamulla from Charleville – a drive that reveals the disused fences of smaller blocks long abandoned as unsustainable. Schmidt though is still at his homestead at Alawoona, its sheds and outbuildings surrounded by a metre-high levee, standing like a bad joke in their sixth year of drought. He put it in after the 2012 flood, which washed a foot of water through his house. Problem is, that flood heralded the start of the dry and it pretty much hasn’t rained since. He jokes with station hand Joe that he cursed the place and might have to break the levee to bring on the rain. But far from being a man of superstition, Schmidt is a rural scientist, with two masters degrees – one each in rural education and cattle behaviour. He has a softly spoken manner and a sense of humour born in the Mulga. “We’re mad here, we are in the most unreliable area, the most unreliable climate in the most unreliable continent,” he says. “Well, it’s unreliably reliable,” says his partner, Kathryn. Schmidt first started thinking about climate change after seeing a program on the astronaut Neil Armstrong who, before he went to space, thought the earth’s atmosphere was like the peel of an orange. In the pictures of space, Schmidt could see that the thickness of the atmosphere was more like an onion skin, and it stayed with him. “I kept that in the back of my mind and then you hear things like there’s a million new cars put on the road every year in Australia belching out exhaust fumes – and these coal-fired things – something has to happen in that very confined space of the atmosphere. I think it’s happening.” It is the middle of winter when we drop in, and though the fine day stretches over the place like a shroud, there is a chilly wind that blows through the mulga. Schmidt welcomes us into a small closed kitchen as he loads some old gidgee (Acacia cambagei or stinking wattle) into the wood stove and offers us a coffee. Schmidt has lived through many droughts but it’s the big ones he remembers – 1958, 1965, 1983. While southern Australia suffered through the Millennium drought during the noughties, up in the Mulga Lands, Schmidt says it was “dry for eight years in a row”. Every one is different but this time Schmidt has noticed one change from previous droughts has been the higher temperature. “The essential thing was there were two or three periods there where the temperature was above 40C for 15 days in a row and it just sapped all the moisture out of the soil,” Schmidt says. “That’s the difference between this drought and the others.” He had 100mm on the backblocks of his place last November, 59mm in March and very little since then. Drought has long been a part of the Australian climate and features in Indigenous stories and history. Indigenous agricultural and land management practices, documented by historians such as Bruce Pascoe and Bill Gammage, consider drought as a subjective notion – that is, it’s a state of mind. This is replicated among today’s landholders, reflected back in comments like these: “the only thing we know about drought is that it will end”. That is, it is a period that needs to be managed, like any other. We will explore more of this thinking about drought in the last of this series. Then there is the scientific definition of drought. According to the Bureau of Meterology, drought is serious or severe rainfall deficiency – essentially a period of prolonged dryness. By this measure, south-west Queensland has experienced almost seven years of dry times. Yet when Guardian Australia visited the region, locals were keen to reject some commonly held assumptions. Drought is not uniform. Parts of Queensland have been in drought for seven years but it does not mean those communities have not had any rain. Drought doesn’t stop with one rainfall. Even in NSW, which is 100% drought-declared, some areas are not strictly in drought. Each region responds differently to drought and has different assets and challenges. All of the community is affected by drought, not just farmers. Businesses, shops and social events can close down as people hunker down and stop spending. Not every farmer is male – businesses are mostly partnerships – and not every farmer is on her last legs. Many farmers have taken advantage of rain when it does come, by making hay and stockpiling other fodder. Many are careful to protect their pastures and therefore their soil by selling or locking up livestock and feeding – a practice known as drought lotting – in dry times. Others over-graze and accelerate land degradation. This explains why driving through the countryside you can see one side of a fence is as bare as a board and the other with foot-high pasture. And yet, no matter how much you prepare, it is hard to manage for seven lean years with a business, bills to pay and an average farm debt. Land management is key. “It’s so much easier to be a good manager in a wet year,” Augathella farmer Rachelle Cameron says. “There is grass everywhere and no stress.” Four hours north of Wyandra, Louise and Andrew (Marto) Martin are sheep growers on the Mitchell Grass plains near Tambo, 860kms north-west of Brisbane. Looking out over the high grass, it doesn’t look too bad, certainly not the desert landscape pictures that metropolitan audiences are used to in drought. Macfarlane station is on an ancient inland sea – the Martin’s fossil collection contains ammonites and Huon pine, spat out of the black soil plains that expand and contract depending on the water content. Both Martins work the farm, while Andrew is also mayor of the Blackall-Tambo region. This year they got a bit of autumn rain and made 200 bales of hay. They reduced their stocking rate to match the season, as much as is possible with lambing ewes. They’re not in favour of what Marto calls “agrarian socialism”, believing that subsidies create dependency. “The best way of dealing with drought is accepting you are going to have one,” Andrew says.  He takes the longer view on climate, which he describes as always changing, while Louise echoes Schmidt’s experience that higher temperatures have been a feature of the latest drought. “It’s quite unusual to get over 40C here but this last summer and the last couple of summers have been so scorchingly hot,” she says. “You can see the water being sucked out of the dams, sucked out of the soil, sucked out of my life and you can’t plan for that. “The way to plan for drought is you just have to make a decision and if you haven’t got enough grass, you sell [stock].” Karen and Bill McLennan and their son Michael are in the Mulga Lands on the highway to Roma, just outside Charleville. Their diversification plan was an olive plantation – Sommariva Olives – made into oil, soap, tapenades and other products. They are trying to stay agile, in the government’s words, to drought-proof. Bill and Karen also work in the panel-beating business in Charleville through the week; they spread themselves thin in an effort to survive the climate and the conditions. Karen describes the good times, when the grass is above their knees, but looking out from their back deck off the olive shed, it is all mulga and red dirt. The olives get enough water to yield a crop every second year. She describes a life that is filled with work, in the panel shop, in the olive shed, in the mulga. The olives were to be the retirement plan, but their oil won awards and it has increased the cashflow in dry times. “You do get a bit sick of it, she says. “You often say, I want to get out. I have had enough, I just want to get out. But you can’t really sell when it’s this dry, you have to wait for the rain, and then hopefully, if you want to get out, you get out then when it looks nice. But probably everyone else thinks the same way so the market will be flooded.” They find government policies frustrating, the rhetoric encouraging farmers to diversify while erecting hurdles, or as Michael says, “government policy is actually adverse to diversification, it’s crazy”. Karen applied for some assistance to restructure their finances and was knocked back on account of their income from the panel-beating shop. “Like my husband says, when we are in drought, this whole area is in drought,” she says. “Our business in town struggles as well, because people can’t spend money in town. We get hit there as well as out here.” Pressure has increased on the family after the bank revalued their properties and stock as a result of the downturn in conditions, which changes the interest payments. Like all the farmers we speak to, they appreciate the city’s donations, though they have not received anything. Hay is tricky, given once you start feeding cattle, you have to keep going. One or two bales will not last long. One of the big movements in farming practice over recent years is towards grazing practices that respond to climate rather than keeping a set number of stock no matter what the climate. There are a number of farmers now who sell down stock and close down for dry periods but this requires a certain equity level. For the McLennans, it is not an option. It’s easy to say you need to destock going into a drought – but you can’t “It’s easy to say you need to destock going into a drought, but you can’t,” Michael says. “The cost of getting into one of these places, you have to keep producing because if you don’t, how do you meet your loans? What is your income? In drought, costs go up, but cattle prices go down because no one else can buy for the next year.” North west of the McLennans, Doug and Rachelle Cameron live on the old station of Nive Downs, originally over 738 square miles with its own post office and general store. It was split up in the 1960s and the couple have been on 34,000 acres north of Augathella since 2004. Conditions were pretty good for the first few years, then it flooded before sliding into drought. They have cut their herd down from 1,300 to 900 and are preparing for the possibility they will not get their usual summer rain. In a normal year, the Cameron family gets 19 inches of annual rainfall on Nive Downs, yet near the end of August they have only had six. Talk turns to what normal is. “The new norm seems to be drier and hotter over the years we have been here, with our average summer temperatures,” Rachelle says. “I wouldn’t say [climate change] is not happening. It seems to be all or nothing in the country.” The Camerons are trying to increase cash flow by diversifying into production of their Nive Beef jerky. Doug hit on it after a cattle price crash due to the 2011 temporary live export ban. At a roadhouse on the way back from the saleyards, he saw a 25g packet of beef jerky for $5 after he just sold cattle for $50 a head. Doug was sick of being a price taker. “It didn’t matter what I did to the cattle – we could have the best genetics, the best everything – but outside influences just crushed us. I thought maybe we can make something out of the jerky and set the price.” Around Augathella, they grow their haystack in summer and cattle eat it down in winter. By autumn, they know whether they will have enough feed to get through the winter, and for the past five years it has never been enough, so they have sold off cattle. “This year is worse than every other year. We are missing all that growth, lately it’s been late rain, with a [short] eight-week window to grow before it cools out. You are not getting bulk feed through and that’s what hurt us in the community.” Farmers are not the only ones to suffer in drought. Dave* lost his job on a big cotton farm in a small northern NSW town when the drought started to bite. There was not enough water and the farmer cut back his cropping program. Like many farm workers, a cottage was part of his package. So when he lost his job, Dave and wife Margie* also lost their house. There was no redundancy package because the employer was not large enough. Dave was reeling from the job loss but Margie got active. The couple, in their late 50s, were carrying a bit of debt from the last drought when they were left unpaid for contracting work. So while looking for a new home, Margie also contacted their bank to apply for hardship provisions which the bank duly provided. But when a good friend gave them some money to tide them over, the bank dropped the hardship provision. Margie applied to Centrelink for Newstart, but given the couple have had various micro businesses, the application process was arduous to prove they had no hidden assets. She also contacted high profile drought charities who told her because they were not farmers, they could not help. Sixteen weeks after losing their job and home, they were still waiting for Newstart. The only assistance they have received is from the Country Womens Association, which pays up to $3000 for household expenses such as fuel, power, insurance and the like. Another city based charity arrived with groceries, lining up donated goods like a supermarket at a local hall. “The government needs to look after people who become unemployed with the drought,” Margie said. “There is no focus on contractors, the small businesses, it’s hard to get Centrelink assistance and those people end up leaving town.” The dry weather also places pressure on regular social events such as picnic races, campdrafts and other gatherings, which are important economically and socially. At a time when people need to keep an eye on others, the usual events can disappear from a town calendar, having a material effect on the state of mind of its inhabitants. Christine McDougall is the director for mental health, alcohol and other drugs for the South West Hospital and Health Service under the Queensland government. Based in Roma, her patch is one of the largest health services in the state, covering 320,000 square kilometres, but there are only 29,000 people scattered across that vast “corner country”. McDougall has been a mental health nurse since 1974 but she says it makes her cry to drive around Charleville and Cunnamulla and see the effect on the community, first of the floods of 2012, which wrecked the soil and land, and now the latest drought. There are no mental health beds in the south west, and people are transported by the Royal Flying Doctors Service if necessary. The service aims to keep people in their own community, using local hospitals and providing full support as much as possible, via telehealth consultations and regular visits by clinicians. “We try to keep as many people as we can out here because it’s traumatic going into hospital in an aeroplane,” says McDougall. “We can’t make it rain but we can keep them going until it rains – we hope – and if they get the money from the government and all these donations coming, we can keep the social and emotional stuff going.” A straight-talking dairy farmer’s daughter from Gippsland in Victoria, she presses the point that women are farmers too. “People think of farmers and they have an image of a man; you ask women what they do and they say we are farmers. They know everything that is happening on the place. They are as likely to get as depressed, miserable or suicidal as the next man.” Three years ago the state government created positions for Regional Adversity Integrated Care Clinicians (Raiccs) to cope with drought and disaster. The approach was to get to as many people as possible, no matter how remote and no matter how few people turn up. The number of suicides has dropped in the region from 13 to 4 over the past two years. “I have not forgotten anyone I have looked after who has taken their life by suicide, you never forget them, and you always think what if I had done this or that – you don’t know,” she says. “We have to acknowledge too we never know the ones we stop. It’s no small thing to go from 13 to 4, given the way it ripples through the community.” If you need support call Lifeline on 131114 *names have been changed"
"In Mike Judge’s 2006 comedy, Idiocracy, the participants in an ill-fated cryogenics experiment awake 500 years in the future to discover that due to dysgenic mutation, anti-intellectualism and corporate capitalism the intelligence of the population has fallen to dangerous levels. The president is sponsored by fast-food chain Carl’s Jr., and crops are failing because the fields are irrigated with energy drinks. The film was abandoned by its studio and largely ignored at the box office, but its subsequent cult status might be in danger once again, this time from the overbearing reality of present events. Researchers from Beijing University and Yale School of Health published research last month showing that people who live in major cities – which is, today, most of us – are not only suffering from increases in respiratory illnesses and other chronic conditions due to air pollution, but are losing our cognitive functions. The study showed that high pollution levels lead to significant drops in test scores in language and arithmetic, with the impact on some participants equivalent to losing several years of education. Other studies have shown that high air pollution is linked to premature birth, low birth weight, mental illness in children and dementia in the elderly. We’re only just beginning to understand how the air we breathe affects not just our physical environment, but our mental capacity as well. And the air we breathe is changing in the long term, as well as the short. Rising carbon dioxide levels – the main driver of climate change – aren’t just a hazard to the earth and other living creatures, they’re also affecting our thinking. At higher levels, CO2 clouds the mind: it makes us slower and less likely to develop new ideas, it degrades our ability to take in new information, change our minds, or formulate complex thoughts. Global atmospheric CO2 levels passed 400 parts per million in 2016, and despite global agreements to keep runaway climate change under control, little action has been taken. The very worst-case scenario – AKA business as usual, which is the track we’re on – predicts atmospheric CO2 concentration of 1,000ppm by 2100. At 1,000ppm, human cognitive ability drops by 21%. This isn’t merely a problem for the future – as if that would make it better. As we come to understand more about the effects of CO2, we have been measuring more of it, and finding that as it increases outside, it increases inside, too. Outdoor CO2 already reaches 500ppm regularly in industrial cities; indoors, in poorly ventilated homes or school workplaces, it can regularly exceed 1,000ppm. A study of bedrooms in Denmark found that overnight concentrations of CO2 exceeded 2,000ppm, with measurable effects on student’s performance the following day. Schools in California and Texas, when measured in 2012, regularly exceeded 2,000ppm in the daytime. And the kind of “green” insulation used to improve the heat retention of buildings – a climate change mitigation process – also raises the levels of CO2 trapped inside. Even if we meet the most stringent targets set at the Paris agreements in 2015, 2100 will bring atmospheric CO2 levels of 660ppm – with around a 15% decrease in average brainpower. It’s possibly one of the most tragic ironies of the whole sorry business that climate change is making it harder for us to think, just when we need new and bold ideas to deal with its effects. Rather than taking action to mitigate this process, we find case and case again of companies actively trying to increase emissions. Volkswagen notoriously spent years creating complex, embedded software to bypass emissions tests, with the result that cars certified for use in the US actually emitted nitrogen oxide at 40 times the legal limit. In Europe, where the same “defeat devices” were found, and where thousands more of the vehicles were sold, it’s been estimated that 1,200 people will die a decade earlier due to VW’s emissions – and many more, as we now know, will have cognitive difficulties. It’s hard not to see an allegory between Volkswagen’s manipulation of opaque technologies and the ways in which we are being manipulated more broadly by the largely unaccountable systems we engage with every day. Multiple studies have shown that the way in which social media regulates our information intake for profit leaves us more divided, less politically aware, and increasingly prejudiced and violent. YouTube recently suggested I should follow an archive clip of US anchorman Walter Cronkite warning about climate change all the way back in 1980, with a 30-minute conspiracy lecture titled How the Global Warming Scare Began. Mental pollution comes in many forms. The US Environmental Protection Agency announced recently that it was reconsidering Obama-era rules governing the emission of mercury from coal-fired power plants. Symptoms of mercury poisoning include emotional instability, insomnia, reduced cognitive function and memory loss. It was the use of mercury to stiffen hat brims that caused an epidemic of dementia among milliners in the 18th and 19th centuries, the origin of the phrase “mad as a hatter”. It’s hard to think of a measure better tuned to cancelling the future than raising the amount of mercury in the environment, or an act more in keeping with our times than intentionally increasing the recklessness, forgetfulness and stupidity of the population. But then those in charge of our affairs currently have their own chemical load to shed. Since the 1980s, one common pollutant we have managed to curtail is lead, mostly by excluding it from paint, plumbing and petrol. As a result there has been a 4.5-point rise in IQ points in those born after 1985. Those who grew up in Europe and North America between 1965 and 1985 – the cohort who are running things right now – were regularly found to be carrying 20 micrograms per decilitre levels of lead in their bloodstream, which can lead to far greater levels of long-term cognitive impairment than those reported in studies of contemporary air pollution. If you want one simple explanation for the wildly differing political attitudes between current generations, and some of the irrational paths we seem hellbent on taking at present, you could do worse than take lead poisoning into account. Brain damage, it seems, is the one thing the baby boomers are willing to pass on to their kids. • James Bridle is the author of New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future"
"Nicola Sturgeon’s government needs much tougher policies on cutting emissions from Scotland’s roads and farms to meet its ambitious CO2 reduction targets, experts have warned. The UK government’s committee on climate change (CCC) said the Scottish National party government was well on track to hit its 2020 target to cut emissions by 56%, reducing them faster than the UK as a whole. However, that was largely because of substantial gains from the closure of Scotland’s last coal-fired power station at Longannet in Fife in 2016 and gains from cutting CO2 emissions from waste, which were relatively easy things to achieve.  While emissions from energy plummeted, transport emissions had barely fallen and made up more than a third of Scotland’s overall emissions of 41.5m tonnes’ equivalent of CO2 (MtC2e) in 2016. To achieve Scotland’s post-2020 target to cut emissions by 66% by 2032 and by 90% by 2050, that volume of transport emissions needed to be cut heavily. “Transport is now Scotland’s biggest sectoral challenge,” the committee’s annual report to the Scottish parliament said. “The Scottish government’s ambition is good but we need to see much more action, particularly on road transport, if Scotland is to achieve more rapid emissions reductions than the rest of the UK.” The CCC said ministers should: • consider free parking and special lanes for electric cars• set targets for cutting nitrogen fertilisers in farming• plough more money into planting new forests to soak up CO2 • set much tougher energy efficiency and low carbon heating standards in new homes. Sturgeon said last year she wanted to see sales of new petrol and diesel cars end in Scotland by 2032, eight years earlier than the UK government target. The CCC said it saw little evidence that the 2032 target would be met. Sturgeon announced last month another £15m towards electric charging points for cars and £20m for a low carbon loans fund. She has said the A9 trunk road from Perth to Scrabster would become the UK’s longest “electric highway” with regular roadside charging points. Even so, sales of ultra-low emission cars have been consistently slower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. The latest UK government data shows 7,700 ULEV cars were sold in Scotland in the first three months of 2018 compared with 130,000 in England, or about 4,000 less than Scotland’s population share. Supported by new funding, Scotland is catching up on low emission buses. Data from the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership shows 12% of Scotland’s bus fleet is low carbon, including 10 hydrogen-powered buses operating in Aberdeen, compared with 16% in England and only 2% in Wales. However, bus travel is falling in Scotland, dropping by 10% over the past five years, while private car use is continuing to grow. Train travel is up but so too is aviation. Tom Ballantine, the chairman of the umbrella group Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, said MSPs at Holyrood should amend the new climate bill going through the Scottish parliament to toughen up policy. “This new independent report is clear that we need decisive and urgent action to keep Scotland’s climate change emissions falling rapidly,” he said. “Science is telling us we need to act faster. We are starting to see the serious effects of wilder weather, with droughts and heatwaves close to home and around the world this year.” A Scottish government spokesman said they welcomed the CCC’s confirmation it was on track to hit its emissions reductions target but he did not respond in detail to the committee’s recommendations.   “The committee’s report shows Scotland continues to lead the UK in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and that we have met our statutory emission reduction target for the third successive year,” he said. “We will continue to look at what more we can do to address climate change and will consider the report’s recommendations carefully.”"
"The world is failing to combat the threat of climate change. Global carbon dioxide emissions from coal, oil and gas increased by 1.6% in 2017, after three years when they rose little or not at all. Demand for oil is increasing by around 1.5% a year. Last week one of the authors of a key United Nations climate report warned that governments are “nowhere near on track” to meeting their commitment, made in Paris three years ago, to avoid global warming of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. When it is unveiled next week, the report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will give a clearer idea of the probable consequences of this failure. One recent study suggested the impact of a temperature rise of 2C could be more severe than previously thought, and include sea level rises of six metres once the climate has stabilised. That would be several metres higher than climate models currently predict could happen by 2100. The relationship between climate change and specific weather events is complex, but modelling suggests global warming made this summer’s European heatwave twice as likely. The increased frequency and severity of tropical storms fit with longstanding predictions that warmer oceans will bring more chaotic weather.  Slowing the rise in temperature means taking steps towards decarbonisation that are more dramatic than anything achieved so far, such as the eradication of emissions from cars and air travel. Activists are hugely important in raising public awareness. So it was disappointing that three environmental activists were sentenced to between 15 and 16 months in jail for their part in a protest against fracking in Lancashire. This punishment, for causing a public nuisance, is unduly harsh and disproportionate. The 2008 Climate Change Act, committing the UK to an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050, was a world-leading piece of legislation. Now the advisory Committee on Climate Change says we are on track to miss legally binding targets, and that this looming failure is partly attributable to government. As well as transport emissions and the removal of incentives for insulation, it has raised concerns about the regulation of fracking. Fracking – or shale gas extraction – is unpopular in England (it is banned in France and Scotland). Campaigners are also opposing government proposals to smooth the planning process for frackers. We do not advocate breaking the law. But when the news on climate change is so alarming, the commitment of green activists around the world is one reason for hope. The UN’s role in leading and coordinating multilateral action is also crucial. The crisis surrounding its environment chief, Erik Solheim, is all the more unfortunate given the timing. Questions over his $488,513 travel expenses, and his wife’s position at a company that has a contract with the UN, must be resolved as a matter of urgency. Governments must also start to take seriously suggestions such as the one made by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that if the US eventually quits the Paris climate accord, other countries should refuse to trade with it. Donald Trump’s administration is a threat to global stability. Last week it emerged Trump officials argued that because global temperatures, on current trends, will be 4C higher by 2100, the US should not bother doing anything to inhibit global warming but instead ought to loosen restrictions on carbon emissions. This is absurd nihilism. Mr Trump needs to be convinced of his wrongheadedness, for the world’s sake. The UN’s report is expected to say it will be extremely difficult to meet the 1.5C goal – but not impossible. We should all hold on to that idea. • This article was amended on 4 October 2018. An earlier version said that a recent study suggested the impact of a temperature rise of 2C could include “sea level rises of six metres by 2100.” That study suggested a six metre rise, but on millennial timescales, not by 2100. In addition, an earlier version referred to a rise of 7C, when 4C was meant. This has been corrected."
"After smoking and drink-driving, could climate change provide the next big behaviour-change challenge? The latest science tells us that nothing short of rapid, transformative change in our infrastructure and behaviour can prevent the loss of the climate we depend on – yet the message is only now being officially endorsed at the highest scientific level, because the implications are terrifying for today’s political and economic gatekeepers. It means real change, which incumbents always fear. But are we better at society-wide changes in attitude and behaviour than we give ourselves credit for? And do recent cultural shifts relating to everything from diet to plastics, sexism and attitudes to gender and identity suggest that we might be entering a phase in which more rapid behavioural changes are possible? Research in a new report for a soon-to-be launched international alliance of concerned groups suggests so.  The really big behaviour changes need to be seen first and most among the populations of the high-consuming, wealthier countries. In recent decades most of these have built up experience of how to achieve behaviour change by tackling several public health crises. Today in the UK fewer than one in five adults still smoke and rates have fallen sharply even in the past five years. But in the early 1970s, more than half of men and over 40% of women smoked. It’s a huge success against the odds concerning a highly addictive product, promoted by a powerful industry that knew about, but publicly denied, knowledge of the harm it caused. Comparisons are close and disturbing with oil companies like ExxonMobil, which was aware of climate change as early as 1977. Change was achieved with a comprehensive approach of awareness raising, tough regulation, pricing and support. Dangerous driving and drink-driving is another example. Car use in the UK was 20 times higher in 2016 compared with 1949, but the risk of being injured or killed fell almost every year from 1949, from 165 deaths for every billion miles driven, to only 5.4 such deaths in 2015. To achieve that change meant challenging people’s perceptions of risk about their own behaviour, raising awareness of the resulting harm to self and others, persuading people to leave their cars at home and take different forms of transport if they planned to drink, and changes to vehicles themselves and the physical driving environment. Other examples of successful behaviour change can be found in responses to the HIV/Aids crisis, the dangers of an unhealthy diet and antibiotic resistance. These examples all provide grounds for hope – but there are signs that something else is happening that might bring even faster shifts in attitude and behaviour closer to what is needed to meet vital climate targets. A mixture of new social movements and social media now seem capable of transforming gradual background shifts into defining moments of change. They reveal that while change can take decades, these days new social norms can become established almost overnight. From the shift around single-use plastics, to the #MeToo movement and the rise of the vegan diet, things are moving fast. The male-only charity fundraiser went out of business following a single investigative report by the Financial Times into the Presidents Club scandal. Likewise, the tide turned rapidly against male-only conference panels once they began to be named and shamed online. Things change. It’s the one thing that is reliable. The climate is changing faster than the attitudes and behaviour of the people most responsible for causing its disruption – but we now know enough to speed things up if we choose to. After a summer of lethal, extreme weather events, it is also becoming clear that disruption of the climate is a public health issue on a much grander scale than smoking or drink-driving. Rapid shifts in how we live, work and run the economy have to be made. We should be optimistic that changing our behaviour – to the extent required – is possible. • Andrew Simms is an author, analyst and campaigner.

"A Danish-flagged cargo ship has successfully passed through the Russian Arctic, in a trial voyage showing that melting sea ice could potentially open a new trade route from Europe to east Asia. The Venta Maersk made the journey as a one-off trial, said Palle Laursen, the chief technical officer of A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s biggest shipping group. The ship, carrying a cargo of frozen fish, arrived in St Petersburg on Friday, after leaving Russia’s Pacific port city of Vladivostok on 22 August. “The trial allowed us to gain exceptional operational experience,” said Laursen, adding the ship had performed well in the unfamiliar environment. The Northern Sea route could be a shorter journey for ships travelling from east Asia to Europe than the Northwest Passage over Canada because it will likely be free of ice sooner due to climate change. Experts say it could reduce the travel distance from east Asia to Europe from the 21,000 kilometres (13,000 miles) it takes to go via the Suez Canal, to 12,800 kilometres (8,000 miles). This would cut transit time by 10 to 15 days. It’s not the first time a cargo vessel has completed the Russian Arctic route, and Maersk underlined that the journey was “to gain operational experience in a new area and to test vessel systems”. “Currently, we do not see the Northern Sea route as a viable commercial alternative to existing east-west routes,” Laursen said. “Today, the passage is only feasible for around three months a year which may change with time. Furthermore, we also must consider that ice-classed vessels are required to make the passage, which means an additional investment.” During the 37-day journey, Maersk was “in close and regular dialogue” with Russian authorities and ice breaker companies as precautionary measures. The company said the vessel which made the trip is among the world’s largest ice-class ships specifically designed to operate in cold waters. "
"Almost all of Britain’s homes and businesses would be powered by wind, solar and nuclear power by 2030, under bold new green energy plans being outlined by Labour. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, will declare on Tuesday that the party is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the middle of the century. The UK’s current goal is an 80% cut by 2050. Such a move would put the UK ahead of the EU and signal that it intends to be a strong international climate leader post-Brexit. It would also leapfrog Labour ahead of the Conservatives on climate-change action. The government is shortly expected to instruct its climate advisers to explore what a tougher global-warming goal means for the UK’s domestic carbon targets but has not yet pledged to hit zero emissions. Long-Bailey, who is seen by some as a potential future leader, will also outline a series of new proposals on energy to meet the long-term carbon goal. Experts said they were far more ambitious than the party’s current policy. The plan envisages 85% of electricity coming from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030, a dramatic increase on the 50% they provide today. That would involve a sevenfold increase in offshore windfarms and a tripling of solar power, enabling nearly 20m homes to be powered by wind and solar. The party would also “remove the barriers” the Conservatives put in place for onshore windfarms. Labour would like to see doubling of onshore windfarms by 2030. Long-Bailey said: “The potential benefits of transitioning to a sustainable economy are enormous and we want to make sure these are shared by everyone … the Tories are not up to the job of dealing with the existential threat posed by climate change.” Beyond electricity, the party is also grappling with how to keep the UK warm without burning fossil fuels. Around 85% of the country uses gas for heating, with most of the rest coming from oil and a tiny proportion from renewable sources such as heat pumps and biomass. Labour is mulling a goal of providing 44% of heat from renewable sources by 2030 and reducing heat demand from buildings by almost a quarter. The party is expected to officially adopt the energy goals later this year. Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: “These proposals are envisaging a much more ambitious approach than current policy. With respect to renewable electricity, particularly wind, the ambitions look achievable by 2030.” Industry sources told the Guardian that the proposals for more green electricity were ambitious but could be met provided there was a rethink on onshore windfarms, which are currently ineligible for subsidies. However, Watson said that meeting the targets on low-carbon heat would be more difficult and “a tall order”. Greenpeace said the adoption of a net-zero emissions goal for 2050 was “truly transformative”. Friends of the Earth said the energy proposals could help the UK seize the potential of “huge innovations happening in renewable energy technology.” Labour said it had created a working group with unions to “ensure workers are protected” as the energy industry shifts from fossil-fuel power stations to a renewable future."
"In this warming world, some parts of the planet are warming much faster than others.  The warming is causing large ice bodies to start to melt and move rapidly, in some cases sliding into the ocean.   This movement is the topic of a very new scientific study that was just published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.  The Arctic is warming much faster than other parts of the planet and the ice there is showing the signs of rapid warming.  This fact has serious consequences. First, melting ice can cause sea levels to rise and inundate coastal areas – it also makes storms like hurricanes and typhoons more destructive.  Melting ice also causes a feedback loop, which can cause more future warming and then more ice loss.  It should be noted that there are different types of ice.  Some ice floats on water and is called sea ice.  When it melts, the ocean water level hardly budges because the ice is already in the sea displacing liquid water.  But, sea ice is really important for this feedback loop I mentioned above.  Other ice is on land and may be a large ice sheet or a smaller glacier.  These ice bodies sit atop the land and “rest” there.  In some cases, they extend out off the land and into the ocean where they partly float on liquid water.  When this land ice melts, the liquid flows into the oceans and can cause significant ocean level rising. So, the importance of ice depends on what type it is, where it is located, and how fast it is melting. And this brings us to the new paper. The researchers looked at a type of high latitude glacier in their study.  These glaciers hold enough water to cause about 1 foot (about a third of a meter) in sea level rise. Typically, they exist in cold and dry areas, where snowfall is limited.   How do glaciers move?  Well really by either sliding over the underlying bedrock or surface that they sit on, or by deforming and stretching under their weight. The colder glaciers tend to move by the deforming and stretching process.  Glaciers that have wetter and more temperate regions involve more sliding.  But regardless of how they move, these glaciers, particularly the glaciers that have both cold and temperate parts, experience surges in their motion.  These surges are short duration times where the glacier moves a lot.  During a surge, ice is redistributed from one part of the glacier to another region.  The authors in this study observed such a glacier surge.  It happened at an outlet glacier that is mainly of the “cold” type in Russia.  At the Vavilov Ice Cap on October Revolution Island, the authors find it “is undergoing extraordinary acceleration and thinning but displays no previous evidence of surging.”  The authors write, the 300-600 meter thick 1820 square kilometer Vavilov Ice Cap is frozen to its bed over the majority of its area, apart from a region along its western margin where basal sliding is potentially important for faster flow.  In 2010 the ice in the region began to accelerate and the next year, crevasses were observed that matched the patterns of ice acceleration. The researchers were able to watch this surge in ice motion in real-time using satellite images. They could track the motion and show the incredible speed of flow.  What caused the rapid motion? This is an important question because if the motion is caused by human warming, we can expect the behavior to be repeated elsewhere as temperatures rise.  Importantly both air and ocean-water temperatures could be a factor.  One potential cause is surface meltwater.  The top of the ice can melt, and liquid water then can flow downwards, into the ice through cracks and holes.  This flowing water can precondition the ice for rapid motion.  This fact may be a contributing cause to the motion.  Basically, the melted water lubricated the ice/ground interface causing more sliding and more friction.  The friction caused some of the bottom ice to melt and released more liquid water, and a cycle had begun. The researchers also took measurements of elevation to better understand areas where ice was becoming thicker or thinner.  In addition, they studied the forces that exist within the ice itself to help elucidate the cause of the increased speed. Obviously, this is an evolving area of study and all of the questions have not yet been answered.  However, I was impressed when I read that even though these types of surges are becoming more common, what the researchers observed in Russia was still unique.  They describe the rate of ice loss at Vavilov as “extreme.” The authors also point out,  It is startling that the Vavilov Ice Cap, until recently, an apparently stable ice cap with an almost entirely frozen bed that is almost entirely above sea level, is able to rapidly discharge such a large proportion of its ice in the ocean over such a short period. So, to answer the question, how fast is it moving?  In 2015, it reached speeds of up to 82 feet in a single day. It currently is sliding 15–35 feet a day. For comparison, that is much faster than the average 2 inches per day we would see with no surge events. The takeaway message is that once we thought these large bodies of ice responded slowly to changing conditions.  But this research shows us differently.  It shows that ice sheet can move quickly and once we pass a threshold, they may be hard to stop.  This finding makes it more crucial for us to slow down global warming before it’s too late."
"London, Jakarta, Shanghai and Houston and other global cities that are already sinking will become increasingly vulnerable to storms and flooding as a result of global warming, campaigners have warned ahead of a landmark new report on climate science. The threat to cities from sea level rises is increasing because city planners are failing to prepare, the charity Christian Aid said in the report. Some big cities are already subsiding – the ground beneath Shanghai, for instance, is being pressed down by the sheer weight of the buildings above – and rising sea levels resulting from global warming will make the effects worse.  The cities named in the report are sinking for a variety of reasons. Jakarta is thought to be subsiding by 25cm a year largely because of groundwater extraction, and Houston is sinking as the oil wells beneath it are depleted. Bangkok’s skyscrapers are weighing it down, while London is slowly sinking for geological reasons: Scotland is slowly rebounding after having been weighed down by glaciers during the last ice age, which is pushing southern England downwards like a see-saw. The warning comes as the world’s leading climate scientists meet this week in South Korea to finalise a comprehensive study setting out whether and how the world can avoid temperature rises of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body of scientists convened by the UN, has been asked to examine the consequences of such a rise and assess what progress can be made to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The world has already warmed by roughly 1C from pre-industrial levels, and sea levels could rise by 40cm if that increases to 1.5C, previous science from the IPCC has suggested. Sharp brakes on greenhouse gas production are expected to be needed to halt the rise. Under the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, governments pledged to hold warming to no more than 2C, with an aspiration not to surpass 1.5C, based on previous IPCC advice. The new IPCC report, to be published on Monday, is expected to show that remaining within the 1.5C limit is still possible but only with strong action to reduce carbon in the atmosphere. Christian Aid, one of many organisations publishing studies to coincide with the IPCC’s judgment, looked at the consequences of a 1.5C rise for a selection of eight major cities around the world. The report concludes that poor development choices are exacerbating cities’ vulnerability to weather shocks. Kat Kramer of Christian Aid, who wrote the report, said: “These global metropolises may look strong and stable, but it is a mirage. As sea levels rise, they are increasingly under threat and under water.” Dozens of the world’s biggest cities are built in coastal areas and near major rivers, making them vulnerable not just to sea level rises but also to storm surges, which can send high seas inland and past maritime defences. The UK and the Netherlands experienced such a storm in 1953, when high tides and a storm surge inundated coastal regions. If similar weather were to strike today, the damage could be much greater despite sea defences, because of rising sea levels and the increased severity of storms that is likely to result from climate change."

"What a year it’s been. While the months of soaring temperatures provided an initially welcome ray of sunshine after a long, cold, wet winter, the two extremes have damaged our gardens – and highlighted how vulnerable labour-intensive, primped-and-pruned plots can be. Mature trees and shrubs (with deeper root structures), perennial crops and wildflower-laden areas suffered less from the heat; but potted plants, which dry out quickly, became a time-consuming burden, requiring endless watering, while salad leaves stopped growing or wilted and died. Mediterranean, sun-loving produce such as tomatoes, aubergines, grapes, cucumbers, thyme, rosemary and oregano thrived; but leeks, broccoli, onions, carrots and potatoes were hit hard, a fact mirrored in farmers’ worrying crop yields this year. Soil erosion and heat stress left plants more vulnerable to pests and diseases, while the wet winter threatenedsoil fertility and increased the risk of nutrients being washed away. Cyclical natural phenomena, predicted to amplify the effects of global warming over the next four years, could result in greater extremes. The RHS recently partnered with Cranfield University to recruit the UK’s first garden water scientist, to research how gardeners can better deal with drought and flood; but in the meantime, what can we do to repair the damage and increase our gardens’ resilience? Here’s how to get started.   Pulling out, clearing plants and digging over the soil is the worst thing you can do, opening up your loam to the elements. A plant with roots in the ground helps to hold together the soil (and its goodness); allowing flowers and crops to rot down naturally provides greater protection. Even non-invasive weeds are better than nothing at all. Good old-fashioned, slow-release compost contains everything plants need and promotes deep-down resilience. It’s easy to make: in a basic cold composting system, add a roughly 50/50 mix of green waste (fruit and veg, grass cuttings, plant trimmings) with brown (newspaper, cardboard, garden pruning, fallen leaves). During a heatwave, it can also be used as a mulch around thirstier plants, helping to hold moisture in. Ground that has been well composted throughout the year will be better able to deal with winter rain, as it has an enhanced structure and can absorb more water.  Climate change could result in an increase in pests, and weather-stressed plants are more vulnerable to attack. Predators provide a more balanced ecosystem where it’s harder for one type of creature to dominate. Allow a small area of your garden to be entirely wild, to encourage frogs, toads, ground beetles, ladybirds and their ilk. Attractive habitats over winter include leaf litter, a wood pile, compost heap, stinging nettles, old plant stems and pots under which insects can hide. Their deeper root structure enables them to seek out moisture and thrive in harsher conditions than many flightier annuals, making them lower-maintenance and hardier. Easy additions include rhubarb, asparagus, cardoon, daubenton kale, winter herbs and the likes of jerusalem artichoke and oca, which will grow back if you leave a few tubers in the ground. Lavender, hardy geraniums and coneflowers also stand their ground well. As well as completing the gardening circle in a way that is very rewarding, this will give you seeds adapted to the conditions in your garden or allotment, making them more resilient. Some of the best plants for this are parsley, coriander, calendula, nasturtium, poppies, camomile and aquilegia. Autumn is the time to collect rainwater. This means upsizing or increasing the number of butts you have, so you are better prepared for the next drought. A pump can be used in butts, baths or paddling pools to help access every available drop. Trees and shrubs near the top of your garden will make a protective barrier, helping to absorb excess winter rainwater and provide a defence against wind. Allowing grass to grow long also helps.  Rather than growing crops in blocks, take a more cottage garden approach,mixing produce in with flowers, herbs and small shrubs. This provides greater biodiversity, encourages pollinators, makes it easier to create ground cover and provides resilience against pest attack.

"There was a barely stifled schadenfreudian glee echoing across the liberal press through this burning hot summer. Environmentalists could scarcely disguise their we-told-you-so smirks as one suffocating heatwave after another rolled over the globe, wildfires savaged landscapes from Siberia to California and broken temperature records kept piling up. But yearning for catastrophe is an ugly desire, and it is exactly the wrong way to think about global warming. Disasters always hit marginalised people first and worst, and as tempting as it might be to hope the calamities of 2018 bring new kinds of change, that desire only betrays how badly environmentalism needs to be overhauled.  It is a historically precarious moment for the environment. We constantly hear dire warnings from some UN body or scientific panel that we have this many years left and these thresholds before we hit the tipping points and the whole world unravels. Despite this piercing urgency, the languages at hand are so consistently inept that it often feels impossible to know what real change might be or how to talk about it. The reflexive condescension of environmentalism that looks down on those working in industry is precisely what we do not need. Working people whose livelihoods and families depend on resource extraction have no time for catastrophism, and defaulting to that desire sets back climate justice movements immeasurably. Ecology has to speak to class directly and confront inequality with believable claims that a different world is possible. Individualising responsibility is one of capitalism’s prime defensive strategies: reducing ecology to just another consumer decision and isolating governments from culpability. Blaming the choices individual people make in the context of limited options and grinding employment pressures is a fool’s errand. We are all implicated in these extractivist ideologies: we’re all burning almost everything we can get our hands on, and we are as bound up with the contradictions as anyone. We do not need another set of climate strategies built on shame and castigation. We need something more fundamental – something beyond exhortations to recycle more – that can open viable routes to real action. We need an approach that matches the scale of the problem.  There are better ways to think about ecology all around us. Indigenous communities, who are disproportionately affected by extractive industries, have the most pragmatic and compelling perspectives. We have to understand that ecological destruction is entangled with land thefts and colonisation. Last month the Trans Mountain pipeline was rejected by Canada’s federal court of appeal due to a failure to meaningfully consult with indigenous people. This was a shockingly positive development, but was matched the same day when Kinder Morgan approved the $4.5bn sale of the entire pipeline extension to the Canadian government. Justin Trudeau’s baffling eagerness to double down on pipeline expansion underlines the poverty of contemporary ecological imagination. Those two decisions reinforce how essential it is to look to indigenous resistances to define our ecological future. A critique of capitalism and consumption is necessary but insufficient when examining the state of the environment. Capitalism has proven spectacularly malleable and agile, and it will exist long after any climate crisis is averted, if the crisis is framed only as one of climate. We must destroy the colonial assumptions that dominate our relationships with land and the natural world. More than ever, we need creative resistance and radically affirmative social visions of the future if we are to take the calamity of global warming seriously. The burning catastrophes of 2018 can and should open up new lines of urgency. But we have to resist the urge to smirk about suffering and refute the smug catastrophism of environmentalists. • Matt Hern and Am Johal are the authors of Global Warming and the Sweetness of Life: a Tar Sands Tale (MIT Press).

"The party at Bait & Tackle didn’t look like a funeral. The bar was packed with people double-fisting drinks and dancing. But every now and then you caught someone go quiet, stare at the ceiling, take a deep breath and sigh, eyes glimmering. “It’s a lot to take in,” said a woman to a friend standing next to her. “Where are you gonna go for happy hour now?” she asked. “I don’t know,” her friend answered. “Nowhere.” A grey-haired man behind the bar gave a bottle of vodka to a customer who knocked back its last dregs. Barry O’Meara was not just the bartender – he also owned the place, which he had opened 14 years ago. But on 27 January 2018, it was coming to an end. O’Meara would close Bait & Tackle for good. Until then, Bait & Tackle had been a neighborhood bar in Red Hook, Brooklyn. O’Meara was shutting it down because the neighborhood was not what it used to be. The people moving to Red Hook – “the new people”, he said – were displacing his customers, who could no longer afford their rent. “And the people moving in don’t frequent establishments like this,” O’Meara said. “So that’s it.” It was not the ending anyone had expected five years earlier. In October of 2012, O’Meara had stood on the street outside Bait & Tackle watching the ocean draw nearer and nearer. Soon water was pouring into the basement of his bar. With its narrow rivers, estuaries and islands, New York City is extremely vulnerable to coastal flooding. Red Hook lies on the city’s floodplain. Flood maps show that Red Hook – a low, flat peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides – wouldn’t stand a chance in the case of a “100-year flood”, a weather event so massive it has a 1% chance of occurring every year. It might not sound like much of a risk, but “1%” is a deceptively small number. As Arctic glaciers melt, and oceans grow warmer and expand, sea levels are rising. Storms that would have been too weak to push the water to shore in the past will become powerful enough to do so. In the near future, what we think of as 100-year floods might be more like 30- or 40-year floods. Soon, it won’t take a heavy storm for Red Hook’s streets to flood. According to scientists’ projections, the city’s piers will vanish under high tide in the 2020s. By 2080, a normal high tide will flood some streets. Part of Van Brunt Street, Red Hook’s main thoroughfare, is expected to flood daily. Hurricane Sandy, in 2012, offered a grim preview of Red Hook’s future. The storm, which devastated areas all over New York and left 43 dead in the city, hit Red Hook particularly hard. As water gushed out of sewers and into streets, parks and basements, residents were forced to remember that Red Hook used to be a tidal marsh and that old, hidden creeks still stream under the asphalt like veins under the city’s skin. After the storm, Red Hook residents who owned their homes believed their property had lost its value overnight. The truth was more surprising. Over the next several years, Red Hook’s home prices soared. It turned out that, storm or no storm, there were people in New York City and beyond who were willing to pay more than $1m for the chance to live on a floodplain. Red Hook’s transformation was tangible. Two blocks of new luxury townhouses rose on King and Sullivan Streets. In 2016, Tesla opened a showroom there. More and more tourists wandered in for new and rebuilt galleries, restaurants and bars. An old factory, right by the water, was turned into million-dollar condos. The Puerto Rican family that owned the Bait & Tackle building sold it to an investment company in 2016, and O’Meara’s rent shot up by 30%. Rising rents pushed more than a dozen of O’Meara’s friends out of the neighborhood and, in many cases, out of the city entirely. Many Red Hook residents saw their neighborhood as the last bastion of real New York: a place where regular people with regular jobs could still afford to live. That “authenticity” was also part of its charm in the eyes of newcomers – but that didn’t reassure people like O’Meara, who felt the bastion was under attack, not only from the rising sea but from newcomers and their middle-class lifestyle too. Five years after the storm, O’Meara said that Sandy was the beginning of the end for the neighborhood. Then he corrected himself: “There’s no such thing as a fucking end. But it was the beginning of something different.” Andrew Amendola is the fourth Amendola to live in the slender, four-story 19th-century building on Van Brunt Street. He is an only child who grew up without a mother but who shared the house with his father, grandmother, great-uncle and two great-aunts. When Amendola was a kid, Bait & Tackle was still a bait and tackle shop. Back then, in the late 1990s, Amendola and his father used to break through a fence, on to the shore that is now home to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, and go crabbing. All they needed was a net and the huge blue claws were theirs for the taking. The silhouette of lower Manhattan shone just a mile away but there was nobody else by the water. Amendola was 13 years old when he saw Barry O’Meara for the first time. The teen had sneaked over to his window to smoke a cigarette when he saw a white guy, back then a rare sight on Van Brunt Street, walking by below. He didn’t know the guy, so he shouted: “Go home, yuppie!” O’Meara, a fourth-generation bartender, was hardly a yuppie. He had grown up in a small Irish village where his great-grandfather had a bar. He had served his first drink when he was eight. When he heard Amendola’s shout, he looked up and shouted back: “Andrew? I’m gonna tell your father that you’re smoking.” Immediately, the window slammed shut. One afternoon in November 2017, Amendola was volunteering behind the bar at a VFW veterans’ club across from his home. His girlfriend came in and took a seat. Amendola fixed her a bloody mary, went to the other end of the bar, and made a quick phone call. “What did the guy want?” Amendola’s girlfriend asked. “He wanted to offer $2.8m for the building. I said no, we’re not getting rid of it.” Amendola gets calls from real estate developers and private equity firms on a regular basis. When his great-aunt Sue Amendola died last fall, the calls got even more frequent. “These people are predatory,” Amendola said. He witnessed the same happen after Sandy. After the market took a hit because of the storm, people came to Red Hook looking to buy. But Amendola has no intention of selling the house where he grew up. Neither $2.8m nor the threat of another hurricane are enough to make him abandon a place that holds all his memories. More than money or safety, he values that he can walk down the block and be annoyed that he has to say “hi” at least to three people. “Like, ‘Oh, this fucking guy, I don’t want to see him right now.’ But I actually like not wanting to see them,” he said. At 26, Amendola plans to spend the rest of his life in Red Hook, just like generations of Amendolas before him did. Red Hook’s desirability is rising because, unlike elsewhere in Brooklyn, townhouses are still relatively affordable there. Some gentrifiers come because they want their kids to attend the local private school that opened a year after Sandy. (Next year’s tuition: $30,200.) Others come because Red Hook is different from most other parts of the city. It is quiet, like a seaside village, except you can see the Statue of Liberty. You can see the sky. You can breathe. It’s easy to forget that people didn’t always want to live on the waterfront. In cities, the rivers used to smell. Water meant pollution and waste, and waterfronts were where the cities pushed the working class, the poor, the new immigrants. It is not a coincidence that Fifth Avenue is as far from any river as possible. This started to change in 1972, when Congress passed the Clean Water Act and water quality across the United States started to improve. At the same time, industry was abandoning cities, leaving behind vacant parcels that eventually attracted commercial developers and wealthy new residents. Across the world, urban waterfronts have become the most desirable, expensive locations, even though water is rising. That’s one of the many quirks of Red Hook and places like it. After more than a century of living inland, the rich – suddenly yearning to live by the water – are pushing the poor and middle class out. This migration might save longtime waterfront residents from rising waters, but it doesn’t save them from losing their homes. On the other hand, many of the low-income residents who still live on the shore don’t have any choice but to stay. Much of New York’s public housing is concentrated by the water, in Red Hook, Coney Island, the Lower East Side, the Rockaways. Red Hook has one of the oldest and biggest public housing projects in the country. More than half of Red Hook’s 12,000 residents are tenants of the New York City Housing Authority. Without government investment in flood protection, they are in harm’s way. Coastal megacities from London to Tokyo and Rotterdam to Shanghai have installed seawalls, storm surge barriers, super-levees and dyke-rings to keep the water out of the streets. New York has not. Americans are better at immediate disaster response than planning for the future, experts say. In the future, there could be less and less government support for struggling working people in places like Red Hook. Flood protection, many urban planners predict, may only be available to those who can afford to pay for it themselves. In November 2017, Andrew Amendola was decorating the vacant lot next to his house for Christmas. Mounting a nativity scene was a family tradition. The afternoon sun made the plastic angels shimmer gold, while a gust of wind blew a reindeer over. “Go home, reindeer, you’re drunk,” Amendola said. The lot is home to four cats. After Sandy, he was sure that they had died. But a few days after the storm, they found their way back. Unlike many people, they had evacuated. If you asked real estate developer Chris Ward, he might say that the vacant lot is another parcel of scarce New York land being underutilized. Ward, now a senior vice-president at the global engineering giant Aecom, has a long history of working with New York’s waterfronts. In September 2016, Ward told the Brooklyn Eagle, a local paper, that Red Hook had two options: to become populated with high-rise buildings, co-ops and condos, or to remain the “underutilized low-income, unconnected community it is today”. Aecom had just announced a proposal to radically transform the neighborhood into a hub of gleaming skyscrapers. The plan included a subway line from Manhattan and 45,000 new apartments in high-rises. In his 2018 State of the State address, New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, put “revitalizing” Red Hook on his agenda and called on the Port Authority to consider relocating the operations of Red Hook’s remaining port, the Red Hook Container Terminal, to Sunset Park. He also asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to study options to extend the subway from lower Manhattan to Red Hook, a key component of Aecom’s vision for Red Hook’s reinvention. Robert Pincus, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, moved to Red Hook after Sandy because his rent in Carroll Gardens, on the other side of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, spiked. In Red Hook, his family could afford to rent a home. He wouldn’t buy property in Red Hook: he’s too aware of the climate risks. But he understands why Aecom and other developers have their eyes on the neighborhood. “There are billions of dollars to be made,” Pincus said. “The developers make them in 30 or 40 years, and only then the land will flood.” Chris Ward disagrees with this view. He sees new development as a way to build and finance flood protection in waterfront cities across the globe. “Most cities are taking the approach that with thoughtful architectural design and engineering we can ameliorate the risk at at an acceptable level,” he told the Guardian. Aecom is not the only company going after the neighborhood. According to the New York Times, Related Companies, a major real estate developer, is also circulating a draft plan on Red Hook’s revitalization. The plan is titled “New York’s Next Big Thing”. On his final night at his bar, Barry O’Meara got to the bar’s tiny stage for his final speech. He had to wait a little for the crowd to quiet down and listen. “We have made friends for life and we have made enemies for life,” O’Meara said into a microphone, with his usual flair for drama. A slideshow of pictures ran on a screen behind him. In one photo, a sign outside Bait & Tackle said “FREE HURRICANE ADVICE”. In Sandy’s aftermath, Bait & Tackle became one of the central neighborhood hubs where people went for help and company. In the years since Sandy, residents of Red Hook and New Yorkers in general have been asking themselves: what is the right thing to do after such a disaster? How do you make plans when you know that it might happen again, but you don’t know if it’s going to be next month, next year, or in three decades? It seems like the rational thing to do would be to leave the waterfront and find a new home – somewhere on higher ground, somewhere safe. But that’s not how people choose a place to live. There are other, more immediately compelling factors to consider. What can you afford? Where feels like home? Where are your friends and family, your favorite bar, your kid’s school? Knowing your neighbors or having a perfect view of the Statue of Liberty can outweigh a far-off-seeming flood risk. It’s not easy to leave a place you love – even if the place, by virtue of its geography, promises to one day kill you. In Bait & Tackle, O’Meara’s speech was almost over. People raised their voices. First, one at a time: “We love you, Barry!” And then all together: “Barry! Barry! Barry!” O’Meara told them to shut up. “I’m not sad,” he said, interrupting the chant. “This room has been too great and too beautiful with happiness and laughter and joy to be sad. I’ve been fucking privileged. Let’s continue the night. I love you all. Thank you.” After the speech, the DJ put on David Bowie’s Let’s Dance. Amendola stood next to the bar wearing a T-shirt bearing the words he once shouted to O’Meara: “Go home, yuppie!” Now, he wiped away tears."
"The globe-trotting travels of the UN’s environment chief have been sharply criticised in a draft internal audit as “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction”. Erik Solheim, executive director of UN Environment, was travelling for 529 out of the 668 days audited, spending $488,518 (£370,380), according to the report. The audit also said he had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and claimed unjustified expenses.  The development comes amid growing concern among some UN Environment officials, with sources claiming his “haphazard and dictatorial management style” has “already made us dysfunctional in many respects”. Solheim told the Guardian he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and made changes where other rules had been broken. He said he could not comment in detail on the audit until it was completed and published: “If any other mistakes are found, we will immediately correct them.” Responding to staff concern over his leadership of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), he said: “To secure unprecedented environmental action, we need to change, as individuals, as society, indeed as the UN. No one is immune to the difficulty that type of systemic change often brings.” The draft audit, leaked to the Guardian, was compiled by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and will be finalised after responses from the individuals named. It is particularly critical of Solheim’s frequent flying, which included a weekend trip from the US to France and back. “The extensive travel patterns of [Solheim] did not set an example for the rest of the staff to follow,” it said. “In 2011 … the secretary general stated that ‘What we demand of others, we must do ourselves’. Such extensive travel therefore presents a reputation risk to the organization, especially [given] that Unep is supposed to be the lead on sustainable environment matters.” It also said Unep, unlike several other UN organisations, did not have policies and incentives for staff to reduce their carbon emissions. In August, Solheim told a Norwegian aviation magazine, people should not have a “guilty conscience” about flying and said he held gold frequent flyer cards at all three major airline alliances. “This is simply embarrassing,” said Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace in Norway. “Solheim has made Unep much more visible, which is a good thing, partly through travels and discussions with so many people. But this report puts him in an extremely bad light and weakens the credibility of UN’s entire environmental organisation.”  Solheim said: “Making good on our global agenda demands engagement with the world and indeed an expanded approach to our work. I am therefore determined to continue to focus on our mandate to create real results for real people, with real impact on the ground.” The draft OIOS audit also criticises Solheim’s management style as “having no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules, and correspondence seen showed management willingness to circumvent regulations and rules which were termed as ‘bureaucratic’.” The audit said Solheim’s travel had been approved by a manager who reported directly to him, not someone more senior. “We have immediately put new procedures in place whereby my travel is approved by the office of the secretary general,” Solheim told the Guardian. The audit also said Solheim had not provided justification for 76 days spent in Oslo and Paris on official travel. After a request from a UN official to account for days spent in his home country, Norway, Solheim, emailed: “We cannot accept this question on holiday vs job … we are not any longer living in the industrial age and they must stop treating me as if I am a 07 to 16 factory worker … the other side of this coin is that they must stop asking this stupid question.” Solheim told the Guardian: “It’s true that I have vented frustration with what I perceive as excessive bureaucracy in the UN system. I believe fully in reforming the UN so we’re better able to confront the urgent challenges facing our planet.” But he added: “If administrative rules are found to have been overlooked, I accept personal responsibility and offer my unflinching commitment to refining a process that prevents them from ever occurring again.” The OIOS report also criticises Solheim for allowing two senior managers to work unofficially from Paris, rather than Unep headquarters in Nairobi. A source said staff saw this arrangement as the managers “getting away with murder”. In one case, the unofficial teleworking resulted in additional travel costs of $23,750, according to the draft audit. Questioned by officials over the unofficial arrangement in emails seen by the Guardian, Solheim said: “Please blame it on the erratic executive director.” On another occasion, discussing management reform, Solheim emailed colleagues to say: “There is no need to be the most legalistic implementer of nonsense. Very often it is easier to get forgiveness for non compliance than to get permission for change.” Numerous Unep staff have contacted the Guardian, on condition of anonymity, criticising Solheim’s leadership of the organisation, which is governed and funded by UN member states. “He thinks he is a CEO when he is actually an international civil servant,” said one source. “A lot of us were very excited when he came. He’s Norwegian and an ex-environment minister. It was the dream CV that turned into a nightmare.” The Guardian can be contacted securely here or by email at damian.carrington@theguardian.com."
"Australia is in a position to replace thermal coal exports with the export of renewable energy technologies if the parliament can settle an energy policy and end a decade of policy chaos, the Labor frontbencher Pat Conroy says. The shadow assistant minister for climate change and energy will use an appearance at a renewable energy conference on Thursday to argue that Australia can remain an energy export “superpower” during the transition to low-emissions energy – “it just won’t be fossilised carbon, instead it will be wind and solar power”.  Conroy says in his speech that thermal coal exports will “decline significantly over the next few decades” but Australia will continue to export metallurgical coal, “which makes up 65% of our coal exports by value, for a long time to come, as there is no other way of manufacturing steel at an industrial scale”. He says that, with the right policy settings, Australia can replace thermal coal exports with renewable energy exports, and also develop the hydrogen economy. Some critics of renewables – such as the former prime minister Tony Abbott – contend that a high take-up of low-emissions technology will lead to the de-industrialisation of Australia. But Conroy argues the reverse is true. “The shift to renewables also offers Australia the opportunity to revitalise the manufacturing sector. “As the world decarbonises its electricity supply, the nations that can transform into manufacturing powerhouses are those with the cheapest energy, which will be the nations with the best renewable energy resources.” He says the opportunity is twofold. Australia has the highest average solar radiation per square metre of any continent in the world, plus abundant wind and wave resources, generating power that can be firmed by gas peaking plants, pumped hydro and batteries. Conroy says Australia is also well positioned to “be the capital of mining and processing of key inputs for the renewables revolution”. “We are the second-largest producer of rare earths, we supply 41% of the world’s lithium and we have 12.4% of global copper reserves. These are all crucial materials for clean energy and battery manufacture.” Conroy will restate Labor’s commitment to create renewable energy zones if it wins the next federal election. He says the zones will be central to developing new industries such as hydrogen, direct electricity export and new energy intensive manufacturing facilities. He says boosting the domestic renewables industry will have flow-on benefits for traditional industry, with metallurgical coal required to manufacture wind turbines. “In a similar vein, if we source local steel for the wind farms that will be built to meet Labor’s 50% renewable energy commitment, this would need 423,000 tonnes of Australian steel. This is around 10% of Australia’s annual steel production.” He says producing a coherent development plan for Australia’s renewables industry “is not some hippy nirvana” but a transition already underway in other countries. Conroy says the US remains a case in point, despite Donald Trump pulling out of the Paris agreement and winding back some of the environmental regulations of the Obama era. He says there are close to 3.4m clean energy jobs in the US, 200,000 jobs in the United Kingdom and 350,000 in Germany. The speech is critical of the Turnbull and Morrison governments for floating and rejecting a series of energy policy options during this term in government, and Conroy notes that industry and the general public “are crying out for a vision for our energy sector”. The new energy minister, Angus Taylor, was invited to address Thursday’s renewables conference but declined. Labor is yet to determine its final position on the future of national energy guarantee – the policy developed by the Coalition to promote reliability and emissions reduction in the electricity sector – before being dumped by the new Morrison cabinet. But while the opposition’s position is not yet final, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has sent a number of public signals over the past month that the ALP is likely to keep the Neg mechanism with a higher target for emissions reduction. A number of industry stakeholders are lobbying the ALP to keep the Neg. Last month, Shorten told the ABC “we think that there’s something that we can work with there” and “we are prepared to use that as part of our framework going forward”."
"The UN’s environment chief, under fire over huge travel expenses and rule-breaking, has been forced leave the UN general assembly in New York early and return to his Nairobi headquarters to deal with the growing crisis. The problems for Erik Solheim, Norwegian head of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), include the Netherlands becoming the latest nation to withhold millions of dollars in funding until the issues are resolved.  The Guardian can also reveal that Solheim has now recused himself from professional dealings with his wife and a Norwegian company that employed her shortly after it signed a deal with Unep in April. Pressure is growing on Solheim after he was sharply criticised by a draft internal UN audit over his $488,513 globe-trotting travels that called them “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction”. The audit also said he had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and that he claimed unjustified expenses. The UN staff union in Nairobi, where Unep is headquartered, called some of the draft audit’s findings “mind-blowing”. Solheim said he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and that he had made changes where other rules had been broken. Solheim wrote to all 125 national ambassadors on the committee that oversees Unep’s work on Tuesday to tell them he was cutting short his New York trip and putting in place measures to increase the accountability of managers and their travel. “We will address issues of trust between management, our staff, member states and/or partners,” he said in a letter seen by the Guardian. Unep is governed by the UN environment assembly, the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment. Its president, Siim Kiisler, Estonia’s environment minister, told the Guardian the next steps to be taken would be decided when the internal audit was completed. “I need to ensure that member states have full trust that their resources are used for the benefit of the environment,” Kiisler said. “I will read the official report carefully, talk to Mr Solheim and after that form a standpoint.” He said Solheim’s travels had played an important role in making Unep visible, but added: “It certainly has too look and feel right as well, and of course, follow the rules of the system.” On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Dutch government told the Guardian: “A planned payment of €8m will be held until Unep provides more clarity, and until it is clear that Unep is taking this matter seriously.” The job taken by Solheim’s wife, Gry Ulverud, is with the Norwegian company X Four-10/REV Ocean, which aims to build the world’s biggest research ship as well as a “World Ocean Headquarter” near Oslo. On 4 May, the company announced a memorandum of understanding with Unep, although Unep did not issue a press release. On 1 June, Ulverud posted on her Facebook page: “Started New Job at at X Four-10/REV – Manager for Strategy and Partnership”. The page has now been removed. “In relation to any notion of nepotism, I wish to clarify that my spouse was recruited to REV Ocean through an open, transparent and competitive process,” said Solheim. He said her recruitment was based on 25 years of professional experience “with the Norwegian Refugee Council, as a diplomat, as deputy representative to Unesco from 2014-2016 and over 10 years with the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research.” Solheim said he wrote to the UN Ethics Office for advice on the matter of his wife’s appointment on 9 July and again on 11 September, when he told it REV Ocean was giving Unep funding over four years. Solheim said he received the advice on 14 September and wrote to the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, to recuse himself on 19 September, the same day the Guardian first contacted him on the matter. Solheim said he and Ulverud would have no “direct bilateral interaction” when acting in their official capacities. He said all matters relating to REV Ocean would now be dealt with by the Unep deputy executive director. The Guardian has also seen emails relating to an initial refusal to allow Ulverud to attend a Unep meeting on marine plastic litter in May, just before she started at REV Ocean. One senior manager advises Ulverud to ask an official for “assistance”. That official then asks colleagues: “Can we think of a creative way to have Gry join the meeting next week?” Ulverud was subsequently invited. “The available records do not indicate that Ms Ulverud used any influence to obtain access to the meeting other than being an employee of a private sector entity in partnership with Unep,” said Solheim. Her contract started just after the meeting took place, but a Unep spokesman said: “Her employer requested her to do a number of things before assuming her new functions, including attending the meeting in Nairobi.” The Guardian can be contacted securely here or by email at damian.carrington@theguardian.com"
"New energy efficient eco-designs for 15 products including fridges, TVs and dishwashers have been delayed, EU diplomats say, even though experts consider them “crucial” to meeting Europe’s Paris climate pledge. The delays are also expected to mean consumers will miss out on lower energy bills. The design revamps would have saved 62m tonnes of CO2 emissions – as much as Sweden’s annual primary energy consumption – but now look set to be dealt with by the next commission, in which far right parties may be more influential.  Only five energy labelling measures are on track to be approved by a 2 November deadline and at least half of the design overhauls are unlikely to be approved before the European parliament goes into recess in March. “The measures are delayed and we are worried,” one EU diplomat told the Guardian, “We know that some of the products won’t make it but we really hope that we will have nine or 10 of them.” Any hold-ups would impact on EU climate pledges, the official said, adding that a worst case scenario in which all 15 eco-designs were sent back to the drawing board “would not be acceptable” to his government. This would involve a costly bureaucratic double take, with recalculations and technical specifications needed from EU officials, consultants and research centres after 2019. Chloé Fayole, a senior programme manager at the European Environmental Citizens Organisation for Standards (Ecos) said a two-year postponement in adopting the latest package would cost consumers and business €46bn (£41bn) in increased energy bills. Eco-design and energy labelling improvements made up a quarter of the EU’s carbon dioxide emissions cuts in the years to 2020 – and one half of its energy savings. The new measures were expected to save about 5% of Europe’s annual electricity consumption by 2030, and introduce innovative requirements for recycling and repairability. But the EU has been spooked by the past success of UK tabloid campaigns against eco-design proposals, burying planned revamps of hairdryers and hot drinks vending machines in 2016. Officials declined to be quoted on the latest delay, citing a clampdown on whistleblowers under the Juncker commission, but EU sources told the Guardian that the office of Martin Selmayr, the commission secretary general, was responsible for it. Selmayr denied responsibility in comments emailed to the Guardian. He said: “All decisions are on the way, as scheduled by the responsible commission services in the commission’s Decide system and as validated by the first vice-president and the president’s cabinet.” Selmayr’s boss, Jean-Claude Juncker, promised to be “big on the big things and small on the small things” when he was appointed in 2014. Proposals to scrap or review eco-design and energy labelling laws followed soon after, and a bid to improve energy-guzzling toasters went up in flames during the Brexit referendum. Fayole said: “It’s extremely disappointing to see high-level EU officials sabotage Europe’s plans for climate action and waste reduction. Taken behind closed doors, this decision will result in huge losses for consumers and the environment. This is surely not the right strategy ahead of the European elections.” Other products at risk from the delay include washing machines, industrial fans, electric motors, power transformers and welding equipment."

"Climate change is fueling heatwaves, hurricanes and floods, gradually making certain places in the US challenging, if not outright miserable, to live in. Scientists, and some members of the public, are starting to question where in the US will remain comfortable to call home.  The answer, broadly speaking, is north and maybe west. Florida has seen a population boom in recent decades but the southern portion of the state is on course to be submerged by rising seas. The Gulf coast will get supercharged hurricanes, while the south-west and south-east US will be baked by increasingly hostile heat. “Areas towards the north and away from the ocean and that central corridor where you get tornadoes probably look best,” said Vivek Shandas, an expert on climate change’s impact on cities at Portland State University. Shandas recommends looking to live in a “band roughly above the 42nd parallel” – a line of latitude that divides New York and Pennsylvania and forms the southern borders of Oregon and Idaho. Places close to a reliable source of water without being flood-prone as the seas rise are attractive, such as areas near the Great Lakes and the Pacific north-west. “Seattle doesn’t break 90F that often so it’ll be nothing like Phoenix in terms of tolerability of heat,” said Shandas. “Places like Portland, Oregon, and Boise, Idaho, will be relatively safeguarded, apart from a bit of wildfire smoke.” There will be bastions elsewhere. “Cincinnati, for example, is surprisingly good,” said Shandas. “It’s close to the Great Lakes, away from hurricanes, away from the eastern seaboard. It will get more heatwaves, but then again we all will.” Much of the east coast will look dicey if the seas rise at such a pace that they’ll be 6ft higher by the end of the century, but plenty will rest on local decisions made to shield residents from flooding. New York City, for example, is flanked by rising water and is already stiflingly hot in summer, but a multibillion-dollar strategy to build flood defenses and buy out vulnerable areas should help stave off the worst impacts. Climate resiliency is a growing focus for many towns and cities that fret about expensive clean-up costs from disasters, shading people from the heat or dealing with an eroding tax base should residents decide to uproot and head somewhere safer. The scope of these climate considerations is vast, touching on everything from transport links to the availability of flood insurance. Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard University, said that he likes Buffalo, New York, and Duluth, Minnesota, as climate refuges as they tick many of the appropriate boxes. “Their sources of energy production are stable, they have cooler climates and they have access to plenty of fresh water,” Keenan said. “They also have less vulnerability to forest fires, as compared to somewhere like the Pacific north-west. They also have a legacy of excess infrastructural capacity that allows them to diversify their economy in the future. Land prices are cheap and they have a relatively well-educated and skilled labor force.” These safe havens are more of a fantasy wishlist for many moderate-to low-income people as property and rental values rise in desirable areas. Others won’t want to leave more vulnerable parts of the US due to more umbilical links, to family and jobs and a sense of home. “As we saw after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Maria, communities that are able to move can do so, especially if family and friends do the same,” said Shandas. “Those with less resources are left behind.”"
"America’s national parks have warmed twice as fast as the US average and could see some of the worst effects of climate change, according to a new study. Most of Joshua Tree national park could become uninhabitable for its eponymous trees, glaciers will continue to melt away at Glacier national park, and many other of America’s most treasured beauty spots could be rendered virtually unrecognizable by climate change, Patrick Gonzalez, the lead author of the study, writes in the journal Environmental Research Letters.  Even the tiniest of creatures are at risk in the worst-case predictions: the American pika, a small alpine mammal, may no longer be able to survive on park land. “We are preserving the most remarkable ecosystems, and they happen to be in extreme environments,” said Gonzalez, a climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. Gonzalez is also the principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service but conducted and spoke about the research in his university capacity. The study finds that temperatures in national parks could go up 3 to 9C by 2100, under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s worst-case scenario, which shows what could happen without policies to decrease greenhouse gas pollution. With lower emissions, temperatures could still increase more than 2C (3.6F) for 58% of park land, compared to 22% of the US as a whole, according to the study. They are particularly vulnerable because most US park land is in areas that are heating up quicker: in the mountains, the Arctic and the dry south-west. Alaska parks would see the most extreme heat increases, and the US Virgin Islands parks face 28% less rainfall by the end of the century. In Glacier Bay national park, the Muir Glacier melted 640 meters between 1948 and 2000. In Yellowstone national park, trees are dying because bark beetles are thriving in warmer winters. Yellowstone will also become far more vulnerable to wildfires. The area burned could be up to three to 10 times higher by 2100. Joshua Tree national park in California could lose up to 90% of the habitat suitable for its namesake trees. Gonzalez explained that parks at a higher elevation have a thinner atmosphere that warms faster. Higher temperatures are also melting snow cover and making the ground darker so that it absorbs more heat. Parks in California and the south-west US have seen both high temperatures and record-low rainfall, he said. The research is the first comprehensive look at climate change impacts on national parks, Gonzalez said. He said he has been using the climate impacts research to develop plans for parks to adapt and reduce the greenhouse gas pollution they contribute. The Trump administration has rescinded government efforts to slow climate change. The interior department, where the National Park Service is housed, nixed a policy that would have urged management decisions based on science, including climate change research. Park officials in New England scrubbed references to climate change and flooding risks in a report this summer, according to Reveal. The National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the study or climate change policies for parks. Jonathan Jarvis, the National Park Service director under Barack Obama who now works at UC Berkeley, said he relied on climate change projections to decide where to relocate and bolster structures in the Everglades national park in Florida, an area that has been hit by hurricanes and faces sea-level rise. Jarvis said he worries that under Trump parks won’t be able to plan long-term for climate change. “The park service manages these assets, these places, for the benefit of the American people, and they should be based on the best available sound science in the long-term public interest, not for some short-term political agenda,” Jarvis said."
"The house on Weber Hill Road is almost a year gone, but it still haunts Emilie Hayes. Thirteen years ago, when she and her husband Steve bought the Missouri property in a foreclosure sale, Hayes vaguely knew that it was in a 100-year floodplain. But the purchase put her children in public schools ranked among the top in the state, and the Meramec river was a whole two miles away. A trickle of a creek that cut behind the house was too small to merit a name. In Sunset Hills, flooding seemed a distant, rare hazard.  Over nearly a decade, the risk revealed itself to be greater than Hayes had known. By 2008, that backyard tributary had roared often enough that the family stacked sandbags permanently next to the beige bungalow to deflect the floodway. Then, on New Year’s Eve in 2015, a storm called Goliath helped  raise the Meramec to a record historic crest of 44ft. Hayes heard a boom as water crashed through their doorway. Muddy water swallowed their basement. It covered the doorframe where she had marked the growth of four children in pencil. “We would never live there if we could do it again,” Hayes, 45, says. No laws require Missouri property owners to warn potential buyers about past flooding – even though the National Flood Insurance Program has paid out more than $813m in damage claims in the state, on 33 federal disasters over 40 years. City ordinance prohibited the Hayes family from modifying their land with berms or levees, and the government refused to buy them out. Last year, after another record flood, the city of Sunset Hills ordered the house demolished. Hayes refuses to sell her piece of the floodplain to a private buyer. “We don’t want somebody to build a house there and have this happen again,” she says. “It wouldn’t be right.” Every US state has seen high water in the last five years; flooding is the largest and most frequent disaster in the country. But in 21 states, homeowners are guaranteed little information about flood risk, according to an analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “You can get a file on yourself from the FBI,” saysNatural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) attorney Joel Scata. “Why can’t you get the file on your property?” When it comes to a property owner’s risk from disasters like flood or fire, “there’s a moral responsibility to ensure that anything that is knowable is known,” says Roy Wright, president of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety and the former head of the National Flood Insurance Program. Still, no one place, public or private, holds all that information, even as losses from natural disasters have risen over the last 40 years. In the Carolinas, where Hurricane Florence recently dumped nearly 3ft of rain, both states require only that sellers tell buyers of their “actual knowledge” of flood hazards. South Carolina property owners must disclose whether they have flood insurance at the time of sale. In North Carolina, even where past federal aid requires flood insurance, buyers aren’t guaranteed to find out about a property’s risk. If you were supposed to have flood insurance but didn’t, says Scata, “your chances of getting federal aid are pretty slim”. Many homes in both states outside the federally designated 100-year floodplain are still drying out; for them, disclosure requirements and their consequences are murky at best. Notification efforts for property owners vulnerable to disaster remain uneven across the US, with wide gaps. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says 2017 saw a record $300bn in disaster loss, much of it from fires. Wildfire risk is growing, in the western US in particular, both because of climate change and because local development codes are stuffing new homes into the seam between urban and wildland areas. Since 1990, the size of such areas has swollen by a third. No federal systems alert potential property owners where wildfire may strike next, though some states, including California and Colorado, have mapped regional hazards. Retired lawyer John MacKay, 64, says he didn’t dwell on risk when he moved to Nederland, a foothill community west of Boulder. “It’s the natural beauty, that’s why we moved here,” he says. “I’ll go to a hospice if I want to be absolutely safe.” Two years ago, he and his wife sold up in Florida. With a buddy, MacKay readied his new house in Colorado, getting it painted and moving in clothes, papers and other possessions. A month later, as he watched from afar in Tampa, the Cold Springs fire destroyed eight homes, including his. “It was devastating,” he says. “We were crying for a month. I didn’t come back out right away, because what the hell are you going to do?” MacKay’s first Colorado home was a painful education about the hazards of the backcountry, but he calls it a near miss. When he later bought a second, he was more conscious of its vulnerabilities. Where fire risk is high, as in Boulder county, local efforts have cropped up to reduce it. A voluntary mitigation program called Wildfire Partners advised MacKay to clear wood mulch away from the sides of his house, and to remove notoriously flammable juniper trees. “I’m very fire conscious now, as you can imagine,” MacKay says with a laugh. “I was a dumbass, no question about it. But it all worked out, and we’re happier than ever.” Market forces offer homeowners like MacKay a glimpse of risk. Housing prices are a weak signal for disasters; despite the fires in Santa Rosa, California, for example, the median home price there has continued to climb. But the cost of insurance does tell property owners about fire and flood, if imperfectly. “The price tag is a cue,” says Amy Bach, executive director of advocacy group United Policyholders. Bach says insurers have more experience adjusting to coastal risk and hurricanes. For homeowners risking wildfire damage, Bach argues the industry is “still adjusting”. (In California, those adjustments have set off complaints about spiking rates and losses in coverage.) Last year’s disasters reopened questions about local notice requirements. In Houston, some people lived inside a “flood pool”, an area used for emergency inundation, but beyond the boundaries of the floodplain itself. They now argue that the government should have told them about the risk. In August, California’s governor, Jerry Brown, signed a bill requiring insurers to give homeowners a replacement cost estimate for loss in case of disaster. But informing property owners about disaster risk isn’t the same thing as reducing the risk itself, says Max Moritz, a UC cooperative extension fire scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Even perfect information isn’t the whole solution. There’s got to be some policies in place to help us where we’re not always going to make the right decision.” Floodplain experts, consumer groups and environmentalists have pushed for a federal-level disclosure notice, under which a property’s flood history would be made public, but such federal disclosure mandates are extremely rare. Only lead paint disclosures are required by federal law at every property sale. Legislation incorporating disclosure principles in the event of flood has passed the House of Representatives, but remains stalled in the Senate. Nevertheless, a federal notice requirement for flood risk may sound like the right thing to weary homeowners; 81% of voters polled by the Pew Foundation last year supported one. Even though such a disclosure rule might harm him, 77-year-old Nate Timm supports the idea too. Late last month, his house in Mazomanie, Wisconsin, flooded badly. At least 12 homes in his village have been condemned. “It just is traumatic,” he says. Timm bought his land 47 years ago, without ever seeing a flood map; over time, he became a leader in minimizing his village’s risk of rising waters. After the town flooded three times in 10 years, Mazomanie cleaned out the floodplain, taking out truckloads of trees and debris year after year, mostly with volunteers. Timm credits that mitigation effort with saving his village from the worst flood risk for 17 years. But he says all that work was no match for climate change, which he blames for 15 inches of rain falling in 24 hours in August. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” Timm says. Timm didn’t need insurance when he got a mortgage; now that it’s paid off, a policy is too expensive. With hindsight, he says he might have planned better. “Considering the impact of climate change, maybe I would have built higher. Maybe I would not have built in that spot.” Warning prospective buyers about past flooding would make sales more fair and regional planning more effective, he insists. “How can you be smart if the information is hidden?” he asks. But if a federal notice rule took effect, Timm suspects that would sap the value of properties like his, paid off decades ago. For older people like him, retired, middle class, a piece of land is a nest egg, security for retirement. He worries disclosure would trap them in vulnerable properties. “If you knew that a place is in the floodplain – OK, you wouldn’t buy that place,” Timm says. “That’s fine for somebody who is coming in for the first time.” This flood has dimmed the future at the property where he spent the last half-century. Timm says he’s thinking of giving up and moving upstate, closer to family. After taking care of his village, Mazomanie, and himself, all these years, Timm feels that, when it comes to the risk of climate change, he’s on his own."

"Brutal heatwaves and forest fires, species extinction and biodiversity loss, melting ice caps and rising sea levels. Every week it seems new and terrible environmental records are being set. Staving off the worst impacts of this reality is one of the defining challenges of our time. I have committed the last 15 years of my life to addressing this as part of the environmental movement. From policy meetings in 10 Downing Street and direct action, to closing coal-fired power stations, I have tried to drive change through any and all means.  I also have a great love for traditionalmusic and perform as one half of a folk duo with Sid Goldsmith. Until recently, my professional and musical life were unrelated. But a few years ago, Sid and I were performing at a folk festival. The gig came after a busy week working on a major announcement that put an end date on coal-fired power in the UK; a development that would cut 20% of the UK’s carbon emissions. And yet we were singing traditional songs about past wars, lost loves and everyday life for people living in the England of old. Sid – who had worked in organic horticulture and struggled against a farming system heavily weighted towards large-scale interests – and I suddenly had a sense that our music was not direct enough in tackling these important issues. We started to wonder whether folk musicians could – and should – do more to reflect on the modern world and the political developments that define our generation’s lives. The environmental movement needed a stronger cultural voice and songs that were rallying cries to help the cause. Folk music can be a powerful political tool. Folk singers have played a critical role in many social and political movements – from Dick Gaughan in the miners’ strike to James Connolly’s fight for Irish independence, or Pete Seeger’s contributions to the civil rights movement in the US. Folksongs have galvanised activists and helped spread a message of hope: we shall overcome. There is something unique about the form of a folksong that lends itself to stirring resistance and hope. Perhaps it is its participatory nature. Many of the classic political folksongs, such as If I Had a Hammer, are inspired by a tradition of work songs that are designed to be sung together and passed down the generations. And the sharing of songs can help unify people around a joint purpose. As James Connolly wrote in 1907: “Until a movement is marked by the joyous, defiant, singing of revolutionary songs, it lacks one of the most distinctive marks of a popular revolutionary movement, it is the dogma of a few, and not the faith of the multitude.” So why doesn’t folk play a larger part in environmentalism? There is wonderful and powerful music already out there; Karine Polwart and Nancy Kerr are among the artists writing environmental material. And there’s a fascinating new project, Songhive, that highlights the plight of Britain’s native bees. But much more can be done to poetically explore the environmental challenges we face as a species, the politics that underpin the damage we are doing and how as humans we are responding. Sid and I address these issues in our music. Our version of John Conolly’s 2004 song The Last Ploughshare speaks of the damage we are doing to the natural world. Our interpretation of Harvest Gypsies, a Boo Hewerdine song, is about the migration of agricultural workers across depression-era America as they escaped the dust bowls caused by damaging farming practices. These practices are still in use and the parallels between those American workers and the future movement of people across the globe as our climate changes are striking. We draw out these parallels and engage in a discussion with the audience about what we can do to address the problem. Our merchandise table often serves as more of a stage for debating soil erosion than for selling CDs! Sometimes we are less direct. Our song The Tide explores how the great tide of people that washes in and out of London each day is a far more significant rhythm for many of us than the tidal rhythms of the River Thames, which would have dominated Londoners’ lives in the past. This disconnection from the natural world partly explains the damage we are doing; why would we protect something that we are so distanced from? Many of the folk clubs of the 1960s and 70s were political spaces where radical ideas could be discussed. It must have felt to people then that they were part of something bigger than folk music and that they were engaging with the political struggles of the time. But many of those clubs are now gone. We need new spaces in which we can experience environmental art, discuss politics, collaborate across disciplines and – most importantly – spread hope that progress is possible if we come together. A performance from last year sticks in my mind. We were at Fire in the Mountain, a beautiful festival held in West Wales. It was a period of bruising political upheaval. People in the UK were reeling from the Brexit debate, a divisive general election campaign and the election of Donald Trump. It felt that night as if our music enabled a collective processing of what was happening in the world, and, crucially, offered hope that better times will come. As we left the stage, the audience continued our final, hopeful chorus from the song Keep your Hand on the Plough. It struck Sid and I that the simple act of bringing people together is a solution to the problems we sing of. A shared sense of purpose and agency can be uniquely stirred by music, and we as musicians must do all we can to create that. The power of folk music lies not just in its ability to document social change but also to effect it. So this is a call to arms for artists, and particularly folk musicians, to engage with environmental issues and for the environmental movement to seek out and support artists who are attempting to help the cause. •Jimmy & Sid tour the UK until 21 December. Their album Many a Thousand is out now. "
"Abandoning the UK’s ambitions for a number of new nuclear power stations would cause carbon emissions to spike and push up energy costs, according to lobbyists led by a former Conservative MP. The New Nuclear Watch Institute warned against what it called the “folly of technological tribalism” of pursuing a future powered by renewables and gas-fired power stations, rather than any new nuclear plants. Excluding nuclear would cause the UK to emit millions of extra tonnes of carbon dioxide and put the country’s carbon targets out of reach, the group concluded in a report due to be published on Thursday. Tim Yeo, the institute’s chairman, said: “Abandoning nuclear power leads unavoidably to a very big increase in carbon emissions, which will prevent Britain from meeting its legally-binding climate change commitments. It also raises the cost of electricity.” The claims will be seen as a direct riposte to recent suggestions from the government’s infrastructure advisers, who urged ministers to cool their ambitions for as many as six new nuclear projects and prioritise renewables instead. The National Infrastructure Commission suggested the UK back only one more nuclear plant after the two reactors being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset. However, the New Nuclear Watch Institute, which is supported by nuclear industry firms including the South Korean company eyeing a nuclear project in Cumbria, said “technological zealots” were trying to restrict the range of options for cleaning up electricity generation. The group compared a worst-case scenario – where old nuclear plants are rapidly phased out, Hinkley Point C is cancelled, no nuclear plants are built and offshore windfarms and gas plants fill the gap – with one where nuclear plants account for nearly half of electricity generation by 2030. The “no nuclear” world would lead to the cost of managing the UK’s energy system being 15% higher and result in an extra 35m tonnes of CO2, around a tenth of today’s annual emissions. However, the comparison is based on an extreme scenario – few expect Hinkley Point C will be axed, given the billions EDF Energy has already poured into it. The government has repeatedly made clear it is committed to new nuclear plants but has been grappling with how to help the financing of their huge upfront costs."
"The first commercial flight to use jet fuel partly made from recycled industrial waste has landed at Gatwick. The Virgin Atlantic plane, travelling from Orlando to London, was powered by a new blend of normal jet fuel and ethanol produced from waste gases, which the airline says could significantly lower aviation’s carbon footprint. The flight’s fuel blend was 5% recycled, but the sustainable element could eventually form up to 50%. It was produced in the US by LanzaTech, which claims it could eventually supply about 20% of the aviation industry’s fuel, and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 65% compared with conventional petroleum. Virgin is bidding for government support to have plants built in the UK that could fuel all its operations. Welcoming the Boeing 747 on arrival was Sir Richard Branson, the airline’s founder, who said the flight was a huge step forward in making the fuel a mainstream reality. “Working with LanzaTech will enable us to greatly reduce our carbon emissions and, at the same time, help support UK industry,” he said. “This fuel takes waste, carbon-rich gases from industrial factories and gives them a second life so that new fossil fuels don’t have to be taken out of the ground.” Virgin called on ministers to provide financial backing for LanzaTech to open three UK plants by 2025, potentially producing up to 125m gallons of the jet fuel blend a year. The LanzaTech chief executive, Jennifer Holmgren, said: “We have shown that recycling waste carbon emissions into jet fuel is not impossible, that waste carbon needs to be thought [of] as an opportunity not a liability, that carbon can be reused over and over again.” However, other similar schemes have failed to come to fruition. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the British Airways owner, IAG, bitterly criticised a lack of government support for a proposed east London GreenSky factory, which it said could fuel all BA flights from London City airport after 2014, but was never built and abandoned in 2016. The Department for Transport has since committed some funds towards a new project from the biofuels company Velocys, backed by BA and Shell, which could turn household waste, including nappies, into jet fuel. The aviation minister, Liz Sugg, said: “We are committed to cutting carbon emissions and promoting new environmentally-friendly fuels, especially for aeroplanes, which will rely on traditional fuels for years to come.” The UK’s binding climate change targets only require the aviation industry to stay within 2005 levels of CO2 emissions by 2050 – although rapid growth in the number of flights is predicted. Most progress in managing aviation emissions to date has been through more efficient planes – Virgin reported a 24% reduction in its overall CO2 emissions from 2007 t0 2017, with aircraft such as 787s starting to replace old 747s. But the widespread use of more sustainable fuels, allied with carbon-offsetting schemes, will also be required."
"Three years after world leaders signed the Paris climate agreement, we’re about to better understand what that deal means for how we live our lives. On Monday, a major report from the UN’s climate science panel will set out what it will take to limit global warming to 1.5C, the key Paris target. There are reasons to think the world is, finally, getting to grips with climate change. Carbon emissions are still rising but more slowly than before, and in many countries they’re falling. The UK has slashed its emissions to 19th-century levels, and we’re not alone – plenty of other countries, including the US, are making progress as well. Crucially, that’s happened without many people noticing, suggesting the world might be able to deal with the problem without having to persuade the public to change their polluting lifestyles. Studies confirm what we might guess: people lose motivation when they think others aren’t pulling their weight But this is wishful thinking. The UK’s recent emissions cuts have mostly come from shutting coal power stations, which had few friends, and there aren’t many left to close. And that only happened after years of campaigning, but it was still much easier than what is to come. Cutting emissions further to stop dangerous warming will depend on people changing how they live: flying less and eating less meat and dairy, for example. There’s no way this can be done as quietly as what’s been achieved so far. Persuading people to cut down on things they enjoy for the sake of the climate might seem impossible. In most European countries, about three-quarters of the public say they’re worried about climate change, yet less than a third would accept higher taxes on fossil fuels to cut emissions. But this climate apathy can be overcome if it’s tackled in the right way. The first step is to understand the psychology behind apathy. Climate change is exactly the kind of threat our minds aren’t equipped to worry about. It seems distant, happening mostly in the future and to other people. The widespread tendency to think “I’ll be OK”, known as optimism bias, makes it easier for people to assume such distant problems won’t affect them. Partisanship is a problem, too. Arguments about climate change are often polarised between left and right, and the public widely see it as a left issue. This is a problem because people are more likely to believe what they hear from those they identify with, and to reject what they hear from others. If they usually hear about climate change from leftwing people, the majority will tend to think it’s not for them. The distance between emissions and their effects also makes it harder to feel guilty or outraged about them. It’s easy enough to be angry when a crime has an identifiable victim, and to feel ashamed when we are at fault. But climate change is double-blind: everyone’s emissions go into the same atmosphere and no one knows in advance who exactly will suffer. Burning fossil fuels isn’t a victimless crime, but it’s not instinctively obvious who the culprits and the victims are. And there are more psychological barriers. Cutting emissions requires people to trust authorities to be competent, honest and fair – a tall order at a time when only a third of people say they trust government. Those authorities have to persuade the public to change how they live. But most people don’t like change, favour the status quo and are averse to losing what they have. This is compounded by the fear that others might be freeloading on our efforts. Studies confirm what we might guess: people lose motivation when they think others aren’t pulling their weight – it’s known as the sucker effect. Yet, daunting though these barriers are, they can be beaten with political leadership and honesty. To start with, the international community has to admit its plans aren’t enough. Commitments to cut emissions, such as the Paris Agreement and the UK’s Climate Change Act, give the impression the problem is under control. It isn’t. The UK is set to miss its targets from the mid-2020s, while global plans are so weak they would, even if achieved, leave us on course for dangerous warming. In a year in which extreme weather has battered every part of the planet, it shouldn’t be hard to demolish the belief that climate change is someone else’s problem. Those in the centre and right of politics who want serious action to be taken should be more prominent in the debate. You don’t have to agree with a Conservative about how to cut emissions to see that the issue looks more pressing when it can’t be dismissed as the special interest of one political faction. But everything rests on showing that the process is fair. When Donald Trump announced the US would pull out of the Paris agreement, he said it was because the deal was unfair, not because climate change itself was a hoax. Success depends not only on showing he was wrong about how the effort is shared between countries, but also on showing the effort is being shared fairly at home. Governments must be smarter than just taxing pollution – they will fail if most people have to change what they eat and where they go on holiday, while the rich can buy their way out of any sacrifices – and they have to be transparent about how they are sharing the burden fairly. It won’t be all burden, though. Cutting emissions could bring benefits including clean air, new forests and well-insulated homes. Research suggests these can be the most persuasive arguments for climate action. The BBC TV programme Blue Planet II transformed how we think about the impact consuming plastic has on the planet. Since its broadcast last year, we have had a tougher plastic bag tax, a ban on microbeads, calls for a latte levy on disposable cups, and supermarkets racing to scrap plastic packaging. This happened because it made us face up to the way our lives contradict our values. The show first made us fall in love with the oceans, before confronting us with what we’re doing to them: albatrosses, turtles and whales choking on the rubbish we – each of us, personally – throw away. But Blue Planet II didn’t produce a similar outcry about climate change. That may not seem a problem so long as there are emissions cuts that don’t rely on people in vast numbers changing how they live. But as the world faces up to what it will take to limit warming to 1.5C, it’s clear this road is running out. There’s no way to stop dangerous warming that doesn’t involve the public. • Leo Barasi is the author of The Climate Majority: Apathy and Action in an Age of Nationalism, published by New Internationalist"
"Warnings about the dangers of global warming are being watered down in the final version of a key climate report for a major international meeting next month, according to reviewers who have studied earlier versions of the report and its summary. They say scientists working on the final draft of the summary are censoring their own warnings and “pulling their punches” to make policy recommendations seem more palatable to countries – such as the US, Saudi Arabia and Australia – that are reluctant to cut fossil-fuel emissions, a key cause of global warming. “Downplaying the worst impacts of climate change has led the scientific authors to omit crucial information from the summary for policymakers,” said one reviewer, Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.  “However, if governments do not recognise the full scale and urgency of the risks, they may underestimate how critical it is to meet the goal of the Paris agreement on climate change. And that could have very serious knock-on effects in the battle to limit the impact of global warming.” The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C and its summary for policymakers were commissioned by governments following the UN meeting in Paris in 2015, when it was agreed to act to limit increases in global average temperature to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels and to try keep that increase nearer to 1.5C. The report – to be presented at a meeting in Korea in early October – will make clear that allowing temperatures to rise by 2C will have devastating consequences, including rising sea levels, spreading deserts, loss of natural habitats and species, dwindling ice-caps and increases in the number of devastating storms. However, it is the report’s summary for policymakers that is causing concern. This is the document politicians will use as a key climate guide when making changes to legislation. Reviewers of earlier drafts say it is being altered to make the dangers of climate change seem less alarming. As a result, they say,, policymakers could seriously underestimate the risks of global warming. Cuts made to the final draft of the summary include: • Any mention that temperature rises of above 1.5C could lead to increased migrations and conflict; • All discussion of the danger of the Gulf Stream being disrupted by cold water flowing from the Arctic where more and more sea-ice is melting; • Warnings about the dangers that 1.5–2C temperature rises could trigger irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet and raise sea levels by 1–2 metres over the next two centuries. Other cuts from the summary include the sentence: “Poverty and disadvantage have increased with recent warming (about 1C) and are expected to increase in many populations as average global temperatures increase from 1C to 1.5C and beyond.”  The original summary also stated “at 2C warming, there is a potential for significant population displacement concentrated in the tropics”. Again this is not mentioned in the report for policymakers. “The scientists who produce reports like these try to summarise the latest knowledge, but they have a reputation for being conservative about the worst risks of climate change,” Ward said. “This time they have outdone themselves in pulling their punches, however.” An IPCC spokesman said member governments would work to ensure the summary for policymakers was consistent with the findings in the main report. “They may change the wording of text there to clarify, remove material from the summary for policymakers, or bring material from the main report that was not there at the start of the session. Any text in the summary for policymakers … is based on the assessment in the main report. Even if it is removed from the summary for policymakers, the finding it is based on remains in the main report.”"
"Five years since the Abbott government scrapped the Climate Commission, the environmentalist Tim Flannery says our energy policy remains hostage to lobbyists, political self-interest and “mad ideologues”. But the organisation Flannery helped start from the ashes of Abbott’s climate bonfire, the Climate Council, says that attitudes have shifted substantially since 2013 – at least those outside federal parliament. “We’re being held hostage at a federal level,” Flannery told Guardian Australia. “It has been a disgrace. Our failures are the failures of a small group of politicians who are supposed to be acting in the national interest. Instead, they’re using energy policy as a cudgel, they’re listening to paid lobbyists and doing their bidding.” “I don’t want to say any more because I’ll just get angry.” Flannery was the chief commissioner of the Climate Commission, a government-backed research body whose remit was to communicate reliable and authoritative information about climate change. The commission lasted just two years, and was almost immediately scrapped by the Abbott government after the 2013 election. Flannery and other commissioners decided to subsequently launch the Climate Council as an independent not-for-profit body. “We raised $1.5m in 10 days,” recalls Amanda McKenzie, the council’s chief executive. “At the time we went out, quite on a limb, because we had no funding. We said we will go ahead if the public backs us. It was the largest crowdfunding campaign in Australian history. Thousands of people were contributing.” “I look back on that time as a really hopeful moment, thinking the community is behind us on this. More and more Australians are concerned about the issue. That concern has elevated over time. “We had no idea that we would still be, five years later, battling for any action on an federal government level.”Flannery points out that Australia’s emissions continue to increase “at a time when they need to be going down”. The federal government has abandoned any commitment to meeting the Paris emissions reduction targets. The new prime minister, Scott Morrison, famously used a lump of coal as a prop in parliament. That state of affairs might cause some to question whether any progress had been made during the past five years. But putting federal politics to one side, both Flannery and McKenzie say strides have been made by individuals, local and state governments. “I think [without the Climate Council] we’d be a long way behind in terms of public awareness, we’d be a huge distance behind,” Flannery said. “Those who were seeking to mislead would be [not held to account].” “I’m immensely proud of it and I think we’ve made a huge difference”. Flannery said the Climate Council initially sought to be a research and information body, filling the gap left by the disbanding of the commission. But in recent years it has taken on a broader remit, actively running programs to support action. “We decided we needed to expand our remit, we’re running out of time to deal with this issue and we needed to pull out all stops. “I think we’ve got to use every leverage point we can at the moment because we’re running out of time. We need to find those programs that work, get involved and start leading them.” One of those programs, which Flannery says he is “most proud of”, is a partnership that supports local governments to transition to clean energy. “What we didn’t realise [five years ago] was that state governments would step into the vacuum and that local governments would step into the vacuum,” McKenzie said. In five years, the council has released more than 100 publications. “If we had failed, it would not only have set back the entire climate change discussion in Australia, it would have given the conservatives an opportunity to say how little everyone cares about climate change,” Flannery said. “There will be a need for the Climate Council I think for decades, because the problem isn’t going to be solved for decades. It’s a pretty tough thing to be pushing against this and find you’re constantly going backwards. But I’m nothing if not stubborn.”"
"If George Monbiot really wants to get people talking about the connection between climate change and the economy, he’d do better to find a different question to “how do we stop growth?” (While growth continues we’ll never kick our fossil fuel habit, 26 September). The elephant in the room is the assumption that nature’s resources and capabilities are so large that they can be considered infinite and so excluded from the economic cost of production. This has the unintended consequence of rewarding destruction. Hence the German situation in Hambacher: the lignite has value because it can be sold to be burned, the 12,000-year-old forest has none unless the trees are cut down for economic use. And, in an infinite world, there are always more 12,000-year-old forests.  This form of thinking might have been a useful simplification when human population and activities were at the levels of the Enlightenment, when much of the philosophy that still drives the economy was developed. Indeed, for any one individual the world is still a remarkably big place and it is difficult to imagine it running out of anything. But a resource that would have supplied an Enlightenment-sized population for 500 years would last today’s just 35 years. And that is without considering increased rates of consumption. Maybe the better question is: how do we rewrite the rules of our economy to reward activities that nourish our future rather than those that destroy it?Harold ForbesWareham, Dorset • With reference to George Monbiot’s article and Sébastien Thibault’s brilliant illustration may I make two suggestions: first, that cycling in the UK is made much more user-friendly – at present only the most intrepid would dare to cycle on our roads, whereas in Holland cycling is an option for all ages, shapes and sizes, not just Lycra-clad athletes; second, when resources are scarce, it makes sense to introduce a fair system of rationing. I remember the rationing of food, clothing and fuel in the 1940s. It was tiresome but necessary and it ensured that no one in UK starved. Rather than destroy our environment, we need to introduce a system of mileage rationing for people using modes of transport which run, directly or indirectly, on fossil fuels. I don’t believe it is a basic human right to be able to jet here, there and everywhere with no restrictions.Jill GreerChadlington, Oxfordshire • George Monbiot is right. It takes a peculiar form of obstinacy for news channels such as the BBC to consistently not mention climate change. Last week, for example, Jeremy Corbyn committed the Labour party to a huge investment in green technology coupled, to zero carbon emissions by 2050. This was ignored in favour of yet more pointless debates about Brexit. Future generations will look back on the present era with a profound sense of disbelief that the Kardashians command 200 times more airtime than climate change does; and that the media’s obsession with Brexit resembles a pack of vultures fighting over a dead carcass from which every item of interest has long since been stripped bare.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the Planet • George Monbiot is right (again). But is there any chance he could get together with, say, Owen Jones, Caroline Lucas and Justin Welby, to tell us how, practically, to get from where we are to where we should be, without catastrophic unemployment, poverty and civil unrest?Philip Hall Cotford St Luke, Somerset • Re climate change, “be the change you wish to see in the world”. Stop driving fossil-fuel cars. Become vegetarian. Consume less. Use less energy. Do not follow fashion. Do not upgrade phones with every new model. Buy products, including clothes, furniture and household items to last. Recycle everything: plastic, glass, metal and organic matter. Take furniture, clothes, DVDs, CDs and everything else that is still usable to charity shops.Neil SinclairEdinburgh • George Monbiot considers the mismatch, between economic growth and environmental sustainability, on a global scale. At an individual level, we all need to forget what everyone else might be doing, and tailor our activities and consumption to much reduced totals. This has to mean a much simplified lifestyle: being happy with our personal relationships, reducing most forms of competition, and devoting our time to caring for other members of society. It means a fundamental change of attitude to everyone else. At a political level, we need to replace competitive politics with cooperative politics. Left and right politics is redundant, as are most of our politicians. As Larry Elliott once said in a related context, “best of luck with that”.Martin LondonHenllan, Denbighshire • George Monbiot is of course quite right. But why will he not take his argument to its logical conclusion? There is one overarching problem which is behind all the others: it subsumes global warming, pollution, the ozone hole, shortages of basic ingredients. It is the population problem: quite simply, there are too many of us. Someone, I forget who, has suggested that if everyone on earth had a European standard of living we would need about three planets to sustain us (five for a North American standard). Some people get very exercised over the thought that there might be 9 or even 10 billion of us by 2050. That is the wrong concern: they (and we) should worry about the 7 billion we have now. I believe that it is not enough to slow or stop population growth; we need to reverse it – drastically, and fast – but this obviously raises some unpleasant decisions. The time to start thinking is now.Tim GosslingCambridge • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"MEPs have voted for a 40% cut in car emissions by 2030, in a rebuke to more cautious proposals by the European commission that signals tough negotiations with national governments ahead. Germany has strongly opposed any increase to the 30% cut in CO2 output proposed by the European commission, although countries such as France have yet to reveal their position.  While the MEPs’ target – along with a 20% milestone agreed for 2025 – would still overshoot the Paris agreement’s objective of holding global warming to 1.5C, it was welcomed by the Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout. “We cannot compromise our climate ambition because certain governments and the commission act as lobbyists for the car industry,” he said. “In upcoming negotiations, the parliament must stand firmly by its newly agreed targets.” British Conservative MEPs voted against the 40% goal despite a government instruction, seen by the Guardian, that welcomed the proposal as being in line with UK policy. The Conservative MEP John Procter said: “We are concerned a 40% target, tied to punitive penalties, may be a step too far at this stage and further threaten jobs.” Officials suggested the ECR’s positioning could strengthen the UK’s hand in negotiations. However, it was condemned as “a total sham” by the Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder. “Do they seriously expect us to believe their government’s promise of a green Brexit after this?” she asked. In a sign of battles to come, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Acea) said the timetable for the changes might be too tight to meet. Acea’s secretary general, Erik Jonnaert, said: “We remain particularly concerned about the extremely aggressive CO2 reduction targets and the imposition of sales quotas for battery electric vehicles that MEPs have backed. Today’s vote risks having a very negative impact on jobs across the automotive value chain.” The MEPs’ decision followed a Danish ban on the sale of automobiles using fossil fuels, announced on Monday, also due to take effect from 2030."
"Fracking protesters have been sent to prison for the first time. It reeks of desperation from the industry and a clampdown on the right to protest. In 2013 I was arrested in Balcombe, West Sussex, for peacefully blockading a fracking site in solidarity with the local community. The charges against me were dropped, but today, for the first time ever, a judge sent three protesters to prison for doing the same thing in Lancashire. All charges relating to over 350 previous acts of non-violent direct action at Preston New Road since work started in January 2017 have led to fines or community service. But, as Cuadrilla prepares to start fracking within weeks, the police have pursued the most severe charge and sentencing possible.  Where I was charged with obstruction in Balcombe, these men are now serving time under the complicated and archaic charge of public nuisance. And their incarceration is part of a wider clampdown on protest. This year the UK is “celebrating” the suffragettes and 100 years since women won the right to vote – but the government’s triumphant narrative glosses over the radical and law-breaking tactics these brave campaigners had to pursue in the name of what was right. And ministers are overseeing a growing trend for draconian injunctions and disproportionate charges against people standing up for what they believe in. In Sheffield last year, Green party councillor Alison Teal was arrested for peacefully preventing unnecessary tree-felling in the city. Next week 15 people will go to court facing terrorism charges for a peaceful protest that grounded a chartered deportation flight. The law they are accused of breaking has never been used against activists before and could see them sentenced to life in prison. The case of the anti-fracking protesters jailed today goes back to July 2017, when a convoy of lorries delivering drilling equipment to the Preston New Road fracking site was spontaneously brought to a halt by protesters. Four men – including a piano restorer, a teacher and a soil scientist – climbed on top of the cabs of the lorries and between them stayed there for four days. During the seven-day court case the defendants weren’t once allowed to contextualise their actions. They were told they couldn’t talk about why they were concerned about fracking, or explain that many people in the community welcomed being mildly inconvenienced if it delayed and deterred the much greater threat of fracking and climate change. These men were standing up for all of us against a dangerous government policy – but they were treated as thoughtless criminals. Now three of them are in prison. A year after the men were arrested and hours before parliament’s summer break, the government quietly granted permission for fracking to go ahead at the Preston New Road site. That same summer break brought some of the most violent impacts of climate change we have ever seen. A global heatwave brought record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires from Sweden and Manchester to Greece and California, and heat-related deaths in several countries. The government’s decision to launch a whole new fossil fuel industry while forest fires burned in the Arctic circle was an unforgivable and reckless act that can only worsen the climate breakdown already impacting millions of people around the world. And while their voices were silenced in court, ministers are silencing the rest of us in our communities. In defiance of democracy and an attempt to bypass the effective resistance of local people to protect their homes and countryside, the government is now planning to force fracking through without consulting local residents. But these proposed changes and the harsh treatment of protesters tell us something – we are winning the fight against fracking. Five years after former chancellor George Osborne embarked on his “Dash for Gas”, Cuadrilla hasn’t been able to get the industry off the ground. Its counterpart in Yorkshire, Third Energy, couldn’t muster the financial backing to get consent for fracking, and has since packed up its operation at Kirby Misperton. Now, on top of national opposition and local resistance, MPs from across parliament are joining the campaign against plans to force fracking on communities without their consent. In the same way I did, the protesters jailed today took action as a last resort – following a call for help from a community overruled by ministers in Westminster. As momentum against fracking grows and the industry limps forward with the help of a government willing to defy its electorate, we owe it to these men behind bars to stand with the local community and stop this industry once and for all. • Caroline Lucas is co-leader of the Green party of England and Wales, and the MP for Brighton Pavilion"
"We’re getting there, aren’t we? We’re making the transition towards an all-electric future. We can now leave fossil fuels in the ground and thwart climate breakdown. Or so you might imagine, if you follow the technology news. So how come oil production, for the first time in history, is about to hit 100m barrels a day? How come the oil industry expects demand to climb until the 2030s? How is it that in Germany, whose energy transition (Energiewende) was supposed to be a model for the world, protesters are being beaten up by police as they try to defend the 12,000-year-old Hambacher forest from an opencast mine extracting lignite – the dirtiest form of coal? Why have investments in Canadian tar sands – the dirtiest source of oil – doubled in a year?  The answer is, growth. There may be more electric vehicles on the world’s roads, but there are also more internal combustion engines. There be more bicycles, but there are also more planes. It doesn’t matter how many good things we do: preventing climate breakdown means ceasing to do bad things. Given that economic growth, in nations that are already rich enough to meet the needs of all, requires an increase in pointless consumption, it is hard to see how it can ever be decoupled from the assault on the living planet. When a low-carbon industry expands within a growing economy, the money it generates stimulates high-carbon industry. Anyone who works in this field knows environmental entrepreneurs, eco-consultants and green business managers who use their earnings to pay for holidays in distant parts of the world and the flights required to get there. Electric vehicles have driven a new resource rush, particularly for lithium, that is already polluting rivers and trashing precious wild places. Clean growth is as much of an oxymoron as clean coal. But making this obvious statement in public life is treated as political suicide. The Labour party’s new environment policy, published this week, rightly argues that “our current economic model is threatening the foundations on which human wellbeing depends”. It recognises that ecological collapse cannot be prevented through consumer choice or corporate social responsibility: the response to our greatest predicament must be determined by scientific research, and planned, coordinated and led by government. It pledges “to meet the Paris agreement goal of limiting global temperature rises to no more than 1.5C”. But, like almost everyone else, it ignores the fundamental problem. Beyond a certain point, economic growth – the force that lifted people out of poverty, and cured deprivation, squalor and disease – tips us back into those conditions. To judge by the devastation climate breakdown is wreaking, we appear already to have reached this point. The contradiction is most obvious when the policy document discusses airports (an issue on which the party is divided). Labour guarantees that any airport expansion must adhere to its tests on climate change. But airport expansion is incompatible with its climate commitments. Even if aircraft emissions are capped at 2005 levels, by 2050 they will account for half the nation’s carbon budget if the UK is not to contribute to more than 1.5C of global warming. If airports grow, they will swallow even more of the budget. Airport expansion is highly regressive, offending the principles of justice and equity that Labour exists to uphold. Regardless of the availability and cost of flights, they are used disproportionately by the rich, as these are the people with the business meetings in New York, the second homes in Tuscany, and the money to pay for winter holidays in the sun. Yet the impacts – noise, pollution and climate breakdown – are visited disproportionately on the poor. I recognise that challenging our least contested ideologies – growth and consumerism – is a tough call. But in New Zealand, it is beginning to happen. Jacinda Ardern, the Labour prime minister, says: “It will no longer be good enough to say a policy is successful because it increases GDP if it also degrades the physical environment.” How this translates into policy, and whether her party will resolve its own contradictions, remains to be determined. No politician can act without support. If we want political parties to address these issues, we too must start addressing them. We cannot rely on the media to do it for us. A report by the research group Media Matters found that total coverage of climate change across five US news networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and PBS) amounted to 260 minutes in 2017 – a little over four hours. Almost all of it was a facet of the Trump psychodrama (Will he pull out of the Paris accord? What’s he gone and done this time?) rather than the treatment of climate chaos in its own right. There was scarcely a mention of the link between climate breakdown and the multiple unnatural disasters the US suffered that year; of new findings in climate science; or of the impacts of new pipelines or coalmines. I cannot find a comparable recent study in the UK. I suspect it is a little better, but not a lot. The worst denial is not the claim that this existential crisis isn’t happening. It is the failure to talk about it at all. Not talking about our greatest predicament, even as it starts to bite, requires a constant and determined effort. Taken as a whole (of course there are exceptions), the media are a threat to humanity. They claim to speak on our behalf, but they either speak against us or do not speak at all. So what do we do? We talk. As the climate writer Joe Romm argued in ThinkProgress this year, a crucial factor in the remarkable shift in attitudes towards LGBT people was the determination of activists to break the silence. They overcame social embarrassment to broach issues that other people found uncomfortable. We need, Romm argues, to do the same for climate breakdown. A recent survey suggests that 65% of Americans rarely or never discuss it with friends or family, while only one in five hear people they know mention the subject at least once a month. Like the media, we subconsciously invest great psychological effort into not discussing an issue that threatens almost every aspect of our lives. Let’s be embarrassing. Let’s break the silence, however uncomfortable it makes us and others feel. Let’s talk about the great unmentionables: not just climate breakdown, but also growth and consumerism. Let’s create the political space in which well-intentioned parties can act. Let us talk a better world into being. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"In the cloud of toxic dust thrown up by the Kavanaugh hearings last week, two new Trump initiatives slipped by with less notice than they deserve. Both are ugly, stupid – and they are linked, though in ways not immediately apparent. In the first, the administration provided the rationale for scrapping President Obama’s automobile mileage standards: because Trump’s crew now officially expects the planet to warm by 4C . In the environmental impact statement they say it wouldn’t make much difference to the destruction of the planet if we all keep driving SUVs.  The news in that statement is that administration officials serenely contemplate that 4C rise (twice the last-ditch target set at the Paris climate talks). Were the world to actually warm that much, it would be a literal hell, unable to maintain civilizations as we have known them. But that’s now our policy, and it apparently rules out any of the actions that might, in fact, limit that warming. You might as well argue that because you’re going to die eventually, there’s no reason not to smoke a carton of cigarettes a day. Meanwhile, reporters also discovered that the administration has set up what can only be described as a concentration camp near the Mexican border for detained migrant children, spiriting them under cover of darkness from the foster homes and small shelters across the nation where they had been staying. Not an extermination camp – these aren’t Nazis – but a camp that literally concentrates this “problem” in one place: a tent city in the middle of the desert. Schooling is not available there, as it was in the shelters they came from; instead the kids are given “workbooks that they have no obligation to complete. Access to legal services is limited.” That camp is linked to climate change because, first, it’s in a desert. If you searched high and low across the North American continent, you could barely find a place hotter and drier than Tornillo, Texas, where in June the average high is 96F and where, as one climate data source succinctly puts it, “there is virtually no rainfall during the year”. But the link goes much deeper. Most of those migrants are from Central America and Mexico, and they might as easily be described as refugees fleeing gang violence (much of it rooted originally in the US) and a changing climate. Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras first saw an outbreak of coffee rust linked to higher nighttime temperatures; the El Niño that began in 2015 led to years of unprecedented drought. Deep new droughts this summer wiped out more harvests: “total or partial loss of crops means that subsistence farmers and their families will not have enough food to eat or sell in coming months,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization warned. The author Todd Miller, writing in the Nation, described meeting men trying to jump a train in Guatemala headed north toward the border. “When I asked why they were heading for the United States, one responded simply, “No hubo lluvia.” (“There was no rain.”) This will, of course, get steadily worse in the years ahead – every climate forecast shows deserts spreading and water evaporating across the region. And of course more migration will follow, in every corner of the world. The World Bank predicts we may see 140 million climate migrants before long, and given the chaos that even a million people fleeing the (partially drought-fueled) crisis in Syria created, we better come to grips. Some of that migration will be internal – perhaps six million people will abandon their coastal property in Florida alone, according to recent reports. And much of it will be international, as people flee because their lives depend on it. Telling people to stay home is not an option – when there’s no water, or when the floods come each year, or when the sea rises into your kitchen, people have to leave. Period. And telling people to stay home is not a moral option, either. Because the climate chaos setting off waves of refugees is born above all from the unconstrained migration of carbon dioxide molecules from America over the last century. No wall can prevent the exhaust from our armada of oversized cars from raising the temperature in Mexico; if Guatemala could ship its changed climate back north it doubtless would, but it can’t. We have to realize that global warming stems from the fact that we are a world without atmospheric borders, where the people who have done the least to cause the problem feel its horrors first and hardest. That’s why, over the last half-decade, the environmental and migrant-rights movement have grown ever closer. The Trump years are a fantasy land where we pretend we can go on living precisely as in the past, unwilling even to substitute electric SUVs for our gas guzzlers, and able to somehow insist that the rest of the world stay locked in place as well. It’s impractical, it’s unfair, and when it ends up with camps for kids in the desert it’s downright evil."
"Chinese coal-fired power plants, thought to have been cancelled because of government edicts, are still being built and are threatening to “seriously undermine” global climate goals, researchers have warned. Satellite photos taken in 2018 of locations in China reveal cooling towers and new buildings that were not present a year earlier at plants that were meant to stop operations or be postponed by orders from Beijing. The projects are part of an “approaching tsunami” of coal plants that would boost China’s existing coal capacity by 25%, according to the research group Coalswarm. The total capacity of the planned coal power stations is about 259GW, bigger than the American coal fleet and “wildly out of line” with the Paris climate agreement, the group said in a new report. “This new evidence that China’s central government hasn’t been able to stop the runaway coal-fired power plant building is alarming – the planet can’t tolerate another US-sized block of plants to be built,” said Ted Nace, executive director of CoalSwarm, which is funded by international green groups and private donations. Many of the power stations date back to a 2014-16 surge when the regime permitting construction was devolved from Beijing to provincial authorities. That led to a threefold increase in permits being issued between 2013 and 2015. In response, during 2016 and 2017 the Chinese government ordered projects to be slowed down, postponed or cancelled. But satellite photos analysed by Coalswarm show many power stations have continued to be built, including the Huadian Nanxiong station in south-east China. Despite the government ordering the plant to be suspended in January 2017, two cooling towers had sprung up by March 2018. Other photographs show water vapour emerging from cooling towers where there was none before, such as at the Zhoukou Longda power station in central China, which indicatesa plant burning coal and generating electricity. Some plants seem to have been built but not connected to the grid, which Coalswarm said appeared to be officials using a “sleight of hand” to avoid busting the government-imposed cap on coal. China’s current five-year plan dictates that there should be no more than 1,100GW of coal by 2020, but the 259GW increase via new plants comes on top of 993GW of existing capacity. Coalswarm said that given China had about half the world’s coal power capacity the country’s “coal policies have an outsized effect on global climate prospects”. The group called on China to act quickly to cancel the projects."
"We are following a path that will ultimately take us to a 4C-warmer world. A hot state where it is unlikely that we can generate food, water and shelter for all citizens, where sea level rise will ultimately exceed 10 metres, and where social insecurity and widespread disease will very likely be universal. Along the way we will reach several critical tipping points. One such is at 2C – a scenario that may prompt the Earth system to shift from self-cooling by means of buffering emissions to self-warming, thereby putting us on a path to a “hothouse Earth”. At 3C we reach a point where extreme floods and droughts will force people to leave their homes; more powerful hurricanes will destroy urban infrastructure.  In order to keep climate change in check, the Paris agreement committed countries to limit the increase of global mean temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, with the aim of reaching 1.5C. We are currently at about 1C. To explore the feasibility of this target, UN member states commissioned the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to produce a new 1.5C report. This report, seen by many as a concession to the grave threats low-lying island states face due to severe climate risks, has now gained more traction than previously anticipated, mainly because of mounting evidence that droughts, floods, heatwaves and storms strike earlier with higher frequency and severity than initially predicted. The latest science indicates that already at a range of global warming of 1-2C, humankind is at risk of triggering an irreversible loss of Arctic sea ice, losing all tropical coral reefs, and destabilising the Greenland ice sheet. The IPCC report not only assessed the climate risks but also the economic and technical challenges of stabilising global warming at 1.5C. The challenges are enormous. They include decarbonising all sectors of the global economy in their entirety by 2050, rapidly phasing out fossil fuels in the power sector and channelling large-scale investments into technologies that allow us to absorb carbon from the atmosphere. A key number in the new report regards the estimates of the remaining carbon budget, ie how much more greenhouse gas emissions can be allowed in order to have a chance of keeping global warming at 1.5C. The IPCC calculates a slightly higher remaining carbon budget compared with its previous calculations. These estimates are complex and depend on many assumptions, such as the trajectories of other greenhouse gases and cooling pollutants and the recalibration of the historical reference temperature on Earth before the industrial era. The slightly wider range of carbon budgets in this report compared with earlier reports – adding a few hundred gigatonnes of CO2, or three to seven years of emissions – is a reflection of the complexities involved. But rest assured, the conclusion is crystal-clear. However we twist and turn our data, at current rates of emissions the world has less than 10 years left to remain within the limits of a carbon budget to stand any chance of halting global warming at 1.5C. It would therefore be a mistake to construe the report as implying that credible climate action can be postponed even longer owing to a higher carbon budget. Countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam are still investing heavily in coal-fired plants. Even Germany, once touted as a leader in combating climate change, has invested in new coal-fired plants over the last decade. Japan, too, has decided to invest significantly in coal since the Fukushima nuclear event. The already existing and planned coal-fired plants would roughly emit 330 gigatonnes of CO2 over their economic lifetime, which always exceeds 15 years. They alone would exhaust almost the whole available carbon budget for the 1.5C scenario. Investment decisions have to be reversed now, otherwise the world economy will be locked in to a carbon-intensive pathway. To avert this, the right policies must be put in place immediately. The climate summit in Katowice, Poland, in December will conclude that the voluntary contributions of the governments are currently insufficient to put the world on a 2C, let alone 1.5C, trajectory. Policies to intensify efforts are necessary. All nations need to revise their mitigation targets to accommodate the more rapid emission reductions required to truly stay well below 2C. New global policies are needed. One such policy would be a carbon price starting around €30 per tonne of CO2, which would very likely render investments in coal-fired plants unprofitable. Zero-carbon mobility, such as electric cars, could then become an attractive option as consumers would expect an increasing carbon price, and the internal combustion engine would gradually be phased out. Admittedly, there is a significant gap between actual carbon prices and those required to achieve ambitious climate change mitigation. The gap can be closed, however, by enhancing the legitimacy and popularity of carbon pricing by using its revenues to fund research and development for zero-carbon solutions, cutting taxes or propping up the welfare state. These revenues could, moreover, be used in developing countries for low-carbon infrastructure investments. Carbon pricing would be a credible signal to investors that governments are willing to act now. Governments, policymakers and civil society should heed the warnings of the IPCC report and take action immediately. • Ottmar Edenhofer and Johan Rockström are the directors of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research."
"Stephen Lipp, who left New Orleans for Houston I grew up in New Orleans. When you’re brought up there you realize you’re below sea level: you see boats beyond the levee that are actually higher than you on the street. When Hurricane Katrina hit, we were prepared and realized we had to get out of Dodge. We headed to stay with family in Houston. I saw the pictures of the hurricane on and I thought: “Oh my gosh, everything I remember about this city has gone.” There was a TV shot of my neighborhood; instead of a boulevard, it was a bayou. I called the kids in and said: “I think we’ve lost everything. We’ve lost our lives there.” I decided to move on even before I saw my house. Going back to New Orleans just reaffirmed that. The whole city smelled of death, it was rotting. It was horribly depressing. The water was up to the eaves of our house and all we managed to salvage was half a briefcase of items. Everything else, my music, my books, my memorabilia, was gone. We moved to Houston. I managed to get a job in software development. We didn’t appear to be in harm’s way when Hurricane Harvey hit last year but I’ve never seen a flood of that magnitude before. Even as the water rose I thought: “This will peak soon.” But it rose, sat stable for a while, continued to rise and when it came into the house I thought: “This is crazy.” There was this intense feeling of denial, thinking about how this couldn’t happen again. There was a lot of shock and that night was hard – all the sewage was backing up, we had to stay on our beds to keep out of the water. We had friends nearby who got us out the next day in boats. There’s maybe one out of every five houses around here with a for sale sign because of the flooding now. I joke that towns should pay me to not move there in order to avoid being flooded. We will stay, though – I mean, the chances of being hit by a third storm are pretty slim. Things aren’t looking great for our planet but let’s face it, I’m not living on geologic time. Chantel Comardelle, relocating with entire community from the Louisiana coast Isle de Jean Charles is an island on the Louisiana coast that was settled by native American families who were pushed out of the city because they were native. It’s as far as you can go down the bayou, you don’t go there by accident. We have a very distinct culture. Our tribal family were fishermen, they lived off the land and traded with other communities. It was a close-knit community, everyone watched out for each other. We played stickball, did beadwork. I was born on the island but had to leave when I was four years old because a hurricane flooded our trailer and I became very sick. The doctor said I couldn’t go back because of the mold so we made the difficult decision to move to Houma. I noticed the changes when driving down to see family on the island. There used to be land on either side of the road and now it’s just open water. Everyone used to have gardens and now they don’t, the salt water kills everything. On the other side of the levee there was marsh but now it’s all water, it’s all going. A lot of younger people have moved away as you can’t put every house on 15ft stilts. You couldn’t get the school bus down the flooded road. [The tribe] made the decision to relocate and managed to get a grant from the federal government in 2016 to start that process. We looked through sites and we now have somewhere about 30 miles away – construction will begin be sometime at the end of next year for 150 lots. It’s very slow. It’s been frustrating and also scary because of the risk of hurricanes. The plan is to rebuild the community, make it what it was. There are still some people who are not ready to move, especially older people, and you have to be respectful of people’s wishes. My grandma is 92 and she’s never lived anywhere else but the island – for her to move to a new community is a big ask. We are called climate refugees, but I hate that term. “Refugee” suggests something with no clear plan or action but we have a clear plan and are doing this as a unified tribe. Most people believe we have to move because of climate change and also because the oil companies dug canals that allowed salt water to intrude further. It’s like we’ve hit the fast forward button on the environment. We will be the first ones to face this in the modern US but we won’t be the last. It’s important for us to get it right so other communities know that they can do it, too. Gaye Marie Thurmond, moved to safer ground in Houston I lived in the same house for 40 years with my late husband and children. They’ve grown up and gone now. We were flooded for three years in a row and Hurricane Harvey was absolutely the last straw. We were never in the flood plain before, never really flooded … and then, bingo. I think it’s because of the overdevelopment in Houston. We are near a gully and when the water backs up we flood because it’s flat here. I renovated and put the house up for sale after flooding in 2015, but when people heard it had been flooded they weren’t interested. We got 17 inches of water with Harvey. I think it gave me PTSD, my brain was in a fog. People are still suffering down here because of it. I stayed with a friend for eight months because I was flat-out homeless. Every room had to be gutted and replaced. I suffered a lot of loss, but others suffered much more. There was a [government-run] buyout program for flood-prone houses and I’d applied after the 2015 flood. Exactly one week before Harvey, I had the first monetary offer for my home. I didn’t have much time to think about it, we went back and forth, they said they’d pay for my moving costs and I thought: “I’m good, I’m done.” It was hard to walk away from a home where you raised your children and your husband had died. But I had to get somewhere away from the flood plain. I got somewhere in the north-west of the city, it doesn’t flood there. By the end I would’ve just accepted living in a tipi just to have my own place. I went back to the old house after they razed it. I bawled like a baby when I heard it had gone but I drove up to see it. It was beautiful. I had six pecan trees, a grapefruit tree – they had left them there next to the grass. It was like a pocket park. Anyone can enjoy that park now. Dan Kipnis, who is leaving Miami Beach I’m 68. My father bought a house in Miami Beach back in the day. Back then, it was pretty laid-back. Now, the development is crazy. I can’t believe they are still developing, they will still be building when they have water lapping at their feet. I’m now spending close to $20,000 a year on insurance because of the floods and the storms. The house is for sale because I want to get the value out of it before the shit hits the fan. I did list it for $3.2m, but it’s been on the market for two years and is now it’s down to $1.9m. I’m now spending close to $20,000 a year on insurance because of the floods and the storms I’m going to move to Palm Beach with my wife, rent an apartment and not give a shit if it floods because it’ll be a rental. I don’t care. I’ve been preaching about this problem for 15 years to try to wake people up. I want to get away from all the craziness, ripping up the streets to raise them, putting in new sewers, water pumps. The traffic is crazy. I am a boat captain and I first noticed something wasn’t right in about 1974. I saw that the barnacles were getting higher up the bridge pilings. Barnacles have to be in water all the time, and they were getting higher and higher, moving by inches. I used to catch snapper, groupers, Spanish mackerel, amberjacks. I had 11 people working for me. I don’t fish here any more because there’s so much algae in Biscayne Bay that it’s basically dead. The other boat captains know that the water covers the dock now and it didn’t before. But most of them voted for [Donald] Trump, they don’t care, they are very conservative people. It’s better to speak to the young people. It’s going to be much worse for them. We are really screwing them over. Laura Witham Spink, left Virginia Beach My husband was a navy officer at the base in Norfolk so we we moved to Virginia Beach, not too far away, in 1999. We have four children. In 2006 we moved to a bigger house in what was a very quiet neighborhood. By 2017 development was popping up everywhere, and I also noticed that there was flooding from heavy rains, just regular storms. Hurricane Matthew caused our home to be an island – the water came to the top of the car tires. After that the flooding became a nuisance and then a bit scary, we had to find a way around the water to find a way home. It flooded every time it rained. There were two roads into the neighborhood and when they were flooded we would park in the 7-Eleven and walk home. I kept rubber boots in the car. The city decided to put a four-lane road in front of where we lived and the flooding was only going to get worse, so we thought we should sell or we’d never get out of this place. It is a pretty place but has just been given over to developers. We made a loss on the house, sold it for $30,000 less than we paid for it. We never met the new buyer, no one ever asked about the flooding. They were from Virginia Beach so I’m surprised that they didn’t didn’t do their homework; I suppose they wanted a bigger house in a good school district. We waited for the last child to leave high school and we moved. We liked the character of Norfolk and it’s near my husband’s job. Norfolk floods too but they are proactive about it – we did our research. We have spent six months renovating so we are here for good. I’m not sure insurance will always be available if we went anywhere else on the coast."
"Two countries have halted their funding to the UN Environment programme following sharp criticism of its leader’s frequent flying in a draft internal audit. The audit also said Erik Solheim, a former Norwegian environment minister, had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and had claimed unjustified expenses. Now, Denmark and Sweden have frozen their funding until the audit is finalised.  Concern over Solheim’s activities is also growing in Nairobi, where the UN Environment programme (Unep) is based, with the UN staff union there calling some of the findings in the draft audit “mind blowing”. A prominent climate scientist has also criticised Solheim’s globetrotting as “obscene CO2 hypocrisy”. Solheim spent $488,518 (£371,100) in 22 months and was travelling 80% of the time, according to the audit. Solheim said he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and made changes where other rules had been broken. On the frozen funding, first reported by Norway’s Aftenposten newspaper, he said it was “completely natural” for countries to wait for a final audit before releasing funds. Denmark’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said it was withholding its 2018 contribution of about $1.6m to Unep. “The ministry is familiar with the criticism of Solheim’s travel activities,” an MFA spokeswoman told the Guardian. “We take this seriously. We are now awaiting the final audit report and its possible recommendations before we pay additional funds.” Sweden’s International Development Agency (Sida) said they would not approve any new funding until all the issues raised had been resolved. “Sida takes all signals of misuse of funds very seriously,” a spokeswoman said. Ole Jacob Sending, from the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs thinktank said he thought the freezing of funds was probably unprecedented. “There are many who don’t think Unep is functioning as it should, and that there are other means of promoting environmental issues that can be more effective,” Sending told Aftenposten. Some observers have praised Solheim for raising the profile of Unep. A Unep spokesman said: “We do not comment on the contributions of individual member states. However, UN Environment takes great pride in its reputation as both an environmental authority and trusted steward to our donors. As always, we remain in close consultation with every member state to ensure concerns are urgently addressed and resolved.” UN staff appear increasingly unhappy with Solheim’s leadership, claiming it is damaging Unep. A statement on Monday issued by Martin Njuhigu, president of the UN staff union in Nairobi, said: “The Union is deeply concerned ... Some items mentioned in the report are mind blowing. They require serious attention.” Prof Kevin Anderson, a climate scientist at the University of Manchester, UK, said deep and immediate cuts in global carbon emissions are needed to tackle climate change: “Despite this, there’s a cohort of climate glitterati for whom climate change is less a scientific and moral imperative, and more a vehicle for their own prosperity and prestige.” The draft audit, leaked to the Guardian, was compiled by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and said Solheim’s extensive travel was “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction” and was a “reputation risk to the organization”. It will be finalised after responses from the individuals named. Solheim said on Friday that he could not comment in detail on the audit until it was completed and published: “If any other mistakes are found, we will immediately correct them.” He said there was “excessive bureaucracy in the UN system” and that travelling was essential to his job: “Making good on our global agenda demands engagement with the world.” The Guardian can be contacted securely here or by email at damian.carrington@theguardian.com."
"The role of forests in combating climate change risks being overlooked by the world’s governments, according to a group of scientists that has warned halting deforestation is “just as urgent” as eliminating the use of fossil fuels. Razing the world’s forests would release more than 3 trillion tons of carbon dioxide, more than the amount locked in identified global reserves of oil, coal and gas. By protecting and restoring forests, the world would achieve 18% of the emissions mitigation needed by 2030 to avoid runaway climate change, the group of 40 scientists, spanning five countries, said in a statement.  “We must protect and maintain healthy forests to avoid dangerous climate change and to ensure the world’s forests continue to provide services critical for the well-being of the planet and ourselves,” the statement reads. The intervention comes as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gathers in South Korea ahead of Monday’s release of an eagerly awaited report on how the world can avoid warming of 1.5C (2.7F) beyond pre-industrial levels, an aspirational target of the landmark Paris climate deal in 2015. It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests. “In responding to the IPCC report, our message as scientists is simple: Our planet’s future climate is inextricably tied to the future of its forests,” the scientists’ statement pointedly concludes. Trees and other vegetation currently absorb around a quarter of the CO2 humans are adding to the atmosphere, softening the potential impact of climate change. While the world won’t lose all of its trees, large tracts of tropical forests, which hold a vast amount of carbon, are still being lost in the Amazon, central Africa and Indonesia. Warming temperatures are also fueling huge fires in forests in higher latitudes, as witnessed this summer when much of northern Sweden was aflame. “The forest piece of the conversation is often lost and I don’t think the IPCC report will highlight it enough,” said Deborah Lawrence, a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a signatory of the statement. “We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink. “Deforestation has been massively reduced in the Amazon, but that hasn’t happened elsewhere. As countries get more peaceful in Africa we could lose more tropical forests, which really worries me.” The IPCC’s report is expected to mention the need for as-yet unproven technology to burn vegetation and bury the resulting emissions underground or directly suck carbon from the air as a way to meet the 1.5C target. The statement by Lawrence and other scientists warns the former strategy, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (Beccs), is untested and risks wiping out huge areas of rainforest in order to make way for plantation timber for energy. “It breaks my heart to think we’d lose half our tropical forests for plantations just to save ourselves,” Lawrence said. “It’s horrifying that we’d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change. Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara.” Lawrence said a steep drop in emissions to zero by 2040 would negate the need for “negative emissions” technology that would damage forests’ ability to suck up carbon, maintain local water supplies and weather patterns and provide a home for a riot of birds, mammals, insects and other creatures. “We will have a hotter, drier world without these forests,” Lawrence said. “There needs to be an international price on carbon to fund the protection of forests. And countries with tropical forests should maintain large chunks of forests to stabilize rainfall for agriculture and keep a predictable regional climate.” The prospects for averting at least 1.5C of warming appear dim, however, with a co-author of the upcoming IPCC report warning last week the world is “nowhere near on track” to meet its Paris commitments."
"New official data shows clearing of forests near and along the Great Barrier Reef continued despite Australian government pledges to protect the natural wonder, with at least 152,000 hectares felled in 2016-17 alone. Forests covering 770,000ha – an area about three times the size of the Australian Capital Territory – in the reef catchment zone have been bulldozed over the past five years. The area cleared last year was larger in size than that covered by new re-growth.  Jessica Panegyres, a nature campaigner with the Wilderness Society, said it showed Australia should be considered a global deforestation hotspot on a par with the Amazon and Indonesia. “The federal government has promised the world it is doing everything it can to protect the reef,” she said. “[It] has simply refused to act on deforestation, despite the major impacts on forests, wildlife, the reef and the climate.” The figures are included in the latest national greenhouse gas emissions accounts, which the government quietly released on Friday afternoon in the shadow of the AFL and NRL grand finals. They showed Australia’s emissions increased 1.3% in the year to March 2018, continuing a trend at odds with the government’s repeated claim it is on track to meet the target it set at the 2015 Paris climate conference. Deforestation increases nutrient and sediment run-off on to the reef coast, hurting water quality, stimulating algae growth and at times smothering corals. The government has spent billions addressing poor water quality, considered second only to climate change as a threat to the reef. The land-clearing data for 2016-17 is described as a projection and does not include part of the Fitzroy river region. It was released as the government postponed a decision on whether to allow a farmer to clear nearly 2,000ha of forest at Kingvale station on Cape York. The federal environment minister, Melissa Price, is considering an environment department recommendation that the clearing, approved at state level in 2013 under the former premier Campbell Newman, be allowed despite the presence of endangered species. Scientific advice to the government suggests allowing the Kingvale clearing would likely increase sediment run-off on to the reef. A decision is now due by the end of October. Land-clearing spiked in Queensland after the former Liberal National government relaxed laws preventing mass deforestation. The Palaszczuk Labor government passed new land-clearing laws to restore earlier protections in May, prompting protests from farmers who said they needed to manage vegetation to produce the food and fibre expected by consumers. Legacy clearing permits remain for about 115,000ha. Panegyres said Price could block outstanding permits using national environmental laws that empower the minister to intervene if threatened species were at risk or an activity was likely to have a significant impact on the reef. Price said state and territory governments were primarily responsible for regulating land-clearing. She said the government’s Reef 2050 plan, submitted to Unesco, was focused on improving the reef’s resilience to climate change by reducing local pressures. “We know climate change is a big issue for the reef and this is why we have invested over $400m to help protect the reef through the Great Barrier Reef Foundation,” she said. The minister said the emissions reduction fund, the central plank of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action climate policy, had incentivised a reduction in land-clearing. About $2.3bn of the $2.55bn taxpayer fund has been spent or committed. No new money has been allocated since 2014. More than $1bn from the fund had been used to pay for tree-planting and habitat restoration. Analysis of government data earlier this year found those emissions savings would effectively be wiped out by little more than two years of deforestation elsewhere in the country."
"After her house flooded for the third year in a row, Elizabeth Boineau was ready to flee. She packed her possessions into dozens of boxes, tried not to think of the mold and mildew-covered furniture and retreated to a second-floor condo that should be beyond the reach of pounding rains and swelling seas. Boineau is leaving behind a handsome, early 20th-century house in Charleston, South Carolina, the shutters painted in the city’s eponymous shade of deep green. Last year, after Hurricane Irma introduced 8in of water into a home Boineau was still patching up from the last flood, local authorities agreed this historic slice of Charleston could be torn down. “I was sloshing through the water with my puppy dog, debris was everywhere,” she said. “I feel completely sunken. It would cost me around $500,000 to raise the house, demolish the first floor. I’m going to rent a place instead, on higher ground.” Millions of Americans will confront similarly hard choices as climate change conjures up brutal storms, flooding rains, receding coastlines and punishing heat. Many are already opting to shift to less perilous areas of the same city, or to havens in other states. Whole towns from Alaska to Louisiana are looking to relocate, in their entirety, to safer ground. The era of climate migration is, virtually unheralded, already upon America. The population shift gathering pace is so sprawling that it may rival anything in US history. “Including all climate impacts it isn’t too far-fetched to imagine something twice as large as the Dustbowl,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard University, referencing the 1930s upheaval in which 2.5 million people moved from the dusty, drought-ridden plains to California. This enormous migration will probably take place over a longer period than the Dustbowl but its implications are both profound and opaque. It will plunge the US into an utterly alien reality. “It is very difficult to model human behaviour under such extreme and historically unprecedented circumstances,” Keenan admits. The closest analogue could be the Great Migration – a period spanning a large chunk of the 20th century when about 6 million black people departed the Jim Crow south for cities in the north, midwest and west. By the end of this century, sea level rise alone could displace 13 million people, according to one study, including 6 million in Florida. States including Louisiana, California, New York and New Jersey will also have to grapple with hordes of residents seeking dry ground. “There’s not a state unaffected by this,” said demographer Mat Hauer, lead author of the research, which is predicated on a severe 6ft sea level increase. There are established migration preferences for some places – south Florida to Georgia, New York to Colorado – but in many cases people would uproot to the closest inland city, if they have the means. “The Great Migration was out of the south into the industrialized north, whereas this is from every coastal place in the US to every other place in the US,” said Hauer. “Not everyone can afford to move, so we could end up with trapped populations that would be in a downward spiral. I have a hard time imagining what that future would be like.” Within just a few decades, hundreds of thousands of homes on US coasts will be chronically flooded. By the end of the century, 6ft of sea level rise would redraw the coastline with familiar parts – such as southern Florida, chunks of North Carolina and Virginia, much of Boston, all but a sliver of New Orleans – missing. Warming temperatures will fuel monstrous hurricanes – like the devastating triumvirate of Irma, Maria and Harvey in 2017, followed by Florence this year – that will scatter survivors in jarring, uncertain ways. The projections are starting to materialize in parts of the US, forming the contours of the climate migration to come. “I don’t see the slightest evidence that anyone is seriously thinking about what to do with the future climate refugee stream,” said Orrin Pilkey, professor emeritus of coastal geology at Duke University. “It boggles the mind to see crowds of climate refugees arriving in town and looking for work and food.” Pilkey’s new book – Sea Level Rise Along Americas Shores: The Slow Tsunami – envisions apocalyptic scenes where millions of people, largely from south Florida, will become “a stream of refugees moving to higher ground”. “They will not be the bedraggled families carrying their few possessions on their backs as we have seen in countless photos of people fleeing wars and ethnic cleansing, most recently in Myanmar and Syria,” Pilkey states in his book. “Instead, they will be well-off Americans driving to a new life in their cars, with moving trucks behind, carrying a lifetime of memories and possessions.” Dejected with frigid New York winters, Chase Twichell and her husband purchased a four-bedroom apartment in Miami Beach in 2011, with the plan of spending at least a decade basking in the sunshine. At first, keeping a pair of flip-flops on hand to deal with the flooded streets seemed an acceptable quirk, until the magnitude of the encroaching seas became apparent when the city spent $400m to elevate streets near Twichell’s abode. Twichell began to notice water pumps were spewing plastic bags, condoms and chip packets into the bay. Friends’ balconies started getting submerged. Twichell, a poet, found apocalyptic themes creeping into her work. Last year, she sold the apartment to a French businessman and moved back to upstate New York. “It was like end of the world stuff,” she said. “It was crazy for us to have such a big investment in such a dangerous situation.” Her neighbours initially scolded her but now several are also selling up, fretting that the real estate and insurance markets for properties like theirs will seize up. “It was horrible but fascinating to see it,” Twichell said. “It’s like we got to see the future and it wasn’t pretty. It’s like a movie where there’s a terrible volcano that is destroying everything, only it’s much slower than that.” A sense of fatalism is also starting to grip some local officials. Philip Stoddard, mayor of South Miami, has seen a colleague, spooked by sea level rise, move to California and some neighbours sell their houses before an expected slump in prices. Stoddard and his wife regularly discuss buying a fallback property, perhaps in Washington DC. “Most people will wait for the problem to be bad to take action, that’s what I worry about,” he said. “We can buy a lot of time, but in the end we lose. The sea level will go over the tops of our buildings.” Sanitation is an immediate preoccupation for Stoddard, given the large proportion of residents who aren’t served by sewage works. “If you’re using a septic tank and your toilet starts to overflow into your bathroom because of water inundation, that’s a basis-of-civilization problem,” he said. “A medieval city wasn’t a nice smelling place and they had a lot of diseases.” Those living near the coasts will face pressures of the gradual (sea level rise) as well as dramatic (storms) nature but people inland will also be harried to move by climate change. Farming techniques and technology have improved immeasurably since the Dustbowl but rising temperatures are still expected to diminish yields for crops such as maize, soybeans and wheat, prompting the departure of younger people from farming. By 2050, Texas county, the largest wheat-producing county in Oklahoma, could spend an extra 40 days a year above 90F (32C) compared with now. A study published last year found that the economies of the southern states, along with parts of the west, will suffer disproportionately as temperatures rise. In what researchers called potentially one of the largest transfers of wealth in US history, the poorest third of counties are expected to lose up to 20% of their income unless greenhouse gas emissions are severely curtailed. Wealth, and potentially people, are expected to shift north and west. Meanwhile, cities already struggling with heat will see wealthy residents head for cooler climes. Last year, 155 people died in Phoenix due to a particularly fierce summer. Increasing heat will start testing the durability of the populace, even those shielded by air conditioning. In the western states, wildfires are getting larger, razing homes in ever more spectacular ways and choking thousands of people with carcinogenic smoke. Further to the south, at the border, there are suggestions that people from Central America are being nudged towards the US because of drought and hurricanes in their homelands, part of a trend that will see as many as 300 million climate refugees worldwide by 2050. “People will get very grumpy and upset with very hot temperatures,” said Amir Jina, an environmental economist at the University of Chicago who co-authored the research on economic losses. “Even if you have air conditioning, some areas start to look less habitable. By the middle of the century parts of the south-west and south-east won’t look attractive to live in. “That insidious climate migration is the one we should worry about. The big disasters such as hurricanes will be obvious. It’s the pressures we don’t know or understand that will reshape population in the 21st century.” Prodded to name refuges in the US, researchers will point to Washington and Oregon in the Pacific north-west, where temperatures will remain bearable and disasters unlikely to strike. Areas close to the Great Lakes and in New England are also expected to prove increasingly attractive to those looking to move. By 2065, southern states are expected to lose 8% of their US population share, while the north-east will increase by 9%. A recent study forecast that the population in the western half of the US will increase by more than 10% over the next 50 years due to climate migration, largely from the south and midwest. But these population shifts are uncertain and are bound by a tangle of other factors and caveats. People will still largely follow paths guided by nearby family or suitable jobs. Even those who do want to move may find favoured locations too expensive. Some will just grimly hang on. “With property rights as strong as they are in the US, some people may choose to go down with the ship,” said Harvard’s Keenan. “The question is whether they have the means and the options to do anything else.” “People can usually cope with being a little less comfortable, but if you see repeated storms or severe damage to crops, that will trigger change,” said Solomon Hsiang, who researches how climate change will affect society at the University of California. “There will be pressure to move a little north. It won’t be everyone, though, it won’t be like the great migration of wildebeest in Africa. Whole cities picking up and moving would be hugely expensive.” Smaller towns are giving relocation a go, however. In 2016, the community of Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana was the first place to be given federal money to replant itself. The population, situated on an island being eaten away by the sea, is looking to move to a former sugar cane farm 30 miles inland. “We are called climate refugees but I hate that term,” said Chantal Comardelle, who grew up in the Isle de Jean Charles community. “We will be the first ones to face this in the modern US but we won’t be the last. It’s important for us to get it right so other communities know that they can do it, too.” About a dozen coastal towns in Alaska are also looking to relocate, as diminishing sea ice exposes them to storms and rising temperatures thaw the very ground beneath them. One, Newtok, has identified a new site and has some federal funding to begin uprooting itself. A buyout of damaged and at-risk homes has already occurred in New York City’s Staten Island in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, while certain flood-prone houses in Houston, pummeled by Hurricane Harvey last year, are also being purchased and razed. But the cost of doing this for all at-risk Americans would be eye-watering. Estimates range from $200,000 to $1m per person to undertake a relocation. If 13 million people do have to move, it seems fantastical to imagine $13tn, or even a significant fraction of this amount, being spent by governments to ease the way. “As a country we aren’t set up to deal with slow-moving disasters like this, so people around the country are on their own,” said Joel Clement, a former Department of the Interior official who worked on the relocation of Alaskan towns. “In the Arctic I’m concerned we’ve left it too late. Younger people have left because they know the places are doomed. These towns won’t be relocated within five years and I’m sure there will be a catastrophic storm up there. My hope is no lives will be lost.” Ultimately, the US will have to choose what it wants to defend and hope its ingenuity outstrips the environmental changes ranged against it. Not everyone will be able to shelter behind fortifications like the ‘big U’ planned to defend lower Manhattan. Wrenching decisions will have to be made as to what and where will be sacrificed. “We won’t see whole areas abandoned but neighborhoods will get sparse and wild looking, the tax base will start to crumble,” said Stoddard, mayor of South Miami. “We don’t have the laws to deal with that sort of piecemeal retreat. It’s magical thinking to think someone else will buy out your property. “We need a plan as to what will be defended because at the moment the approach is that some kid in a garage will come with a solution. There isn’t going to be a mop and bucket big enough for this problem.”"
"Late on Friday, under the cover of the release of the first interim report from the Hayne royal commission into the financial sector and the day before a weekend of AFL and NRL grand finals, the government released the latest quarterly data showing greenhouse gas emissions had once again risen. You can call this government many things – a bunch of dolts deluded into believing climate change is a global conspiracy, a bunch of feckless cowards lacking the intellectual ability or political acumen to stand up to those climate change-denying fools occupying positions on the backbench and in cabinet – but you can’t call them subtle. Ever since they have taken office from the ALP, this government has sought to release the quarterly greenhouse gas emissions data at times when it will most likely be lost in the news cycle. The usual favourite is the week before Christmas. The previous batch of data was released late on Friday of budget week. That it is now more than four months since that last “quarterly” release serves to highlight how planned this past Friday’s release was. The reason they choose to release the data at times when it is unlikely to get much attention is because the emissions data is continually awful and would be utterly shameful, were this government possessed of the ability to feel that emotion in relation to climate change. In the past 12 months the annual level of emissions reached a record level of 559m tonnes CO2-e if we exclude the controversial component of “land use, land use change and forestry” (LULUCF), which includes a measure for the amount of forest and grasslands and the amounts of those cut down or converted to other uses. Rather disgracefully Australia is allowed to count that use towards its Paris agreement to reduce emissions by 26% below 2005 levels. The reason this is disgraceful is because it means we are able to take into account the high amount of forest clearing that was occurring at the time, and to bank improvements merely due to us being less bad now than we were, not because we have actually improved our emissions. We did the same thing for our Kyoto commitment, which had 1990 as the base year – a year in which we had a massive amount of land clearing: But even if we include the LULUCF measure, our annual emissions rose in the past 12 months by 0.9% – and they are now at their highest level since 2011. It is a terrible result, but one that is not surprising given our emissions have been increasing every quarter since the end of the carbon price period in June 2014: The good news is electricity emissions have been falling recently, the bad news is so too has our level of renewable energy production. The only reason emissions in the national energy market have fallen is because of the drop in brown coal production: And the problem is while emissions from electricity have fallen since June 2016, in that time emissions from all other areas have increased by more than that amount: It’s the problem with focusing only on electricity emissions – they either need to come down by overly large amounts in order to meet our overall target, or we are not going to be able achieve it. The prime minster, when asked about the figures on ABC’s Insiders program parroted the inane media release that accompanied the data. Rather than focus on the overall increase in emission, the prime minister boasted that: “We’ve got emissions per capita at the lowest level in 28 years.” Whoop dee fricken doo. Is anyone shocked to discover that cars and equipment made now are more fuel-efficient than those made in 1990? Out of the past 28 years, only seven times have emissions per capita not declined. Not only is it a worthless boast, it says nothing about the impact on the environment. The atmosphere doesn’t react on a per capita basis, it reacts to the total level of CO2 emissions. Boasting about emissions per capita falling while total emissions are rising is like a general arguing that it doesn’t matter that the number of innocent civilians killed in bombing raids has increased in the past year because the average number killed per raid has fallen. At a political level it also doesn’t matter because our Paris commitment to reduce emissions to 26% below 2005 levels is total emissions, not per capita. But here again we find the prime minister in the land of obfuscation and outright fertiliser production. When Barrie Cassidy asked Morrison on Insiders if he still believed we would meet our 26% reduction target “in a canter” he replied that “people choose and pick their figures to make their political arguments. We’re going to meet those in a canter our 26% target … All of the issues are pointing to that outcome so I’m comfortable with our 26%.” So let us pause now as I choose to show the government’s own figures, which reveal not only that we are not going to make the 26% target in a canter, but instead by 2030 our emissions will be about 29% above the level they need to be: If the prime minister has some data in his back pocket that leads him to believe that “based on our assessments” Australia will meet its targets, maybe he could give those assessments to the Department of Environment and Energy so they can then publish them for all of us to see. Though, of course, given how the government hides its emissions data, they’ll probably publish it at a time for maximum exposure – say Christmas Eve at 4.50pm.  • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise, but Scott Morrison seized on the silver lining, maintaining Australia would meet its Paris commitment, despite the government having no legislated instrument to help it get there. Figures released on Friday  showed Australia’s emissions increased 1.3% in the year to March 2018, up all sectors – except land use and electricity, where renewable technologies were having an impact on the latter.  The prime minister jumped on the rate of the increase not being as high as in previous years. “The emissions are at the lowest level in 28 years, and those figures, in particular for the March quarter, were based on some rather stronger LNG production figures for that period,” he told the ABC Insiders program. “So look, one swallow doesn’t make a summer, and I know that plenty of people will leap on that and say ‘you need to do X and Y’ and use those numbers for that purpose, but it means that we’re going to meet Kyoto 2 and we’ll smash that number. “We smashed Kyoto 1.” Morrison said Australia would meet its Paris targets “in a canter”, largely based on investment in renewable energy technologies, despite concerns a lack of legislated instrument may impact investor confidence in the sector. “The investments that are continuing to be made in renewables, on the basis of the fact, that, increasingly, we’ve hit the threshold point, where the investments make sense, increasingly, without subsidies,” he said. “We still have large-scale and small-scale policies there. We still have the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and we still have the Emissions Reduction Fund for the period that it’s currently for, and we’re on track to hit it ... “I know people will want to use that one figure [1.3%] and ignore the fact that emissions per capita [are] at the lowest level in 28 years. Electricity sector emissions are down 13.9%, I think it is, on 2009, on the same figures. “So people choose and pick their figures to make their political arguments. We’re going to meet those in a canter.” Critics of the government’s stance have repeatedly called for legislation to ensure Australia meets the targets it agreed to when Tony Abbott signed the nation up to the Paris agreement. But with the national energy guarantee a casualty of the leadership spill within the Liberal party, the government has no legislated instrument to ensure emission reductions, and no plans to create one. Morrison said he did not believe that would impact Australia’s progress, citing government policy as being enough, despite repeated calls from interest groups, including the business lobby, to give certainty. “We’ll meet up in 2030 and we can argue the toss then,” he said, citing the deadline when Australia is due to meet its target of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels. “None of us are Nostradamus in this but we have the policies in place and importantly, the technology, the demand management. All of the issues are pointing to that outcome so I’m comfortable with our 26%. I was comfortable with it when we set it, when I was part of the government that set it. And we’ll continue to pursue it.” He said lowering electricity prices remained the government’s priority and criticised Labor for its policy. “Labor has a 45% emissions reduction target – we all know what that will do,” he said. “It will put up electricity prices ... for every household in the country. Labor has that. We have a sensible target of 26%. We’ll stick to that and it won’t have an impact on electricity prices and we’ll continue our track record of delivering emissions reductions.” Labor has said it will look to legislate a version of the national energy guarantee the government abandoned as policy to ensure Australia does meet its targets. The Greens announced its parliamentary team will take a “hard line” on making sure any future Labor government does not back down. Research released earlier this month found that emission reductions targets were not responsible for driving up power prices."
"Better scientific understanding of global warming makes the discussion about its geopolitical consequences increasingly urgent. Put simply, there are going to be winners and losers: hotter places and colder places; wetter places and drier places; and, yes, places that disappear under the sea. But the reality is a bit more complicated. In particular, are sea levels going up or down? The answer seems clear when you consider that Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tonnes of ice in the last 25 years.  Yet to understand what is going on we first have to recognise that the Earth isn’t solid. It started life as a ball of hot liquid about 4.5bn years ago and our planet has been cooling ever since. Right at the centre of the Earth is a solid core of metal made of iron and nickel at a temperature of approximately 5,000C. But this core is surrounded by an approximately 2,000km-thick ocean of molten metal, again mostly iron and nickel. Surrounding this is a layer of rock called the mantle that is between 500C to 900C, and at these red-hot temperatures the rock behaves like a solid over short periods of time (seconds, hours, and days) but like a liquid over longer time periods (months to years) – so the rock flows, even though it is not molten. On top of the fluid mantle floats the crust, which is like the skin of the Earth. It is a relatively thin layer of cool rock that is between 30 to 100km thick and contains all the mountains, forests, rivers, seas, continents – our world. Since the crust is floating on the fluid mantle, if you increase its weight by, for instance, building up kilometres of ice on top of it, then it sinks further into the mantle. This is what has happened to the landmasses of Antarctica and Greenland, which are both covered in 2km to 3km of thick ice. If global warming were to cause all that ice to melt, then the sea level of the oceans would rise by more than 50 metres, submerging all the coastal cities of the world and making hundreds of millions of people homeless. This seems obvious. What is less obvious is how it might unfold. If the whole ice sheet covering Antarctica melts, the release of its weight will destress the rocks below, which, because they float on the mantle, will bob up. This is called post-glacial rebound. The position with Greenland is similar: the crust below it is being weighed down by the 3 million trillion litres of water held in the ice sheet, and if that ice sheet all melts then parts of the North American tectonic landmass will rise up. If the resulting increase in the height of the continent is bigger than the sea level rise, then major flooding may be avoided. Working out which scenario is more likely is vitally important for future generations, because one of these results will start to play out if global warming intensifies. What we know is this: the global mean sea level has risen 20cm since the beginning of the 20th century. Some of this has been owing to the water thermally expanding as the oceans have got hotter – since hotter liquids take up more volume (this is how liquid thermometers work). Some of the rise in sea level has been due to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melting, and some due to other glaciers melting. The rising sea levels are global: they affect everyone with a coastline, from tiny Pacific islands that would be entirely submerged to a huge country such as Bangladesh, for which a one-metre rise in sea levels would result in nearly a fifth of the country being submerged and 30 million people being displaced. But while rising sea levels affect everyone, the post-glacial rebound affects only the coasts connected to parts of the Earth’s crust weighed down by the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. It is hard to overestimate the importance of this issue, and we badly need more data and scientific understanding of these liquid processes. A limited number of specialised satellites, such as CryoSat, GRACE and ICESat-2 – just launched by Nasa – are being used to monitor ice thickness and to develop models of post-glacial rebound. What the science predicts is that if the ice melts first in the northern hemisphere, then Greenland may bounce up higher than the average sea level, as will parts of North America, and so sea levels there may initially go down. If the opposite happens, and the Antarctic ice melts before the Greenland ice sheet, then it is the southern tectonic plates that will bounce up first and the whole of North America’s eastern coast will go under water first. The big unknowns are how quick the ice will go in each location, and how fast the post-glacial rebound will be. We need to get a better understanding of these processes fast, because if we don’t it may be too late to avert catastrophe. These issues don’t dominate news agendas but they should. Recently the French environment minister resigned, citing the president’s lack of progress and urgency on climate change issues. In doing so, he voiced the concern of the whole scientific community about world leaders – we need a step change in governmental action. But there’s the rub: not all governments feel urgent about it. And why? Perhaps it’s because, as the issue of post-glacial rebound shows, there will be winners and losers from global warming. For instance, countries such as Russia will be less affected by sea level rises, and may benefit from a more temperate climate. In contrast, the US may not only suffer from new drought zones, but its low-lying eastern coast is threatened by the accelerating loss of Antarctic ice. As the 21st century continues and the ice continues to melt, it will become clearer which countries have a greater incentive to mitigate climate change, and the resulting geopolitics has the potential to drive division and conflict. • Mark Miodownik is the author of Liquid: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flow Through Our Lives, which is short-listed for the Royal Society Book prize"
"We’re currently on pace to double the carbon dioxide-equivalent (including other greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere by around mid-century.  Since the late 1800s scientists have been trying to answer the question, how much global warming will that cause? In 1979, top climate scientists led by Jule Charney published a report estimating that if we double the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm to 560 ppm, temperatures will warm by 3 ± 1.5°C.  Four decades later, ‘climate sensitivity’ estimates remain virtually unchanged, but some climate contrarians have argued that the number is at the low end of that range, around 2°C or less.  It’s an important question because if the contrarians are right, the 2°C resulting global warming would represent significantly less severe climate change consequences than if mainstream climate scientists are right and temperatures rise by 3°C.  It would also mean our remaining carbon budget for meeting the 2°C Paris target is about twice as large than if the mainstream consensus is right.  If the consensus is correct, we’re on pace to blow through the remaining Paris carbon budget by around 2030. Studies published in March 2014, May 2014, and December 2015 identified two critical flaws in the contrarians’ preferred so-called ‘energy balance model’ approach: it doesn’t account for the fact that Earth’s sensitivity can change over time, for example as large ice sheets continue to melt, or that the planet responds differently to different climate ‘forcings’. Last week, the journal Earth’s Future published a study by the University of Southampton’s Philip Goodwin that took both of these factors into account.  Goodwin ran climate model simulations treating every forcing separately, including changes in greenhouse gases, solar activity, particulates from volcanic eruptions, and from human fossil fuel combustion.  For each, he included feedbacks from changes in factors like atmospheric water vapor, clouds, snow, and sea ice, including how these factors change over different timescales, as Goodwin explained: I ran 10 million simulations with a relatively simple climate model. These 10 million simulations each used different climate feedback strengths, and so the way that climate sensitivity responded over time was different in each simulation.  To check which of the 10 million simulations were most realistic, I checked each simulation against observations of warming in the atmosphere and ocean up to the present day. I kept only the simulations that agreed with the observations for the real world.  This left 4600 simulations, where the values of the climate sensitivity (and changes in climate sensitivity over different timescales) agree with the atmosphere and ocean warming observed so far. It is from these final 4600 simulations that evaluate how the climate sensitivity evolves over time. Essentially, adding up all of the warming contributions from all of these factors at any given time tells us how sensitive the climate is on that timescale, whether it be a month, a year, a decade, or a century after atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have doubled.   Over the shortest timeframes of a year or less, Goodwin found that temperatures will rise by about 2°C once carbon dioxide levels have doubled, consistent with the conclusions of the contrarian studies.  That makes sense because those studies applied current climate measurements into energy balance models, but since carbon pollution is still rising, the climate still has a large energy imbalance.  Climate sensitivity, on the other hand, is usually evaluated at the point when the Earth reaches a new energy equilibrium, long after carbon dioxide levels have stopped rising. Once our carbon pollution levels decline close to zero (hopefully by mid-to-late century), the planet will start to reach that new equilibrium.  The slower feedbacks like melting ice will continue to kick in, and Goodwin found that on timescales close to a century thereafter, temperatures will rise by 1.9–4.6°C, most likely 2.9°C, consistent with mainstream climate science estimates since the 1979 Charney report. In other words, we are indeed on track to burn through the remaining Paris carbon budget by 2030, and under current international climate policies, we’re most likely headed for about 3.4°C warming by 2100.   Climate contrarians want to gamble on the long shot that the climate sensitivity is on the low end of the possible range, which would give us a few extra decades before we burn past the Paris target.  But even that relatively rosy scenario would require more aggressive international climate policies than are in place today.  We still have to change course even to limit ourselves to a doubling of carbon dioxide-equivalent in the atmosphere. And the body of scientific research keeps refuting the contrarian case.  If anything, recent research suggests the climate sensitivity is toward the high end of the possible range, but Goodwin’s study finds that it’s most likely right where climate scientists have expected for decades. As Goodwin concluded, some of the lowest estimates of climate sensitivity from before do not appear to hold on the long timescales"
