"Barack Obama has signed up for eight interviews with TV meteorologists on Tuesday to defend a landmark report against those who deny climate change. The interviews were scheduled as part of a carefully co-ordinated rollout of the National Climate Assessment.  The exhaustively detailed account of the impact of climate change on America will be formally launched at the White House on Tuesday. White House adviser John Podesta told reporters the report was unequivocal: there would be no region and no economic sector that would remain untouched by climate change. “If you want to try to side with the polluters and argue to the American public that climate change is not happening – today, tomorrow, and certainly in the future – that's going to be a losing argument,” he said. He described the findings as “actionable science”. Obama will use the report to build public support for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, the core pillar of his climate plan. Podesta confirmed that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would be proposing new rules for power plants in early June. The success of the EPA plan – and another energy efficiency measure to be announced later in the week – hinges in part on Obama's ability to persuade the American public of the urgency of acting on climate change. TV weather forecasters remain among the most trusted sources, according to opinion polls. Some 89% of Americans rely on local television for their weather news, according to a 2012 report from the Pew research centre. The same report said 62% of Americans trust television weather reporters on climate change far more than they do climate scientists. The problem is, however, that there is a strong current of climate scepticism among weather forecasters. Some of the most prominent television meteorologists deny a human cause in climate change – or insist there is no evidence of climate change. A 2010 study by George Mason University's centre for climate change communications found that only 19% of TV weather forecasters accepted that human activity was the main driver of climate change. “Many TV meteorologists remain climate change sceptics, in part because they are skilled at forecasting weather over short time periods, which can make them doubt long-range projections from climate science computer models,” wrote Andrew Freedman, who covers climate change for Mashable. ""Many TV meteorologists also lack specific training in climate science."" Bill Clinton and Al Gore were blindsided by that strong strain of climate scepticism when they adopted a similar strategy in the 1990s, Freedman writes. Meanwhile, the campaign group Forecast the Facts complained that broadcast meteorologists do not do enough to explain how climate change is contributing to heatwaves, drought, and other extreme weather events.  ""I don't talk about [global warming] on television … because I don't see it as part of my short-term forecast,” the group quoted Tampa weatherman Steve Jerve as saying. “I don't think it's good for a scientist to talk about an opinion."" The meteorologists interviewing Obama on Tuesday include: Al Roker, co-anchor of NBC's Today Show; Ginger Zee, meteorologist on ABC's Good Morning America; John Morales, chief meteorologist of NBC 6 in Miami, Florida, and Jim Gandy, meteorologist of WLTX-TV in Columbia, South Carolina.

"Tucked away beneath the rolling Sussex countryside, crate upon crate of bloated, brown paper bags are piled high. Fastened with a clerical bulldog clip and neatly labelled, the unassuming exteriors belie their import. For within these bland wrappers are crucial tools for safeguarding our food security in the face of climate change, pests, population growth and disease: seeds. But these are no run-of-the-mill offerings - they are wild, undomesticated relatives of 29 of our most crucial global crops, such as wheat, barley and maize. And they are about to be processed and stored within the sub-zero vaults of Kew's millennium seed bank.  ""Crop wild relatives are one of the solutions for future security as they provide the genetic material which can build resilience in our crop plants, making them more resistant to disease and better adapted to climate change,"" says Jonas Mueller, international co-ordinator of the Millennium Seed Bank Partnership, located at Kew's Wakehurst site. Collecting and preserving such seeds, he explains, is crucial because the modern cultivated crops we rely on have a very limited genetic diversity as a result of intensive breeding. ""We call that domestication bottleneck,"" says Mueller. The danger is that low genetic diversity in our crops has rendered our food supply vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions, onslaughts of pests and outbreaks of disease. ""History can teach us the lesson with the Irish potato famine,"" says Mueller. ""They only had a few varieties and then with the blight there were disastrous consequences. Had they cultivated a multitude of potato varieties they might not have come into such problems as there would have been a greater chance of one having a resistance to the disease."" Such disasters are not just consigned to the past - plantations of one of our most familiar fruits are now in danger of being decimated. ""The domesticated banana is just one variety, the 'Cavendish', and it is under threat from a new strain of Panama disease, a Fusarium wilt,"" says Jonathan Jones , senior research scientist at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich. Such risks are profound. A 2010 report co-produced by Kew estimates that 80% of our calories come from just 12 species of domesticated plant, while a study published in March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) suggests that although the range of crops contributing to each country's food supply has increased over the last 50 years, the bill of fare in each country is becoming more similar. In other words, the global food supply is becoming more homogenous. As a result, seed banks are safeguarding our ability to feed the world. But the clock is ticking. ""It's a race against time,"" says Mueller. ""Our research shows that 50% of all our target species are not properly collected and preserved in the seed banks, therefore [they] are potentially threatened."" Launched in January 2011 and funded by the Norwegian government, the crop wild relatives project, entitled Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change, is a joint venture between the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Global Crop Diversity Trust. By providing partners, working on every continent (bar Antarctica), with a species list and collection guide, the hope is to gather around 20,000 seeds of each species. ""In total we are talking about 450 species in 30 countries over the next four years,"" Mueller says. But the project goes far beyond simply hoarding genetic diversity. Once the seeds have arrived at the bank, researchers carry out a variety of germination tests to explore the conditions under which the seeds will sprout, as well as checking their viability and vigour. They also ensure there is a pressed specimen of the plant in flower to record exactly what each paper bag holds. They then send out seed samples to researchers around the world who carry out further research to characterise the specific traits shown by the wild relatives, and set up breeding programmes to cultivate new crop varieties. But that all takes time. ""The whole process of incorporating traits from a wild relative and developing a new variety can take 10 to 15 years or even longer,"" says Mueller. There are, however, alternative ways to introduce desired genes from Kew's cache. ""You can either try to breed [a trait] in from a wild relative and that takes many, many years, at the end of which you may have linked to your gene a bad [version] of some other gene,"" explains Jones, ""or you can try to clone the gene you'd like with the useful property and move it from the species where you found it to the species where you would like it."" Using such GM techniques, Jones and his team have recently reported success in producing potatoes resistant to late blight by introducing a gene cloned from a wild relative held in a Dutch gene bank. However, European Union regulations mean that the potatoes are unlikely to reach our supermarkets any time soon. Jones believes it's time the EU moved beyond a cautionary approach to GM. ""That's what's clearly needed now to take advantage of all these opportunities we have to solve disease and other problems,"" he says. While seed banks offer one approach to global food security, the PNAS study also touches on the benefits of introducing lesser-known plants into our diet. It's an approach organisations such as Crops for the Future (CFF), a body supported by the University of Nottingham and Biodiversity International, champion. ""The major crops are good crops - if they weren't they wouldn't be there,"" explains Sean Mayes, associate professor in Crop Genetics at the University of Nottingham. ""[But] they are potentially not the only good crops."" Looking at plants from around the world, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations together with the International Network of Food Data Systems, has already drawn up a list of more than 900 species it considers to be neglected or underused, although they may be popular in local regions. Bagging a spot on the list are fruits such as the viciously spiky and infamously pungent durian, popular in south-east Asia, the subtly flavoured yet refreshing dragon fruit and the zingy feijoa, which is already a favourite in New Zealand. Aiming to carefully evaluate and produce quantitative data on the role such underused plants could play in areas including nutrition and food security, in 2011 CFF launched an independent research centre, backed by the Malaysian government (to the tune of nearly $40m) and the University of Nottingham in Malaysia. ""Wild relatives are one way to try to make wheat, or whatever major species it is, more resilient or use fewer resources,"" sayes Mayes, who is also theme director for Biotechnology, Breeding and Seed Systems at the new centre. ""But you are still very focussed on a limited number of of species and we think in itself that's potentially a danger. We're trying to find some plan Bs and Cs."" While the centre is still being built, research has already begun. Mayes and his team are working to pinpoint specific problems, ranging from the need for drought tolerance to nutritional requirements, then identify plants that fit the bill. While it is early days, some matches have already been suggested. ""Potentially we are trying to look at whether we can introduce [Bamara] groundnuts [grown in Africa] into southern Europe because the rainfall patterns predicted, and the the changes predicted in southern Europe mean there is going to be a lot more marginal land in terms of water availability,"" he says. But there are a number of issues the researchers need to resolve before they can achieve their aim of making such crops more widely used. ""If I double wheat yields in the UK through breeding, everyone knows what to do with that [crop], so the whole system, the processing system, commodities system, how it works, what properties it has, is already there,"" explains Mayes. ""It is much more difficult for a lot of the underutilised crops."" Indeed, bringing an underused crop to an international market is fraught with issues, ranging from questions of breeding and crop yield to those of storage, transport, policy issues and even the problem of educating consumers about how to use it. However, neglected and underused crops could be more immediately helpful in safeguarding the food security of subsistence farmers, who depend entirely on their crops for nutrition. ""That's fine in itself, it helps food security,"" agrees Mayes. ""[However] to get those minor crops more used, there has to be demand as well if they are ever going to be anything more than subsistence crops."" But as the rise of the avocado has shown, the world may just have a taste for change."
"Climate change has moved from the corners of the earth into the American backyard, the country's leading scientists warned on Tuesday, releasing a landmark report they hoped would spur action on climate change. The 840-page National Climate Assessment was seen as the definitive account of the effects of climate change on America, and of the country's efforts to deal with climate change. The findings were immediately embraced by the White House as “actionable science” which would guide Barack Obama as he moves to cut carbon emissions from power plants next month and for the remaining two years of his presidency. “I think this National Climate Assessment is the loudest and clearest alarm bell to date signalling the need to take urgent action to combat the threats to Americans from climate change,” John Holdren, the White House science advisor, told a conference call with reporters. Scientists who worked on the report said its main messsage was that climate change was already disrupting the lives of Americans – now and in real-time – and was doing so much more strongly than scientists had expected. Climate change was already registering in the form of extreme weather, sea-level rise, and the thawing of Arctic sea ice, a shift in growing seasons, and other indicators, the report said. “What this report shows is that climate change is happening now in our own backyards,” Thomas Karl, the director of the climatic centre at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told the Guardian. “There are a number of changes that have become faster and more apparent and stronger than we first anticipated.” The report for the first time looks at what America is doing to cut the emissions that cause climate change, and to protect people from its consequences in the future. It said all Americans are experiencing and will continue to experience the effects of climate change. ""Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,"" the report said. ""Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington state and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience."" The report is a compilation of published peer-reviewed science of the last several years, and details the effects of climate change on eight regions in the US. It notes that average temperature in the US has increased by about 1.5F (0.8C) since 1895, with more than 80% of that rise since 1980. The last decade was the hottest on record in the US. Temperatures are projected to rise another 2F over the next few decades, the report says. In northern latitudes such as Alaska, temperatures are rising even faster. Some parts of the country will be harder hit than others. Record-breaking heat – even at night – is expected to produce more drought and fuel larger and more frequent wildfires in the south-west, the report says. The north-east, midwest and Great Plains states will see an increase in heavy downpours and a greater risk of flooding. The north-east saw a 70% rise in heavy rainfall events in the last 60 years, the report said. Sea-level rise, which could reach 4ft by the end of the century, was already causing dangerous flooding in low-lying areas like Miami, Norfolk, Virginia, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the report said. Florida alone could face a $130 billion bill for flooding damage by the year 2100. Drought and high temperatures were already baking California and Arizona and prolonging the fire season in other parts of the south-west. In California, warmer winters have made it difficult to grow cherries. In the midwest, wetter springs have delayed planting. Invasive vines such as kudzu have spread northward, from the south to the Canadian border. Some of the effects on agriculture, such as a longer growing season, are positive. But ""by mid-century and beyond the overall impacts will be increasingly negative on most crops and livestock."" The report also warned of a growing risk of contaminated water supply because of sea-level rise and flooding, and poor air quality as hotter temperatures cook the smog, and soot from wildfires drifts across the country. Those with allergies are facing longer pollen and ragweed seasons – by as much as 24 days in North Dakota and Minnesota, the report said. “I think maybe this report will be the turning point when people finally realise that this is about them,” Susan Hassol, the chief science writer on the report, told the Guardian. “It's about them and their lives … Earlier, they had seen it as a distant threat – distant in time, distance in space, this is about poles, this is about island nations. They haven't seen it as a threat in their own backyard.” The White House moved to capitalise on that new sense of immediacy, organising a series of events on Tuesday and this week to showcase the findings of the report, including a series of interviews with TV weather forecasters. ""We want to emphasize to the public, this is not some distant problem of the future. This is a problem that is affecting Americans right now,"" Obama told NBC's Today show forecaster, Al Roker. ""Whether it means increased flooding, greater vulnerability to drought, more severe wildfires — all these things are having an impact on Americans as we speak."" Environmental groups and Democratic members of Congress also rallied to support the report. John Podesta, the White House counsellor, said Obama would rely on the report's findings as he moves ahead on the most ambitious phase of his climate change plan in June – a proposal to cut emissions from the current generation of power plants, responsible for nearly 40% of US carbon dioxide emissions. The White House acknowledged Obama would continue to face strong pushback from Republicans and industry. Podesta said the most Obama could expect from Congress in the way of climate action was a modest energy efficiency bill. Some Republican members of Congress continued to dismiss the findings of the report. Deb Fischer, a Republican Senator from Nebraska, attacked the science as ""politically charged"" and ""far from settled"" as well as Obama for bypassing Congress and using his executive authority to act on climate change.  Meanwhile, a leading coal industry lobby group, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, dismissed the report as “unsubstantiated scare tactics and hyperbole” and lashed out at Obama for moving ahead on power plant regulations."

"Increased future plant growth will not reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere as much as we thought; so finds a new study published in Science. This means that we will not have that get-out-of-jail-free card that some of us were counting on. For some background, it is clear that in some cases, increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can stimulate plant growth. It makes sense that this plant growth would help pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, buying us some time to get our act in order to reduce pollution.   According to the study,  “Earth system models project that rising atmospheric CO2 will promote carbon uptake by the terrestrial biosphere (plants). The resulting increase in carbon stocks in plant biomass and soil organic matter would slow the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and may help to slow climate change.” The authors note that many experiments have shown the increased CO2 usually helps stimulate photosynthesis and plant growth. Some of this extra CO2 ends up in the soils where it is unable to participate as a greenhouse gas. The current authors went a step further though. They asked what happens to the carbon after it is in the soils. We know that microbes decompose soil matter and thereby release the carbon back to the air. Will this process increase, decrease, or stay the same as the climate warms and climate change progresses? It is important because soil stocks (the amount of carbon contained in soil) is determined by a balance between the influx and outflux of carbon.  The authors found that increased CO2 in the atmosphere actually increased the outflux of carbon dioxide from the soils. That is, it increased the rate of decomposition. In the long run, the increases in influx and outflux will essentially balance out. This suggests that there will be little help from the biosphere for us humans – plants will not take up our emissions. The authors have two competing hypotheses behind the physical mechanisms that drive the decomposition. They told me that it is possible the plants close their stomata (the tiny pores which allow water and CO2 to pass into and out of leaves). As the stomata close, the soils become wetter and microbial activity increases. The authors also think that as atmospheric CO2 increases, soil microbes respond by decomposing older soil carbon. They call this a “priming effect” which is a natural buffering mechanism that slows carbon accumulation in soils.  Author Dr. Bruce Hungate from the Center for Ecosystem Science and Society told me,  “These results add to an increasingly clear picture that natural carbon sinks are finite. In particular, the soil carbon sink driven by rising CO2 concentrations has probably been overestimated. Natural land ecosystems are unlikely to sequester as much carbon as we had hoped. We should not expect nature to mop up the atmosphere for us. We have long thought soils to be a stable, safe place to store carbon, but our results show that soil carbon is not as stable as we previously thought.” This all goes to show that it is really up to us humans, the emitters of greenhouse gases to take the lead on fixing the problem we started. The earlier we take action, the easier it will be."

"The collapse of the Western Antarctica ice sheet is already under way and is unstoppable, two separate teams of scientists said on Monday. The glaciers' retreat is being driven by climate change and is already causing sea-level rise at a much faster rate than scientists had anticipated. The loss of the entire western Antarctica ice sheet could eventually cause up to 4 metres (13ft) of sea-level rise, devastating low-lying and coastal areas around the world. But the researchers said that even though such a rise could not be stopped, it is still several centuries off, and potentially up to 1,000 years away. The two studies, by Nasa and the University of Washington, looked at the ice sheets of western Antarctica over different periods of time. The Nasa researchers focused on melting over the last 20 years, while the scientists at the University of Washington used computer modelling to look into the future of the western Antarctic ice sheet. But both studies came to broadly similar conclusions – that the thinning and melting of the Antarctic ice sheet has begun and cannot be halted, even with drastic action to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. They also suggest that recent accumulation of ice in Antarctica was temporary. “A large sector of the western Antarctic ice sheet has gone into a state of irreversible retreat. It has passed the point of no return,” Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at Nasa and the University of California, Irvine, told a conference call. “This retreat will have major consequences for sea level rise worldwide.” The two studies between them suggest sea-level rise will be far greater than envisaged by the United Nations’ IPCC report earlier this year. The IPCC forecast on sea-level rise did not factor in the melting of the western Antarctica ice sheet. The Nasa study, to be published in Geophysical Research Letters, studied the retreat of six glaciers in western Antarctica that are already the major drivers of global sea-level rise. One of those glaciers, Pine Island, retreated 31km at its centre from 1992-2011. Rignot said all six glaciers together contained enough ice to add an additional 1.2m (4ft) to sea levels around the world. In the University of Washington study, which will be published in the journal Science, researchers used detailed topography maps, airborne radar and computer modelling to reach greater certainty about the projected timeline of the ice sheet collapse. The study honed in on the Thwaites glacier – a broad glacier that is part of the Amundsen Sea. Scientists have known for years that the Thwaites glacier is the soft underbelly of the Antarctic ice sheet, and first found that it was unstable decades ago. The University of Washington researchers said that the fast-moving Thwaites glacier could be lost in a matter of centuries. The loss of that glacier alone would raise global sea level by nearly 2ft. Thwaites also acts as a dam that holds back the rest of the ice sheet. Once Thwaites goes, researchers said, the remaining ice in the sheet could cause another 10 to 13ft (3-4m) of global sea-level rise. “The thinning we are seeing is not just some temporary trend. It is really the beginning of a larger scale collapse that is likely to play out over a two to 10-century range,” Ian Joughin, a University of Washington glaciologist, told The Guardian. He said the retreat would begin slowly, resulting in sea-level rise of less than 1mm a year for a couple of hundred years. But “then boom, it just starts to really go,” Joughin said. Even under the worst-case scenario currently envisaged, the collapse of the entire ice sheet is about 200 years off – and the collapse could be as far away as 1,000 years, depending on future warming. But collapse is inevitable, the scientists said. Joughin put the most likely timeframe at between 200 and 500 years. The two teams of scientists used airborne radar and satellites to map the layers of ice down to the sea bed, and to study the rate of glacier movement. The Nasa team also drew on observations stretching back 40 years. Even so, Rignot said he was taken aback at how fast change was occurring. “This system, whether Greenland or Antarctica, is changing on a faster time scale than we anticipated. We are discovering that every day,” Rignot said. Scientists are also finding that the causes of the ice loss are highly complex – and that it is not just due to warmer temperatures causing surface melting of the ice. Both papers said the contact between the glaciers and the relatively warmer water at the ocean depths was the main driver of the slow-motion collapse. Rignot said that even drastic action to cut greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change could not prevent the collapse. “We feel this is at the point where even if the ocean is not warming up, is not providing additional ocean heat, the system is in a sort of chain reaction that is unstoppable,” he told reporters on a conference call. The only thing that could hold the glaciers back would be a large hill or big mountain that could block the retreat, Rignot said. But there is none, he said, “So we think it is not going to be stoppable.”"

"The oversight committee of the US House of Representatives devoted several hours on Wednesday to grilling the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about online porn viewing, rampant absenteeism, accusations of assault and other alleged workplace improprieties. In truth, the investigation did not come up with much – at least nothing to match last year's sensational disclosure that the EPA had for years been duped into paying the salary of an employee who masqueraded as a CIA spy. Or revelations that a former administrator, Lisa Jackson, had used a fake private email account in the name of Richard Windsor.  But the zeal with which the committee's chair, the California representative Darrell Issa, pursued the investigation suggests Republicans are trying to disqualify the EPA from carrying out President Barack Obama's climate-change agenda.  “This is truly a broken agency,” Issa told the hearing. Republicans in Congress redoubled their attacks on the EPA and Obama's climate plan on Wednesday, following the release of a sweeping new scientific report. The hearing was told: one EPA employee devoted four to six hours a day to watching internet porn; one employee got a hefty pay rise despite being in charge of a hotline that did not respond to a caller in 2009; one supervisor paid a bonus to his own daughter; another authorised telecommuting for an employee in a nursing home; a number of employees were paid even though they rarely turned up for work; one employee got a $62,000 bonus. Committee members also identified by name employees alleged to have used EPA accounts to send private email. In all, the hearing was told that some 80 personnel were under investigation for workplace impropriety. If the evidence of wrongdoing seemed microscopic relative to the size of the 16,000-person agency, Issa was undeterred.  “This is going to be an ongoing daily part of communications with the EPA,” he told the hearing. Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican, said the allegations demonstrated the agency could no longer perform its job.  “The atmosphere and environment around the EPA is polluted and it's affecting your impact,” he said. The most serious revelation involved a breakdown between rival investigation units which led to a shouting match and accusations of assault. The Justice Department declined to intervene. The clash involved two competing units. One, which focuses on security, works out of the office of the EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy. The inspector general's office of the EPA claims the 10-person cell was obstructing its efforts to investigate workplace improprieties. Elisabeth Heller Drake, an agent with the inspector general's office, said John Martin, an agent of the EPA's homeland security office, invaded her personal space and angrily jabbed a finger at her following a testy interview. The Justice Department declined to press assault charges following Drake's complaint. It emerged at the hearing that Martin is making a counter-allegation of assault."

"The ‘big 10’ global food and drink companies together emit more greenhouse gases than the Nordic countries and would rank as the 25th most polluting country in the world if grouped together, the international charity and agency Oxfam claims in a new report on Tuesday. In a highly critical overview of their climate change policies, it warns the companies – which represent the world’s most famous household brands – that they are risking financial ruin if they do not do more to use their clout and size to tackle the climate crisis.  The companies are Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola, Danone, General Mills, Kellogg, Mars, Mondelez International, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever. The new report, Standing on the Sidelines, says together they churn out more than Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Iceland’s annual total of 250 million tons of greenhouse gases, according to its analysis of the Carbon Disclosure Project for company emissions and the most recent data for country emissions.  Oxfam insists the companies are capable of cutting their combined emissions by 80 million tons by 2020 and says they are not doing enough despite the threat climate change poses to the sustained supply of ingredients needed for their products, their economic might and the need to feed a growing population. Between them, they generate £650m ($1.1bn) a day in revenues, equivalent to the total GDP of all the world’s lower income countries. Oxfam singled out Kellogg and General Mills as two of the worst on climate change policies and is calling on these “clear laggards” to lead the sector towards more responsible policies and practices.   Both have huge UK food businesses – Kellogg best-known for its Corn Flakes and Rice Crispies cereals and General Mills for Haagen-Dazs and Jus-Rol – and Oxfam urges them to disclose their agricultural emissions and biggest polluting suppliers, and set targets to cut emissions from their supply chains. Climate change is linked to storms, floods, droughts and shifting weather patterns, which affect food supplies and put pressure on prices, causing more hunger and poverty. Oxfam projects that the price of products like corn flakes could spike by up to 44% in 15 years because of climate change. Oxfam’s director of UK campaigns and policy Sally Copley said: “By failing to cut emissions adequately the ‘big 10' are putting short-term profits ahead of the long-term interests of both themselves and the rest of us. Their influence and wealth are the perfect ingredients to stop putting their businesses at risk and making climate change worse."" Kellogg said: “Kellogg is committed to doing what’s right for the environment and society. As part of this commitment, we are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – along with energy use and water use – by 15–20% at our manufacturing facilities by 2015. Oxfam has recognised our commitment to working with global palm oil suppliers to source fully traceable palm oil, produced in a manner that’s environmentally responsible, socially beneficial, and economically viable."" General Mills said: ""Climate Change is a serious issue, and as a food company we are very aware of the impact that climate change could have on agriculture and the world’s food supply. General Mills has been actively engaged in positively influencing climate policy and has been taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its operations for many years."""

"Clear skies above but water below, a woman on a moped navigates a flooded street corner on Miami Beach, an all-too-familiar sign for residents of this iconic peninsula where the ocean seems more likely than ever to swamp Ocean Drive one day. If there's an image that starkly illustrates the threats of climate change, it's this photograph, which was included in the recent National Climate Assessment released by the White House. It is noteworthy because the flood is from exceptionally high spring tides – not heavy rains. Tidal flooding like that is relatively new. And scary. ""People in Miami Beach are living climate change,"" said David Nolan, a meteorology and physical oceanography professor at the University of Miami. ""They're on the frontline.""  The people of Miami Beach didn't need the National Climate Assessment to tell them low-lying south Florida is ""exceptionally vulnerable to sea level rise"". The city is already spending $206m to overhaul its drainage system. The day after the White House released its climate change report, Miami-Dade County's commission passed a 6 May resolution that calls on planners to account for sea level rise. Local officials across the four counties of south Florida are making similar moves. Almost anyone who lives in south Florida has a nagging fear about climate change. It's both abstract and, at times, very real. I grew up with Nolan in one of the most vulnerable places in South Florida: Key West. Both of our mothers' homes were flooded by hurricane Wilma in 2005. It was the first flood of its kind in my lifetime. And Wilma was the last of an unprecedented eight hurricanes that damaged parts of Florida in 13 months. Talk of global warming mounted after those back-to-back mean seasons. No hurricanes have directly hit since. Widespread discussion about climate change subsided. Here's what hasn't gone away: rising home insurance rates, which have increased in part because insurance firms do believe in climate change. And then there's the concern that the one investment that we see as the fulfilment of the American dream – our homes – will be impossible to keep or will be so devalued in 30 years that they won't be worth passing on to our children. Sea level rise threatens our drinking water supplies, farm fields and the main driver of tourism: beaches. But in the absence of a disaster, it's easy for many of us to forget about the long-term risks until a report such as the National Climate Assessment details them. But while local officials are talking about solutions and planning, politicians farther away from south Florida aren't. The issue has become an ideological fault line on the state and national levels. In the state capital in Tallahassee, Republican governor Rick Scott stalled efforts to grapple with the issue. In Washington, Republican senator Marco Rubio is emerging as a leading sceptic of man-made climate change. A potential 2016 candidate for president, he said that scientists sometimes get it wrong. ""Some of these people were predicting a new ice age in the 1970s. Imagine if we had acted on that."" In the Democratic-leaning Miami area, people are not inclined to side with Rubio. But many hope that he's right. Hope does nothing to stop the seas from rising. ""Climate change is real,"" said Nolan. ""It's here."" And it's clear to anyone walking around South Beach when there's high spring tide. Marc Caputo is the Miami Herald's political writer"
"River otters, lichen on trees and coral in oceans are not just beautiful to look at, they tell us something important about the environment around them.   The return of otters to a river can point to water becoming cleaner, lichens typically appear when the air is clear and free of pollution, while if corals – part of the large animal group known gloriously as cnidarians – bleach and die it can be a sign of oceans warming. Famously, Cuban tree frogs are thought to be under threat due to climate change. Collectively such organisms are known as 'indicator species.' You wouldn’t think that humanity could fall into that group. We have an extraordinary ability to inhabit everywhere from the most polluted inner cities, choking mines and factory sites, to the sweetest meadow and untouched island paradise. We can make camp in harsh sub-zero Arctic conditions and live as nomads in the sweltering desert. But, look more closely at the fate of particular groups of people, and you can tell an awful lot about what is happening to certain key environments and the planet more generally. From endangered tropical forests in Brazil and Liberia, to contested tracts of fertile land under threat of being ‘grabbed’ across Asia, people defending the environment and land rights are increasingly under attack and being killed. Thinking of such environmental defenders just as an ‘indicator species’ is too technical and reductive. But as people under ever more violent threat, who find themselves on the front line of humanity’s transgression of planetary boundaries, they have become bellwethers, those who reveal the existence of a trend. Competition for access to natural resources is intensifying. Logging and mining concessions, land grabs for industrial scale palm oil plantations, all these deals pitch powerful vested interests against the livelihoods of communities and the long-term health of the environment.  This plays out against a backdrop of the still unquestioned pursuit of economic growth and rising consumption in rich countries, together with extreme global inequality. Humanity in the meantime is crossing the threshold of several vital ecological life-support functions.  As a result, more and more people find themselves like border guards at our planetary boundaries, defending their environment from corporate or state abuse and unsustainable exploitation.  In the decade between 2002 and 2013 there were 908 known killings of people across 35 countries resulting from their work on environment and land issues. The worst year on record was 2012, but numbers for 2013 are expected to rise due to a time lag in data.  These figures, though, are just the visible tip of a larger veiled mountain of harassment and intimidation. Because of the failure of the international system to properly recognise, record and report on the plight of environmental defenders, these known deaths – on a par with the number of journalists killed as a result of their work over the same period – are almost certainly a significant underestimate. For example, unrecorded killings are highly likely in African countries such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Zimbabwe that are enduring resource-fuelled unrest, but information is almost impossible to gain without detailed field investigations. So, all around the world, an increasing number of individuals and communities operate like guardians, look-outs, watchers, pioneers, messengers on the edge of our planetary boundaries – feeling the brunt of resource competition and providing the human face of the consequences of global overreach. Their example challenges us to accept ecological limits and devise a new economic compact for how we can all survive and prosper by sharing a finite world. The year of the worst recorded killings of environmental defenders – 2012 – also saw a conference to mark the 20th anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit. The day the conference closed, two campaigners – Almir Nogueira de Amorim and João Luiz Telles Penetra – fighting on behalf of Rio’s fishing communities against the expansion of oil operations were abducted nearby in Rio de Janeiro state and later found executed. The killers of environmental defenders enjoy almost complete impunity. Only 10 perpetrators, about 1% of the overall incidence of known killings, are known to have been tried, convicted and punished between 2002 and 2013. Later this year in December government officials from around the world will gather for the next climate change talks in Lima, Peru. Without urgent action, as they struggle towards a paper agreement on progress, the murder and intimidation of ordinary people actually defending the environment and land will continue outside the conference halls largely ignored. With crushing irony, environmental defenders who find themselves in conflict with powerful vested interests get depicted as enemies of development. Yet a model of economic development that undermines planetary life-support systems and kills and intimidates those who would protect them, cannot really be called 'development' at all.  As long as human progress in lower income nations is based on the exploitation of their natural resources to feed relentless over-consumption elsewhere, this problem will remain and worsen. New approaches to development must begin with communities first and foremost being able to manage and benefit, securely and in environmentally resilient ways, from their own natural resources. In the meantime we need action to recognise and protect environmental defenders. In finding the frontline of their struggles globally, we will be drawing a map of planetary boundaries. For the sake of our own collective survival, we must then work out how to stay the right side of the lines."
"Lord Nigel Lawson and his associates at the Global Warming Policy Foundation have been all upset this month. Professor Lennart Bengtsson, a 79-year-old meteorologist from the University of Reading, had resigned from the foundation’s academic advisory council only a couple of weeks after joining.  According to Bengtsson, once news got out that he had joined the GWPF, colleagues and peers in the academic community put him under “enormous pressure” and one refused to co-author a science paper with him. In his resignation letter, Bengtsson said the situation reminded him of the anti-Communist fervour fuelled by 1950s US Senator Joseph McCarthy.  David Henderson, chairman of the GWPF’s academic advisory council, wrote this “degree of intolerance” and the “rejection of the principle of open scientific inquiry” was “truly shocking”.  This was just the kind of situation that the GWPF “was created to remedy”, wrote Henderson. Really?  Let’s have a look at the Global Warming Policy Foundation’s record in its noble fight for tolerance and respect for scientific inquiry. In 2010, it kicked things off by inviting Vaclav Klaus, then the President of the Czech Republic, to deliver its inaugural annual lecture [pdf]. He said: It seems to me that the widespread acceptance of the global warming dogma has become one of the main, most costly and most undemocratic public policy mistakes in generations. The previous one was communism. Comparing people who accept the evidence of human-caused climate change to communists hardly seems conducive to breeding tolerance. The following year, the GWPF called on Australian Cardinal George Pell to deliver the lecture. Here’s what he said about climate change campaigners. Some of those campaigning to save the planet are not merely zealous but zealots. To the religionless and spiritually rootless, mythology - whether comforting or discomforting - can be magnetically, even pathologically, attractive. Later in his speech, Pell said debates about anthropogenic global warming “can only be conducted by the accurate recognition and interpretation of scientific evidence”. Pell's own “interpretation” of the state of the science was described by some of Australia’s leading climate scientists as “dreadful”, “utter rubbish” and “flawed”. The 2013 lecture was delivered by former Australian Prime Minister John Howard who said he was an “agnostic” on human-caused climate change.  He titled his speech “One Religion Is Enough” which was a reaction to the “sanctimonious tone” he said came from people who advocated for sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The GWPF’s own academic advisory council can hardly be described as being populated by those hoping to spread love and tolerance either. For example, three members of the GWPF academic advisory council – Professor Nir Shaviv, the Cato Institute’s emeritus Professor Richard Lindzen and Professor William Happer – co-signed a column printed in the Wall Street Journal in 2012 where they suggested climate scientists were influenced by considerations of cash.  Alarmism over climate is of great benefit to many, providing government funding for academic research and a reason for government bureaucracies to grow. Alarmism also offers an excuse for governments to raise taxes, taxpayer-funded subsidies for businesses that understand how to work the political system, and a lure for big donations to charitable foundations promising to save the planet. The trio also compared modern day climate scientists to the work done by Trofim Lysenko and the totalitarian regime of Stalinist Russia – a comparison that's a popular climate denialist canard.  It almost feels like there's a communist analogy under every climate contrarian's bed.  Another GWPF advisory council member is Professor Ian Plimer, a geologist and director for a number of mining companies, including several owned by one of the world’s richest women, Gina Rinehart.  Plimer has written two debunked books claiming climate change is all natural – Heaven and Earth and How To Get Expelled From School – the second of which was aimed at children and teachers.  Plimer told one audience at a book launch to “maintain the rage”. His upcoming book Not For Greens, the publisher says, will claim “unless the greens live sustainably in caves in the forest and use no trappings of the modern world, then they should be regarded as hypocrites and treated with the disdain they deserve”. Another Australian GWPF member is Dr Robert Carter, who has no academic position at any university but is associated with about a dozen climate science denial organisations in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. One of those organisations is the Heartland Institute, which ran an infamous billboard campaign that associated people who accepted the science of human-caused climate change with the values of terrorist and murder Ted “Unabomber” Kaczynski. After seeing the outrage caused by the billboard campaign, Carter thought it was a good idea. The GWPF has also been all upset over the rejection of a manuscript submitted to the journal Environmental Research Letters by Professor Bengtsson.  The Times and other mainstream media in the UK, the United States and Australia ran stories claiming his manuscript had been knocked back because its conclusions would be “unhelpful” to the mainstream science community. It turned out that the manuscript was knocked back because the peer reviewers said it contained several errors, had tried to compare “apples with pears” and showed “troubling shallowness” in its arguments. When Lord Lawson is characterising certain behaviours as McCarthyesque or intolerant, he might want to stop and consider the actions of some other GWPF associates. The Independent newspaper has reported how an unnamed GWPF trustee wrote a letter to the employer of one of the foundation's harshest critics, Bob Ward, a policy director at the London School of Economics.  The letter reportedly claimed one distinguished Oxford scholar was “appalled” that the LSE was employing Mr Ward. ""This is the way in which the foundation goes about its business, trying to intimidate its opponents into silence,"" Ward claimed. The GWPF has said it knew nothing of the letter. Another GWPF advisor is Professor Richard Tol, of the University of Sussex.  Tol is the co-developer of a model known as FUND that is used as one way to assess the societal cost of greenhouse gas emissions. When economist Frank Ackerman co-authored a technical paper criticising aspects of Tol’s FUND model, Tol responded by accusing Akerman of libel and writing to his employers and several of his publishers. When Ackerman changed jobs, Tol wrote to them too. Tol was allowed to post a response in the journal, where he claimed that Ackerman had ignored known problems with his own analysis. In a web page devoted to the “Tol Controversy”, Ackerman writes that Tol had “waged a relentless campaign to convince the world that one of my published articles is illegitimate”. On the accusations of libel, Ackerman wrote: “This is a false accusation of a serious offense, no longer just an academic disagreement. It has gone far beyond the bounds of acceptable debate.” The GWPF and Lord Lawson are keen to leave people with the impression that climate sceptics are being being victimised. Yet they never seem keen to mention the numerous occasions where academics researching climate change have themselves been abused and hounded.  There are many examples - they could start with Dr Ben Santer or Professor Michael Mann. There’s also the use of Freedom of Information laws to monitor scientist’s inboxes or make unreasonable or uninformed demands for data that’s either already there or irrelevant to a finding. When the Daily Mail looked around for examples of Lennart Bengtsson being abused on the internet, they chose to highlight how one writer had called Bengtsson (sensitive types should mute their internal reading dialogue now) a “cry baby”. I’d say this is somewhat milder than emails to some climate academics from people who want to “smack the living shit out of you” or ask you to “die you maggot”. It’s certainly less shocking than arriving at your car to find the words “climate turd” smeared in excrement across your bonnet. Bjorn Lomborg, the political scientist who heads the US-based Copenhagen Consensus Center think tank, is another to have run with the confected outrage at so-called climate McCarthyism. He wrote: When researchers mix up their role as a scientist with that of an activist, the reputation of their science will inevitably diminish. Climate science deserves better. Ironically, Lomborg’s analysis comes only days after it was revealed that the GWPF had decided to restructure itself so that it can actively campaign, something that in Lomborg's eyes would presumably ""inevitably diminish"" an already questionable reputation. But all this talk of McCarthyism and communists reminds me of a passage in the book Merchants of Doubt: How a handful of scientists obscured the truth on issues from tobacco smoke to global warming by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway. The book explores the roots of science denial, tracing many of its earliest actors – some of which are still active – to a group driven by a fear of communism and a fanatical devotion to free markets. Evidently accepting that their ends justified their means, they embraced the tactics of their enemy, the very things they hated Soviet Communism for: its lies, its deceit, its denial of the very realities it had created. • This article was amended on 27 May 2014 to correct the spelling of Frank Ackerman's name."
"After a day of breathless campaigning for its massive, 840-page climate change report, detailing the severe weather and dangerous events ""happening now"" in Americans' backyards, the White House turned to Al Roker for help. The jovial NBC Today Show anchor is one of eight local and national meteorologists the Obama administration invited to the White House for one-on-one interviews with the president.   The report is the third and most comprehensive of its kind since George HW Bush first ordered an analysis in 1990. As Tuesday's report was unveiled, Noaa administrator Kathryn Sullivan urged Americans to act on the local level – a message President Obama pushed on local news channels. The anchors used their interviews to stray away from climate change. Fox News commentator Dana Perino, ""dared"" the meteorologists to ask Obama about Benghazi, but Nigeria took top billing. At least three of the anchors, including NBC's Al Roker, used their interview with the president to go off-topic, bringing up the kidnapping of more than 270 girls in Nigeria – an event unrelated to warming temperatures and severe weather. In response to Roker's question, Obama said ""help from our military and our law enforcement officials"" has been accepted and ""we're going to do everything we can to provide assistance."" When the president guided Roker back to climate change, Obama stressed urgency: ""This is a problem that is affecting Americans right now. Whether it means increased flooding, greater vulnerability to drought, more severe wildfires – all these things are having an impact on Americans as we speak."" Robert Bonnie, an undersecretary for the USDA, told Roker the forest service now spends 40%, ""about $2bn"", of its budget fighting fires. Roker, who began the day by bragging about years of White House visits, concluded by tweeting an photo of himself with the White House dogs, Sunny and Bo. Sunny and Bo, First Dogs on the South Lawn with an old dog http://t.co/XmzDNKe0yC Meanwhile, ABC News' Ginger Zee also asked Obama about Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram, which he described as a ""horrendous organization"". Zee asked Obama about the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, to which he said it ""isn't going to be the determining factor"" of his plan for coping with climate change, and that solar and wind power would be among the top priorities. Megan Glaros, of CBS This Morning, also tried to bring up the pipeline, a question Obama dodged in favour of appealing to Americans' wallets. ""It's having an impact on agriculture, it's having an impact on our tourism … There are real costs, not in the distant future but right now. … It's going to impact … We'll end up saving money and lives in the long term … I think that's something most Americans understand."" My interview with President Obama. pic.twitter.com/zTTwKc4nTY Jim Gandy, a South Carolina CBS local weatherman, rejected the climate change naysayers of his conservative home state by saying ""the science has spoken, our world is warming."" Gandy also pressed Obama on South Carolinians' worries about how expensive going green will be. Obama countered by talking about creating jobs in solar and wind power, as well ""energy-efficient refrigerators"". As for how the state should cope with more powerful hurricanes, Obama recommended that you put your generator on the roof if you're in a flood-prone region, and in the basement if high winds are a risk. He ended his home improvement segment by reminding Gandy that ""mitigation"" isn't the answer, and that the US will ""have to adapt"". The other anchors included Jeff Renner of Seattle's KING, Bill Martin of San Francisco's KTVU, and John Morales of Miami's WTVJ. All the interviews will be broadcast during their respective local and national airtimes.  Me, Bo & Sunny on a sunny day on the #southlawn - See my interview with @BarackObama on @ABCWorldNews pic.twitter.com/FMSIxvAoGl First dogs Sunny and Bo proved to be the star attraction, however, as Zee join Roker in playing with the dogs, posting this video online. NBC New York's Janice Huff, refusing to be outdone by her ABC rival, did the same, as did John Morales and KTVU's Bill Martin."
"Climate change scientists have reacted angrily to charges that an academic paper was rejected by a peer-reviewed journal because of intolerance of dissenting views. A paper by a group of researchers headed by Lennart Bengtsson, a University of Reading research fellow, was turned down for publication by Environmental Research Letters. Bengtsson was briefly a board member of the climate sceptic organisation the Global Warming Policy Foundation, founded by former UK chancellor of the exchequer Nigel Lawson, but he resigned on Wednesday citing pressure from other academics.  He turned to the Times newspaper to complain that the journal's rejection of his paper was on ""activist"" grounds. But the publishers of the journal, the Institute of Physics, said on Friday that the paper was rejected because it contained scientific flaws, and not for any political reasons. A large number of the scientific papers submitted to peer-reviewed journals are rejected, usually because of criticisms of the scientific methods used or because the research does not represent a major new advance in thinking. Environmental Research Letters told the Guardian that it rejects about 65-70% of the papers submitted to it. The paper in question dealt with the sensitivity of the climate to rises in greenhouse gases, claiming to have found inconsistencies in recent analyses of how much temperature is likely to rise if concentrations in the atmosphere should increase. But the reviewers found that the claim of inconsistencies was invalid, particularly as a variety of results are likely to be found by any such analysis, because all climate science deals in a range of possible future outcomes. Nicola Gulley, editorial director at IOP Publishing, said: ""The draft journal paper by Lennart Bengtsson that Environmental Research Letters declined to publish, which was the subject of this morning's front page story of The Times, contained errors, in our view did not provide a significant advancement in the field, and therefore could not be published in the journal."" She added: ""The decision not to publish had absolutely nothing to do with any 'activism' on the part of the reviewers or the journal, as suggested in The Times' article; the rejection was solely based on the content of the paper not meeting the journal's high editorial standards. The referees selected to review this paper were of the highest calibre and are respected members of the international science community. The comments taken from the referee reports were taken out of context and therefore, in the interests of transparency, we have worked with the reviewers to make the full reports available."" In their reports, the reviewers stated that ""the overall innovation of the manuscript is very low"", and this meant it did not meet requirements for the papers in the journal to ""significantly advance knowledge in the field"". They wrote: ""The comparison between observation based estimates of [warming] … and model-based estimates is comparing apples and pears, as the models are calculating true global means, whereas the observations have limited coverage."" Other academics defended the peer-review process. Simon Lewis, reader in global change science at University College London, said: ""What counts are the reasons the editor gave for rejection. They were because the paper contained important errors and didn't add enough that was new to warrant publication. Looking at all the comments by the reviewer they suggested how the paper might be rewritten in the future to make it a solid contribution to science. That's not suppressing a dissenting view, it's what scientists call peer review."" Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute on climate change, said: ""This episode should not distract us from the fact that we are performing a very dangerous experiment with the Earth's climate. Even by the end of this century, on current trends we risk changes of a magnitude that are unprecedented in the last 10,000 years. How we respond to that is a matter of public policy, but scientists clearly play a key role in providing policymakers with the evidence they require."" Bengtsson said in a statement late on Friday: ""I do not believe there is any systematic 'cover-up' of scientific evidence on climate change or that academics' work is being 'deliberately suppressed', as the Times front page suggests. I am worried by a wider trend that science is gradually being influenced by political views. Policy decisions need to be based on solid fact. I was concerned that the Environmental Research Letters reviewer's comments suggested his or her opinion was not objective or based on an unbiased assessment of the scientific evidence."" The paper by Bengtsson and others was submitted to Environmental Research Letters in mid-February and rejected in early March after reports by two international referees found ""significant scientific errors"". Following that, the authors asked for the paper to be considered as an opinion piece rather than a research paper. The journal rejected this suggestion after a further review by two other experts in the field. The final decision was made in early April. Bengtsson was appointed to the Global Warming Policy Foundation academic advisory council on 30 April this year, and resigned barely two weeks later on 14 May. His resignation was covered by the Times the next day, with Bengtsson claiming to have been subjected to ""McCarthy""-like persecution by his academic peers. No specific examples of the persecution that took place during those two weeks were cited, and when contacted by the Guardian Bengtsson did not provide any."

"It is often claimed by those who deny the reality of climate change that scientific forecasts about the impact of global warming are far too uncertain to merit taking action. There is no reason to suffer the inconvenience of leaving the planet's fossil fuels unburned when the current analyses of meteorologists, oceanographers and geophysicists will probably turn out to be false alarms, they argue. Such contention is dangerously false. For a start, scientists' warnings about future weather patterns are certainly not overreactions to the evidence they have gathered. In most cases, observed climate changes – the slump in summer sea ice coverage in the Arctic in recent years is a good example – have turned out to be far more drastic than researchers had originally predicted. Their views of the future – melting icecaps, spreading deserts and acidifying oceans – are cautious evaluations that most probably underestimate the likely impact of global warming. There is another, more straightforward reason to repudiate deniers' claims about scientists' ""false alarms"", however. The impact of climate change is not an issue that is going to be determined in far-off years for the simple reason that it is already happening. This is a point made clear by Nasa glaciologist Eric Rignot who reveals that his observations show that a large part of the West Antarctica ice sheet has now begun to disintegrate and that the entire sheet appears today to be in irreversible retreat. ""One of the feared tipping points of the climate system appears to have been crossed,"" says Stefan Rahmstorf, an expert on the physics of the ocean at Potsdam University. Certainly the consequences of this massive destabilisation of ice cover at the south pole are going to be considerable, scientists now argue The last assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) put a modest figure of one to three feet as the likely rise in sea levels that will be experienced this century. The disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice shelf extends that forecast drastically. A figure of 10 feet is now a more than likely option over the coming centuries. Vast tracts of heavily populated coastline around the world face inundation. Millions are likely to lose their homes. It may take more than a century for this devastation to occur. Nevertheless, it now looks to be inevitable, says Rignot. Nor will the residents of low-lying regions such as Bangladesh or Florida be surprised at this forecast. They are already experiencing the consequences of rising sea levels triggered by melting icecaps. A useful example is provided by Miami. The city is built on top of porous limestone and its foundations are now absorbing water from rising seas at an alarming rate. Water now bubbles up through pipes and drains and taints fresh water supplies while seawater regularly flows out of drains into streets, which become flooded. Civil engineers currently estimate that the cost of putting right the damage to Miami could rise to billions of dollars and that, please note, is the price that a single city will have to pay to deal with just one aspect of global warming. Repeat it across the globe and you get a notion of the vast cost we now face for having failed to deal with climate change for the past two decades and for faltering in our commitment to agree to curb emissions of carbon dioxide from our factories, power plants and cars. The result of this continued inaction has been straightforward: climate change – once a far-off threat – is now upon us and is already bringing alarming change to our planet, as the citizens of Miami are now experiencing, along with those living near spreading deserts in Africa, in the far north where tundras are melting, and in high mountain areas in the Andes and Himalayas whose glaciers are now disappearing. As Leonard Berry, director of the Florida Centre for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University puts it: ""Climate change is not a future thing, it's a 'happening now' thing."" After a week that has seen several UK newspapers give wild and inordinate coverage to false claims that some scientists have tried to suppress inconvenient climate research, this point needs emphasising. A world bedevilled by climate change is not a remote, questionable prospect. It is a reality that has already arrived and is destined to have increasingly profound impacts until we wake up to the threat and act coherently. • This article was amended on 19 May 2014 to clarify the probable rate of the rise in sea levels."

"Climate change caused by humans has made the likelihood of extreme rainfall similar to that seen in England this winter significantly higher, according to analysis seen by the Guardian. Rainfall events that would previously have occurred only once in a century are now likely to be witnessed once every eighty years in the south of England, the Oxford University work shows.  That will mean far more frequent severe floods for residents of the crowded region, with what were once extremely rare events now happening much more often than the infrastructure of the region is equipped for. The research shows an increase in the rate of such events of about 20 to 25%, which significantly alters the number of homes likely to be vulnerable to flooding.  Friederike Otto, from the university’s school of geography and the environment, said: “It will never be possible to say that any specific flood was caused by human-induced climate change. We have shown, however, that the odds of getting an extremely wet winter [in the UK] are changing due to man-made climate change. Past greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution have loaded the weather dice so the probability of the south of England experiencing extremely wet winters has increased.” The scientists who conducted the study warned that this estimate of the frequency of extreme rainfall was based solely on current levels of observed rainfall in the recent past, compared with historical levels and those predicted for the future under a wide variety of possible scenarios under climate change.  This method means that if global warming leads, as expected in the future, to higher rainfall in already wet areas of the globe, including the UK, then this frequency could rise much further still. If that were the case, many more thousands of homes in the UK could be vulnerable to flooding, or to worse extremes of weather. The analysis was arrived at by one of the most significant examples to date of scientists using the power of home computers to crunch vast amounts of data. The weather@home project drew on the power of more than 60,000 volunteers who allowed their personal computers to be used to process raw data gathered from observations of weather patterns.  Specialised software allowed the computers to be used to safely to process the figures, and return them to the scientists, from which the climate change experts were able to deduce key findings such as the increased likelihood of extreme weather events in the south of England. Under the programmes, the scientists used the spare capacity on home computers to compare tens of thousands of simulations of possible weather in our present-day climate with tens of thousands of simulations of a hypothetical world without the influence of past greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, using the same climate model. However, the scientists now want to refine the data still further, to include elements reflecting the UK’s individual geography and hydrology –such as river locations, underlying rock formations, lowlying flood plains, and the flow of water from upland areas to lowlands.  That should enable a much more detailed picture to be drawn up of the likelihood of floods across the region. At present, the scientists are only able to say that high levels of rainfall are much more likely than in the past, whereas with a greater refinement they may be able to say with precision how much more likely flooding events are in particular localities."

"That didn't take long. The public interest in the state of the natural world stimulated by the winter floods receded almost as quickly as the waters did.  A YouGov poll showed that the number of respondents placing the environment among their top three issues of concern rose from 6% in mid-January to 23% in mid-February. By early April – though the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had just published two massive and horrifying reports – the proportion had fallen back to 11%.  CarbonBrief has plotted the results on this graph: Sustaining interest in this great but slow-burning crisis is a challenge no one seems to have mastered. Only when the crisis causes or exacerbates an acute disaster – such as the floods – is there a flicker of anxiety, but that quickly dies away. Why is it so difficult to persuade people to care about our wonderful planet, the world that gave rise to us and upon which we wholly depend?  And why do you encounter a barrage of hostility and denial whenever you attempt it (and not only from the professional liars who are paid by coal and oil and timber companies to sow confusion and channel hatred)? The first thing to note, in trying to answer this question, is that the rich anglophone countries are anomalous. In this bar chart (from the New York Times) you can see how atypical the attitudes of people in the US and the UK are. Because almost everything we read in this country is published in rich, English-speaking nations, we might get the false impression that the world doesn't care very much. This belief is likely to be reinforced by the cherished notion that we lead the world in knowledge, sophistication and compassion. The bar chart puts me in mind of the famous quote perhaps mistakenly attributed to Gandhi. When asked by a journalist during a visit to Britain, ""What do you think of western civilization?"", he's reputed to have replied, ""I think it would be a good idea."" Our erroneous belief that we are more concerned about manmade climate change than the people of other nations informs the sentiment, often voiced by the press and politicians, that there's no point in acting if the rest of the world won't play its part. For example, last year the chancellor, George Osborne, remarked: I don't want us to be the only people out there in front of the rest of the world. I certainly think we shouldn't be further ahead of our partners in Europe. But we're not ""the only people out there in front of the rest of the world."" In fact we're not in front at all. As this map produced by Oxford University's Smith School suggests, we are some way behind not only some other rich nations but also a number of countries much poorer than ours. As for the US, Australia and Canada, they are ranked among the worst of all: comprehensively failing to limit their massive contribution to a global problem. We justify our foot-dragging with a mistaken premise. Our refusal to stop pumping so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is pure selfishness. Both the map and the bar chart overlap to some degree with the fascinating results of the Greendex survey of consumer attitudes. For years we've been told that people cannot afford to care about the natural world until they become rich; that only economic growth can save the biosphere, that civilisation marches towards enlightenment about our impacts on the living planet. The results suggest the opposite. As you can see from the following graph, the people consulted in poorer countries feel, on average, much guiltier about their impacts on the natural world than people in rich countries, even though those impacts tend to be smaller. Of the nations surveyed, the people of Germany, the US, Australia and Britain feel the least consumer guilt; the people of India, China, Mexico and Brazil the most. The more we consume, the less we feel. And maybe that doesn't just apply to guilt. Perhaps that's the point of our otherwise-pointless hyperconsumption: it smothers feeling. It might also be the effect of the constant bombardment of advertising and marketing. They seek to replace our attachments to people and place with attachments to objects: attachments which the next round of advertising then breaks in the hope of attaching us to a different set of objects. The richer we are and the more we consume, the more self-centred and careless of the lives of others we appear to become. Even if you somehow put aside the direct, physical impacts of rising consumption, it's hard to understand how anyone could imagine that economic growth is a formula for protecting the planet. So what we seem to see here is the turning of a vicious circle. The more harm we do, the less concerned about it we become. And the more hyperconsumerism destroys relationships, communities and the physical fabric of the Earth, the more we try to fill the void in our lives by buying more stuff. All this is accompanied in the rich anglophone nations with the extreme neoliberalism promoted by both press and politicians, and a great concentration of power in the hands of the financial and fossil fuel sectors, which lobby hard, in the public sphere and in private, to prevent change. So the perennially low level of concern, which flickers upwards momentarily when disaster strikes, then slumps back into the customary stupor, is an almost inevitable result of a society that has become restructured around shopping, fashion, celebrity and an obsession with money.  How we break the circle and wake people out of this dreamworld is the question that all those who love the living planet should address. There will be no easy answers. Monbiot.com"
"Climate change has moved from distant threat to present-day danger and no American will be left unscathed, according to a landmark report due to be unveiled on Tuesday. The National Climate Assessment, a 1,300-page report compiled by 300 leading scientists and experts, is meant to be the definitive account of the effects of climate change on the US. It will be formally released at a White House event and is expected to drive the remaining two years of Barack Obama's environmental agenda.  The findings are expected to guide Obama as he rolls out the next and most ambitious phase of his climate change plan in June – a proposal to cut emissions from the current generation of power plants, America's largest single source of carbon pollution. The White House is believed to be organising a number of events over the coming week to give the report greater exposure. ""Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,"" a draft version of the report says. The evidence is visible everywhere from the top of the atmosphere to the bottom of the ocean, it goes on. ""Americans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter, and periods of extreme heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced. Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours, though in many regions there are longer dry spells in between."" The final wording was under review by the White House but the basic gist remained unchanged, scientists who worked on the report said. On Sunday the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said the world needed to try harder to combat climate change. At a meeting of UN member states in Abu Dhabi before a climate change summit in New York on 23 September, Ban said: ""I am asking them to announce bold commitments and actions that will catalyse the transformative change we need. If we do not take urgent action, all our plans for increased global prosperity and security will be undone."" Gary Yohe, an economist at Wesleyan University and vice-chair of the NCA advisory committee, said the US report would be unequivocal that the effects of climate change were occurring in real-time and were evident in every region of the country. ""One major take-home message is that just about every place in the country has observed that the climate has changed,"" he told the Guardian. ""It is here and happening, and we are not cherrypicking or fearmongering."" The draft report notes that average temperature in the US has increased by about 1.5F (0.8C) since 1895, with more than 80% of that rise since 1980. The last decade was the hottest on record in the US. Temperatures are projected to rise another 2F over the next few decades, the report says. In northern latitudes such as Alaska, temperatures are rising even faster. ""There is no question our climate is changing,"" said Don Wuebbles, a climate scientist at the University of Illinois and a lead author of the assessment. ""It is changing at a factor of 10 times more than naturally."" Record-breaking heat – even at night – is expected to produce more drought and fuel larger and more frequent wildfires in the south-west, the report says. The north-east, midwest and Great Plains states will see an increase in heavy downpours and a greater risk of flooding. ""Parts of the country are getting wetter, parts are getting drier. All areas are getting hotter,"" said Virginia Burkett, chief scientist for global change at the US Geological Survey. ""The changes are not the same everywhere."" Those living on the Atlantic seaboard, Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska who have weathered the effects of sea level rise and storm surges can expect to see more. Residents of coastal cities, especially in Florida where there is already frequent flooding during rainstorms, can expect to see more. So can people living in inland cities sited on rivers. Some changes are already having a measurable effect on food production and public health, the report will say. John Balbus, senior adviser at the National Institute of Environmenal Health Science and a lead author of the NCA report, said rising temperatures increased the risk of heat stroke and heat-related deaths. Eugene Takle, convening lead author of the agriculture chapter of the NCA report, and director of the Climate Science programme at Iowa State University, said heatwaves and changes in rainfall had resulted in a levelling off in wheat and corn production and would eventually cause declines. In California, warmer winters have made it difficult to grow cherries. In the midwest, wetter springs have delayed planting. Invasive vines such as kudzu have spread northward, from the south to the Canadian border. Some of the effects on agriculture, such as a longer growing season, are positive. But Takle said: ""By mid-century and beyond the overall impacts will be increasingly negative on most crops and livestock."" The assessments are the American equivalent of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. This year's report for the first time looks at what America has done to fight climate change or protect people from its consequences in the future. Under an act of Congress the reports were supposed to be produced every four years, but no report was produced during George W Bush's presidency."
"No refugees please, we’re New Zealanders. That’s the message from New Zealand’s court of appeal. In a decision released last week the court endorsed earlier rulings that Ioana Teitiota – a Kiribati national – is not a climate change refugee. Teitiota, his wife and their children will be deported to Kiribati, where the court believes they can “resume their prior subsistence life with dignity”. Even if the Teitiota’s can reclaim some dignity, climate change will take it from them. The IPCC projects that the Pacific ocean will swallow most Kiribati by the end of this century. Life in Kiribati is life against the clock. There’s little dignity in that.  But before Kiribati sinks beneath the sea, ocean creep will make the islands uninhabitable. Sea level rise – coupled with more intense storm cycles – will contaminate the water table, pollute the small pockets of agricultural land and destroy homes and businesses. Tarawa, the main atoll, is a tiny sandstrip some six square miles in size. There is, quite literally, no escaping the misery climate change will cause.  The conditions for social unrest are manifest and the I-Kiribati know it. Density means disease and unrest spread quickly. There are 50,000 people tightly packed on Tarawa. The president, Anote Tong, is exploring options for mass migration. The idealist in me hoped the court of appeal would create an option for that mass migration. The realists on the court wouldn’t have a bar of that. Teitiota was not a refugee under 1A(2) of the refugee convention. The court conceded Teitiota was a refugee under a “sociological definition”, but not the legal definition.  The court approached the case as a threshold question: was “there a real chance of the refugee claimant being persecuted” and, if so, was “there a convention reason for that persecution”? Teitiota couldn’t satisfy the test.  The court took the orthodox position that persecution is primarily political and internal. There had to be a “violation” of human rights and a “failure” of state protection. Teitiota’s claim turned that definition on its head.  In essence, his claim held that the violation and failure was on the part of the international community. The persecution was external, not internal, and environmental, not political.  The decision reveals – in all its misery - the protection deficit in international law. A judicial decision is an uncodified statement of power relations. Never could there be a more unequal power relationship than here: on one side, the I-Kiribati and their sinking home, on the other the rigid machinery of international law. If Lord Diplock is right, then “law is about man’s duty to his neighbour”. That principle should underpin our approach to climate change and forced migration.  But the law doesn’t encompass all of our moral obligations. It’s clear that the international system isn’t fit for purpose. Let’s look past it to social resistance and political solutions. Science, as Naomi Klein argues, “is telling us to revolt”. Ordinary people need to put pressure on their governments to deal with climate change displacement. The missing link isn’t some new legal rule, but mass action. The history of the Pacific is a history of isolation, both physical and political. It’s that isolation that allowed the great powers to commit economic and military misadventures in the region, from depleting phosphate stocks in Kiribati and Naura to nuclear testing in French Polynesia and the Marshall Islands.  The social history of the Pacific is one of migration, from the early Austronesian and Polynesian expansions to the recent European settler migration. How can we say no to refugees when we are all migrants ourselves?"

" The UK's first carbon capture and storage (CCS) plants must be fast-tracked and get the go-ahead within a year, according to a report from MPs. It describes the technology, which traps the carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning and buries it, as “vital to limit climate change”. The MPs on the energy and climate change select committee (ECC) sharply criticised the government's botched £1bn competition for the first plants, which launched in 2007 and had to be restarted in 2011, after the last competitor withdrew.   Tim Yeo MP, chair of the ECC, said: “Fitting power stations with CCS is absolutely vital if we are to avoid dangerously destabilising the climate. After nearly a decade of delay, the Department of Energy and Climate Change has finally got near to delivering two pilot CCS projects in the UK. It must now fast-track these projects and reach final investment decisions before the election to ensure this technology can start delivering carbon savings by the 2020s.”  If the pilot projects go ahead they will fit CCS to a gas-fired power station in Peterhead and to the coal-fired power station at Drax in Yorkshire.  Yeo said the pilots would not be enough to kick-start the large CCS industry needed in the UK to cut carbon significantly and that other CCS projects must be made eligible for the guaranteed-price contracts being given to other low-carbon energy projects such as the proposed nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point and offshore wind farms.  Yeo added: “The CCS ‘competition’ the government launched has turned out to be a model example of how not to support a fledgling industry.”  The MPs said CCS was a vital technology because burning all existing fossil fuel reserves without capturing their emissions would drive global warming well above the 2C threshold that scientists describe as dangerous.  The report said the UK was very well placed to become a world leader in CCS because of its access to the North Sea, where CO2 could be buried in exhausted oil and gas fields. The UK's engineering expertise and the cross-party commitment to cutting carbon also helped, it said. Energy minister Michael Fallon said: “The UK is ahead of the rest of Europe with two CCS projects actively undertaking detailed engineering studies ahead of full construction."" He said CCS projects would be supported by long-term guaranteed-price contracts ""so it’s important we take the time to get our decisions right and follow a robust process"". But Tom Greatrex MP, Labour’s shadow energy minister, said: “The government attitude towards CCS has been one of damaging neglect. It appears to be uninterested in the enormous potential for CCS in the UK. In our efforts to decarbonise, CCS is not an option but a necessity.”  Professor Stuart Haszeldine, director of the Scottish CCS research group, said: “We all want a secure future, which includes low-carbon energy. Developing five CCS projects now will cost each UK household around £30 per year. The UK needs more than 30 of these to start building before 2025. To avoid extra costs later, we must develop our CO2 storage now. That is a good insurance premium against the 100% certainty of future carbon taxes and future global change.” Nick Molho, at WWF-UK, said demonstrating the feasibility of CCS is an urgent priority for the government: “But the government shouldn’t plan significant investments in new fossil fuel plants today on the assumption that CCS technology will be available at an affordable cost in the future when we simply don’t know that yet.”"
"One month ago, more than 100 North American climate scientists and I warned President Obama and Secretary Kerry that they should reject the proposed Keystone XL pipeline – indeed, that it would greaten the risk of dangerous and potentially irreversible climate changes. Soon thereafter, the administration delayed its long awaited decision on the pipeline – and its insurance of decades of dirty tar-sands extraction, further rises in greenhouse gas levels, and greater warming of the planet – to review the mounting evidence of environmental impacts ... and, perhaps, to hold off until after the mid-term elections. So why on earth is a group of US Senators – mostly Republicans, but a handful of Democrats, too – still trying to circumvent the approval process and double down on climate change-generating fossil fuels? The measure on standalone Congressional approval – a last-ditch effort by Senators beholden to fossil-fuel interests and the Koch Brothers, or simply afraid of being targeted by them during their re-election bids – now looks doomed to fail by a couple of votes, but the effort remains mystifying: ""Some of us who support it have a little trouble understanding why it's such a big deal,"" Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Lousiana said the other day. So allow me to clarify, since the answers still haven't gotten through, no matter how many times we scientists repeat them. Burning fossil fuels for energy over the past two centuries has now warmed the planet about 1 degree Celsius (about 1.5F), with at least another 0.5C of warming likely as global temperatures continue to rise in response to cumulative historical emissions. That leaves little wiggle room (about 0.5C) if we are to avoid crossing the 2-degrees Celsius warming mark deemed ""dangerous"" by many scientists studying the impacts of human-caused climate change. Even the White House is rolling out the red carpet for the facts: the National Climate Assessment, prepared by hundreds of my colleagues, was unveiled on Tuesday morning, warning that climate change has moved ""firmly into the present"", as Obama makes his most ambitious climate push in months. The UN secretary-general, Ban-Ki Moon, has called for a summit to make serious progress: ""If we do not take urgent action, all our plans for increased global prosperity and security will be undone,"" he said this week. ""We can avert these risks if we take bold, decisive action now,"" he writes in another Guardian op-ed today. Even the very conservative estimate of my climate scientist colleague Andrew Weaver, which by some gentle critiques leaves out extra fossil fuel emissions resulting from tar sands extraction, is dire: extracting and burning all of the Keystone-targeted oil would likely result in approximately 0.4C of additional warming. Add that to the observed 1C warming and the additional 0.5C committed warming, and we've only got about 0.1 degrees Celsius to spare before we hit that dangerous limit. Indeed, given the underlying uncertainties, those estimates could well lock in 2C warming – if not more. This is why my colleague James Hansen has characterized approval of the pipeline as tantamount to ""game over for the climate"". This is why the Congressional shell game should end, on the Senate floor, right away. To those elected officials who believe we should build the Keystone XL pipeline, I ask: Are you committed to keeping global warming below dangerous levels? If so, are you advocating for a moratorium on all other sources of fossil fuel energy? Are you ready for no more coal mining, no more natural gas extraction and no more oil drilling? Because that is what would likely be required if were to avoid truly dangerous changes to our climate and still approve the pipeline. Keystone is not ""a marginal thing"", as pundits argued as recently as Tuesday morning in calling for a compromise. This is not a marginal issue, nor one for compromise. When it comes to US energy policy, there is a worthy debate to be had about how we reduce our fossil fuel emissions while growing our economy and meeting our energy needs. What might be the role of natural gas and/or nuclear energy in the ""bridge"" we must build to a fossil fuel-free future? What instruments should we employ to price carbon emissions? Cap and trade? So-called ""fee and dividend""? Or how about the revenue-neutral carbon tax favored by Republicans like former congressman Bob Inglis, former George W Bush speechwriter David Frum and former Reagan Secretary of State George Schultz? Let us have that debate. But building the Keystone XL pipeline simply makes no sense. It represents an investment in infrastructure that will lock in decades of extraction of dirty, expensive fossil fuels at a time when we need to be rapidly pivoting away from a fossil fuel-driven energy economy – as rapidly as possible. I doubt that any of the remaining Keystone supporters in the Senate, Republican or Democrat, want their legacy to be a planet that they have fundamentally degraded for future generations. But that's what a ""yes"" vote on this week's vote will mean: the beginning of the end."

"James Meadway, a former UK government policy adviser at the Treasury, has criticised Chancellor George Osborne's claim that newly released GDP figures prove ""Britain is coming back."" He argues that the government's relentless pursuit of stringent austerity and expansion of household debt is reinforcing the risk of a major economic crash.  Currently a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation (Nef) in London, Meadway argues that the policies driving UK growth are fatally flawed: ""We are setting up… exactly the conditions that helped produce the crash of 2008: debt-led growth, in which stagnant or falling real earnings are masked by increasing levels of household debt that sustain continued consumer spending."" Despite the 0.8% increase in growth over the last quarter, current performance indicates that manufacturing output ""will not recover to its 2008 level before 2019."" With average earnings rising at a rate of 1.4%, and the Consumer Price Index's inflation figures ignoring the large cost of housing at around 40% of household income, real inflation ""is now running at 2.5% a year, well ahead of increases in earnings… ""The fall in real earnings since 2008 is the longest sustained decline in most people's living standards since the 1870s."" This situation is likely to continue. As the government's Office of Budget Responsibility forecasts, real earnings will fall ""virtually every year until 2018."" The fall in real earnings has accompanied increasing inequality, impacting detrimentally on health, well-being and crime rates. Data from the European Quality of Life Survey finds that between 2007 and 2011, the well-being of the richest quarter of Britons rose, while dropping for the poorest quarter. In the meantime, while real earnings are falling, household spending has experienced ""the fastest rate of growth since 2007"" – sustained by ""falling savings and a return to borrowing."" This has fuelled a London-centric property bubble that favours the wealthy. With levels of UK public sector debt topping £1.2 trillion, Osborne has borrowed more in the last 5 years than Labour did throughout its 13 years in government, having left Britain at $0.8 trillion in debt. At the end of last year, outstanding personal UK debt stood at £1.4 trillion, and outstanding mortgage debt at £1.3 trillion. Total household debt is predicted to increase to £2.2 trillion by 2019. The problem, Meadway told me, is that as with the 2008 banking collapse:  ""The danger of another crash certainly increases the more debt is being created. It looks like, at present, that the UK's household sector could become the weak link in all this – if earnings do not pick up, the sheer mass of accumulated debt, with the need to service (to repay and pay interest) could start to present problems. So if the recovery follows its current course, the possibility of such a domestically-generated crash will rise."" According to a new report by economist Dr Jo Michell of the University of the West of England's Bristol Business School, projections using the Cambridge Alphametrics macro-economic policy model (CAM) show that ""this growth strategy cannot be sustained."" The misnamed 'recovery' is merely ""a return to the debt-led and consumption-driven growth of the pre-crisis era… ""The government appears determined to press ahead with a policy programme designed to reproduce and reinforce the imbalances which proved so deadly in 2008. But [Osborne's] reliance on the indebtedness of the household sector to maintain GDP growth rates is fundamentally unsustainable. One way or another, the current trajectory will come to an end."" This is compounded by looming energy challenges. Since 2010, UK household energy bills have risen by 40%, a trend that is likely to continue under the government's current energy policies focusing on shale gas. ""North Sea gas has depleted far faster than was bargained for in the early 1990s, and Norwegian supplies are also under severe pressure,"" said Meadway.  ""Reuters research has suggested that we will start having to import from Russia in 2015 – indeed, we already buy 40% of our coal for electricity production from Russian sources. Fracking, as Lord Browne has acknowledged, is unlikely to produce reductions in fuel bills, since unlike the US the gas price here is set by conditions on the European market, not production conditions in the UK."" The role of energy crisis in sparking recession is ignored by conventional economic models. However, American economist Prof James Hamilton of the University of California has modelled the link between oil prices and US recessions – including the 2008 crash – in a study for the US Congressional Joint Economic Committee. Prof Hamilton concluded that the collapse of the housing bubble was triggered by the post-2005 oil price shocks which escalated cost of living and induced sweeping consumer debt-defaults. If the views of oil industry insiders like Jeremy Leggett are correct – who says that as industry reserve estimates are being systematically exaggerated we could face the risk of a major oil crash over the next five to six years – then the UK's unsustainable growth trajectory could unravel sooner rather than later. The concern that continued dependence on fossil fuels could derail the economy is supported by a report from the UK Energy Research Centre released yesterday. The report states that the government's apparent insistence on ""scaling back the UK's low carbon ambitions"" would prolong ""the exposure of consumers and the UK economy to the potential impacts of high fossil fuel prices."" Unfortunately, this is only one factor among many ignored by the government's economic modelling on climate policy. A new peer-reviewed report by Harvard economist Dr Frank Ackerman and energy consultant Joseph Daniel, commissioned by Friends of the Earth and the World Wildlife Fund, exposes how the Treasury's slanted 'Computable General Equilibrium' (CGE) model systematically underestimates the economic gains, health benefits and job-creation potential of a low carbon transition.  ""An approach that ignores all these benefits - as the HMRC CGE model does - is sure to misunderstand the real economics of climate policy,"" said Ackerman. ""A person who chooses to wear a blindfold will often report that there is nothing to see, but this tells us more about the viewer than his surroundings."" In this context, Friends of the Earth economics campaigner David Powell questioned the usefulness of GDP as a meaningful measure of economic success:  ""Let's assume climate change is real and it's a problem - and that we either get fossil fuels out of our economy, or we burn them with abandon and suffer crippling social and economic side effects. Either way, growth in the future is going to have to mean something qualitatively different: growth in what? Future generations may well consider it borderline barbaric to have put slivers of GDP here or there today, above a genuinely healthy economy for the long haul."" I asked ex-Treasury adviser James Meadway what, if anything, could be done to achieve a healthier economy. He suggested three key strategies:  ""End austerity, both to end its social impact and to support local demand; break up the major banks, setting up accountable regional and local institutions with clear mandates to provide socially responsible credit; and invest heavily in green infrastructure, including the promotion of community-owned wind farms, micro-hydro, and other renewable energy projects, along with a German-style home insulation scheme. What you're aiming for is to set up robust local and regional economies that do not depend on the Westminster-City hub to sustain themselves.""

"If the fossil fuel industry made fancy ice cream, what flavour would it be? Maybe a dollop of Triple Fossil Ripple with luscious layers of coal, gas and shale oil? How about a bowl of Lignite Wonderland? Anyone for Coal Briquette Cookie Dough? Would you be tempted by the slick marketing of that tub of Clean Coal Fantasy Truffle, only to find the tub is entirely empty?  Can we entice you with our Cool Blue Ocean Acidifier with a topping of crumbled reef coral? You'd have to presume that were any of these flavours actually real, they'd be going straight into Andrew Powell's freezer.  Powell is the Liberal environment minister in the coal-friendly state of Queensland in Australia, where a propaganda war is currently playing out. Powell has called on Australians to boycott the Unilever-owned Ben & Jerry's ice-cream brand for its very public and active support of a campaign to ""raise awareness"" of how the Great Barrier Reef is ""at serious risk from intensive dredging, mega ports and shipping highways"". In January, final approvals were granted to dump three million cubic metres of dredged ocean bottom into the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to make way for a new coal terminal. In a press conference, Powell presented a media release and told reporters: ""The only people taking a scoop out of the reef are Ben and Jerry's and Unilever. If you understand the facts, you'd want to be boycotting Ben and Jerry's."" The WWF-Australia campaign that Ben & Jerry's backed was ""scandalous"", Powell said, and was a ""campaign of lies and deceit"". Powell's call for a boycott comes with mine-sized scoops of irony, given his own party is interested in changing consumer law to ban environment groups from calling for products or companies to be boycotted. The campaign in question is called Fight For The Reef and is being run by WWF-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (Greenpeace also has its own campaign flavour - Save The Reef). In a response to these campaigns, the Queensland Resources Council representing mining and fossil fuel companies last week launched television adverts. Over footage of the reef, the voiceover says: ""The Great Barrier Reef has lost almost half its coral cover. The culprits are storms (48 per cent), crown of thorns starfish (42 per cent) and coral bleaching (10 per cent). Not shipping and not ports. The reef facts are clear."" The advert cites a 2012 study from the Government-backed Australian Institute of Marine Science, published in the leading US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. The study did say that storms, starfish attacks and coral bleaching were responsible for the dramatic loss of coral cover on the reef.   But what's causing the Crown of Thorns (COTS) outbreaks and what else did the study say? I'm going to cite lots of it because this is the study the mining industry is trying to claim backs its case (my bolding). GBR has been subject to severe disturbances, including COTS outbreaks, mass coral bleaching and declining growth rates of coral due to increasing seawater temperatures, terrestrial runoff, tropical cyclones, and coral diseases... There is also strong evidence that water quality affects the frequency of COTS outbreaks in the central and southern GBR… The recent frequency and intensity of mass coral bleaching are of major concern, and are directly attributable to rising atmospheric greenhouse gases. To date, the GBR has lost fewer corals to bleaching and diseases than many other regions in the world, but bleaching mortality will almost certainly increase in the GBR, given the upward trend in temperatures... Without significant changes to the rates of disturbance and coral growth, coral cover in the central and southern regions of the GBR is likely to decline to 5–10% by 2022. The future of the GBR therefore depends on decisive action. Although world governments continue to debate the need to cap greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the local and regional pressures is one way to strengthen the natural resilience of ecosystems… If this is a study the mining and resources industry thinks backs its plans for increasing exports of fossil fuels, then I would hate to see a report that doesn't. I asked James Cook University's Professor Terry Hughes, a director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, for his view on the adverts. He told me: It is not scientifically accurate to claim that cyclones are killing off the Reef. The real issue is to ask, why are reefs away from people still perfectly able to recover from cyclones, as they always have, while polluted reefs nearer to the coast are in rapid decline? Pollution is the culprit, not cyclones which are part of the natural dynamic of the Reef. Killing starfish is akin to swatting a locust storm with a butterfly net. The only lasting solution is to reduce runoff and ban dredging and dumping anywhere near the GBR World Heritage Area. The QRC ads make no mention of the impact of burning coal and gas on greenhouse gas emissions, on climate change and on the vulnerability of coral reefs to rising temperatures and ocean acidification. An experimental study, also published in the PNAS journal last year, has recreated the kind of conditions Great Barrier Reef corals will have to cope with as waters warm and the oceans become more acidic. I've seen this experiment first hand. Healthy reef organisms become collections of slimy, dead and bleached corals.  Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland's Global Change Institute, has been researching on the reef for 25 years. He told me the mining industry adverts ""don't tell the full story"", adding:  The resilience of the reef is very much in the hands of water quality. The ability of the reef to grow back after COTS events and cyclones is essentially indexed to how well corals are growing. We already have higher levels of pollutants along the coastline and so the ability of the corals to bounce back is highly compromised. Anything that leads to reduction of growth and the ability of corals to bounce back from disturbances – and that includes dredging and port development – presents a real conundrum on the issue of keeping the reef healthy while at the same time as trying to export these commodities which themselves have an impact on climate. It's a lose lose situation all the way. Hoegh-Guldberg said it was ""not accurate"" to claim there had been no studies linking ports and shipping to a reduction in environmental quality on the reef.  As one example, he pointed to the 2003 Productivity Commission report into the reef. A section on ""port activity"" says: Various potential water quality issues can arise from port and shipping activities, including those due to: dredging of channels and berths (which can result in short-term turbidity) and placement of dredged material at sea; runoff from land (including stormwater from product stockpiles and partially developed sites); reclamation of habitats (wetlands), with potential implications for runoff; antifouling paints and waste discharge from ships; and shipping incidents and accidents, and marine oil spills. The report does list a number of management practices that can mitigate the problems, but it does not consider (or even mention) the impacts of climate change being driven by the fossil fuels flowing through the port developments. To claim that ice creams are an enemy of the reef but building ports and encouraging fossil fuel burning are not, is a whole tub of something – and it's not triple chocolate."
"Increasing evidence is emerging that the policy summaries on climate impacts and mitigation by the UN Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were significantly 'diluted' under political pressure from some of the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, including Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil and the United States. Several experts familiar with the IPCC government approval process for the 'Summary for Policymakers' (SPM) reports – documents summarising the thousands of pages of technical and scientific reports for government officials – have spoken out about their distortion due to political interests.   According to David Wasdell, who leads on feedback dynamics in coupled complex global systems for the European Commission's Global System Dynamics and Policy (GSDP) network, ""Every word and line of the text previously submitted by the scientific community was examined and amended until it could be endorsed unanimously by the political representatives.""  In a detailed paper critiquing the WG1 Summary for Policymakers, Wasdell revealed that:  ""Greatest pressure to establish grounds for the highest possible budget came from those countries whose national economy, political power and social stability depend on sustaining the asset value and production revenue derived from exploitation of their resources of fossil energy. Additional pressure was applied to the political agents by those vested interests whose sustained profitability was based on the extraction, refining, marketing and use of fossil energy as the ground of the global economy."" As an accredited reviewer for the IPCC's 2007 Fourth Assessment Report, Wasdell had previously criticised the political approval process for playing down amplifying feedbacks which could accelerate climate change. That charge was strongly denied by the IPCC's lead authors at the time, although political interference amounting to ""scientific vandalism"" was alleged by other sources. Wasdell told me that scientists familiar with the political approval process in Stockholm for the new WG1 Summary for Policymakers - including WG1 co-chair Prof Thomas Stocker who had signed the 2007 rejoinder to Wasdell - had confirmed that governments fought to amend text that would damage their perceived interests. His paper says: ""… the objections were led by Saudi Arabia, strongly supported by China, and associated with an emerging group of 'like-minded nations.' The impasse was broken following suggested modifications of both text and diagram provided by the representatives of the USA. The resulting compromise safeguards the vested interests of global dependency on fossil sources of energy, while constraining the capacity of the international community to take any effective action to deal with the threat of dangerous climate change."" WG1 co-chair Prof Thomas Stocker, however, denied any knowledge of such political pressure, describing these allegations as ""not correct for WG1."" He conceded that ""the situation is different"" for WG2 and WG3. Wasdell said that the draft submitted by scientists contained a metric projecting cumulative total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, on the basis of which a 'carbon budget' was estimated – the quantity of carbon that could be safely emitted without breaching the 2 degrees Celsius limit to avoid dangerous global warming. He said that the final version approved by governments significantly amended the original metric to increase the amount of carbon that could still be emitted. The total carbon budget according to this estimate is about 1,000 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC) – although over 531 GtC was emitted already by 2011, leaving 469 GtC left. Applying the ""corrected non-linear function"" reduces this available budget to just ""280 GtC"" – this figure does not account for the role of greenhouse gases other than CO2, including the potential impact of thawing permafrost or methane hydrates.  If included, they would reduce the budget even further. Current emissions reduction pledges, therefore, still guarantee disaster. His paper reads:  ""… present levels of international contribution towards the reduction of emissions still led to a cumulative total of 2000 GtC by the year 2100. That left an emissions reduction gap of some 1097 GtC between promised reductions and the 903 GtC required to prevent temperature increase exceeding the policy goal of 2°C."" Wasdell thus told me: ""The summary for policymakers is a document of appeasement, not fit for purpose. In reality, if my calculations are correct, we not only don't have much of a carbon budget left, we have already overshot that budget – we're in overdraft.""  Wasdell's claims about the politicisation of the IPCC's summary reports for policymakers are corroborated by other scientists.  In a letter addressed to senior IPCC chairs dated 17th April, Prof Robert Stavins - a lead author for the IPCC's Working Group 3 focusing on climate mitigation - complained of his ""frustration"" that the government approval process ""built political credibility by sacrificing scientific integrity."" His critique was, however, widely misrepresented by climate deniers as proving that the IPCC's scientific verdict about the dangers of global warming are too alarmist.  Leading the pack, Daily Mail reporter David Rose attempted to equate Stavins' concerns with those of economist Richard Tol, who withdrew ""from the summary of an earlier volume of the full IPCC report, on the grounds it had been 'sexed up' by the same government officials and had become overly 'alarmist.'""  Yet as noted by Dimitri Zenghelis, principal research fellow at the London School of Economics Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, Tol's claims about alarmism in the Stern review on the economics of climate change contain a number of ""significant errors and misrepresentations,"" ""selective"" and ""misleading"" quoting, and are based on his own paper containing ""a number of mistakes"", as well as a ""fundamentally flawed"" understanding of ""the risks of climate change.""  The IPCC's assessments of the potential costs of climate change ""is probably an underestimate,"" argued Zenghelis, ""because it omits consideration of many of the impacts of climate change, including potentially catastrophic risks."" Prof Stavins himself dismissed the denialist ""fringe elements of the press and blogosphere"" which ""capitalised on the situation by distorting the message of my original post to meet their own objectives."" ""My expressed concerns,"" Stavins told me, ""were about the government approval process of one section on international cooperation of the Working Group 3 Summary for Policymakers."" He emphasised: ""My remarks did not include any comments on and have no implications regarding the integrity of climate science."" Rather, government representatives in Berlin sought to ""protect their respective countries' interests by minimising text that could be perceived to be inconsistent with their negotiating positions.""  Stavins' remarks were also backed up by Oxford University's Prof John Broome, a IPCC WG3 lead author: ""At our IPCC meeting, they treated the SPM as though it were a legal document rather than a scientific report. To achieve consensus, the text of the SPM was made vaguer in many places, and its content diluted to the extent that in some places not much substance remained."" Far from being too alarmist, these criticisms suggest that the IPCC's summary reports are too conservative. Like Wasdell, Broome describes how ""a coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia"" at the April approval session in Berlin ""insisted"" that all ""figures"" depicting increases of greenhouse gas emissions in countries classified by 'income group' ""should be deleted."" Saudi Arabia, he said, also ""wanted to delete all references to any part of the main report that mentioned income groups… in the end Saudi Arabia got its way completely.""  According to the Sydney Morning Herald, other countries leading the drive to dilute the document included China, Brazil and the United States.

"Droughts across southern Australia are to continue increasing as the Roaring Forties get stronger and closer to Antarctica, a study has found. It also explains why Antarctica is bucking the global warming trend. Australian National University researchers looked at the past 1,000 years of Southern Ocean winds for the first time, along with ice core samples and South American tree rings and lakes.  They found increasing greenhouse gases were strengthening the Southern Ocean’s Roaring Forties – known as the Southern Annual Mode (SAM) – that delivered rains to southern Australia. They also found the winds were tightening in over Antarctica. “As the westerly winds are getting tighter, they’re actually trapping more of the cold air over Antarctica,” said lead researcher Nerilie Abram.  “This is why Antarctica has bucked the trend. Every other continent is warming, and the Arctic is warming fastest of anywhere on Earth.” This resulted in the decreasing rainfall across southern Australia, particularly in Western Australia. “This isn't good news for farmers in southern Australia who are reliant on winter rains,” said the report, published on Monday in Nature Climate Change.  The southern region of Western Australia had a 20% decline in rainfall since the 1960s, said Abram. “The rainfall there has such a strong influence from what’s being thrown up at it by the Southern Ocean. On the south-eastern side, we have a real interaction of the different climate modes. On the east side, we also have a very strong influence from tropical climate modes like El Nino.” A reconstruction of the SAM showed a 1000-year perspective and gave context to the only other records available that showed prominent increases in wind strength beyond natural variability since the middle of last century, but no further back.  “This is what gives us a really good indicator that greenhouse gases are what’s causing the winds to intensify. “On average, the strength of the SAM is now at its highest positive value – stronger and closer to Antarctica than they have been at any time over the last 1000 years,” she said. The winds moved between two and five degrees closer to the South Pole in the past half century alone. “These winds have been changing over the last few decades and that’s one of the reasons we’ve been having such severe droughts,” said Abram. The researchers explained that while greenhouse gases impacted mostly in the winter, during summer and spring months the SAM was influenced strongly by depletions in the ozone layer.  As the hole in the ozone layer appeared to be repairing itself – thanks in part to the fall in the use of harmful substances – the greenhouse gas effect was the main cause for concern. The alterations in the SAM were only slightly mirrored by its northern counterpart, Professor Matthew England from the University of New South Wales' Climate Change Research Centre said. “As we increase greenhouse gases, different parts of the planet warm differently,” he said. “The northern hemisphere is continent dominated. In the south we have ocean dominated regions and they don’t warm in consistent ways.” The researchers said all signs pointed to a continuing increase in these winds, and further concentration over Antarctica, unless greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were reduced. “The SAM seems to be one part of the weather system which responds quite rapidly,” England told Guardian Australia. “Unlike things like glacial melt – that’s really hard to slow down – with the SAM it seems you get a payback for reducing your emissions on a quick time scale.”"
"Over $1tn is being gambled on high-cost oil projects that will never see a return if the world's governments fulfil their pledge to tackle climate change, according to a new report. The Carbon Tracker Initiative (CTI) research found that $1.1tn of capital expenditure is expected in the next decade in expensive oil sands, deepwater and Arctic projects but that this investment will be lost if policymakers agree to slash carbon emissions. ""This risk analysis shows that many oil companies are betting on a high demand and price scenario,"" said James Leaton, research director at CTI and a former PwC consultant. ""Investors need to [challenge oil company strategies] to ensure capital is not being wasted."" Previous CTI research has shown that about two-thirds of existing fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned if global warming is to be limited to 2C, as agreed by the world's nations. The new work connects the economics of oil production with the limit on carbon emissions needed to avoid dangerous climate change. It found that only the oil expected to cost less than $75 a barrel to produce, much of which is from conventional onshore wells, can be burned within the planet's 'carbon budget'. The analysts found even when focusing only on the high-cost end – oil costing more than $95 a barrel – $1.1tn was at risk from 2014-2025. Looking further ahead, to 2050, CTI estimated $21tn worth of high-cost oil projects could be wasted. The region with the highest risk of wasted capital in the report was Alberta. Canada's vast oil sands province is expected to see $400bn of investment by 2025. The companies with the biggest exposure to risk there are Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Suncor and Shell. Deepwater oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico and off Brazil were also seen as high risk, with ExxonMobil and Petrobras set to invest $100bn each. Ultra-deepwater projects, which drill in ocean depths greater than 1500m, expose Total and BP to the risk of capital being wasted, the report concludes. In the Arctic, Statoil were most exposed, with $22bn capital expenditure projected by 2025. The report also found that high cost (more than$80/barrel), high carbon projects comprised between a fifth and a quarter of the total capital expenditure expected by the major international oil companies in the next 10 years, with Total at 28% and BP at 18%. But at least a dozen, multi-billion-dollar independent oil companies had at 85-100% of their capex targeted at high cost projects. ""They are betting the farm on a high oil price,"" said Leaton. The report concluded: ""Gambling on a $95 per barrel oil price on behalf of shareholders is risky given that oil prices have dropped to $40 per barrel twice in the last decade. Demand for oil could be impacted by a range of future issues, such as the increasing constraints on emissions [through climate policies], efficiency gains, improvements in technology, and slowdown in the Chinese economy."" Paul Spedding, a former-HSBC oil and gas sector analyst, said: ""Many investors are concerned about the growing amount of capital that the oil companies have thrown at low return, carbon heavy projects. The strategies need to be challenged. If this means lower capital investment and higher dividends or buybacks, so much the better."" Craig MacKenzie, investment director at Aberdeen Asset Management, said that unlike Carbon Tracker's previous work on unburnable carbon, the new report dealt with how much demand there may be for oil. ""Oil analysts think about demand all the time, so it feeds into the very lively debate about oil prices. This kind of debate now has real traction with investors,"" he said. MacKenzie added: ""If you look at the return on capital from the majors over the last five years it has been very dissappointing: it has fallen by a third and is now barely covering costs. They need to avoid big splurges of capital on projects that may not pay off. But there has been a sea change in the last year with companies focussing more on shareholder value and not on the volume of oil produced."" Investors managing trillions of dollars have already begun pressing fossil fuel companies to set out their strategies to manage the risk that oil, gas and coal burning may be restricted in the future. But recently ExxonMobil said it thought it was ""highly unlikely"" that the world would cut carbon emissions enough in order to tackle dangerous climate change. ""ExxonMobil's attitude that the risk of climate action is near zero seems an irresponsible attitude to risk management to me,"" said Anthony Hobley, CEO of CTI. The new CTI report was welcomed by Christiana Figueres, the UN's top climate diplomat tasked with delivering a global agreement to cut carbon emissions by 2015. ""It enhances the ability of investors to hedge against risks and capture rewards in a carbon-constrained world,"" she said. Figueres also backed the growing campaign to pressure universities, municipalities and other large fund managers to sell off their shares in fossil fuel companies. ""Divestment may be a question of morality, but it is prudent too,"" she wrote in the Guardian on Wednesday. In April, Nobel peace prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for an anti-apartheid-style boycott and disinvestment campaign against the fossil fuel industry."
"A late correction.  Both Guardian CCS articles today make the mistake of stating that CCS will be fitted to the existing 4000 MW Drax Power Station. In fact the proposal is to build a smaller 400 MW coal-fired plant alongside to demonstrate a CCS variant known as oxyfuel combustion. You can read more at www.whiteroseccs.co.uk The gas-fired Peterhead project is demonstrating another alternative CCS technology called post-combustion capture. If proven, both these CCS variants could be used on a wide range of power plants and industrial plants (cement, steel) and it is those technology variants that is the important element of the proposals, not the type of the plant it is fitted to in the two demonstrations at White Rose and Peterhead.  A third CCS variant called pre-combustion capture is also being proposed elsewhere in the world for demonstration projects. "

"With the release of the fifth report by the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate change, calls for the international community to once and for all transcend its divisions and get serious at last about climate change have multiplied. The content of the report is nothing less than frightful: global warming has been occurring since the middle of the 20th century at an unprecedented rate, already engendering all sorts of disasters. No doubt is permitted as to the principal cause of the phenomenon: mankind. This changes everything, to quote the title of Naomi Klein's forthcoming book. Because climate change will affect all of humanity, it renders past conflicts and traditional political categories – left and right among them – obsolete. Well, this widespread ecological consensus isn't getting us anywhere, and it will certainly not help us fight climate change effectively. The environmental crisis is not brought about by an endless proclivity of mankind to destroy its environment and deplete natural resources, as Jared Diamond, among others, would make us believe in his neo-Malthusian bestsellers. It finds its origin in the logic of a quite recent system, one that was born in the 19th century: industrial capitalism.  Capitalism is productivist, ie it seeks to increase productivity indefinitely (it has no embedded self-limiting mechanism). Moreover, it is predatory, programmed to exploit and exhaust natural resources and biodiversity. Finally, it is irreparably tied to a carbon – coal, oil and gas – energy system. To use the words of German Marxist Elmar Altvater, industrial capitalism is necessarily fossil capitalism. All three features combine to give way to the dreadful situation described by the IPCC report. This is exactly why the environmental crisis doesn't render past conflicts and divisions obsolete, but on the contrary reinforces them. Climate change doesn't change anything, it rather worsens existing problems. To paraphrase a famous dictum by Lenin, it is the highest stage of capitalism. With climate change, a long-standing form of inequality is becoming more and more visible: environmental inequalities. These refer to inequalities that different segments of the population – class, gender, racial groups – experience in their relationship with nature, and more specifically with regard to the effects of climate change. They have existed since the dawn of capitalism. Yet they haven't been as much advertised as other forms of inequalities, especially by the workers' movement. The environmental crisis, as the IPCC report recognises, is rapidly worsening them. Environmental inequalities are manifold: your chances of being exposed to pollutions or toxic waste, for example, are much greater if you belong to the working class, or to a racial minority, whatever the country you live in. Similarly, natural or industrial risks are unequally distributed among the population, since flood-prone areas or neighbourhoods adjacent to chemical plants will typically be cheaper, and hence attract poorer families. Of course, there are exceptions, but the overall picture is clear. Energy poverty is a classic example of environmental inequality. In Greece, for instance, to heat an average-sized apartment with fuel will cost around €1,000 a year. With wood, this figure falls to €250. The devastating economic crisis that began in 2008 led many Greeks to choose the latter solution. This, however, has caused a steep increase in illegal cutting of wood, which has accelerated deforestation. At the same time, austerity measures imposed on the country by the European Union forced the government to sack many forest rangers, which facilitated illegal cutting, and hence deforestation. As a consequence of the increase in wood-heating, air pollution in Athens has risen more than 15% since the beginning of the crisis. As is clear from this example, the economic and the environmental crisis are in fact one and the same crisis. Environmental inequalities not only exist inside countries, but between countries or regions of the world. ""Ecological debt"" is a notion social movements from the global south have put forward in the past years. By exploiting their natural resources, and hence by durably damaging their environment, industrialised countries owe a huge debt to countries of the south. This ecological debt is much bigger than the financial debt the south supposedly owes the north. Taking it into account would completely transform the way we think about the global economy. In sum, if capital is a social relation, as Karl Marx wrote, we should conceive of nature as part of this relation. In addition to class, gender and racial inequalities capitalism generates environmental inequalities. The relationship between these forms of inequalities is complex. Sometimes, two (or more) of them will combine to give way to a particular outcome, say environmental racism, ie the combination of environmental and racial inequality. Environmental racism was denounced by the environmental justice movement in the US at the beginning of the 1980s. In other cases, one sort of inequality will mask another, as in the conflict in Darfur, which is often presented as an ethnic conflict, but is in fact caused – at least in good part – by climate change, as UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has recognised. Under capitalism, inequalities have a cumulative dimension: the more you suffer from one sort of inequality, the greater the chances are you will suffer from another one. Intersectionality has been a major theme in contemporary critical theory. It refers to the fact that some individuals or groups, say black women or poor homosexuals, experience multiple forms of domination at once. To the intersection of race, class and gender inequalities, we should now add a fourth dimension: the environment. The climate crisis, no doubt, will increase the weight of this factor in the decades to come. What does this tell us about the fight against climate change? If the IPCC report admits that the environmental crisis will not be felt equally across the population, it didn't push the argument until its logical political conclusion. Because they are concretely experienced in the daily lives of individuals, environmental inequalities represent a powerful lever of mobilisation against climate change. Instead of abstract calls for the international community to act, what should be stressed is the differential impact of the climate crisis on populations. Hence division, not unity, is the key to winning this battle. Using environmental inequalities as a mobilising lever presents the further advantage of bringing the discussion directly to the core of the matter: the productivist, predatory and fossil logic of capitalism."

"Roy Spencer is one of the less than 3% of climate scientists whose research suggests that humans are playing a relatively minimal role in global warming. As one of those rare contrarian climate experts, he's often asked to testify before US Congress and interviewed by media outlets that want to present a 'skeptical' or false balance climate narrative. He's also a rather controversial figure, having made remarks about ""global warming Nazis"" and said, ""I view my job a little like a legislator, supported by the taxpayer, to protect the interests of the taxpayer and to minimize the role of government.""  In any case, as one of those rare contrarian climate scientists, Spencer is in a good position to present the best arguments against the global warming consensus. Conveniently, he recently did just that on his blog, listing what he considers the ""Top Ten Good Skeptical Arguments,"" throwing in an 11th for good measure. He also conveniently posed each of these arguments as questions; it turns out they're all easy to answer. 1) No Recent Warming. If global warming science is so ""settled"", why did global warming stop 15 years ago, contrary to all ""consensus"" predictions? Quite simply, it hasn't. Even global surface temperatures (which is how Spencer is likely measuring 'global warming', although they only account for about 2% of the Earth's warming), have warmed about 0.2°C over the past 15 years, according to the best available measurements. More importantly, the planet has continued to accumulate heat at a rate equivalent to 4 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations per second over the past 15 years. 2) Natural or Manmade? If we don't know how much of recent warming is natural, then how can we know how much is manmade? We do.  The IPCC stated with 95% confidence that most of the global warming since 1950 is human-caused, with a best estimate that 100% is due to humans over the past 60 years. The IPCC was able to draw this conclusion with such high confidence because that's what the scientific evidence and research clearly and consistently concludes. 3) IPCC Politics and Beliefs. Why does it take a political body (the IPCC) to tell us what scientists ""believe""? And when did scientists' ""beliefs"" translate into proof? And when was scientific truth determined by a vote…especially when those allowed to vote are from the Global Warming Believers Party? The IPCC merely organizes the world's top climate scientists every 5 to 7 years. It's those scientists who summarize the up-to-date status of the scientific research in their respective fields of expertise. The IPCC report and the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming are themselves not proof of anything. They summarize and reflect the scientific evidence – that vast body of evidence is the reason the consensus exists. 4) Climate Models Can't Even Hindcast. How did climate modelers, who already knew the answer, still fail to explain the lack of a significant temperature rise over the last 30+ years? In other words, how to you botch a hindcast? Global surface temperatures have risen more than 0.5°C over the past 30 years. That rise is significant, both in the statistical and figurative sense. Climate models have accurately reproduced that rise. 5) …But We Should Believe Model Forecasts? Why should we believe model predictions of the future, when they can't even explain the past? Climate models have accurately reproduced the past, but let's put them aside for a moment. We don't need climate models to project future global warming. We know from past climate change events the planet will warm between about 1.5 and 4.5°C from the increased greenhouse effect of a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (the 'climate sensitivity').  In a business-as-usual scenario, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are expected to surpass 900 ppm by 2100 – that's close to two doublings from the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm. Hence we know that business-as-usual will cause between 2.5 and 7.5°C (most likely 5°C) warming if we stop carbon dioxide levels from rising beyond about 900 ppm. This is based on simple math and what we know about the physics of the climate – no fancy models needed. 6) Modelers Lie About Their ""Physics"". Why do modelers insist their models are based upon established physics, but then hide the fact that the strong warming their models produce is actually based upon very uncertain ""fudge factor"" tuning? Putting aside the accusation that hundreds of climate modelers are all liars – the answer is that their models are indeed based upon well established physics. NASA climate modeler Gavin Schmidt's TED talk on the subject is well worth watching. Spencer's question likely refers to the uncertain size of the cooling influence of aerosols. However, that is a physical uncertainty. We don't have very good measurements of this effect; unfortunately the rocket carrying NASA's Glory satellite that had instruments to measure the climate effect of aerosols crashed two years ago. Nevertheless, climate models use the available data to account for their influence, and their projections include the associated uncertainties. 7) Is Warming Even Bad? Who decided that a small amount of warming is necessarily a bad thing? We're headed for about 5°C global surface warming above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100 if we continue on a business-as-usual path. 5°C is the difference between average temperatures now and those during the last ice age. That's not ""small"" by any stretch of the imagination. As for who decided that amount warming is a bad thing – climate scientists researching the impacts of climate change. 8) Is CO2 Bad? How did carbon dioxide, necessary for life on Earth and only 4 parts in 10,000 of our atmosphere, get rebranded as some sort of dangerous gas? Carbon dioxide itself is not ""bad."" Water is also necessary for life. Too much water will kill you. Too much carbon dioxide causes dangerous climate change. Greenhouse gases were determined to be pollutants as defined in the US Clean Air Act . This was a ruling of the (politically conservative) US Supreme Court. 9) Do We Look that Stupid? How do scientists expect to be taken seriously when their ""theory"" is supported by both floods AND droughts? Too much snow AND too little snow? This question is a bit like asking, ""Do I look fat?"". Do you want an honest answer? The warming of the atmosphere, happening especially at high latitudes, reduces the temperature difference between higher and lower latitudes. This tends to make storms move more slowly. This results in storms dumping more precipitation in localized areas, which causes more flooding in those areas and droughts outside of them. Higher temperatures also increase evaporation, exacerbating droughts and adding more moisture to the air for stronger storms. A climate scientist should understand these concepts. 10) Selective Pseudo-Explanations. How can scientists claim that the Medieval Warm Period (which lasted hundreds of years), was just a regional fluke…yet claim the single-summer (2003) heat wave in Europe had global significance? There is no contradiction here – a regional event can have global significance, for example via economic impacts. In any case, the Medieval Warm Period was a regional phenomenon and the planet as a whole was cooler than today. 11) (Spinal Tap bonus) Just How Warm is it, Really? Why is it that every subsequent modification/adjustment to the global thermometer data leads to even more warming? What are the chances of that? Either a warmer-still present, or cooling down the past, both of which produce a greater warming trend over time. And none of the adjustments take out a gradual urban heat island (UHI) warming around thermometer sites, which likely exists at virtually all of them — because no one yet knows a good way to do that. Ironically, most of the adjustments to Spencer's own satellite temperature data set have been in the warming direction, so this question may be an example of psychological projection. Scientists also recently identified a problem in Arctic temperature data analysis that's leading to an incorrect adjustment in the cooling direction, and there have of course been other cooling adjustments in the surface temperature record. The urban heat island effect has also been demonstrated over and over to have no significant influence on the surface temperature record. You may have noticed some patterns in these questions. Most are based on false premises and are trivially simple to answer. These 'top ten good skeptic arguments' are frankly not very good or challenging. They also reveal a very one-sided skepticism, although to his credit Spencer did also list 10 'skeptic' arguments that don't hold water. These are glaringly wrong arguments like 'there is no greenhouse effect' and 'CO2 cools the atmosphere,' that some contrarians nevertheless believe. Interestingly, Spencer discusses the science disproving the 10 bad arguments, but there's no scientific discussion supporting his to 'good' arguments. From reading and answering Spencer's questions, we learn that the basic science behind how we know humans are causing global warming and that it's a problem are quite well-established. There are some remaining uncertainties, like how much warming is being offset by aerosol cooling, but overall we have a very strong understanding of the big picture. For quite a while now we've understood the Earth's climate well enough to know that we can't continue on our current high-risk path.  When will we stop using these trivially wrong contrarian arguments as an excuse for climate inaction? Now that's a tough question to answer."

"American scientists are racing to develop chickens that can cope with scorching heat as part of a series of government-funded programmes looking to adapt to or mitigate the effects of extreme weather patterns on the food supply. A University of Delaware project is developing ways to introduce climate hardiness to the US domestic breed stock before summer heatwaves predicted under climate change models kill or spoil the meat of billions of birds. Backing for lead scientist Professor Carl Schmidt's programme comes from the top. This month President Barack Obama, seeking to make stricter regulations on carbon emissions a centrepiece of his second term, described the effects of climate change as ""a problem affecting Americans right now"". Like many in the emerging field of climate adaptation or mitigation, Schmidt's concern is not over slight increases in average temperatures, but the rising frequency and duration of crippling heatwaves and other extreme events. By 2060, US climate agencies predict, there will be 12 times as many 100F (37.7C) days in Delaware and Maryland, where poultry farmers produce 600 million birds a year. ""Hotter periods will last longer, and that's when we'll see significant spikes in mortality and other stress factors coming in,"" Schmidt warns. ""We can't wait for that to happen. We have to prepare now."" As the political classes continue to dispute the causes of climate change, the Department of Food and Agriculture is giving more funding to researchers looking to limit climate-related disruptions to the food supply. ""There's a one-government approach to this issue,"" Sonny Ramaswamy, director of the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture, told the Observer. ""For us, it comes down to adaptation and mitigation. There's a concerted and coordinated push for food security to be achieved, and it's being pushed hard."" Grants have been given to research on how cattle can adapt to extreme drought, on the effect of climate change on pollinators such as bees, and on toxin-producing fungi in wine-making. The shift in policy emphasis was highlighted this month with the publication of an exhaustive National Climate Assessment. From corn producers in Iowa to oyster growers in Washington state and maple syrup producers in Vermont, the report identified areas of agricultural production experiencing ""climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience"". announced a series of regional ""climate hubs"" designed to give farmers access to resources to help understand and combat the changes they are facing. For Schmidt and his staff of researchers, the challenge with poultry lies in mapping the genomes of different species. In extreme hea,t chickens, like dogs, will pant. That changes the chemical balance of their blood, introducing a bitterness to the flavour of the meat. The complexities of bird reproduction present difficulties to genome engineers. It's not possible simply to cross a heat-resistant chicken such as the African naked-neck with a domestic bird without losing qualities you'd want to keep, explains Schmidt. The government is also funding research into turkeys and cattle, which has found that western palates won't accept meat from heat-resistant cattle such as the Indian brahman. Many environmentalists prefer to see the emphasis placed on prevention rather than adaptation. But prevention alone is no longer realistic, says Schmidt. ""We need a rational approach to provide food in the context of a changing climate as the population approaches nine billion,"" he says. ""The expectation is that people will be eating more, and specifically more poultry because that's the cheapest way to meet demand for more meat,"" Schmidt says. ""The combination of climate change and increased demand is a recipe for enormous problems."" Given the energy inefficiencies and pollution associated with the production of livestock and poultry, some of the big names in social philanthropy are backing projects for more sustainable food. Microsoft's co-founder, Bill Gates, is backing technology that uses pea protein to create substitutes for beef and poultry. ""There's no way to produce enough meat for nine billion people,"" Gates wrote on his blog. ""Yet we can't ask everyone to become vegetarians. We need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources."" Schmidt agrees. ""It's irrational to think people are all going to become vegetarian. They will still want to eat meat."" Ramaswamy says farmers may not be in agreement on the causes of climate change, but they can see the changes as the industry deals with many forms of extreme weather. ""We have to ask what can we do to develop better varieties of crops, animal species and management practices because this is the situation we've got."""

"Abolishing the renewable energy target would deliver small reductions in household electricity bills for the next three years, but after that bills would soar, new modelling shows. Tony Abbott has signalled the government’s review of the renewable energy target could pare back or even scrap the scheme because, the prime minister says, it is “causing pretty significant price pressure in the system and we ought to be an affordable energy superpower”.  The Coalition has appointed the businessman and self-professed climate sceptic, Dick Warburton, to head the review of the target, which requires retailers to source 20% of energy from renewables such as wind, hydro or solar by 2020. Last week the renewable energy industry reacted angrily after it emerged that the review was based on modelling which assumed that coal-fired generators would face no carbon price, or regulation or any kind of constraint on their greenhouse emissions for many years. Renewable energy industry representatives said this made the review’s modelling a “stitch-up” and a “farce”. The Clean Energy Council (CEC), which represents the renewable energy industry, has commissioned its own modelling from ROAM consulting and it concludes that the average household would pay approximately $50 less a year for their power in 2020 with the renewable energy target in place, compared with what they would pay if it was scrapped. Over the decade after 2020 households would be paying more than $100 a year extra for their power, without the RET. The modelling found that household bills would fall slightly in the first four years after the RET was scrapped – $11 in the first year, $22 in the second, $16 in the third and $11 in the fourth. The CEC said the result could be explained by the fact that more renewable energy minimised the need for the use of gas, the price of which was likely to rise dramatically over the decade as exports force the domestic price into line with international prices.  “The RET can help to protect consumers from the power price pain of rising gas prices, while delivering billions of dollars in investment and thousands of jobs for regional areas of the country,” said the CEC chief executive, David Green. He said the study also showed that abolishing the RET would put $14.5bn worth of investment and 18,400 jobs at risk. Removing the RET would also mean more power was sourced from high-emitting coal-fired generators, making it much more difficult for the government to meet its minimum 5% emissions reduction target by 2020. One motivation for the government’s review was the fact that declining electricity demand has meant the 41,000 gigawatt hours of power which has to be sourced from renewables actually represented a lot more than 20% of the market. According to the ROAM modelling, it would be 22.6% under the current policy."

"One of the first things Annie Leonard was asked on being named the new leader of Greenpeace USA this month was: are you willing to get arrested? “I said: 'Absolutely! I just need to figure out who is going to drive the car pool',” Leonard told The Guardian. “It's going to be interesting being a single mum doing this,” she said.  The last time Leonard worked for Greenpeace, over 20 years ago, the campaign group was known – only half-jokingly – as “boys and their boats”, because of its reputation for dangerous, high-visibility actions.  She returns to lead the group after having made a name for herself by producing a series of web videos – Story of Stuff – that reached beyond the usual white, male and privileged supporters of environmental causes. The first of her videos on throwaway culture went viral, making her one of the country's most effective messengers on climate change. Now, 40 million views later, her biggest job will be to transfer that broad outreach to Greenpeace, and turn climate change into a pressing, mainstream concern. Environmental groups in America are still undergoing a painful post-mortem of their failure to pass climate change legislation during the early years of Obama presidency – when Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress. That crushing defeat has since seen the birth of new activist groups such as 350.org and Bold Nebraska which are trying to block the construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project, and of movements to ban fracking in towns from Texas to Pennsylvania. But in Washington environmental groups continue to soul-search about how to reach out to a broader audience – and how to overcome the well-funded climate misinformation campaign. Leonard said her work would focus on climate change and exposing the influence of money in politics – furthering Greenpeace investigations into the Koch oil billionaires and other funders of the climate denial effort. She will also work to activate the organisation's base, including members who've left. “That is the only way to mainstream these issues, if we had all the Greenpeace members around the country talking about these issues,” she said. Getting arrested is not a prerequisite for engagement. “It's like an all-you-can-eat smorgasbord,” she said. “You don't have to sleep in the park. You don't have to chain yourself to something.” The organisation had to be receptive to all forms of activism, she said. “There has been a bit of a hierarchy of the people who chain themselves to the fence or go on the big TV talk shows are somehow of higher stature and are more important than the people who make sandwiches. But making sandwiches for the protesters is really important too. We have to figure out a way for them to plug in too.” Making that shift would help transform a movement where the biggest and best-funded establishment groups are still predominantly led by white males from privileged backgrounds.  Community-based and environmental justice groups are more representative of the US population. Once Leonard formally takes up her job, in August, all three Greenpeace organisations in North America will be led by women. Leonard arrives at her position via her Story of Stuff videos. The videos, which debuted in late 2007, were deceptively simple: just Leonard, looking like and sounding like a perky suburbanite with her brown pony tale and button down shirt, and animated stick figures against a white backdrop. She spoke at high speed and in plain English about how production, distribution and the inevitable waste involved in a consumer-driven economy was harming the planet – and made a connection to Americans who were ordinarily unmoved by conventional environmental campaigners. At the time, the messaging was a shift for the fact-based, jargon-laced arguments environmental groups had been making on climate change. Leonard said she realised during making the videos and during the constant touring since that it was less important to dispense data about the problem of consumerism gone wild than to give people the sense they could do something to change it. That realisation was 20 years in the making. The videos were a culmination of the work Leonard began at Greenpeace International in the late 1980s, travelling to Bangladesh and India to track the export of hazardous waste from rich consumer countries to the developing world. Investigations by Leonard and others were instrumental in the passage of an international treaty, the Basel Convention, which cracked down on the trade. Her memories of Greenpeace from that time was of an organisation that celebrated macho adventure.  “When I worked at Greenpeace in the late 1980s hardly any people had kids and the few people who had kids left at five and we thought they were total losers. We scorned them,” she said. “Not only did they leave at 5 they didn't sit around and chat at the coffee machine. They worked and we thought: “ God, they were so uptight'.” But times – and Leonard's own circumstances – have changed.  Leonard said she could not have taken the job if Greenpeace had not agreed to let her work from her home on the West Coast. She lives in Berkeley, with her 14-year-old daughter, in what sounds like a modern-day, middle-class version of a commune. Over the years, a group of long-term friends have bought up six neighbouring houses, knocking down fences to make one big backyard, sharing power tools and a pick-up truck and – when there is a crisis – child care. She said the environmental movement had grown more welcoming to parents like herself over the years – but there was still some distance to go. “No more eco-martyrs thinking that the earth can't sustain us taking a vacation or leaving the office at six to have dinner with the kids!” she wrote in a follow-up email. “We still have distance to go in making the work accessible to working parents and single parents. I'd like to see child care more routinely provided at meetings, stipends for single parents who have to travel and other structural changes that remove barriers to full participation even for those carrying a heavy load at home,” she went on. “Building a movement really does require all kinds of people, so it is our job to make this work accessible and relevant to all kinds of people.”"

"If 300 workers were to die in a nuclear accident or a shale gas blast, such an energy source would be doomed. Not so coal. Coal is the filthiest and most polluting form of energy, and the most dangerous to extract. I recall my Welsh grandfather boasting that none of his sons had ""gone down the pit"". Yet coal continues to exert a mesmeric hold on the world's imagination, especially on the left. Labour supported Arthur Scargill's determination to keep pits open. The party prevented Tony Blair from building any nuclear power stations, instead tipping subsidies into wind, which merely encouraged Britain's dependency on coal, now at 38% and rising. Global coal consumption is at its highest level since 2006, and mocks all attempts at emissions discipline. The past two decades of a ""rush to renewables"" remains a conundrum of modern government. Wind clearly generates electricity, which is good, but not much – and at a cost that has led to an extraordinary shift in wealth from poor to rich in public finance. In most of Europe, wind power has driven up fuel poverty and made dozens of landowners multimillionaires. A KPMG report to government in 2011 suggested that a similar cut in emissions could be achieved by switching to gas and nuclear, at a reported saving of £34bn. The prospect of a bandwagon loaded with subsidy (wind) crashing head-on into another loaded with profit (oil) has not been conducive to calm debate. All the two sides can agree on is paranoia about nuclear. After Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011, in which no one died, Germany was so panicked that it closed all its nuclear sites. This in turn meant frantic investment in German coal and lignite – 10 new plants are said to be opening – and a surge in Polish coal output. The latter may spend ¤20bn a year on renewables subsidies, involving an 80% rise in real energy prices since 2000, but the need to back these up with conventional capacity means that the chief beneficiary of Fukushima was coal. Germany's carbon emissions are rising by between 5% and 7% a year. Meanwhile, the continued identification of nuclear power with nuclear weapons – and now with the prospect of a terrorist dirty bomb – has long underpinned the left's opposition to it. Anyone involved should take an icepack and sit down to read Wade Allison's Radiation and Reason as an antidote. There have been few such potent alliances as the anti-nuclear lobby, Big Carbon and the Saudis driving up the cost of nuclear. The beneficiary, again, has been coal. Anyone who dares talk or write on this subject is scrutinised for tribal loyalties. Where is he coming from? Who must be paying him? I must have spent hundreds of man-hours attempting to keep abreast of the debate, struggling to remain loyal to planet reason. All I have concluded is that most sensible people – though not all – think the climate is changing, and that the precautionary principle suggests concerted action to combat it. But the ""renewables ascendancy"", culminating in the hysteria of the first International Panel on Climate Change report, was a disaster. It saw any carbon combustion or nuclear reaction as equally evil, and any sun, wind or wave power as equally good – however costly. Pleas from energy experts such as Oxford's Dieter Helm for economic literacy fell on deaf ears. ""Announcing a policy does not solve a problem,"" he said of the IPCC report in despair. For its part, coal is treated as a curiously tolerable rogue. Soaring Chinese and Indian consumption is taken as an inevitable consequence of poverty. British politicians, infatuated after visiting China, rarely mention that the basis of this growth is vast supplies of coal. The Chinese used 1.5bn tonnes of the stuff in 2000, and now use more than 4bn. This utterly swamps any western attempt at mitigation. The death rate among Chinese miners may be down from about 6,000 a year at the turn of the century, but is still beyond 1,000 a year. In the great debate over mitigation and adaptation, the adaptors now appear to be winning. Last March's report from the IPCC  marked a dramatic shift. Given that the campaign to reduce emissions has largely failed, money is now better spent on softening the impacts of global warming and helping those directly affected. As one of the few heroes of the debate, James Lovelock points out in his book Revenge of Gaia, the world's systems are ""adjustable for whatever is the current environment, adaptable to what forms of life it carries."" The Turkish disaster reminds us not just of the human cost of coal, but also the cost of hysteria-led policy. Gas is a carbon-based source of energy but can be twice or three times less polluting than coal – and does not require hundreds of people to die each year extracting it. The ""dash for gas"" has made America the only big country to actually reduce emissions since Kyoto. I am more persuaded by the fact of global warming than by it being a long-term existential threat to life on Earth. I am more of an adaptor. Even so, it makes sense to turn to fuels which are less polluting and dangerous to get than coal, while always seeking to innovate and curb energy use. But if I am wrong and warming is indeed a threat to survival, then mitigation becomes urgent. In which case a dash to gas and nuclear is vital. Above all, we should avoid spending money on intermittent renewables. They may appear to be a solution. In fact, they create an ever-rising need for deadly coal as a supplement."

"I've previously written about the five stages of climate denial. Climate contrarians were exhibiting all five stages leading up to the release of the latest IPCC report in ideologically biased media outlets like Rupert Murdoch's The Australian. Recently, John Cook (himself an Australian, at the University of Queensland) proposed the Quantum Theory of Climate Denial.  ""There are various states of climate denial, with some states contradicting others. For example, some believe global warming is not happening. Others believe global warming is happening but is not caused by humans. Others believe humans are causing global warming but that the impacts won't be bad. Now, it's perfectly understandable for a community of people to hold mutually inconsistent beliefs. But can one person hold three inconsistent beliefs at the same time? Can a person argue that global warming is not happening, then smoothly transition to arguing that global warming is happening but is caused by something else? They can, and they do ... It can be explained by the ""quantum theory of climate denial."" This theory holds that climate deniers exist in a fuzzy quantum state of denial, simultaneously rejecting many or all aspects of climate science."" Psychologically this can be easily explained, because climate denial is based not on science, but rather on ideology. This denial is caused by a desire to maintain the status quo and/or an opposition to the policies needed to solve the climate problem. Pseudoscientific arguments are only needed as a means to justify those ideological positions.  If the problem doesn't exist, or if it's not our fault, or if it's nothing to worry about, then we can maintain the status quo. Any of these arguments will suffice to justify opposition to climate solutions, so even though they're contradictory, those who deny climate realities for ideological reasons can deploy any of these positions at any time. Murdoch's The Australian is a prime example, having in recent months run stories claiming that global warming isn't happening, is happening but isn't due to carbon dioxide emissions, and is happening, is due to carbon dioxide, but isn't anything to worry about. Two of those articles were written by Bjorn Lomborg, a favorite of The Australian. Just a few days ago, the newspaper published another Lomborg piece, this one blaming virtually all of the world's problems on renewable energy. Fossil fuels are lovely – status quo it is! The editorial was full of misleading, unsubstantiated arguments. In essence, 'renewable energy is too expensive and receives too many subsidies, whereas fossil fuels are great for the poor because they're cheap.' Just look at China, suggests Lomborg – if you can see it through the smog-filled air that's causing 1.2 million premature deaths per year.  The editorial complained about the billions of dollars in wind and solar energy subsidies, neglecting the approximately $1.5 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies. It claimed that high energy prices are worse for people in poor countries than global warming impacts. Yet a report from Lomborg's own organization found that climate change has already been hurting the economies of poorer nations for many decades. Those countries happen to be the most vulnerable to climate damages. The editorial also complained that Australia's carbon tax has caused energy prices to rise, making it difficult for low-income households to pay their energy bills. The solution to that problem is a simple one – make the tax revenue neutral. While energy prices will still rise in that scenario, the costs to households will be offset when the resulting revenue is returned to the taxpayers. In its state of quantum climate denial, The Australian is happy to swallow Lomborg's flawed economics arguments, or take any other position that justifies the status quo. The quantum theory of climate denial extends far beyond Australia of course. Media outlets, politicians, and others in the US and UK can also often be found to inhabit multiple seemingly contradictory climate positions at the same time. However, given that an ideological opposition to climate solutions seems to be the basis for this denial, it would be nice if we could all move beyond arguing about well-established science and instead debate about climate policies. After all, if we're all honest with ourselves, the climate 'debate' isn't about science at all."
"Climate change poses a growing security threat and could cause conflict in the Arctic, a group of retired American generals and admirals said on Tuesday. In a new report, the former military officers said the Pentagon had been caught out by the rapid changes under way in the Arctic because of the melting of the sea ice.  “Things are accelerating in the Arctic faster than we had looked at,"" said General Paul Kern, the chairman of the Centre for Naval Analysis Corporation's military advisory board, which produced the report. “The changes there appear to be much more radical than we envisaged.” The prospect of an ice-free Arctic by mid-century had set off a scramble for shipping lanes by Russia and China especially, and for access to oil and other resources. “As the Arctic becomes less of an ice-contaminated area it represents a lot of opportunites for Russia,” he said. Oil companies were also moving into the Arctic.  ""We think things are accelerating in the Arctic faster than we had looked at seven years ago,"" he said, saying the situation had the potential to ""spark conflict there"".  The CNA report deepens concern about the security risks posed by climate change. In March, the United Nations' IPCC, in a landmark report, also warned that growing competition for resources in a world under climate change could lead to conflict. The report from the retired generals goes further, however, upgrading the climate risk from a “threat multipler” to a “conflict catalyst”. In addition to the Arctic, the report warned climate change could lead to conflicts in developing countries. “In Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, we are already seeing how the impacts of extreme weather, such as prolonged drought and flooding – and resulting food shortages, desertification, population dislocation and mass migration, and sea level rise – are posing security challenges to these regions’ governments. We see these trends growing and accelerating,"" the report said. “Populations will likely become disenfranchised and even more vulnerable to extremists and revolutionary influences,” the report went on. Other possible sources of conflict remain the intensifying competition for water, food and energy, the report said."
"In November 2013, typhoon Haiyan delivered destruction to the Philippines and a stark message that the world is underprepared for the violence of climate change. Dozens of typhoons hit the Philippines every season but this was not just another storm. Climate scientists have long predicted that as the Earth warms extreme weather events will become more extreme. Haiyan was a marker of how far we have gone down that road. Its unprecedented power and devastation gave us an insight into a dangerous future in which climate change fuels weather of hitherto-unimagined ferocity.  But aid agencies say Haiyan is likely to just be the overture. The rising intensity of tropical storms, combined with their increasingly unseasonal timings, means rebuilding may be incomplete when the next super typhoon hits. This would compound the disaster into a catastrophe. Tariq Reibl, Oxfam's humanitarian response manager for the Philippines, says that climate change will mean destructive storms, disastrous enough in isolation, will increasingly occur in procession. ""You're looking at about 20 typhoons per year for the Philippines and as a whole those 20 are going to be more powerful. And then, one or potentially two of those 20 in the future would be a super typhoon … that is something that we didn't see 10 years ago,"" he says. Oxfam's Haiyan recovery operation is currently costing £1m every week. And yet, six months after the event, the rebuild is only just beginning. Reibl says small but unseasonal storms have continually diverted resources away from the effort. Reibl says: ""If there is another storm that is even close to Haiyan … there could be higher death tolls, there could be much worse impact because the resilience that existed previously is all down. Everything was destroyed in Haiyan, in terms of evacuation centres, in terms of livelihoods."" The damage Haiyan caused outstripped any storm the typhoon-prone islands had experienced before. Reibl says typhoon Bopha in 2012 had already redefined ideas on how big a typhoon could get, and yet ""just a year later, Haiyan made Bopha seem like just a little wind … When Bopha happened we didn't envisage a Haiyan. Can we envisage something more than Haiyan?"" Reibl says that in the past the Philippines were considered the 7-11 of natural disasters – small but open all hours. Indonesia, with its large but infrequent disasters, was more like a mega mall. He says the scale of devastation wrought by Haiyan meant the Philippines had become ""a mega mall that is now also open 24/7"". At the Warsaw climate talks, which started just three days after Haiyan hit the coast, the Philippines' UN representative Yeb Sano captured the attention of the world as he pleaded with leaders to attend to the catastrophe in his homeland and act to ""prevent a future where super typhoons become a way of life"". But Chris Field, one of the authors of the UN's recent report on the impacts of climate change, says the intensity of storms is already increasing. ""We are now in an era where climate change isn't some kind of future hypothetical."" What was really scary about Haiyan, says Paul Jenkins, head of partnership development at the Red Cross, was that it happened in a country that was considered well prepared for this type of disaster. ""You can imagine if that kind of event had struck a country with less good logistics, less structures, less government capacity it could have been absolutely catastrophic."" Anthony Spalton, disaster risk reduction specialist at Unicef, says a major part of preparing for extreme weather events is community education. During Haiyan, many people died because they did not know what a storm surge was and stayed with their properties. Unicef has created region-specific curriculums for schools to teach children how to respond in disaster situations. Jenkins says that, while ""mega-events"" such as Haiyan receive the majority of interest and resources, the full impact of climate change will be subtler and much greater. ""If you look at a global picture, the issue is that [climate change] is already there and it's not necessarily about mega-events, it's about increasing vulnerability due to climate change."" He says the ""collective impact over a year"" of changing seasonality, crop impacts, drought and sea level rise ""will vastly exceed the number of people affected by a Haiyan"". Spalton says the effects of climate change will be felt worst in regions prone to floods, droughts or storms. As a result, Unicef has shifted the emphasis of many of its programmes towards preparing for climate-change-related disasters. ""While there may not be new funding available, there's a recognition that the funding we do have needs to be orientated differently to these global trends."" Spalton says the scale of the problem is such that existing funding is inadequate for providing protection to vulnerable communities. This will only get worse as the effects of climate change become more pronounced. Jenkins says climate change is now the biggest driver of change in the way aid funding is spent.

"Nearly half of all Americans live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to an American Lung Association (ALA) report released Wednesday. Nearly 148 million people live in areas where smog and soot particles make it unhealthy to breathe the air, according to the ALA's annual study on US air quality. The report, which is based on data collected between 2010 and 2012, found smog, or ozone, had worsened in 22 of the 25 biggest US metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, Houston, Washington-Baltimore, New York City and Chicago – and said there was a high risk of more high-ozone days because of climate change. ""Weather played a factor,"" the report said. ""The warmer summers in 2010 and 2012 contributed to higher ozone readings and more frequent ozone days. Sunlight and heat create conditions that increase the risk of high ozone levels."" Smog, or ozone, which is the most widespread air pollutant, forms more readily in hotter temperatures, and is expected to increase under climate change. ""It's going to make it harder to clean up air pollution,"" said Janice Nolen of the ALA. ""Days that wouldn't ordinarily have high ozone levels are going to have them."" She added: ""It's going to be much harder to keep ozone pollution down to the levels that we should be breathing."" There is growing concern globally – including in the US – about the health risks of air pollution. The report's release comes a day after the supreme court endorsed the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to deal with smog and soot that travel across state lines. The ALA had joined that case on behalf of the EPA. The group has also been pushing hard to tighten air pollution standards, and has supported the EPA's moves to force power plants to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Scientific research shows that smog and soot are far more harmful at lower levels than previously thought. A growing body of research over the last decade has connected air pollution to increased deaths from heart disease and respiratory illnesses. The World Health Organisation said last autumn that particulate pollution causes lung cancer. Air pollution in New Delhi rose to record levels in winter, triggering a debate about whether the Indian capital had now caught up with Beijing. Britain was on smog alert earlier this month after recording very high levels of air pollution. Meanwhile, California's pollution control officers warned this month that extreme heat and wildfires could set back decades of improvements in air quality, boosting smog formation and spewing dangerous smoke into the air. Eighteen of the 25 US cities with the worst particulate pollution saw a drop in year-round particle pollutants because of cuts in emissions for coal-fired power plants and other measures. Thirteen of them, including Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Atlanta, registered their lowest ever levels. But the report said those cities still failed to meet national standards for year-round particle pollution."
"There is a soggy feel to the weather, and the outlook doesn't look too promising, with more unsettled conditions next week and even well into June. And there is a horrible sense of deja-vu that this may not be looking good for the coming summer as a whole. Last year aside, there has been a run of several years of washout summers that often began with heavy rains in spring and especially in May.  This may, of course, just simply be bad luck, like throwing dice, or it may be some sort of natural fluctuation in climate. There have been plenty of runs of poor summers in the past, especially some real horrors in the 1950's and 1960's, and further back in the nineteenth century, when the summers were often wetter than the winters. But there are concerns that there may now be a shift in climate that is exposing the British Isles to wetter summers. One suspect that has been blamed is the unprecedented melting of the Arctic ice cap, which has reached record low coverage over recent years. The Arctic is a refrigerator for the Earth's climate – because the sea ice is white, it reflects some 80 per cent of the sunlight over the Arctic back into space and helps cool the atmosphere. But without the ice, the dark sea is exposed, which absorbs some 90 per cent of the solar energy, warming up the sea and upsetting the balance of heat, and possibly climate, across the northern hemisphere."
"Arguments that the climate is relatively insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect have become the last best chance for climate contrarians, but a new study from Texas A&M University hammers a big nail in the coffin of that argument. With overwhelming evidence that humans are the main cause of global warming, and with arguments that modest warming is beneficial falling apart, those who oppose climate solutions are forced to put their eggs in the 'low climate sensitivity' basket. If the Earth's climate is less sensitive to the increased greenhouse effect than most of the available evidence indicates, then perhaps there's not quite as much urgency to tackle the threat of global warming, they argue.  The latest IPCC report gave contrarians a glimmer of hope in this area. The fourth IPCC report in 2007 estimated that the planet will warm between 2 and 4.5°C warming in response to a doubling of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, with a best estimate of 3°C. At the time, all of the different approaches to estimate climate sensitivity (using historical data, climate models, and recent instrumental data) were in good agreement.  However, in recent years, a few studies using a combination of instrumental data and simple climate models have arrived at lower estimates. This caused the IPCC in its fifth report in 2014 to reduce the lower end of its estimated climate sensitivity range, back to 1.5 to 4.5°C in response to doubled CO2 (the same range as its reports estimated prior to 2007). Due to the newfound disagreement between the different methods, the IPCC also dropped its best estimate altogether. The 'instrumental' climate sensitivity estimates were something of a puzzle. Why were they no longer in agreement with estimates from historical climate changes and climate models, which still consistently arrived at climate sensitivity estimates between 2 and 4.5°C? John Abraham reported on a study by Drew Shindell at NASA that may have hit on the answer. These 'instrumental' estimates were assuming that the Earth's climate is equally sensitive to all external temperature influences. However, while greenhouse gases are well mixed throughout the atmosphere, aerosols and ozone are concentrated more in the northern hemisphere. Here the temperature response to energy imbalances is more sensitive, as world-renowned climate scientist James Hansen noted in a 1997 paper, “A forcing at high latitudes yields a larger response than a forcing at low latitudes. This is expected because of the sea ice feedback at high latitudes and the more stable lapse rate at high latitudes” Shindell found that correcting for this faulty assumption brought the 'instrumental' climate sensitivity estimates much higher in the models he looked at.  In their study, Kummer & Dessler took Shindell's approach one step further. Dessler told me, ""I view my paper as a follow-on to Shindell's paper. What he showed in his paper was that climate models respond more strongly to forcing from aerosols and ozone. What we show in our paper is that if we take his result, and re-analyze the 20th-century observational record then we get a higher climate sensitivity than [studies] which assumed that all forcing was equally effective. Taking efficacy into account, our climate sensitivity is right in the middle of the values derived from other sources. So this allows us to bridge the gap between the various estimates of climate sensitivity and converge on a value around 3°C."" Dessler also explains the study's approach and results in the following 4-minute video. In short, Shindell showed that according to models, the climate is significantly more sensitive to changes in aerosols and ozone than greenhouse gases, perhaps by as much as 50%. Kummer & Dessler showed that if the climate is 33% more sensitive to changes in aerosols and ozone, then the 'instrumental' estimates are right in line with those derived from historical climate changes and global climate models, with a best estimate of 3°C warming in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2. If we continue on our current business-as-usual path, we're on track for close to two doublings of atmospheric CO2. If climate sensitivity is 3°C for doubled CO2, that gives us a best estimate of about 5°C warming above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100, while even 2°C is considered dangerous. Even if the lower 'instrumental' estimates were right and climate sensitivity is closer to 2°C, that would still suggest that we're headed for about 3.5°C warming by 2100 if we continue on our current path. Either 3.5°C or 5°C warming represent potentially catastrophic scenarios; thus we would still need to solve the global warming problem even if the lower estimates were correct, although they might buy us a little bit of time. However, the results of Shindell's and Kummer & Dessler's studies suggest that these 'instrumental' estimates were the odd ones out for a reason. Their lower estimates were based on the incorrect assumption that all climate influences are equally effective. At this point we're still left with all the evidence pointing to humans rapidly increasing the greenhouse effect in a climate that's relatively quite sensitive to these types of changes. In other words, we're on a very dangerous path, and we're still lacking the sense to take meaningful action to prevent high-risk climate change."
"When we think of North Korea, we think of a nation determined to be an outsider in the international community. Whether it’s testing nuclear weapons or threatening London hairdressers, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is not usually associated with compliance. But there is compelling evidence that the North Korean government is motivated by domestic power games to co-operate globally on climate change.  North Korea has a record of compliance with its obligations as a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The obvious question then is why the North Korean government would show such commitment to the international climate change regime, given its belligerent reputation in the strategic realm. The most obvious link is between environmental degradation, the vulnerable agricultural system and the stability of governance in North Korea. The concept of climate change vulnerability is important there. Climate change impacts – declining availability of food, water and energy, sea level rise, migration, and extreme weather events – pile more stress onto countries already at risk from internal instability and economic weakness. Like many poor countries, North Korea, where such problems are endemic, is least able to cope with climate change impacts. These weaknesses include food insecurity, energy shortages, economic fragility and a rigid political system. So North Korea is using the UNFCCC as a vehicle for projects designed to increase agricultural output and build the resilience of the agricultural system to disasters. The country exists in a state of near-perpetual food insecurity (the FAO estimates a food deficit of 207,000 tonnes in 2012-2013), stemming from a structural food deficit along with an inability and unwillingness to buy food from international markets. In these circumstances, any disruption to domestic agricultural production will have a significant impact on the food security of at-risk segments of the population, creating ripple effects across the country’s economy and political system. This illustrates the degree to which food insecurity is an existential problem for the North Korean leadership. Degradation of the land base is another critical problem requiring technical assistance. Land degradation in the DPRK is a symptom of ideological rigidity in land management, climatic impacts and the country’s energy shortages, exacerbating food insecurity. The capacity-building assistance made available via the UNFCCC and related programs boosting planting and harvesting efficiency, building soil fertility and reforestation helps to increase the productive capacity of the agricultural sector and enhance its resilience against climate change. The incentives for participation are not confined to agriculture. North Korea is using the UNFCCC as a vehicle for obtaining foreign assistance to upgrade its energy production and transmission infrastructure. North Korea’s energy security problem is well documented, revolving around four distinct challenges: supply, generation, power transmission, and secondary usage. Of these four challenges, electricity generation and transmission are the two that can be addressed through the UNFCCC. Renewable energy may be the most appropriate vehicle for increasing generation capacity because unlike large centralised fossil-fuels, renewables can be scaled locally which reduces their up-front cost. For example, a UNDP-sponsored project is installing small-scale wind energy systems at sites across North and South Pyongan Provinces, helping to alleviate energy shortages affecting these areas by decoupling them from reliance on the coal-generated electricity grid. Most significantly, renewables offer North Korea considerable scope for technology transfer, infrastructure upgrades and income through the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol. Technology transfers for such projects do not violate the import restrictions of dual-use technologies listed under the UN Security Council sanctions regime against the DPRK. The income potential derives from the carbon credits generated by North Korea’s renewable projects, which can be traded on international carbon markets. While there is revenue potential in the generation and sale of carbon credits, the magnitude of the potential revenue is comparatively small. Together, the projects already online in North Korea account for 193,475 carbon credits. At the EU spot price for carbon credits of $5.66/ton (£3.36/ton) as of July 2013, North Korea’s current portfolio of carbon credits are worth a mere $1m per year. North Korea has strong incentives to fight climate change and its potential to erode government control. The fact that the nation has become more compliant over time suggests that the objectives of the international climate change regime coalesce with the survival imperatives of Kim Jong-un’s government.

"Increase coopration in the industry: We now have a global problem but it cannot be solved by one person, one single organisation or any one nation. The waste management industry is currently fragmented along regional and ideological lines. This can be observed from the fact that there are no truly global waste management companies or organisations which have an incentive for improved waste management.  Bury waste misconceptions: I would say that one of the most basic misunderstandings of the waste issue is that recycling isn't always better than just burying waste. There are many places in the world where sand is plentiful, and it is easier, cheaper, less energy and carbon intensive to just bury glass than to have it sorted and reprocessed. The same is true about repurposing shipping containers, especially for housing. Depending where you are in the world, it can be much more ecological to use new materials for housing, and use old containers for storage and other non-housing purposes. Address consumption issues as part of the solution: 150 million tonnes of plastic is thrown away after using it just once. Plastic production accounts for 8% of the worlds oil reserves and that is likely to increase. Our throw away lifestyle has to change. Listen to the global south: We hear about the concept of zero waste constantly, but there are few people who know more about this than many of the communities in the global south. There is a real opportunity for the north to learn from the south. Streamline research networks: The research on waste is uncoordinated and inefficient in identifying research priorities, simply because so many people are involved. The standard of research and the ideas out there are excellent but we need to improve research networks. Reduce the waste going into landfills: In Lagos the state generates about 10,000 of waste daily and 70% of this ends up in landfills. Tailor solutions to local needs: If we have to act locally, then we must think locally. What can be implemented successfully in the UK might not work in Nigeria or Lagos state for instance. For example, despite the talk about waste-to-energy globally, this hasn't worked as a solution in Lagos. Don't waste time striving for all solutions to be unique: Waste is too complex for all solutions to be distinct. In an ideal word, solutions would be tailored to the immense diversity of waste. In reality, the pragmatic approach is to prioritise management systems depending on the types of waste, its volume and how dangerous it is. Encourage communities to get creative: What really interests me is how we can help communities across the world to deal with their own waste. Three billion people receive no formal waste management. While there are moves to remedy this in some of the megacities, this is likely to take much longer to address in rural areas. Work with the informal sector: In Delhi there is a 27% recycling rate from the informal sector alone, at no cost to the public purse whatsoever. This compares favourably with a city like London, with a waste management budget of millions. An interesting model for this is the city of Cuenca in Ecuador, where the municipality sat down with the waste pickers living on the local landfill site, understood their key target materials and implemented a recycling scheme focused on these. They built them a basic recycling shed, so they could do their work away from the elements and provided basic housing adjacent to the landfill site with electricity and running water. They also helped them organise into a co-operative to get better prices for the materials they collected. Engage both the winners and the losers in the waste industry: Make sure you understand all the pieces in the puzzle including which groups gain and lose from waste activities. From this base you can identify their relative drivers and motivations. The industry needs to ask itself, how do you engage all in the process of designing a waste management system, from the local rubbish picker to the large businesses? Don't alientate groups which depend on waste for their income: It is important to learn from these groups both from a social and an operational perspective. The consideration of new, more mechanised, government-run recycling technologies or collection systems that exclude access to recyclables for informal recyclers has met resistance. In many cases it is necessary to strike a balance between a technology that boosts efficiency and productivity without taking away jobs from the informal recycling sector. Many cities in Latin America have tried to strike this balance by installing manual or semi-mechanised separation plants in which informal recyclers are employed or in which a cooperative is contracted to operate the plant.

"With the frenetic studies of emerging climate science, we sometimes lose track of the creators of knowledge; the scientists who have helped shape our understanding of today’s Earth system. When one of them passes, it gives us a chance to reflect on these heroes of the world. Recently, Dr. Tom Crowley died after a struggle with cancer. His personal and scientific impact was best conveyed to me by his dear friend, Dr. Jerry North. Dr. North told me,   “Crowley’s amazing intellectual journey started with marine geology (PhD at Brown University) where he studied cores from the ocean floor. He became very expert in analysis of past climates with climate models. He was extraordinary at dealing with climate data sets where his intuition generated idea after idea. This very unusual instinct for crossing over all kinds of different data (tree rings, ocean cores, ice cores, pollen, etc.) and relating it to the climate signal that was buried in it made him a singularly gifted scientist. He had a talent for looking at a problem, thinking about it and wondering what kind of story could be made of it. What is a significant project leading to an interesting publishable paper and what is not: the very essence of a scientist.” What was remarkably about Crowley was his diverse and adaptive mind. He made significant contributions in a wide range of sub-disciplines. He was also an active contributor to public discussions of climate science. He excelled at telling the world why we should care. In my communication with Jerry North, I learned much more about his friend. Tom and Jerry worked on paleoclimate problems years ago. They teamed up with colleagues John Mengel and David Short to develop energy-balance climate models that had the ability to explain important problems. Tom and Jerry used the model to examine all sorts of climate issues such as the importance of seasonal cycles in climate change.  They found that the summer climate controls the initiation of ice sheets. If the summer is cool, the ice will not melt and the sheet will become thicker. They also found that the placement of land and ocean water in the polar region was important in controlling the summer temperatures. North America and Greenland were ideal for ice-sheet growth. Their model showed that Greenland and Antarctica were predicted to ice over – that is, without human-emitted greenhouse gases. Tom Crowley also co-authored an important climate science book on paleoclimatology which was published by Oxford Press in 1991. It was a clearly written and successful book that introduced climate models to geologists and geographers. It also introduced “climate modelers to the wonderful work of paleoclimate.” While making significant contributions to his science, Dr. Crowley was simultaneously known for his kindness. His treatment of colleagues and employees set a standard that few of us can emulate or imitate. I learned of Tom’s passing from Dr. Andrew Dessler, who says, “Tom was tremendously respected and his loss is a keen one to the climate community”. It is safe to say climate science, and the Earth’s health is better for Dr. Crowley. It is also evident that those around him were made better too."
"Hotter sands triggered by a warming climate could cause greater numbers of sea turtles to be born female, increasing the reptiles’ numbers in the short term, research shows. But the study, published in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change, warns that once the sands in which sea turtle eggs incubate grow too warm, the population could become entirely female, risking the animal’s extinction. “Sea turtles are unusual in that the gender of the offspring is not driven by sex chromosomes, as in humans,” said Professor Graeme Hays, one of the lead authors of the study.  Instead, a sea turtle’s sex is determined by the temperature of the sand in which the female turtle buries her eggs. “The logic is that warming temperatures will lead to more female hatchlings being produced, because the females are produced at the warmer temperatures,” Hays said. Sand temperature depends strongly on its colour, Hays said. “The darker the sand, the more heat it absorbs from sunlight. So blacker sand would be much warmer than lighter coloured sand.” At the “pivotal temperature”, 29C, the gender ratio of turtle hatchling is approximately 50:50. The ratio is upset as the sand temperature increases, until it reaches around 31C. Sand that hot will “almost exclusively produce female hatchlings”, Hays said. Similarly, sand at 28C will likely produce only males.  The study, carried out on a loggerhead turtle rookery in Cape Verde, in the Atlantic Ocean, modelled the likely impact of unchecked temperature increases over the next 150 years.  “Over the next 20 to 30 years, it’s not going to create problems,” Hays said. “In fact there’s going to be a benefit to the turtles, because there’s going to be more females produced, which means more females laying eggs. More females will lead to a population expansion. “But ultimately, if you extrapolate long enough into the future … once you get 100 years or more into the future, then things start to look serious. You have so few males left that it’s likely to be a problem. There will be heaps of female but not enough males to fertilise all those eggs.” It is possible the hardy reptile could adjust by laying its eggs in a cooler season or shifting to a colder part of the world, Hays added. Humans could adjust too, by avoiding the development of hotels and resorts on lighter beaches. ""They're going to be the most important ones to protect,” he said. Other reptiles whose sex relies on temperature, including alligators, crocodiles and many species of lizard, could be exposed to the same process."
"Bluebells are blooming, horse chestnut tree flowers are out and everything is looking lush – and it probably comes as no surprise that this spring has come early thanks to unusually mild weather. To gauge how early spring has arrived needs a long history pf observations, though, and is something that amateurs in Britain have excelled at for a long time. For example, since 1947 Jean Combes in Surrey has been recording the dates when the leaf buds open on her local oak, ash, horse chestnut and lime trees. Her records show a huge advance in the leafing dates over the past 67 years, and especially since the 1990s when very early springs started to become very apparent. Leafing is now about 25 days earlier than in the 1950s, which mirrors a rise in temperatures over the same period – an advance of about six days for every 1C increase in spring temperature.  Of course, climate change sceptics can jump on some freak cold and late springtimes, such as last year, and argue that this proves that the climate isn't changing. But last spring was something of an odd-man-out and historical records that go back even further, over 250 years, show an unmistakeable pattern of springs coming earlier as temperatures have risen in recent times. The Nature's Calendar survey at the Woodland Trust continues to record the dates of natural events in both spring and autumn and is asking for volunteers to send in observations to their website at www.naturescalendar.org.uk"
"Here we go again. The latest IPCC report, the US National Climate Assessment report, and a report published by US military researchers all recently warned us yet again about the risks associated with human-caused climate change. While the planet continues to warm, ice continues to melt, and sea levels continue to rise, the conservative media are trying to distract everyone from these scientific realities with a shiny quarter named Lennart Bengtsson. Bengtsson is a meteorologist at the University of Reading, who recently decided to join a charity, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). The GWPF is known for downplaying the risks posed by human-caused global warming with shoddy scientific arguments, then arguing against taking any meaningful action to address the problem.   The GWPF has called the IPCC a ""deeply discredited organisation"" and worse, and has accused climate scientists of being delusional or liars. The group also recently set up a new campaigning arm, which would be free from charity regulations requiring that any information they put out is fair and as accurate as possible. Thus it was not surprising when Bengtsson's scientific colleagues were unhappy with him joining this organization. Some of those colleagues allegedly told Bengtsson that they did not want to publish research with him due to his association with this political group, which seems entirely understandable. However, in response to these alleged reactions from his colleagues (Bengtsson did not respond to requests for additional details), Bengtsson wrote in his resignation letter to the GWPF, ""I see no limit and end to what will happen. It is a situation that reminds me about the time of McCarthy."" To be clear, this situation bears no resemblance to McCarthyism in the United States, which involved aggressive government investigations and questioning of people suspected of having ties to Communism. For more accurate parallels in climate science today, look instead at Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli's witch-hunt of Michael Mann or the Climategate inquiries directed at Phil Jones. A few colleagues withdrawing support and co-authorship with Bengtsson pales in comparison. A few days later, Bengtsson told Rupert Murdoch's The Times that a peer-reviewer comment recommending rejection of a paper he co-authored mentioned how the 'skeptic' media would react to the study. The Murdoch media and other conservatively biased news outlets went berserk, with stories in Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, The Mail Online, The Telegraph, The Times again, The Mail on Sunday, The Australian, and Drudge, inventing conspiracy theories involving censorship of 'inconvenient research'. Bengtsson's submitted paper had made the case that the Earth's climate sensitivity to the increased greenhouse effect is relatively low by comparing the results of several previous studies, but had not made the case well. The journal in question, Environmental Research Letters published the full comments from the reviewer in question, showing that the recommendation to reject the paper was because, ""The overall innovation of the manuscript is very low ... The paper does not make any significant attempt at explaining or understanding the differences, it rather puts out a very simplistic negative message giving at least the implicit impression of ""errors"" being made within and between these assessments,"" Comments from a second reviewer were even more brutal. This is precisely the purpose of peer-review – to filter out papers that aren't sufficiently accurate or don't add anything significant to our scientific understanding. Environmental Research Letters is a high-quality scientific journal with a 65% rejection rate. For examples of innovative research in this area, see our discussions of recent papers by NASA's Drew Shindell and Texas A&M's Kummer & Dessler. In fact, Bengtsson himself seemed taken aback by the conservative media distortions of the journal's rejection of his research (although one wonders why he leaked the reviewer comments to The Times to begin with), telling the Science Media Centre, ""I do not believe there is any systematic “cover up” of scientific evidence on climate change or that academics’ work is being “deliberately suppressed”, as The Times front page suggests. I am worried by a wider trend that science is being gradually being influenced by political views. Policy decisions need to be based on solid fact."" One also wonders why Bengtsson joined GWPF if he's concerned about political views influencing science. Perhaps because Bengtsson's own political views can be rather extreme at times, as exemplified by this comment he left on a blog formerly known as The Climate Scam, ""It's a shame that the GDR [East Germany] disappeared otherwise would have been able to offer one-way tickets there for these socialists. Now there's unfortunately not many orthodox countries left soon and I surely do not imagine our romantic green Communists want a one-way ticket to North Korea. But if interested I'd gladly contribute to the trip as long as it is for a one way ticket."" Along with Richard Lindzen joining the Cato Institute, Bengtsson now gives us two examples of 'skeptical' scientists becoming associated with political advocacy groups, and zero examples of mainstream climate scientists joining political organizations. Who is it that's politicizing science? In any case, the accusations in the conservative media of climate journals suppressing research are clearly unfounded, even according to Bengtsson himself. It's also worth noting that contrarians have been behind every documented case of climate journals behaving unethically. It's easy to see why this distortion of reality so appealed to the conservative media. With a 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming, it's difficult to justify maintaining the status quo, as politically conservative ideology tends to favor. The easiest way to argue for business-as-usual is if those 97% of climate experts are part of a grand conspiracy. In fact, a 2012 paper by Smith & Leiserowitz found, ""Associations with conspiracy theories (e.g., “the biggest scam in the world to date”) accounted for the largest portion of 2010 [climate] naysayer images with over 40% of total responses for this category."" Everybody loves a good conspiracy theory. Perhaps climate experts' conclusions are dictated by grant money, perhaps journals won't publish dissenting research, or perhaps these tens of thousands of climate experts have been subjected to a secret government brainwashing program led by Al Gore. Or perhaps the scientific evidence overwhelmingly points to humans causing dangerously rapid climate change, and these conspiracy theories and manufactured controversies are just excuses to reject that inconvenient reality. You be the judge."
"Rising carbon dioxide emissions are set to make the world's staple food crops less nutritious, according to new scientific research, worsening the serious ill health already suffered by billions of malnourished people. The surprise consequence of fossil fuel burning is linked directly to the rise in CO2 levels which, unlike some of the predicted impacts of climate change, are undisputed. The field trials of wheat, rice, maize and soybeans showed that higher CO2 levels significantly reduced the levels of the essential nutrients iron and zinc, as well as cutting protein levels.  ""We found rising levels of CO2 are affecting human nutrition by reducing levels of very important nutrients in very important food crops,"" said Prof Samuel Myers, an environmental health expert at Harvard University, Boston, and lead author of the study. ""From a health viewpoint, iron and zinc are hugely important."" Myers said 2 billion people already suffer iron and zinc deficiencies around the world. This causes serious harm, in particular to developing babies and pregnant women, and currently causes the loss of 63m years of life annually. ""Fundamentally the concern is that there is already an enormous public health problem and rising CO2 in the atmosphere will exacerbate that problem further."" While wheat, rice, maize and soybeans are relatively low in iron and zinc, in poorer societies where meat is rarely eaten they are a major source of the nutrients. About 2.4bn people currently get at least 60% of their zinc and iron from these staples and it is over 75% in Bangladesh, Iraq and Algeria. ""This is yet another example of the impact climate change is already having on people's ability to grow and access the nutritious food they need,"" said Hannah Stoddart, Oxfam's head of policy for food and climate. ""With 25 million more children under five at risk of malnutrition by 2050 because of climate change, action to cut emissions and support communities to adapt is crucial."" The research, published in the journal Nature, represents a major advance in the understanding of how rising CO2 levels affect food nutrition. The scientists compared nutrient levels in field crops grown in ambient CO2 levels, about 380-390 parts per milliion (ppm) at the time of the work, with those grown in the elevated CO2 levels expected by 2050. The latter level, 545-585ppm, is expected even if substantial curbs on emissions are put in place by the world's governments. In order to take account of variable growing conditions, the researchers analysed 41 different strains grown in seven locations on three different continents. Wheat grown in high CO2 levels had 9% less zinc and 5% less iron, as well as 6% less protein, while rice had 3% less iron, 5% less iron and 8% less protein. Maize saw similar falls while soybeans lost similar levels of zinc and iron but, being a legume not a grass, did not see lower protein. The precise biological mechanism that causes nutrient levels to fall is not well understood as yet. But Professor Brian Thomas, a plant develoment expert at the University of Warwick and not involved in the research said: ""The work is convincing and consistent with what we do know about the plant physiology."" The impact on human health resulting from the drop in the level of protein is less clear than for the zinc and iron loss. Myers said the resulting increase in carbohydrate in the crops could increase the rate of metabolic syndrome, the diabetes, heart disease and stroke that currently afflicts many in developed countries due to high levels of obesity. But Myers said obesity is not necessary for the risk of metabolic syndrome to rise. ""It is something to do with the switch of foods itself."" Myers said simply eating more staple foods to meet zinc and iron requirements was not realistic when food production already must double by 2050 to meet the demand of rising populations. Some of the varieties used in the research performed better than others, raising the prospect of breeding strains that are less vulnerable to rising CO2. But the researchers noted: ""Such breeding programmes will not be a panacea for many reasons including the affordability of improved seeds and the numerous criteria used by farmers in making planting decisions that include taste, tradition, marketability, growing requirements and yield."" Myers acknowledged that rising CO2 can improve crop yields on some circumstances, but said: ""There may be a little positive effect, but the people who work in this area would not want to hang their hat on that in the face of the many other negative effects of climate change, including heatwaves droughts and floods."" April saw the first month for millions of years in which the CO2 level was greater than 400pm every day: before the industrial revolution started the large-scale burning of fossil fuels the level of CO2 in the atmosphere was 280ppm. Myers told the Guardian: ""It is very hard to predict all the challenges to human health resulting from climate change. My guess is there will be many more surprises as we remake the environmental conditions on the planet. As a civilisation we are now living with 400 ppm for the first time: it's a new world."""
"When we think of hunger strikes historical figures tend to come to mind: Gandhi, the suffragettes, Irish republican Bobby Sands. But what would it look like if we transplanted this established form of protest into the digital age? The recent fast for the climate campaign may give us a starting point. The campaign has drawn its inspiration from Philippines climate change commissioner Yeb Sano's 13-day hunger strike at the post-Typhoon Haiyan's COP19. This individual protest has grown into an active social media campaign for climate change action. Faith groups, environmental NGOs, youth groups and grassroots organisations from across the globe are congregating around the hashtag #fastfortheclimate to call for a collective fast at the start of every month. Sano, who following COP19 has become the unofficial face of the movement, describes it as ""a spontaneous global phenomenon"". ""Since my original fast it has snowballed into #fastfortheclimate. The social media campaign is now moving into a new era of more organised collaboration among the participating organisations. This month we launched an online platform."" Sano recognises that the campaign has yet to see concrete results, but argues that it is not just another voice in the awareness-raising chorus. ""Fast for the climate has done what we have found difficult to do in the past decade – which is to unify the voices of civil society. The organisations collaborating in this movement represent a very broad spectrum of views and voices."" This achievement may have something to do with the emotive language of the campaign. When questioned on its aims and impact, Sano speaks in terms of a ""planetary awakening"" and LWF Youth, an active supporter of the movement, describes it as an example of ""spiritual solidarity"". The campaign is not only going for the hearts and minds of the public, but seeking engagement on a deeper level. Sano sees fasting as the most effective means of achieving this. ""Fasting is one of the most powerful means of peaceful action to drive change. It is both a symbolic and active form of transformational change. People fast become agents of change and instruments of justice."" So how should we evaluate this type of campaigning and what should we anticipate as its outcome? Can a spiritual awakening that hangs on a hashtag be anything more than a gimmick? And will the virtual unity created by these individual commitments lead to any tangible progress? While Sano is mindful of the ethics behind heartstrings campaigning, for him it's important not to lose sight of emotional engagement as a trigger for understanding and for action. The crucial thing is to ""make people believe in the story before it is too late"", says Sano. ""Climate change has always been esoteric for many and has had its own set of technical jargon that only climate negotiators seem to comprehend. The speech I delivered on behalf of my country in the face of Haiyan gave climate change a human dimension."" Sano recognises that his advocacy has been given extra gravitas by his nationality. ""A message is always made more effective by a credible messenger. A country that sits high in the rankings of climate risk, such as the Philippines, sits on a moral high ground, and puts you in a unique position to negotiate. People search for leaders, and leaders who weep with their people send a very powerful image."" If campaigns are best judged on their results rather than the medium of the message, then it is too early to deliver a verdict on #fastfortheclimate. While a growing and diverse movement, it remains to be seen how long it will be able to sustain its momentum. The jury is also out on whether this campaign is a gimmick or has any real power. Perhaps this is a false dichotomy and #fastfortheclimate can be both. Perhaps it also depends how far Sano's original message will be hijacked by international NGOs. What is clear, though, is that campaign's progression very much depends on Sano, as a 'voice of the victims'.

"By most accounts, the first budget of the Abbott government was the least popular and most extreme in forty years, and was handed down during an almost unprecedented May heatwave of ten consecutive days above 20 degrees. The pantomime of the federal budget took place in Australia last Tuesday, auspiciously on the 13th of May. As a piece of political theatre, the budget is generally viewed as one of the most important set pieces of the year by political and media elites. The accepted wisdom is that the budget is an opportunity for the government to set the agenda for the remainder of the year. If this is true, then the Abbott government has sent a strong message that its agenda is resolutely regressive for almost every policy area.  On the climate and environment front, it is genuinely difficult to narrow down the most extreme elements of this deeply and widely disliked budget. Firstly, the fact is that this is a deeply unpopular budget, and it has been presented to the Australian people by a government that is neither liked nor trusted. To get an idea of just how unpopular this budget is, you could look at opinion polls, such as the recent Newspoll which shows only 5 percent of respondents saying they would be better off. Snap protests against the budget were also held, events which were well covered by The Guardian. Or you could watch this video of what happened when people on the street get told about the ""best budget ever"". Reading this on mobile? Click here to view the video. Secondly, the scale of the betrayal in this budget is breathtaking. In addition to social policy attacks against Australia's most vulnerable people, including $80 billion in cuts to health and education, and the regressive proposal to introduce a $7 fee to see a doctor, the budget destroys the Abbott government's final claims to take climate change seriously. There are scores of programs and policies that have been trashed by Tony Abbott and his government. A particularly egregious cut is the abolition of ARENA, the renewable energy agency. This action is a loud declaration that the Abbott government is addicted to carbon-intensive energy. Tied to  this, although not a budget initiative, is the review of the previously bi-partisan Renewable Energy Target, with climate denier Dick Warburton appointed as review head. Before the election, there were clear statements made that an Abbott government would continue to support the renewable energy target. Greg Hunt, the environment minister, said before the election that the Coalition ""does agree on the renewable energy target"" and ""support the RET, the 20 per cent"". The cut to ARENA and the review of Australia's renewable energy target is a breathtaking assault on the $18 billion renewable energy sector, and introduces substantial elements of sovereign risk for companies and people considering investing in this area in Australia. Before last year's election, the Coalition repeatedly promised to keep ARENA. In opposition, the Coalition supported ARENA. The Clean Energy Council has also expressed major concerns, a rare event for a body that has to keep governments on side. In a statement, the CEC deputy CEO said: ""A global race for renewable energy is on, and the removal of ARENA will see potential Australian and international investors now look to countries with much stronger support for renewable energy innovation, meaning we may well miss out on billions of dollars of investment and highly-skilled jobs."" (The Coalition had previously promised to remove funding for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, an ideologically motivated decision based on Abbott's view that it was ""socialism masquerading as environmentalism"".) Other renewable and clean energy programs have also been scrapped, such as the One Million Solar Roofs program, research into carbon capture and storage technology, the Clean Technology Program, the Cleaner Fuels grant scheme, and more. There is a real risk that the result of the RET review will see the end of the renewable energy target, once a bi-partisan policy. Removing or reducing the renewable energy target, currently 20 percent by 2020, would effectively lock Australia to a carbon-intensive, fossil fuel addicted future. Climate change remains a serious and present threat to Australia's society and economy. Major global economic forces are moving to clean energy and low carbon technologies. China for example is planning to triple its solar capacity by 2017, and other major economies including US states and nations in the EU are heading in that direction also. To do nothing about climate change, as the Australian government now appears committed to, is immoral and amounts to abandoning both current and future generations. Australia's social compact has been built around the government ensuring safety, prosperity and freedom; the cuts to Australia's social safety-net (in the form of $80 billion in cuts to health and education) is doubly cruel when you consider that it is the most vulnerable who are impacted by the effects of global warming. Climate change is a direct threat to Australia's future prosperity and safety. The trashing of Australia's renewable energy sector removes the last pretense that this government would take climate change seriously. No one who accepts the dangers of global warming would destroy their nation's renewable energy capacity, or the fossil fuel industry's incentives to develop carbon capture technology. (The bitter pill is that the Abbott government plans to keep billions of dollars worth of corporate fossil fuel subsidies with the diesel rebate, while increasing the  excise for individual motorists.) There are many other instances in the budget – too many to name – that should leave the Australian public, and the global community, under no doubt that the government is run by climate deniers. It is clear now that the carbon price introduced by the former Labor government must be ferociously defended, and the government's discredited ""direct action"" policy opposed. As an economic reform, the combination of the trading scheme and a steadily reducing cap on emissions is essential to both reduce Australia's carbon emissions, and to ensure Australia remains a constructive player in global efforts. It remains to be seen how the new Senate, where coal magnate Clive Palmer holds the balance of power, will act, but it is clear that both Labor and the Greens will block the repeal of the carbon price under the current senate. To its credit, Labor has remained firm in its support for an emissions trading scheme with a cap. Australia sweltered through one of the hottest summers on record, and the winter of 2014 is preparing to match or break heat records. For people who do take global warming seriously, efforts to halt the Australian government's reckless agenda now rests on the Senate. The unseasonably hot May demonstrates yet again the pressing moral urgency of climate action; the assault on the renewable energy sector is yet another symptom of the moral failures of Abbott's government."
"A 300-year-old country mansion is to get environmentally-friendly heating from the ocean with the UK's biggest marine source heat pump, the National Trust said. The technology installed off the North Wales coast will provide all the power needed to heat the National Trust's Plas Newydd mansion, which sits on the shores of the Menai Strait looking across the mountains of Snowdonia.  The 18th century stately home was the trust's biggest oil consumer, using around 1,500 litres of oil on some winter days. Now it is switching to a £600,000 marine source heat pump, which will use sea water pumped to a heat exchanger onshore to create the heat needed to warm the entire house. The 300-kilowatt marine source heat pump, one of the first such systems in the UK and the biggest, according to the National Trust, is expected to save the charity £40,000 a year in costs for Plas Newydd.  It is the first of five schemes being completed in a £5.3m pilot phase of the trust's renewable energy investment programme. If the five pilot schemes are successful, the National Trust plans to invest in 43 renewables projects at the places it looks after, as part of commitments to reduce energy use by a fifth, halve fossil fuel consumption and generate 50% of its energy from renewables. Adam Ellis-Jones, assistant director for operations in Wales at the National Trust, said: ""With the Irish Sea right on the doorstep of Plas Newydd, a marine source heat pump is the best option for us.  ""However being a pioneer is never easy. There are very few marine source heat pumps and none of this size in the UK, so it has been a challenging project but an exciting one."" He said the trust worked closely with coastal and marine experts and conservationists to get the best from the technology while protecting the fragile environment and archaeology of the site. Patrick Begg, rural enterprises director at the National Trust, said: ""It's clear to us that we need to make big changes so that we can continue to protect our treasured places and tackle the impact of climate change.  This successful scheme marks a major step forwards in our clean energy journey."" The other pilot schemes being developed by the National Trust are a biomass at Croft Castle, Herefordshire, a woodchip boiler for Ickworth in Suffolk and hydro-electric projects at Hafod y Porth in Snowdonia and Stickle Ghyll in the Lake District."

"The ongoing collapse of a large part of the Antarctica ice sheet could devastate global food supply, drowning vast areas of crop lands across the Middle East and Asia, according to new research. The report, Advancing Global Food Supply in the Face of a Changing Climate, urges the Obama Administration to step up research funding – especially in developing countries – to help make up a projected gap in future food supply.  It also warns America's corn belt could face yield declines of more than 25% by mid-century - unless there are new advances in agriculture to compensate for hotter temperatures, changing rainfall and more aggressive weeds and pests under climate change.  The report, due to be released at a high-level conference in Washington DC on Thursday, is the first to factor in the effects of the slow-motion collapse of the Western Antarctica ice sheet on future food security. Two independent studies last week warned the retreat of the Western Antarctica ice sheet was unstoppable – and could lead to sea-level rise of up to four metres over the coming centuries.  Those rising seas would displace millions of people from low-lying coastal areas - and wipe out rice-growing areas across Asia, Gerald Nelson, a University of Illinois economist and author of Thurday's report, said. ""That sea-level rise would take out half of Bangladesh and mostly wipe out productive rice regions in Vietnam,"" Nelson told The Guardian. ""It would have a major effect on Egyptian agricultural areas."" The projected levels of sea-level rise, due to the retreat of ice in West Antarctica, pose a far greater threat to future food supply even than that envisaged in the United Nations' IPCC report in March, Nelson said. ""A sea level rise of three metres over the next 100 years is much more likely than the IPCC thought possible,"" the report said.  In terms of absolute land loss, China would be at risk of losing more than 3 million hectares. Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar could lose more than 1 million hectares, the report said. The potential loss of viable crop land underscores the urgent need for new breakthrough technologies to increase agricultural productivity to keep pace with growing world population, the report said.   ""Agriculture is a huge world-wide industry that requires stable weather, 'or else', and we might just be entering the 'or else' period,"" Dan Glickman, agriculture secretary under Bill Clinton and a co-chairman of the conference, told The Guardian. ""The question is: 'are we doing the right kind of research at our universities, at the department of agriculture, or in the private sector to deal with those changes? We need more and more applied research to help us move those numbers up. That is the real challenge for scientists."" The increasing agricultural yields of the last 50 years have already slowed down or plateaued – even before climate change is taken into account. By mid-century, those declines will make it increasingly difficult for farmers to maintain the increases in crop yields needed to feed a growing population. According to some computer models included in the report, projected growth in yields in America's corn belt could drop by 25% by 2050– unless there are breakthroughs in agricultural research – because of higher temperatures, uncertain rainfall, and more aggressive weeds and pests under climate change. ""We have got to figure out how to get plants to continue performance when average temperatures go up, and we don't know how to do that,"" Nelson said. ""We need 60% more food generally, and this will make it harder to get there,"" he said."
"The government must urgently establish a strategic authority to oversee the future growth of Britain's ageing energy infrastructure, a study argues on Tuesday . Academics at Newcastle University challenge the government's market-based approach, saying the £100bn needed to secure energy security is not being delivered by a fragmented system that lacks central direction.  The academics, led by Prof Phil Taylor, argue that the country needs a ""systems architect"" and that energy, at least for the bulk of the population, is too cheap, which is leading to waste. While the Labour party has already said it wants an energy security board, one leading figure in the industry has said that Taylor was highlighting that ""nobody is in charge"" of the country's energy policy. Before Tuesday's launch of the university's latest energy briefing note, Taylor, who leads its Institute for Research on Sustainability, said: ""The current pricing model does not accurately reflect the high economic and environmental cost of generating, storing and distributing energy. In fact, because of the way energy is sold today, it becomes cheaper the more we use. This is unsustainable. ""Although we must make sure people can afford to heat their homes, for the majority of us energy is actually too cheap – this is why we leave lights on, keep appliances running and use machines at peak times when energy costs more."" The research paper describes the energy system as fragmented and, while it does not mention the role of the National Grid, which looks after the pipes and pylons, makes clear there needs to be a new body above that, but below government, which can oversee planning and development. It also wants the government to help find ways to store low carbon energy efficiently and effectively in times of high supply so it can be released during periods of high demand, or to keep the lights on after storms have damaged the power network. The academics call on ministers to work with the energy industry to fundamentally change the way energy is priced. The briefing note says: ""Energy providers should be rewarded for providing tools and techniques that help customers use energy efficiently and cost-effectively."" The leading industry figure, who asked not to be named, said: ""This is all very sensitive. The assumption has been that the government and the National Grid are in charge but they don't provide solutions, just a framework for the market to decide. That has only produced multiple policies and regulatory intrusion. We cannot go on this way."" The industrialist said a systems architect could perform functions similar to those of a strategic rail authority or even the Bank of England, but that there was no reason why this could not be done by the private sector. The body would need to involve commercial, technical and environmental experts as well, perhaps, as social scientists. Meanwhile, the university paper believes too much of the debate within Westminster has focused on issues of affordability and emissions reduction while ignoring other vital issues such as the energy sector's use of water. ""This thinking risks locking the UK into a future in which water availability could put energy security at risk, and power stations could be forced to reduce production or even shut down if there isn't sufficient water available to keep them safely operational."" These kinds of arguments are increasingly being raised in different forms around the industry. A group of energy experts set up by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) warned before Christmas that ""whole system"" thinking was needed for the power grid to ensure the lights stayed on in Britain."

"For almost 25 years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released regular assessment reports warning the world of the dangers of climate change. The scientific knowledge that has been accumulated over this time is astonishing in its breadth and scope. Compiling, collating and synthesising publications from dozens of scientific disciplines, and distilling this into a format that policymakers from across the globe can use as the basis of their national policies on climate change is a phenomenal, painstaking and noble undertaking.  But from the perspective of catalysing a proportionate political and public response to climate change, the reports have had limited impact. Despite all the rebuttals of sceptics' arguments, and the ""myth busting"", public opinion is no further advanced than it was when the IPCC first started producing its reports. In the UK, where policymakers have accepted the IPCC's conclusions and recommendations for more than a decade, public engagement with climate change has regressed since the mid-2000s and the political consensus has begun to unravel. In a report released yesterday by the Climate Outreach & Information Network, we argue that although the IPCC is succeeding in its aim of presenting facts about climate change to policy makers, this role reflects an outdated model of how science is incorporated into society, and how social change occurs. Catalysing a proportionate political and public response to climate change means rethinking how climate change is communicated: from science to human stories. Based on interviews with 16 leading climate change communicators from the media and NGOs in the UK, the report makes a seven recommendations for transforming the role of the IPCC. Our central argument is that IPCC outputs must be coupled with human stories and powerful narratives which can bring the science to life. In a recent piece for the New Statesman magazine, the Sarah Ditum argued that ""the left is addicted to 'smartarse debunking.' But arguments are won by telling human stories."" A similar argument could be made about climate science communicators. Stories are the means by which people make sense of the world, learn values, form beliefs, and give shape to their lives. Stories are everywhere; in myth, comedy, and stained glass windows. But for the most part, they are absent from climate change communication. The careful, considered science and statistics of the IPCC cannot compete with the siren stories of climate change scepticism or the priorities of parts of the right-wing media (where one man's fight against a wind turbine trumps a thousand scientists setting out the case for decarbonisation). To engage the public, the IPCC needs to work with a range of partners who can weave stories with cultural credibility from the science: how will climate change affect the things people love? In addition, by reorienting and restructuring the IPCC – so that it provides science ""on demand"", tailored to the needs of different audiences and stakeholders – its relevance and influence could drastically increase. Do policymakers need a mammoth report every five years? Are the scientists involved making best use of their time? If the IPCC was structured in order to catalyse a proportionate public and political response to climate change, the assessment reports would be turned on their head and would start from the needs of their audiences. These audiences would be defined by their capacity to bring about rapid social, technological and economic change. This would likely involve policymakers, but it would certainly not be limited to this group. What does the construction sector need to know about climate change to create low-carbon infrastructure? How can conservationists get the facts they need about climate change to design programmes for adaptation? How will programmes of health care for the elderly be impacted in a changing climate? These changes would not be easy to implement. But if they seem like a considerable undertaking, then it is worth reflecting on how many person-hours have been poured into the IPCC process over almost a quarter of a century, and how lacklustre the political and public response has been. The terms of the IPCC are ultimately set by the governments that comprise the UN. This means that they can be changed by putting pressure on those who jointly oversee the funding and procedure of the organisation. By working with a range of partners whose stories can lend cultural credibility to the scientific consensus – voices and groups from across the social and political spectrum – the science of the IPCC can be brought to life.

"Last week, senator Marco Rubio, by many counts a rising star in conservative political circles in the US, answered simple questions put to him on climate change. His comments are particularly striking in that they follow a major report put out by the US administration and respected scientists on the observations we are already making of climate change. That report, the National Climate Assessment, points to increases in floods, more severe droughts, heavier precipitation, rising sea levels, and other markers of climate change.    The report also highlights the tremendous economic costs of climate change, costs that will get worse if we fail to act. It is also striking because his own state, Florida, is a state that is particularly threatened by climate change. Try saving Miami as sea level rises. So what did Rubio say? First he said that he doesn’t believe the scientists when they say there are actions we can take today that would have an impact on solving the problem.  This statement flies in the face of facts. It is a fact that if we reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases, we will lessen the degree and thereby the impact of climate change. This fact has been reported in numerous separate studies as well as in synthesis reports. Rubio then continues by saying that the climate is always changing but that scientists take a handful of decades of research and say that this is now evidence of a longer term trend that is directly and almost solely attributable to manmade activity The fail here is huge. First, scientists don’t look at just a “few decades”. There is a whole branch of study called paleoclimatology. This branch of science goes back hundreds of thousands to millions of years in order to assess the relationship between our atmosphere and the climate. In fact, I published a paper on this topic recently hoping to improve paleoclimate studies. And don’t forget the scientists who, in the 1800s, warned of changes to the climate as we emit greenhouse gases. Was that just a few decades ago? But notice that Rubio tries to be careful with his choice of words. He says “directly” and “almost solely attributable” to manmade activity. Was he careful enough? Not quite.  We scientists know that humans are directly responsible for the majority of climate change in the past few decades. Furthermore, the longer term trend is almost solely attributable to humans. Sure, there are temperature fluctuations year-to-year, just as we have weather fluctuations. But the trend is us. We have overwhelmed the natural climatic cycles. Rubio also stated that he does not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way that scientists are portraying it This statement flies in the face of actual real-world evidence we have been collecting over the past decade. These may be his opinions, but they are unsupported by fact. I have said this before but it is worth repeating. How we handle climate change should not be a political issue.   The climate change we are seeing, and will see, affects us all. I don’t know a single conservative or progress politician who wants to harm the climate. I know many conservatives that take our treatment of the Earth’s natural system seriously. I also know conservatives who recognise that doing nothing about climate change is a choice. It is a choice with tremendous economic consequences. When we look back on this issue, at the legacies that are being created right now, conservatives will regret making climate obstructionism a litmus test for their politicians."
"Most city-dwellers are big fans of green spaces, with the benefits to health and community well-being evident in the data. There's more to it though - adding more commons, parks and greens could also shelter British cities from the full effect of global warming. Since the beginning of the 20th century global temperature has increased by 0.8C (1.44F), with two thirds of warming occurring since 1975. Temperature increase from now until 2050 is expected to be increasingly rapid, with human activity the dominant cause of warming.​ Climate change is set to bring hotter, drier summers over the next three decades with urban dwellings - already generally warmer than rural areas - due to take the brunt. This is because roads, pavements and buildings absorb a relatively high amount of heat. As Britian gets hotter, this 'urban heat island effect' will bring with it extra drought and extended periods with high temperatures for our cities. By 2050 the extreme readings associated with current heatwaves are expected to be the norm while by the end of the century they may even seem mild.                                                   The data highlights that an increase in green spaces within UK cities, including trees, parks, gardens, green roofs and waterways, could help to combat future increases in temperature.  This is despite the fact that, at least in England, there has been a relatively drastic cut in the financial support for England's parks and open spaces. Focusing upon Greater Manchester, one of the most populous city in the UK, a10% increase in green space could keep temperatures at or below present levels into the 2050s, despite a changing climate. Across Greater Manchester on average, the temperature will increase by 1.4C (2.5F) from baseline to 2050 as a result of climate change, from 21.8C (71.24F) to 23.2C (73.8F). This is a substantial rise of over 6%. The map above shows how the temperature would expect to increase within the city currently. An increase of 10% in cooling green space within the city over the same period could maintain temperatures at existing levels, with temperature only increasing by 0.1C (0.18F) 2050. The map below shows the change in temperature if green space within the city increased as described previously.  It may even substantially reduce temperatures. If it was implemented there is a predicted decrease of 1.5C (2.7F) in the city centre of Manchester for 2050 where existing green space is lowest. Investment in green space within urban areas in the UK could help to prevent the expected discomfort, health risks and increased mortality associated with rising summer temperatures in the UK. The map below shows the baseline temperature (average for 1961-1990) for Greater Manchester. The second map shows the forecasted temperatures for 2050. The temperature data used is from the UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09) which are designed to help communities to adapt to climate change. The projections have been continuously updated with evolving climate science. It uses the most likely of the UK climate projections for 2050, a 'high emissions scenario' with a 50% probability. This is compared to average or 'baseline' temperatures for the period 1961-1990. The temperature values are summer temperatures that will occur on the two warmest days of the year.   The data was generated using the STAR Tools, a tool developed by the University of Manchester and The Mersey Forest available and can be used to generate similar data for other locations in the UK.

"Climate change is a scientific fact, and increasingly a lived human experience. But it is not yet what sociologists call ""a social fact"". It's not an integral part of the way we shape our social practices, nor a significant enough cultural norm to act as a constraint on our behaviour. The signifiers of climate change are part of the problem; we are supposed to see ourselves in the melting ice, the plaintive polar bears and the hockey-stick graphs, but most of us simply don't. There has been a fundamental failure in the way in which the idea of climate change has been communicated, based on a misunderstanding both of human nature and the systemic nature of the challenge.  What climate change means – and by extension how we should collectively mobilise a meaningful response to it – remains stubbornly stuck, like a broken record, on a problematic vision of 'The Science' translating into a comically generic injunction for Action, with most of the difficult ethical, cultural, political and economic questions left implicit, for policymakers to work out, as if they were equipped for such a task. As argued in a recent Royal Society of Arts (RSA) report a major cause and consequence of this inertia is that even those who broadly accept the facts of climate change struggle to see themselves either as part of the problem or the solution. No wonder then that our societal response has been lacking precisely those personal qualities – passion, honesty, tenacity, and vision – that the issue demands of us. ""Framing"" is rapidly becoming a buzzword in debates about climate change, and will not by itself keep fossil fuels in the ground. But we do need a way of thinking and speaking that captures the fact that climate change is not merely one of many environmental problems, but a completely unique collective action problem, and one that is implicated in every aspect of our lives. As previously argued by Jonathan Rowson we need a framing that is complex enough to highlight the competing commitments (eg to energy security, fuel prices, and economic growth) that militate against many forms of action, but also one that's simple enough to be a shared reference point. A systematic unpacking of the relationship between these Seven Dimensions of climate change: science, technology, law, economy, democracy, culture, behaviour, is our attempt to satisfy both these constraints. A major new collaboration by the RSA and the Climate Outreach & Information Network (COIN), funded by the Climate Change Collaboration, will catalyse a series of conversations about how we might use this framing to help develop, in effect, a social identity for climate change. The aim is to begin weaving a network of representatives from across these diverse backgrounds and convene a series of seven public events at the RSA exploring the interaction between them, leading to a final report in 2015. We can't capture the full range of potential interactions in this post, but here are a few pointers on what might we expect from such discussions: So much of our legitimate fear stems from the models, measurements, probabilities and predictions of climate science as our most objective reference point and shared touchstone. But so much of our hope rests in the applied sciences of technology to, for instance, make renewable energy at scale feasible, affordable and swift. Even the most hardened techno-optimist will recognise that we also need law, to give us regulations without which we can't get national and international incentives for technological development or constraints on fossil fuel production at sufficient scale and speed. There are limits to such constraints though, because the consumption-based growth imperative that shapes the global economy is not going anywhere fast, and there is no long term solution that doesn't factor in a new economic vision. There is little hope of that kind of transformative change happening unless we can mobilise and channel civic and political will in ways that allow us to take sound collective decisions, which means democracy has to deliver. But where will such will and conviction come from if not from media, social media, art, music; the ideas, ideals and visions of culture? And who is going to really 'act' to make all this happen if not people in all these dimensions of their own lives, through changes in their behaviour? Essential but neglected discussions between these two distinct families of approaches can be tackled through framing. By capturing the need both for technical solutions relating to levers that can be pulled within our current system or paradigm (science, technology, law) and adaptive challenges (behaviour, culture, democracy) relating to personal, political and social progress that could potentially yield a more fundamental transformation. Changes in the economy typically feature both technical solutions (eg carbon taxes) and adaptive challenges (eg shorter working weeks) and might be seen as a bridge between the two. The framing has a holographic quality, in that if you look through a particular lens you begin to see the other dimensions there too. Consider Shell's recent statement (technology) that their business model (economy) relying on fossil fuel extraction remains safe from ""the carbon bubble""; a scenario in which current balance sheet assets lose their massive value and become ""stranded"" as governments respond to explanations and predictions on devastating climatic changes (science) by legislating (law) against the extraction of fossil fuels due to political pressure (democracy). Shell justified themselves on the basis that energy demand is going to keep rising (behaviour) and implicitly on fossil fuels not becoming stigmatised due to the growth of divestment strategies (culture). Viewed in this way, investors with an interest in renewable energy technologies would be well advised to get talking to very different kinds of ""tribe"", including student divestment movements, and this is just one of many examples. There is something in the seven dimensions for anyone to get their teeth into – this is a way of beginning to think about climate change that invites widespread debate and contestation, not the uniform agreement of a niche minority, which keeps us exactly where we are.

"Climate scientists are canaries in the coalmine - highly attuned to sense danger before we blunder into it. For decades, various researchers have issued calamitous warnings about climate change. But was there a moment when science collectively, definitively, dropped off the perch? During the 1990s, scientists were still debating the most basic assertions of climate change science. Was the world indeed warming? Consensus was growing, but slowly and many scientists remained undecided.  Two bold scientific statements bookended the decade – James Hansen's statement to the US senate in 1988 and the 1999 hockey stick graph. Maligned and celebrated, the two were influential in bringing climate change into the public consciousness. Yet both were accused of using unproven methods to reach their conclusions, damaging the credibility of climate science and paving an easy road for denialism. Hansen, head of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told the energy and natural resources committee of the United States Senate in 1988 that his research on human-induced global warming was unequivocal. ""The greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now."" The next day, the New York Times ran the headline ""Global Warming Has Begun"". It was a galvanising moment for public opinion and Hansen became a poster boy for the environment movement, but not all were convinced. ""Hansen was a scientist that bumped right up against the edge of activism and a lot of scientists have been very uncomfortable going over into that. And rightly so ... if you're seen too much as an activist then people won't trust your science,"" said Marshall Shepherd, 2013 president of American Meteorological Society. The US National Climate Assessment (NCA), released last week, echoed Hansen's words 26 years later: ""Climate change is already affecting the American people"". But even the NCA, built as it was on the work of 800 scientists, has been criticised for a lack of nuance.To maintain credibility, climate science must walk the narrow ledge between conservatism and activism. Some scientists feel the hockey stick graph, published in 1999, dangled both feet over this edge. Michael Mann, Raymond Bradley and Malcolm Hughes used data gathered from tree rings, lake sediments, ice cores and corals to recreate the global temperature over the past 1,000 years. The image they produced was a startling visual communiqué of the world's post-industrial warming trend. It was featured prominently in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 2001 report. But Mann et al's willingness to use unproven methodology irked some scientists, including Hulme: ""I don't think it was seminal for scientists. To me that was never a decisive interventional piece of evidence. The data was absolutely scanty."" Shepherd disagrees. ""I think it would be characterised as a watershed moment in climate science,"" he says, although he recognises it as ""one of the singular most polarising graphs or scientific pieces of data that exist"". The problem for Mann and Hansen is the world wants to see all the canaries keeling over together, a clear public moment of unequivocal proof. Shepherd says the public wrongly see science like a court case, in which reasonable doubt can outweigh a larger body of evidence. But science has a natural indifference to the desire for certainty. Each time a scientist gets too far ahead of the curve it makes the scientific community deeply uncomfortable. Disagreements of this kind can be latched onto as evidence that the scientific process is flawed, fuelling the denial movement. Consensus on climate change built incrementally through the 1990s until, by the time the 2001 IPCC report came out (with the hockey stick graph in it), there were very few scientists who felt uncomfortable attributing some climate change to human activity. But Hulme says there was no collective eureka moment and there will always be doubt and questions. ""Science doesn't really do that. It is always an unending process of confirmation, correction, refutation … It is the collective social practice of science that in the end gives science its particular credibility and status. But it's a rather harder thing to get to the bottom of because you can't just focus on one charismatic individual."" Notably absent from the consensus building of the 1990s were the voices of climate scientists from developing countries, says Chandra Bhushan, deputy director of the Centre for Science and Environment  in Delhi. For the most part, this was because the research was simply not happening. But increased interest from political leaders during this time led some countries (mainly in the Indian subcontinent, China and southeast Asia) to implement climate science programmes. Even so, the imbalance perpetuates today. Bhushan says climate scientists from the south ""still play a very little role in developing consensus on climate change negotiations."" The latest IPCC report drew more than 90% of its research material from developed countries. Scientists participate in the compiling of IPCC reports with funding from their governments, meaning wealthy countries can afford to participate more in the process. This has the effect, Bushan argues, of politicising the reports, which he says have focussed unduly on the impacts of climate change on the developed world.

"The climate sceptic organisation founded by former chancellor Nigel Lawson is to set up a new campaigning arm, which would be free from charity regulations. The Global Warming Policy Foundation, which is classified as an educational charity and thus covered by strict Charity Commission rules that restrict its ability to conduct political campaigns, said that the new non-charitable company would undertake ""activities which do not fall squarely within the educational remit of the charity"".  Similar structures are also used by some other non-profit organisations, because it gives them greater freedom in lobbying and in some commercial activities. The new arm, to be called the Global Warming Policy Forum, will share the same website and initials and publish reports and research papers, as well as organising lectures and debates on science and policy. In particular, it will put out news articles and opinion columns through a section of its website. If the Charity Commission agrees with the restructuring, the new organisation will start operating by the end of July. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, last year complained to the Charity Commission, over what he saw as the dissemination by the GWPF of ""misleading and inaccurate"" information. Charity Commission rules require organisations granted charitable status – which allows them, and their donors, to benefit from favourable tax treatment – to ensure that any information they put out is fair and as accurate as possible. Ward said: ""I think it is apparent that this move is designed to get around Charity Commission rules that specify that it must not disseminate inaccurate information. It is a deeply cynical move by the Foundation to avoid any formal requirement that they should stop misleading the public with inaccurate information. However, I hope now that it will be more obvious that when Lord Lawson speaks about climate change, it is as a campaigner rather than as an expert. And at least its secret donors will no longer be able to claim tax relief on funding the Foundation's political propaganda."" Greenpeace, which was named by the GWPF as an organisation that operates a campaigning arm as well as its core charity, told the Guardian: ""They do say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."" But he said that if Lord Lawson really wants to emulate Greenpeace's structure he should be open about where his funding comes from and ""root his political campaign in the reality of climate science."" The GWPF does not disclose the names of organisations or individuals who provide its funding, but says that fossil fuel companies are not among them.  Benny Peiser, of the GWPF, said Ward's complaints had not come up in the discussions with the commission. He added: ""Our charitable status has not changed and we will continue with our objectives, only more effectively now."" • This article was amended on 13 May 2014 to include a statement from the Global Warming Policy Forum."
"I have frequently criticized flawed analyses from economists or political scientists regarding climate change and its impacts. An excellent recent criticism was written by Bob Ward from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.  Ward has been in a public battle to achieve corrections relating to the work of economics professor Richard Tol. Richard Tol is at the University of Sussex; he is well-known in the climate circles as someone who has been a proponent arguing for potential benefits from modest climate change to society and economies.  Back in October 2013, Ward reviewed Tol's work after it was publicly cited by Matt Ridley in the Spectator. I had also criticized Matt Ridley's writings as not representing the views of the scientific community.  Ward's findings were striking. He reported,  ""Viscount Ridley drew primarily on an academic paper by Professor Tol which was published in the 'Journal of Economic Perspectives'. The study drew together a number of estimates of the aggregate economic impacts of climate change and concluded that global warming of up to 2.2°C would have a net beneficial impact for the world However, when I examined Tol's paper in detail, I discovered that he had made a number of errors, wrongly plotting studies which had found net negative impacts as if they were positive benefits. Of the 14 data listed in Table 1 and plotted in Figure 1 of the paper, at least four were wrong."" When you put all of these mistakes together, there was only one of Tol's studies that showed a significant positive impact from climate change. That study, published in 2002 suggested a 2.3% effect on global wealth with a 1°C temperature rise. Even there however, Tol admitted that many impacts of climate change were omitted which will change the results. When I challenged Professor Tol on this point, he identified a second paper which showed a very small potential positive economic impact of 0.1% as climate change progresses, which I think we can agree is not significant. Ward ""exchanged email with Professor Tol to confirm that his 2009 paper contained mistakes, but he refused to give any undertaking to write to the journal to correct them."" Ward wrote, ""I then decided to check some of the other analyses that Professor Tol had published on the economic impacts. Sure enough, I found some of the same mistakes in a paper published in 2012 in 'Environmental and Resource Economics' and in 2013 in the 'Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control'."" Ward found that Tol made multiple errors in his 2013 publication. In the end, it was still only Tol's own work which showed significant economic benefits with climate change. In January 2014, Ward extended his investigation to a leaked version of the final draft of the IPCC Working Group 2 report. There, chapter 10 had a section which was largely based on Tol's own work. This material had not appeared in previous drafts of the report and so had not been made available to expert reviewers of the report, like Ward. The final draft contained multiple errors in Table 10.B.1 and in Figure 10-1; some of which stemmed from the Tol 2013 article. And there was still only the Tol study that showed significant positive impacts, yet the text of chapter 10 stated that ""Estimates agree on the size of the impact (small relative to economic growth) but disagree on the sign."" So Ward wrote to Professor Tol, authors of the IPCC report, and editors of the journals where the errors had appeared to seek corrections. He also asked the journal editors to make available the calculations used by Tol for his papers, so that the rest of the results could be checked for further inaccuracies. As Ward recounted in a commentary,  ""Disappointingly, none of the journals have so far secured an agreement from Professor Tol to make his calculations available, which means that a number of the data included in Chapter 10 of the IPCC report remain unverifiable. For this reason, I remain concerned about the following statement from the Summary for Policymakers from the report: ""the incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of ~2°C are between 0.2 and 2% of income (±1 standard deviation around the mean)"". These figures are drawn entirely from Professor Tol's 2013 paper, and without independent verification of the data currently being possible, I do not regard them to have been proven robust. Furthermore, the version of Chapter 10 that has been published on the IPCC's website is the draft that was distributed to governments in October 2013, and still contains at least three erroneous data points in Table 10.B.1 and Figure 10-1. The text of Section 10.9.2 remains a highly misleading description of the data: ""Estimates agree on the size of the impact (small relative to economic growth) but disagree on the sign"". As I indicated earlier, I wrote to Richard Tol and put some of these complaints to him. Of the six complaints I posed to him, he agreed with three. The only two items he took issue with have facts which do not support his view. In particular, regarding chapter 10 of the IPCC report, conceded that new material was added to the report but that, ""Earlier drafts discuss the same material but without a comprehensive assessment. Peculiarly there was a misattribution of estimates; and one key new study was overlooked."" It is time for us to move beyond these endless debates and begin working together on solutions that are cost effective ways to deal with climate change. The more we delay the greater will be the future costs to us and our children. • Richard Tol responds to John Abraham •This footnote was added on 9 May 2014 and updated on 24 July 2014: This article has been amended to correct the number of complaints that Richard Tol agreed with – it previously said four – and to remove a reference to Richard Tol agreeing with Bob Ward in the paragraph regarding chapter 10 of the IPCC report."
"Below the jump, I mention the books that I received recently. They are gifts, review copies that arrived in the mail, or books that I purchased. These are the books that I may review in more depth later, either here or in print somewhere in the world.     When I get new books, I like to share them with people. Unfortunately, you are all so far away, so I cannot host a book party in my crib where you can look them over, so I'll do the next best thing. I'll host a book party on my blog each Friday of the week when I either purchase books or when they arrive in the mail. In this New Book Party, I will try to be your eyes by presenting my quick ""first impression"" -- almost as if we are browsing the shelves in a bookstore -- and I'll also provide relevant videos about the book and links so you can get a copy of your own.   Philosophy Bites Back by David Edmonds and Nigel Warburton [Oxford University Press, 2014; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK; Amazon US/kindle US] Publisher's synopsis Philosophy Bites Back is the second book to come out of the hugely successful podcast Philosophy Bites. It presents a selection of lively interviews with leading philosophers of our time, who discuss the ideas and works of some of the most important thinkers in history. From the ancient classics of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, to the groundbreaking modern thought of Wittgenstein, Rawls, and Derrida, this volume spans over two and a half millennia of western philosophy and illuminates its most fascinating ideas. My first impression: I am not generally attracted to books that are transcripts of interviews, but the interviewees are so articulate and the conversations are so interesting that I am enjoying this book. For example, the discussion with John Dunn about John Locke's ideas about toleration provides so much insight into how ideas about toleration have changed over the centuries (Locke viewed toleration only in the context of religious belief), and why religious people feel so threatened by atheists. In another chapter, Mary Warnock discusses Jean-Paul Sartre's ideas about bad faith -- making me realise that, according to Sartre, nearly every person alive today could be accused of bad faith. Ironically, Warnock says Sartre's later book, the incomprehensible Critique of Dialectical Reason, was in bad faith. Although the chapters move from the earliest to the most recent philosophers in chronological order, it's not necessary to read them in order.   Tambora: The Eruption That Changed the World by Gillen D'Arcy Wood [Princeton University Press, 2014; Guardian Bookshop; Amazon UK/audio download UK; Amazon US/kindle US/Audible US] Publisher's synopsis When Indonesia's Mount Tambora erupted in 1815, it unleashed the most destructive wave of extreme weather the world has witnessed in thousands of years. The volcano's massive sulfate dust cloud enveloped the Earth, cooling temperatures and disrupting major weather systems for more than three years. Amid devastating storms, drought, and floods, communities worldwide endured famine, disease, and civil unrest on a catastrophic scale. On the eve of the bicentenary of the great eruption, Tambora tells the extraordinary story of the weather chaos it wrought, weaving the latest climate science with the social history of this frightening period to offer a cautionary tale about the potential tragic impacts of drastic climate change in our own century.The year following Tambora's eruption became known as the ""Year without a Summer,"" when weather anomalies in Europe and New England ruined crops, displaced millions, and spawned chaos and disease. Here, for the first time, Gillen D'Arcy Wood traces Tambora's full global and historical reach: how the volcano's three-year climate change regime initiated the first worldwide cholera pandemic, expanded opium markets in China, set the stage for Ireland's Great Famine, and plunged the United States into its first economic depression. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein's monster, inspired by Tambora's terrifying storms, embodied the fears and misery of global humanity during this transformative period, the most recent sustained climate crisis the world has faced.Bringing the history of this planetary emergency grippingly to life, Tambora sheds light on the fragile interdependence of climate and human societies, and the threat a new era of extreme global weather poses to us all.My first impression: Growing up in the Pacific ""ring of fire"" made it easy for me to be fascinated by volcanoes. The jar of grey flour-like volcanic ash that I collected a couple days after Mt Saint Helens exploded almost in my backyard is the only object that I have carried with me throughout my entire life as I've relocated to a number of countries. So of course, I'm always interested to read yet another book about a volcano. This book traces the history of the massive Tambora eruption and its aftermath but the author goes one step further: he explores the climactic patterns caused by Tambora's eruption and compares them to the effects of modern day global warming. The book is beautifully illustrated with black-and-white maps, paintings, drawings, photographs and diagrams that help the author develop his ideas, although at least one of those figures would be clearer if it was in colour -- I am specifically referring to figure 0.1. Oh, and speaking of diagrams, I was blown away by figure 9.1 (p. 202), which shows the summer storm of 6 June 1816 that enveloped most of New England.  What book(s) are you reading? How far are you along in the book? What do you think of it so far? Do you think your book is worth recommending to others? .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

"""There is nothing left here. We don't have electricity, we don't have gas, we have an acute shortage of water, so what is left for us?"" This is how a woman in Lahore, Pakistan, expressed her frustration to researchers for Climate Asia, the largest study in Asia on people's perceptions of changes in climate.  Pakistan stood out from the other countries included in the study – India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and China – because of this strong sense of despair. It was the only country of all seven in which more people thought life had become worse in the past five years, both in rural areas and big cities. Climate Asia, which surveyed more than 4,000 people across the country, found that lack of electricity, not having enough food and not having enough clean water were people's biggest worries. High inflation was also mentioned as putting a lot of pressure on their lives. And these worries were aggravated by perceived changes in climate and the environment, namely rising temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, shifts in seasons and saline water intrusion, which people said affected agricultural productivity and access to water. People in Pakistan were noticing these changes over the years despite only a quarter of respondents saying they had heard the term ""climate change"" before, and despite 15% saying that they had heard the term but did not know what it meant. In more than any other country surveyed in the region, people in Pakistan thought these changes in weather and in availability of water, food, electricity and fuel, were currently having a high impact on their lives, their lifestyles and health. Pakistan also stood out for the low confidence people had in national, provincial and local governments taking the necessary actions to help them respond to changes in water, food, energy supply or extreme weather events. More than 70% of people surveyed said that they had little or no confidence in government to help them on these issues. People in Pakistan had more confidence in their neighbourhoods than in any institution. ""The floods have taught us that we need to solve our own problems,"" one community leader in Badin told us. Moreover, despite the feeling of despair, people in Pakistan who were responding in one way or another to these challenges were taking a broader range of actions than those surveyed in the other countries, from rotating crops and using renewable energy, to storm-proofing their homes. But co-operation is not always easy. We carried out community assessments which provided a useful insight on how people worked together to improve their resilience. In the district of Rajanpur (Punjab), we observed three different responses to the challenges, some of which were more successful than others. One small farming settlement had decided to join forces to overcome the impact of recurrent floods and, despite low financial resources, helped each other in elevating homes to protect families and livestock. Another benefited from resources and training provided by a local non-governmental organisation, which helped them to organise themselves, speeding up post-flood recovery. This settlement displayed a strong sense of confidence in their ability to respond to emergencies such as recurring floods. However, unlike these two communities, a third group was struggling to work together and felt that power relations which allowed certain farmers to secure more water or favourable crop prices, coupled with increased lack of water and infrastructure, were eroding any sense of community. One of the most important findings – for Pakistan and the other six countries – was that when people are well informed, they are better able to cope with changing weather. We found that people were relying on others to learn and share information at the community level, and those who felt well informed were also more likely to be rotating and diversifying crops, saving water and making adjustments to their houses – even those with little money. With high levels of TV viewership and rising mobile phone use in Pakistan, there are opportunities to provide people across the country with information on coping with resource shortages and seasonal changes on a much bigger scale. Communication and media can not only provide information at critical times such as SMS alerts during extreme weather, but also help people hold their institutions and leaders to account through discussion shows, and share examples of best practice using, for example, dramas or reality TV challenges. The Climate Asia findings for Pakistan are at once some of the most worrying and inspiring to emerge. In the absence of government support, some communities are innovating and working together to tackle the threats they face. These responses cover a wide range of actions, such as changing cropping patterns, creating emergency shelters and safe spaces for livestock and storing seeds, trying alternative sources of income or creating community citizen boards to manage publicly funded schemes. If those ideas could be shared on a wider scale, it could go a long way to support some of Asia's most vulnerable communities. Anna Colom works as a research manager at BBC Media Action.

"""Australia may sell assets and cut welfare spending to rein in a debt burden that is already the second-smallest among developed nations"" reported Bloomberg breathlessly early in May. Such is the madness of the deeply unpopular conservative Australian government, which will lay down its budget for the coming 12 months next week. In order to justify its right-wing agenda, the Abbott government ordered a National Commission of Audit. The Commission's report was released a week ago, and was described as a ""document that appears to hates Australia"". Amongst its many recommendations was one to axe climate programs at the national science organisation, the CSIRO, and the Bureau of Meteorology. It also recommends halving the budget for the National Landcare Program, abolishing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Climate Authority, and merge specialist and independent National Water Commission and Murray Darling Basin Authority into other government departments. The Australian government already has a terrible reputation with climate change information and science in general. There is no dedicated Minister for Science, and one of the first acts of the Abbott government was to shut down the Climate Commission. The Commission of Audit report is transparently a tool for the Abbott government to be a stalking horse for their extreme agenda, and to provide cover for their first budget. Abbott and his advisors know that you make all your unpopular decisions and cuts early, so you can buy votes closer to the election. (Ironically and scandalously, the Commission, after recommending so many cuts to public programs, busted its own budget by over double, according to the West Australian newspaper, costing $2.5 million with just a $1 million budget.) Behind the many broken election promises embodied in both the Commission of Audit report, and the various policies canvassed by Abbott and his treasurer Joe Hockey, is a desire to reduce the deficit. At its heart, the Abbott government wants to pursue an austerity agenda to wind back the social democratic state. As Bloomberg noted, Australia has the second-smallest budget deficit in the developed world. A substantial part of this deficit has been utterly concocted by the government, according to the ABC's fact-checker. The treasurer has added $68 billion to the deficit, and has tried to lay the blame at the feet of the former Labor government. Amidst the many recommendations from the Commission of Audit and various policy thought-bubbles from the government, almost no suggestion has been given to reducing the vast amounts of subsidies and tax credits given to corporations. A particularly egregious subsidy is the diesel fuel subsidy, which will cost $2.4 billion next year. This equates to a hand-out by Australian tax-payers of around $182 each year. The national president of the mining union, the CFMEU, Tony Maher called out this squandering of public funds in an article for ABC's The Drum: Does it really make sense for taxpayers to be funding a rebate on diesel fuel for the mining industry at a cost of $2 billion a year? The CFMEU underlined this point in a senate submission to the Select Committee on Fuel and Energy: The Australian Taxation Office has stated that for the 2006-07 year, the mining industry was easily the heaviest user of the fuel tax credit schemes, claiming $1.47 billion of the $4.9 billion claimed. The next highest claim by an industry was transport and warehousing with $1.28 billion. The latter industry made 171,085 claims for the credits, while the mining industry made just 6,735. This vast difference demonstrates that mining industry claims are made by a relatively small number of very large companies, while the transport claims often come from small businesses. That the mining industry receives such extensive fuel tax credits while claiming to be internationally competitive and unsubsidised has attracted significant criticism from an environmental perspective. The continuing level of significant subsidy weakens the substantial argument that the industry is otherwise able to make that is it one of Australia's great success stories. Industries that rely on subsidies or other forms of protection are not generally able to be portrayed as a success story. Further, the mining industry is not a deserving case. There are no grounds in terms of equity, social justice or industry development to justify a significant subsidy to the mining industry. The Abbott government could avoid cutting important education, health, and disability support programs, by simply ending the ludicrous diesel fuel subsidy. However, cutting this subsidy has been ruled out by treasurer Joe Hockey, according to the ABC. The argument used to defend this subsidy is that it is used by farmers, but as the CFMEU notes, the biggest beneficiary is the mining industry. The Australian mining industry has form, and its power has been demonstrated over the past few years, and as Ben Phillips writes, it is really about an industry locked in a life-or-death struggle to keep profiteering. Nevertheless, it is remarkable (but not surprising given this recent revelation) that Hockey was so quick to rule out scrapping the diesel subsidy. In February, treasurer Joe Hockey declared that the so-called ""age of entitlement"" to be over: ""I say to you emphatically, everyone in Australia must do the heavy lifting. The age of entitlement is over, the age of personal responsibility has begun,'' he said. Of course, he really is referring to everyday people, not corporations. It's not just environmentalists calling for the end of the diesel subsidy. The International Monetary Fund, not a notable hotbed of socialistic revolutionaries, called in March for the ending of subsidies for fossil fuels. Globally, 2.5 percent of global GDP is spent on fuel subsidies, with wealthy households capturing around 43 percent of the benefits. As I've written before, the conservative world-view supports fossil fuel subsidies because they see the wealth of companies like mining companies as inherently moral and because subsidies incentivise their hard work. Support for everyday people and disadvantaged people is immoral because in the minds of conservatives, it creates dependency and promotes laziness. Next week's budget will likely see the Abbott-led Australian government commit an unforgivable act of self-harm upon the Australian people in pursuit of their extreme, ideologically-motivated conservative agenda. As Greg Jericho says, this budget will just be the first step to achieving a ""dopey regurgitation of libertarian masturbatory fantasy""."
"There is no doubt the climate is changing. Each of the past three decades has been warmer than the previous one, and the vast majority of scientific evidence points to this being caused by mankind's reliance on carbon-based fossil fuels. While understanding weather patterns and the risks associated with major weather events has always been critical to the insurance industry, climate change has recently brought the need for better modelling of future weather into sharp focus.  According to the World Bank, weather-related losses and damage have risen from an annual average of about $50bn in the 1980s to close to $200bn. Lloyd's knows this all too well, the damage wrought on the US by the hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012 to name but a few all brought significant claims to the insurance market. Many types of business we insure are affected by climate change. There are the obvious ones such as property, catastrophe and crop insurance. But Superstorm Sandy taught us that the reach of extreme weather is far greater than that. The destruction Sandy brought to the eastern US seaboard was responsible for claims of up to $300m in lost fine art, a consequence of the many expensive US beachfront homes damaged. Modelling has shown that the approximate 20cm of sea-level rise at the southern tip of Manhattan Island increased Sandy's surge losses by 30% in New York alone. As a response, our recent Catastrophe Modelling and Climate Change report calls for the insurance industry to take seriously the impact of climate change and the implications it poses for the industry. The first step has to be making sure that catastrophe models can properly account for climate change. This will be challenging. Uncertainties associated with the estimation of the extent and frequency of the most extreme events can make assessing future impacts difficult within traditional modelling. Consequently, this will require investigation into new modelling approaches that build in forward projection, not just historical data. In developed and developing economies alike, there is a need to better understand the impacts of climate change and the responsibility doesn't lie exclusively with the private sector. The development of more accurate catastrophe modelling which takes into account the implications of climate change will create an opportunity that governments must seize. By using these innovations in modelling to deliver better environmental, housing and wider land use policy, governments can protects their citizens from the worst effects of changing climates. Insurers also have an important role to play in mitigating the impact of the changes in climate which have already occurred, through closer coordination with other industries, notably construction. There need to be policies to drive up standards and make sure we have resilient homes, that we use better materials. All these and strong forward planning will be key to this effort. Here, too, governments must play their role in enshrining standards in legislation. Change will touch all of us. I firmly believe that understanding and incorporating climate change into future modelling has become essential for anyone making long-term financial commitments, be that investing in infrastructure, housing or indeed policy. Ultimately, insurance exists to pick up the pieces and pay the claims when the likes of a Hurricane Katrina or a Superstorm Sandy strike. But to continue to do this, as Lloyd's has done since 1688, insurers must factor climate change into modelling, and develop the tools we need to understand and evaluate its impact."
"Three decades from now the world is going to be a very different place. How it looks will depend on actions we take today. We have big decisions to make and little time to make them if we are to provide stability and greater prosperity to the world's growing population. Top of the priority list is climate change. All around the world it is plain that climate change is happening and that human activities are the principal cause. Last month the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed that the effects of climate change are already widespread, costly and consequential – from the tropics to the poles, from small islands to large continents, and from the poorest countries to the wealthiest. The world's top scientists are clear. Climate change is affecting agriculture, water resources, human health, and ecosystems on land and in the oceans. It poses sweeping risks for economic stability and the security of nations.  We can avert these risks if we take bold, decisive action now. An increasing number of government leaders, policymakers, businesses, investors and concerned citizens are beginning to comprehend the costs of climate change. More crucially, they are also learning that affordable solutions exist or are in the pipeline to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support resilience. We need to deploy these solutions at a scale commensurate to the challenge. That means investment and it means global co-operation, especially in the areas of finance and technology. That is why it is important that governments complete their work on a new universal climate agreement by 2015. To build political momentum and help bring about action, I am convening a climate summit in New York on 23 September. I am pressing national leaders, along with mayors and senior representatives from business, finance and civil society, to join a ""race to the top"" by showcasing solutions and forging partnerships that can steer the world away from cataclysm and towards a sustainable future. I have been hosting an international meeting designed as a staging post for the September summit. The Abu Dhabi Ascent has given me considerable hope. Governments and private sector leaders have unveiled achievements and plans in a variety of areas where we feel we can make the quickest, greatest impact, including energy, cities and transport, finance, resilience, agriculture and short-lived climate pollutants. Just as scientists are united on the impacts of climate change, so are economists generally agreed on the costs of combatting it. Working now for a rapid transformation to a low-carbon economy will be significantly less expensive for people and economies than failing to act, especially in developing countries, which are most vulnerable to climate impacts. They are also where emissions are rising fastest. These countries need support to build their own low-carbon futures and the opportunities that will bring. They have a pressing need for development. But their sustainable progress – and ultimately that of all of us – demands they do so as cleanly as possible. No one can afford the relentless increase in global temperatures that business as usual will bring. The benefits of addressing climate change include reduced pollution, improved public health, fewer disasters, cleaner, cheaper, more efficient energy, better managed forests, more liveable cities, increased food security and less poverty. Instead of asking if we can afford to act, we should be asking what is stopping us, who is stopping us, and why? Climate change is an issue for all people, all businesses, all governments. Let us join forces to push back against sceptics and entrenched interests. Let us support the scientists, economists, entrepreneurs and investors who can persuade government leaders and policymakers that now is the time for bold action. In Abu Dhabi I have seen again that effective affordable solutions are already available. I have seen that an increasing number of governments and other actors are prepared to invest in a low-carbon future. My sights are now set on the September climate summit and the climate negotiations in Lima in December and Paris next year. Change is in the air – I can sense it at all levels of society. Solutions exist. The race is on. My challenge to all political and business leaders, all concerned citizens and voters is simple: be at the head of the race. Don't get left behind. Don't be on the losing side of history. Let us work together to make climate change a top priority for all leaders – at home and in the global arena. Let us take advantage of the opportunities presented by climate action and lay the foundations for a more prosperous and secure future for all."
"In the early 1970s human-induced climate change was still a matter for the academy. A link between climate change and the burning of fossil fuels had been mooted but debate would not move into the political sphere for more than a decade. Even so, concern for the environment was growing. It was a decade since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring had popularised the idea that poisoning nature would damage humanity. The Club of Rome had published its Limits to Growth thesis emphasising the finite nature of the world's resources, and drought was ravaging the African Sahel, causing starvation among some of the world's poorest people.  Urged on by Sweden, the UN held the  first global conference on the human environment (UNCHE) in Stockholm in June 1972. The discussion was dominated by pollution, deforestation and whaling. But the meeting, in particular a speech  made by the then Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi, was a foundation stone for much of the co-operation, disagreement and politics that would develop around climate change. As today, many of the impacts of environmental exploitation were being felt in the global south. Yet the conference encountered resistance in these countries. ""Developing countries were considering boycotting the conference. They thought this new concern of 'environment' was one for the rich and would distract from their main concerns, which were the relief of poverty and continuing development,"" Maurice Strong, the UN diplomat who chaired the Stockholm summit, told the BBC in 2012. Gandhi used her platform to express the inextricable goals of poverty alleviation and environmental protection. ""There are grave misgivings that the discussion on ecology may be designed to distract attention from the problems of war and poverty,"" she said. ""We have to prove to the disinherited majority of the world that ecology and conservation will not work against their interest but will bring an improvement in their lives."" Then, unknowingly, she threw the future climate change movement under a bus. ""We do not wish to impoverish the environment any further and yet we cannot for a moment forget the grim poverty of large numbers of people,"" she said. ""Are not poverty and need the greatest polluters?"" This statement has echoed down the halls of climate change debate ever since. Gandhi was referring to the realities of life below the poverty line. Her message: who can care for the environment when their basic needs are not being met? ""The environmental problems of developing countries are not the side effects of excessive industrialisation but reflect the inadequacy of development,"" she said. We now know this to be untrue, in part. The 1970s drought in the Sahel was at first blamed on deforestation by local tribes. The real trigger was changing ocean currents caused by excessive industrialisation and climate change. Gandhi's words have been consistently manipulated to shift the focus of responsibility for environmental degradation on to the world's poorest people, says Chaitanya Kumar of 350.org. ""It's the need of the poor [to raise themselves up] that is the biggest polluter. That's how it's seen by a few people."" Much of the climate debate revolves around how the developing world can lift itself from poverty without pushing the world into dangerous global warming. Developing countries look at the historical emissions of the rich and say the burden of carbon reductions should lie with the main offenders. Rich countries worry that the rise of the middle class in China, India and Brazil will create an impossible growth in carbon emissions. On this, Gandhi was prescient: ""On the one hand the rich look askance at our continuing poverty - on the other, they warn us against their own methods."" But her words must be seen as both seminal and hypocritical, says Kumar. Gandhi's own poverty alleviation efforts in India revealed a lack of will to really tackle poverty or environment issues, instead she focused on middle-class interests. The conference in Stockholm also gave birth to the concept of global environmental co-operation. The final declaration of the meeting called on all nations to take responsibility for the environment and encouraged a collegial approach. ""While most of the conference's accomplishments were mainly rhetorical, its ultimate success was that environmental policy became a universal concern within international diplomacy, and the conference's motto of 'only one earth' became iconic for the modern environmental movement,"" says Andreas Greiger of the Rachel Carson Centre for Environment and Society in Munich. This philosophy led to the creation of the UN Environment Programme  . The UNEP, along with the World Meteorological Foundation , founded the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. The IPCC process, however flawed, is now the leading driver of action and accountability for climate change. The greatest legacy of Stockholm however was to couple the destiny of the poor with that of the environment and bind nations to a communal endeavour. But it was susceptible to the hubris and politics that continue to bedevil its progeny.

"It is 100 days since David Cameron visited the submerged Somerset levels at the peak of the winter floods that devastated swathes of England and hundreds of broken flood defences have now been repaired thanks to £270m of emergency funding from government. But in the Netherlands, also battered by the record deluge but relatively unscathed, an ongoing multibillion-euro programme continues to reshape the watery nation, with none of the political storm whipped up in the UK. Hard-won reclaimed land – polders – are being given back to rivers and meanders are being cut back into flood plains, all as part of a back-to-nature approach that is reversing centuries of battling against water, in favour of finding ways to live with it.  The Netherlands is a land of waterways and a quarter is below sea level, with 60% of its people in flood-risk areas. There is deep experience of what it takes to deal with flooding, in both financial and human terms.  Jan Kant is the fourth generation of his family to farm the Noordwaard polder in the heart of the giant four-river delta than dominates the south of the Netherlands. “I am attached to this area,” he says simply. But, with his sons who now run the business, he is about to move away. The dykes protecting Kant's low-lying fields are about to be broken and the area flooded, to take 30cm off the river level that threatens the nearby town of Gorinchem. The intensification of downpours by climate change is the underlying reason and Kant is now philosophical about losing his farm: “Living in an area like this, we may have had to move someday anyway.” Another 10 farmers and 24 other families are having to make way as the river takes possession of its flood plain once more. The project is the biggest of 34 “Room for the River” (RR) projects across the Netherlands, costing €2.3bn (£1.9bn) and set to finish in 2015.  But discussions with the locals began more than a decade ago, led by Raalf Gaastra, the stakeholder manager for the Noordwaard polder RR project. “People have made their own choices: they can stay in an area that could now be flooded tomorrow, because they like the area, or they can leave,” he says. Those who stay are helped to build new homes, raised on high mounds, those who don't are bought out at market rates. “The first discussion is not easy, but once one house has decided to go people start to follow,” says Gaastra. Vic Gremmer, the local residents' spokesman, is staying and moving to a new house. “Being forced to move so other people can keep their feet dry is acceptable,” he says. “The key is to make us safe and compensate us properly.” The disruption is enormous: new bridges, roads, pipes and repositioned dykes are all in construction, leaving great muddy tracks across the flat green and blue landscape. “Sometimes it feels like the work takes ages,” says Gremmer. But the nature-lover is excited by the prospect of new waterworld and the ospreys it will support. “I can't wait to see what it looks like.” The Noordwaard polder is strikingly similar to the Somerset Levels in the south-west of England, down to the locals initial insistence that river dredging was the key. But Kant, Gremmer and the rest were eventually persuaded that annual dredging was not a sustainable solution. Visiting the Noordwaard polder, David Rooke, director of flood and coastal risk at the UK's Environment Agency, says: “It's exactly the same issue as the Somerset Levels, exactly the same. But [in England] there is not €2.3bn to solve the problem.” Projects like Room for the River have also gone ahead in other countries, such as Germany and China. In England and Wales, which together have actually a 50% greater area of land below sea level than the Netherlands, the last Labour government began a similar project, called “Making room for water.” ""But then there was a change of government and a change of policy,"" says Rooke. After the coalition cut annual flood defence spending by 25% on taking office in 2010. In the Hague, at the Rijkswaterstaat, the national water management agency which runs the Room for the River programme, director of safety Roeland Allewijn, says over €16bn has already committed for flood defences up to 2028. “We call this relatively short term. “There is huge political and public awareness that we need to spend a lot of money on this,” he says. “It is reasonably easy for us to get government spending on this.” This stems back to the national disaster in February 1953, when a North Sea storm overwhelmed the coast and killed 1,850 Dutch people. The sea remains as major flood threat to the Netherlands and on the windy coast, not far from the major cities of Rotterdam and the Hague, a €75m government-backed experiment is taking place. A new crescent-shaped peninsula, 4 miles long, has been created just in front of the sandy beach. The idea is that rather than having to replenish the beach every year to protect the coast, the waves and currents will wash the 20m cubic metres of sand used to create the peninsula into place: the project is called the “sand motor”. The new peninsula has already been stretched to 5.5 miles in its first two years, and has provided a new site for recreation including hunting for the fossil mammoth teeth hidden in the ice-age sand dredged from offshore. “There was not a big need to show a cost-benefit,” says Jaap Flikweert, an engineer at Royal Haskoning DHV. “There was a lot of vision: it's very Dutch.” Flikweert is now examining how the sand motor might be used in the UK, and has identified coastal locations off the low-lying counties of Lincolnshire and Suffolk, both places hammered by the winter's storms. Paul Cobbing, chief executive of the UK's community-led National Flood Forum, says the British approach is different: “In the UK, the cost-benefit analysis would have had to be foremost to get anyway near Treasury funding.” The sand motor's primary aim is to guard against the rise in sea levels being driven by climate change, and global warming is always the first reason cited by Dutch engineers for the huge flood defence improvements being undertaken. There is no debate about its impact, according to Peter Glas, president of the Dutch Association of Regional Water Boards, the 23 elected bodies that raise €2.5bn a year in flood defence taxes and have defended communities for many centuries. “I don't even enter into discussions about carbon dioxide,” he says. “I see sea level rising, I see the land falling and I see millions of people in need.” Aidan Kerr, a flooding expert at the Association of British Insurers and formerly at the Environment Agency, does not see the same attitude in the UK, where environment secretary Owen Paterson is widely regarded as a climate sceptic. “There is concern about the extent to which climate change projections are being taken into account,” he says. “The EA has done work on the impact of climate change. But this is not being taken into account as a benchmark for funding.” Water Boards president Glas is also chairman of the local De Dommel water board in another part of the delta region. Here long, sinuous meanders have just been dug through fields to recreate the natural winding form of the Esse Stroom, slowing the rush of water towards populated areas downstream and creating more room for water. The Esse was part of the huge 1995 floods and closed the A2 motorway which runs from Amsterdam to Milan, causing over €6bn of economic damage.  The new meanders, and fields newly opened to floodwaters, account for about 6% of the total 150,000 hectare area of the De Dommel water board and will be able to store 20m tonnes of water. The EA in England has also restored meanders at Stockton-on-Tees and in Oxfordshire, but on a much smaller scale. Such back-to-nature projects, like another pilot scheme in north Somerset, challenge centuries of accepted wisdom that rivers must be straightened and water flow speeded up. “It can be a leap of faith for local communities,” said Rooke, noting that the early results in Somerset look promising. Mark van de Wouw, hydrologist at the De Dommel waterboard, looks at the newly cut meanders in the Esse and says: “It is a small sacrifice to save a massive cost if a city floods downstream.” Van de Woew visited No 10 Downing Street in February as part of a Dutch delegation that advised on the UK's flood response. “The biggest difference was a difference of culture. In the Netherlands, we have a totally different approach to the problem: people here expect to pay bills for flood defences.” Flikweert agrees: “Flooding in the UK is more difficult to treat because it is more diverse. So in the Netherlands you have a simpler problem with more money, compared to a more difficult problem with less money in the UK.”"
