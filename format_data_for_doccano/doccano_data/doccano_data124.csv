"The White House has denied reports that it planned to stay in the Paris climate agreement, saying its position on leaving was unchanged, and that it would only stay in if it got more “favourable” terms. The Trump administration was forced to make a statement on Saturday after reports emerged as ministers from more than 30 countries held talks in Montreal this weekend preparing for the upcoming United Nations climate summit in November.  The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump administration officials had said at the Montreal talks that they wouldn’t pull out of the Paris accord and were offering to re-engage with the deal, citing the EU’s climate commissioner.  The WSJ quoted Cañete saying: “The US has stated that they will not renegotiate the Paris accord, but they will try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement.” According to the AFP news agency, Cañete also said there would be a meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York City early next week with US representatives “to assess what is the real US position”, and noted: “It’s a message which is quite different to the one we heard from President Trump in the past.” Trump provoked outcry among the majority of world leaders and the science community when he gave notice earlier this year that Paris was a bad deal for the US and he would pull the country out of the deal to cut emissions. On Saturday, responding to the reports, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in an email to the Guardian: “There has been no change in the United States’ position on the Paris agreement. As the President has made abundantly clear, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country”. Ministers from 34 economies are meeting in Montreal in part to head off potential efforts by the US to weaken the accord at the November UN climate summit in Bonn, Germany.  Our position on the Paris agreement has not changed. @POTUS has been clear, US withdrawing unless we get pro-America terms. Though Trump said in June that the country would pull out of the Paris accord, there has been little effort by the US to formally extricate itself from the agreement. Half the G20 is represented at the weekend meeting in Montreal, though there are no senior US climate officials in attendance.  The US delegation is headed by Everett Eissenstat, deputy director of the US National Economic Council.  After the summit, Cañete is set to travel to New York and meet Trump adviser Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, on Monday. "
"Tens of millions of dollars are spent annually on political lobbying for the interests of the fossil fuel sector. That investment serves the interests of a small amount of company shareholders in keeping a legacy industry alive, despite the availability of newer, clean technologies, at lower cost.  In the wake of these behind-the-scenes policy negotiations, the real and present impacts of climate change, such as bushfires, coastal flooding and reduced crop yields are left at the door of future generations to deal with.   As the expensive fees of industry associations like the Minerals Council of Australia are claimed as business expenses, the fossil fuel companies are then able to receive generous tax concessions – paid for from the public purse. That’s why the hypocrisy was palpable last week, when the deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce said in an address to the Minerals Council that the charitable status of environmental groups is against the interests of Australia. So, when there are no rules limiting the power that big mining wields over politics, why are environmental scientists being attacked by the government? Recently, the government instituted an inquiry into Australian charities, seeking to curb the work of charities working to protect the environment. The inquiry’s most concerning recommendation, which came from the Minerals Council itself, is that all environmental charities, no matter if they are focused on research or public education, should be forced to spend 25% of their resources for on-the-ground remediation work, such as tree planting and weed control. Environmental remediation has great value, but ultimately the policy change required to solve climate change will only happen through scientifically informed policy change that allows businesses and communities to do the heavy lifting.  The Climate Council is an independent organisation dedicated to public education on climate change. We want to keep doing what we’re good at – which is providing independent, accurate information to Australians across society; from emergency services to farmers, schools and businesses. For the government to demand that the Climate Council spend 25% of its time on remediation is nonsensical and undemocratic. When it comes to Australia staying in step with the global race to address climate change, planting a few trees just won’t cut it. The government inquiry is a cynical attempt to hamper support for charities by reducing our ability to execute on our purpose. The Climate Council’s purpose is to accurately communicate information on climate change, giving Australia the chance to be on the front foot in responding to climate change. Our information assists fire fighters, health professionals and communities. It helps journalists to report more accurately in what is a debate often awash with misinformation. Importantly, it helps the wider community make sense of what is a complex and confusing issue.  An informed public is absolutely vital to a well-functioning democracy. The science is not the only consensus on the issue. Most Aussies are worried about what climate change means for their jobs, property and families, especially the youngsters that are now stepping up to power our economy. For the government to adopt the mining lobby’s recommendation would damage the ability of organisations protecting the environment to work effectively – and therefore damage our environment itself. It would also set a dangerous precedent for the interference of vested interests into our government. For beyond the Climate Council a broad range of charities stand to be affected should the government give itself powers to hamper any community group that they deem to be in conflict with its worldview. The logic of curtailing an organisation like Climate Council, which fills the major chasm in public information on climate change, is unscientific and undemocratic.  Despite what we hear about the post-truth, fake news world in which we now live, the Australian public still values independent experts. When we go to the doctor, or fly in an aeroplane, we place our trust in the hands of qualified experts. Equally, for Australia to make sound decisions on our changing world, we expect to be advised by experts that operate independently of vested interests.  Past experience tells us we cannot rely on government to give us all of the facts, all of the time. Just last year it was widely reported that the Australian Department of Environment censored a Unesco report on climate change, removing the inclusion of the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu national park and the Tasmanian forests. The objections were made on the grounds that showing the impacts of climate change on Australian world heritage sites would be bad for tourism. When Unesco agreed to remove the sections requested, Australia became the only inhabited continent on the planet with no mention whatsoever. It would be a wonderful world if the threat of climate change could be wiped away so easily. In the absence of a magic wand, both the Australian public and the broader international community have a right to accurate information in order to tackle climate change. We have a responsibility to future generations to take action. And our best chance for action is from the standpoint of knowledge that is open, shared and freely available. I have no doubt that a government that has the best interests of the Australian public at heart is one that champions and protects access to science and does not seek to restrict it."
"Refugees fleeing conflict have already sent shockwaves ‎through the political systems of Europe. But unless we take urgent action now and help the countries of the Sahel, we will face the prospect of millions more refugees in the time to come.  A coordinated and comprehensive plan to partner these nations and help them to avoid catastrophe is essential for them and for us. It should be devised by an alliance between Europe, the US and Arab allies in the Gulf.  The Sahel – the belt of countries stretching for 3,360 miles across sub-Saharan Africa from the Sahara in the north to the Sudan Savanna in the south – is dominated by the G5 Sahel group of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger, which in July launched a new military force together with President Emmanuel Macron to tackle Islamist militants. These countries are buckling under the weight of the challenges of “fragile states”: poverty, food security, weak governance, ethnic tensions and the spread of radical extremism. These problems are not in themselves exclusive, but two factors make them unique – and call for a new approach. First, huge population growth will see the combined population of these G5 nations grow from 78 million today to more than 200 million by 2050. Aid in its traditional sense cannot outrun these numbers. Population growth brings with it many more young people needing jobs. High youth unemployment increases the risks of human trafficking, slavery, crime and violence. Population growth will also further stress the natural environment, which is already prone to climate change-induced droughts that result in crops failing and livestock dying, forcing people to migrate. Nearly five million people have already been displaced in the region. Second is the risk that local conflicts and extremist movements join together across porous borders, aided by technology. The early warning signs are here. The UN peacekeeping operation in Mali is already one of its deadliest missions. Alongside Boko Haram, the four main groups in the region – al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, al-Murabitoun, Macina Liberation Front and Ansar Dine – merged into a single entity this year, fuelling the probability of further violence. We need a programme specifically designed for the Sahel – a formal compact between the nations and the international community. Analysis from my institute, which has projects supporting governments in 12 African countries, shows that the problem in fragile states is that donor aid is often less effective because it lacks buy-in from the national leadership and they do not have the capacity to use the aid well. This is confirmed by the Brookings Institute report, which analysed aid and compared fragile and stable states.  The problems are so many and so deep that governments become overwhelmed. This is why a compact must be comprehensive, covering all the different dimensions to development – including security – and must be based on a partnership with clear and measurable objectives in return for help. This is not aid in the traditional way, but a sensible investment in the protection of our own future. Another novel feature would be that it involves non-traditional development partners in the nations to the east, who will also be greatly impacted by failure in the Sahel. The compact should also be tailored for each nation, based on need. It must be built in the spirit of partnership and mutual accountability, balancing obligations and support and learning from other initiatives, such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation, already active in the region. And finally, the governments should be provided not just with financial support but with embedded technical assistance. This will be key to implementing the necessary reforms and building local capability. It will not be quick; fragile states are not rebuilt in a few years – even with the best will in the world. But the need is urgent, and elsewhere on the continent countries such as Botswana, Rwanda and Ethiopia have undertaken reforms focused on building state capacity and generating growth. I am convinced that a new path forward can be forged. A path where Sahelian governments get the right kind of partnership to build an effective government that can tackle its own challenges and, in time, transition away from aid.  At the most fundamental level, the people of these nations have the same desires as us in the west: for peace, stability, good health, education and the opportunity for meaningful work. It is the only vision of the future that works, not least because problems in countries which seem far away may well be closer than we think."
"The winds and rain came first, usual for this time of year. Crops drown in the sodden earth, the price of vegetables and fruits in the market rises and, as the rain and wind beat down on the tin roofs and wooden frames of many of our homes, communities bear down for more. Torrential storms, gushing flood waters and devastated infrastructure come next, and lives are lost in their wake. Evacuation is not an option for most citizens of the Caribbean. Instead of escape, survival is a matter of endurance. What were predictable changes to the wet or dry months in the Caribbean are now increasingly irregular weather patterns, bringing serious weather events that demand more resources and attention to mitigate escalating damage, including loss of life. There is widespread agreement in the region, based on meteorological data as well as lived experience, that Caribbean seasons, noteworthy for shifts in temperature and precipitation, are changing. As residents in the region, sometimes we wonder if “change” is a powerful enough word to represent the realities of rising seas and battering rains, coastal erosion and habitat loss, new agricultural stresses and higher food import bills, as well as the loss of human life. Despite broad consensus, we must be clear that climate change is not the only villain. Regional underdevelopment and global economic polarisation exacerbate the effects of disasters. The colossal convergence of clouds formed by the churning of warm waters in the Atlantic basin has generated three fully formed hurricanes since tropical storm Harvey passed through the eastern Caribbean in mid-August: hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia. The Atlantic basin has not seen activity of this nature since 2010 when category three hurricanes Igor and Karl joined category four Julia to bring disastrous impacts to Caribbean islands. None of these previous hurricanes, however, were nearly as devastating as Irma’s category five assault, which has resulted in 28 confirmed deaths across the Caribbean so far – and thousands will be displaced. Those whose lives have been washed away, leaving them without shelter, include street dwellers, homeless people, squatters and others living precariously in rural, hillside, and coastal areas, which are prone to landslides, collapse and flooding. Also vulnerable are elderly people, children and people who are mobility-impaired or sick and may more quickly succumb to the health effects of mould, poor nutrition and lack of clean drinking water, exacerbated by constraints in accessing medical help. In addition to flood losses in residential, agricultural, and commercial areas, winds destabilise transport and communication infrastructure, while storm surges dismantle much needed economic, social, and environmental assets on coastlines. Disasters, as we know them, are a function of magnitude, exposure, and vulnerability. On its own, Irma has characteristics that could make it one of the Caribbean’s most damaging hurricanes on record, due in part to the low levels of economic development that hamper the region’s ability to cope with natural hazards. Irma’s path of destruction has affected more than 10 Caribbean countries, a significantly higher number of islands than those affected by hurricanes Igor, Julia, and Karl combined. While Igor, Julia, and Karl directly affected islands including Bermuda and Cape Verde, Irma made landfall on Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the US Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, St Kitts, Nevis, and Guadeloupe among others. Bermuda and Cape Verde have substantially higher GDPs and GDP per capita than Barbuda and Anguilla, which strongly correlate to higher resilience and much better coping mechanisms. For example, in Barbuda Irma destroyed more than 90% of the housing stock and telecommunications infrastructure; large and extended families, including one group of seven, were reliant on rooftop rescues by emergency responders. Similar incidents have been reported from Anguilla and other islands. By comparison, although serious damage was reported in Bermuda and Cape Verde, nothing nearly as devastating as this occurred. These two islands can expect to return to normal life much more quickly than the islands with fewer economic resources. Clearly, the impacts of such storms and the course of the subsequent recovery are determined by a country’s preparedness and capacity to respond. At both the national and community levels, development provides protective armour. Mismanagement of resources and failure to protect the environment pose a grave threat to small-island developing states As we look to the future, we must heed the lessons taught by these hurricanes. While it is not possible to modify the hazard of a hurricane such as Irma in itself, there are ways to reduce the disastrous effects, and increase coping capacities and resilience of those affected. With dwindling funding for disaster risk reduction in the Caribbean, there is a growing need to encourage self-protective resilience. Education and communication are crucial tools, and we must develop new techniques to identify the most vulnerable communities, groups and households. The climate chaos represented by the increased magnitude and heightened form of storm activity in the Atlantic basin is becoming the norm for the Caribbean. The regional realities of this chaos have been masked by the discourse of “climate change”, which suggests a more manageable and gradual process. In June and July tropical storms Bret and Don also passed through the Caribbean as far south as Trinidad, an island that had previously seen a total of only four tropical storms since records began in 1851. The mismanagement of natural resources and failure to protect the environment pose a grave threat to many of us living in small-island developing states and less economically developed countries. Ultimately, just as the health of the oceans and atmosphere are related to one another, so the current plight of countries on the periphery is the best indicator of the future of the core. • Dr Gabrielle Thongs specialises in disaster planning and spatial modelling at the University of the West Indies."
"That which is dangerous can also be thrilling. Many liberal democracies are engaged in something dangerous, as questions of identity, community and nationhood are being asked with a fresh urgency, with some of the answers turning out to be deeply disturbing. But is there also something thrilling going on? The capacity for democracy to throw up surprises, such as Britain’s 2017 general election result, is mesmerising. Brexit may be a famous act of economic self-harm, but something new will be born one way or the other. Still the danger persists and may be growing. That this is happening now, as opposed to 10 or 20 years ago, is a direct consequence of the disintegration of the economic policy framework that has held sway in Britain, the US, the European commission and many multilateral institutions for much of the previous 40 years. That framework is often referred to as “neoliberalism”, even if the term irritates a certain class of pundit, for whom it is some sort of swearword without any clear referent. Its disintegration is producing conflicting sympathies, as many on the left come to realise the xenophobia that can be unleashed in the absence of stable market-based rules.  For George Monbiot, neoliberalism should best be understood as a “story”, one that was conveniently on offer at precisely the moment when the previous “story” – namely Keynesianism – fell to pieces in the mid-1970s. The power of stories is overwhelming, as they are “the means by which we navigate the world. They allow us to interpret its complex and contradictory signals”. The particular story of neoliberalism “defines us as competitors, guided above all other impulses by the urge to get ahead of our fellows”. This story may not have been all that attractive, but it provided meaning and clarity. It offered a guide on what to do and how to live. With the rise of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, neoliberalism came to govern how policies were designed and institutions constructed. More diffusely, it came to shape how we understand ourselves, leading us to take on ever more responsibility for our own needs, economic security and wellbeing, devaluing social bonds and dependency in the process. The grand global difficulties of neoliberalism are plain to see. The financial crisis was testimony to the stupidity of deregulation, while the inability to move on from it demonstrates that orthodox economic policy tools no longer work. Solutions to climate change are hamstrung by the need to respect existing corporate and financial strategies. But Monbiot also details considerable psychological and biological evidence for how the ethos of individual competition harms us all, running counter to our innate needs and instincts. Loneliness and distrust are not just the defining social problems of our age, but increasingly posing risks to our health. The problem is that we have no new story to tell, and are therefore trapped in a groundhog day of repetition. The principal objective of Out of the Wreckage is to identify exit routes from this miserable condition. Few of the policy ideas contained within it are original to Monbiot (he credits their sources regularly and generously) and some (such as participatory budgeting and basic income) have been around for some time, but they are rarely assembled into a single overarching narrative. Monbiot is offering his services principally as a storyteller. He reserves particular enthusiasm for the environmental economics of Kate Raworth and the participatory campaigning techniques of the Bernie Sanders campaign. To construct the new story, he leans heavily on the burgeoning evidence for our innately social and empathetic nature. Human beings are the “supreme cooperators”, which explains our dominance within the natural world. Altruism and concern for others’ feelings are evolutionary properties that are central to our biology, hence the fact that “social” pain (such as loneliness or grief) produces many of the same symptoms as “physical” pain. Most of this research was unknown when the neoliberal story was first being told by economists such as Friedrich von Hayek in the mid-20th century, but it highlights central aspects of the human condition that are neglected by our individualistic and competitive culture. What this suggests, Monbiot argues, is that a new political story must privilege belonging above all. We need to feel we belong to a particular place and a particular community, with whom we can achieve common goals. We need to combat the epidemic of alienation with a new set of institutions, through which individuals can collectively shape their own lives and environments. Out of the Wreckage makes an impassioned and optimistic case for greater democracy in virtually all areas of life, from global to local, kicking big money out of politics in the process. At the same time, Monbiot’s intuition regarding “belonging” resonates with the present political mood. Was it not a desire for belonging that drove much of the Brexit vote, or at least a sense of not belonging to Brussels? This is a highly contemporary book, potentially offering the left a set of implements with which to win arguments on terrain often dominated by the populist right. After the depressing sight of Boris Johnson touring ex-industrial regions in a bus promising NHS funding that he knew would never materialise, the need for a more sincere vision of how people might “take back control” remains pressing. Monbiot’s hopeful, practical energy is precisely what the left needs right now. Some of it borders on the utopian, but then so did Hayek’s story. Optimism does produce its blind spots. Monbiot is alive to the thrill of popular power, but the dangers are absent. He touches on the pessimistic vision of Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century philosopher who argued that the central function of the state is to stop us slaughtering each other, given our innately suspicious and arrogant nature. “Today,” Monbiot reassures us, “knowing what we do about the nature and origins of humanity, we can state unequivocally” that Hobbes’s view “is mistaken”. We’d all like this to be true (even Hobbes would have done), but that’s a brave call, especially on the post-neoliberal precipice on which we stand. The yearning for belonging has historically been associated with romantic conservatism, although Monbiot offers some good counterexamples, such as the Clarion magazine, which formed socialist societies and ramblers’ and cycling clubs during the 1890s. In the current climate, this poses a couple of questions, at least for the less optimistic reader. One is whether democratic participation can deliver the same sense of belonging as the darker political forces that are stirring, with their promise to look after their own and lock out the others. If the left is to start a conversation about belonging, it needs to be confident that it can finish it. After all, there is another storyteller in Britain, also challenging the cult of GDP growth and prioritising a sense of belonging: his name is Nigel Farage. It is far from certain that democracy – even thriving, inclusive democracy – will produce the happy social and environmental outcomes Monbiot expects it to, including a respect for science. The indeterminacy of popular power is both its thrill and its danger. At one point Monbiot writes expertly on how to combine music, “energisers” and speakers to convert the vitality of protest marches into more lasting campaign outcomes. “The energiser would bring back the musicians to lead the crowd in an anthem: there’s no better way of generating a sense of solidarity and shared emotion,” which sounds as much like a Trump rally as the ones that attract Monbiot’s sympathies. Monbiot might well respond that severe dangers have already been realised, in the form of climate change, political corruption, psychological distress and inequality. Why live in fear of emerging enemies, when the established ones are already running amok? Out of the Wreckage is partly an activists’ manual, which aims to coordinate and energise those who want a different world. You don’t build an evocative story out of warnings and fears.

"Tomorrow, the horticultural industry gathers in Birmingham at the Glee international garden show, with the major high street retailers deciding how and what we will grow in our gardens next year. Yet among the commercial bustle, there remains a deafening silence that shames this £5bn business and our national passion – why is peat still being used in our gardens? The importance of our remaining peatlands to people and planet is hard to overstate. They are the unrivalled kings of carbon storage. Known peatlands cover about 3% of the world’s land surface yet store twice as much carbon as all of Earth’s standing forest and provide a haven to unique wildlife – from threatened wild flowers through dragonflies to curlews. Yet 2m cubic metres of peat are sold annually for us to plant begonias and tomatoes.   There is growing demand for peat-free alternatives: a 2017 survey conducted by Plantlife, Friends of the Earth, RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts established that consumers are crying out for peat-free products, yet a third of respondents couldn’t find peat-free compost clearly available. And sales of peat are still increasing despite the looming 2020 government ban. Carbon-rich peat, dating back millennia and growing at a rate of only 1mm a year, makes up over half of the compost sold every year in the UK. The government needs to give a shot of adrenalin to its commitment to phase out peat and support the industry to divest away from peat and keep what remains safely protected in the ground not the grow bag.Martin Harper Director, Global Conservation, RSPBStephanie Hilborne CEO, Wildlife TrustsBen McCarthy Director of strategy, PlantlifePaul de Zylva Senior nature campaigner, Friends of the Earth • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"The number of hungry people in the world has increased for the first time since the turn of the century, sparking concern that conflict and climate change could be reversing years of progress. In 2016, the number of chronically undernourished people reached 815 million, up 38 million from the previous year. The increase is due largely to the proliferation of violence and climate-related shocks, according to the state of food insecurity and nutrition in 2017, a report produced by five UN agencies.  The study also noted a rise in the number of people globally who are chronically hungry, from 10.6% in 2015 to 11% in 2016. Cindy Holleman, a senior economist at the Food and Agriculture Organisation, said it was hard to know whether the increase was a blip or marked the reversal of a long-term trend. However, she said the rise in conflict and climate change – factors that rank alongside economic slowdown, which makes food hard to access for poor people, as key drivers of food insecurity – was cause for concern. “Whether it has been a blip and it’s going to go back down again, we’re not sure,” said Holleman. “But we’re sending warning signals. We are sending a message that something is going on. “If you look at the 815 million [chronically undernourished] people, 489 million or 60% of them are located in countries affected by conflict. Over the last decade we’re seen a significant increase in conflict. We also see that conflict combined with climatic effects is having a significant effect.” A foreword to the report, written jointly by the heads of the five UN agencies, said: “Over the past decade, conflicts have risen dramatically in number and become more complex and intractable in nature. “This has set off alarm bells we cannot afford to ignore: we will not end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 unless we address all the factors that undermine food security and nutrition. Securing peaceful and inclusive societies is a necessary condition to that end.” Oxfam’s head of food and climate change, Robin Willoughby, said:“This must act as a wake-up call for international leaders and institutions to do more to resolve the catastrophic cocktail of climate change and conflict around the world. Global failure to tackle these issues affects us all, but it’s the world’s poorest who will suffer most.” The report is the first UN global assessment of food security and nutrition following the adoption of the sustainable development goals, which aim to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. Progress has been made on reducing global hunger, which affected more than 900 million people at the turn of the century. Over the past year, however, hunger has reached an “extreme level” in many parts of the world, with famine declared in South Sudan in February, and Yemen, north-east Nigeria and Somalia considered on the brink. People living in countries affected by protracted crisis are nearly two and a half times more likely to be undernourished than those living elsewhere, the report said. Fuelled partly by extreme weather patterns resulting from El Niño, food security “deteriorated sharply” in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and in south-east and western Asia, said the report. Chronic child malnutrition continues to fall, but at a slower rate in some regions, the report found. Wasting remains a threat to the lives of 52 million children. Overweight and obesity rates in children are rising in most regions, and in all regions for adults. Such “multiple burdens” for malnutrition is a “cause for serious concern”, said the report. Africa has the highest levels of severe food insecurity, affecting 27.4% of the population – almost four times that of any other region. Higher food insecurity was also observed in Latin America, rising from 4.7% to 6.4%."
"A new analysis looking at the long-term trends of more than 900 species of wildlife in Canada has found that half of them have seen their populations decline, including several species already listed as threatened or endangered. The Living Planet Report Canada, released on Thursday by World Wildlife Fund Canada, paints a bleak picture for wildlife in a country that is home to a quarter of the earth’s wetlands, 8,500 rivers and more than 2m freshwater lakes.   During the past four decades, human activity – whether industrial development, farming, forestry or the expansion of urban areas – as well as climate change, pollution and overfishing have helped shrink the populations of 451 species, representing half of the 903 monitored species in the country. “I think for many Canadians, it’s somewhat of a surprise,” said James Snider of WWF Canada and the lead author of the report. “Canada is this vast nation with huge wilderness areas, at times we assume that wildlife here is doing OK.” The list of species in decline ranges from the woodland caribou, who grace the country’s 25¢ coin but have seen their habitat shrink from logging, mining and gas development, to the several species of whale that live off Canada’s three coasts. The report found that for species with diminishing populations, the average loss was 83% of their population. “That’s a really striking number,” said Snider. The report – billed by the conservation group as the most comprehensive synthesis of Canadian wildlife population trends to date – was compiled using more than 400 sources of data on species population. Scientists looked at more than 3,700 populations of vertebrates, including 106 specials of mammals, hundreds of fish and bird species and dozens of 46 amphibians and reptiles, during a period that stretched from 1970 to 2014. Wide gaps remain in regions such as the Arctic, where a lack of historical information prevented researchers from drawing conclusive results. It’s a critical omission, said Snider. “Climate change is being witnessed in the Arctic at a rate really not seen elsewhere in the world. We need to be effectively monitoring today the status of wildlife populations so that we can understand the impacts of climate change on a lot of really unique and important species in the Canadian north.” Of the 903 monitored species – representing about half of the known vertebrates in Canada – 407 species showed an increase in population, while 45 remained stable.  Success stories included the once struggling raptors – such as Cooper’s hawks and peregrine falcons – whose species have seen their numbers swell an average of 88% in recent decades, thanks to the reduced use and outright bans of pesticides such as DDT. Their rebound hints at the turnaround that is possible, said Snider. “So when we as society decide to take action and elevate the concern of wildlife, we are able to make real change.”  Researchers, however, found that federal legislation – one of the country’s primary tools aimed at protecting wildlife at risk – had failed to stem the decline of many species. The report looked at 64 species protected by federal legislation and found their populations diminished by an average of 2.7% per year since 2002, when federal legislation was adopted to protect species at risk, as compared to an annual decline of 1.7% between 1970 and 2002.  “According to researchers, the federal Species at Risk Act (Sara) has faltered in its mission to protect Canada’s most beleaguered wildlife,” the report noted. A number of peer-reviewed journal articles have documented shortcomings in the federal government’s efforts to curb the loss of wildlife, from delays in recognising critical habitat to the years-long process of creating recovery strategies.  Snider pointed to the beluga whale population in the St Lawrence estuary off Quebec as a potent example of these issues. After the population was listed as threatened in 2005, the creation of a recovery strategy dragged on for seven years.  It took until 2016 for the beluga’s habitat to be legally protected – more than a decade after the species was initially listed as threatened. The delays were not without consequence, as this year saw the status of the St Lawrence beluga upgraded to endangered. “This is a clear message that we need to be doing more to prevent the decline of wildlife,” said Snider. “If the rate of decline of wildlife continues as it is today, I do think we face the risk of beginning to lose species from Canada.”"
"For Rob Vertessy, the attacks on his government agency became tedious and time-consuming and no less irritating because they were coming from a motivated group of “amateurs”. Vertessy spent a decade at Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology. He retired in April 2016 after five years as the agency’s director.   Over that time, Vertessy’s agency was under consistent attack from climate science denialists who would claim, often through the news and opinion pages of the Australian, that the weather bureau was deliberately manipulating its climate records to make recent warming seem worse than it really was. “From my perspective, people like this, running interference on the national weather agency, are unproductive and it’s actually dangerous,” Vertessy told me. “Every minute a BoM executive spends on this nonsense is a minute lost to managing risk and protecting the community. It is a real problem.” Now, the agency is under another wave of attack through the pages of the Rupert Murdoch-owned broadsheet, which is publishing claims made by Jennifer Marohasy, of the “free market” conservative thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs.  Earlier this week, the former Abbott government adviser and climate science denier Maurice Newman accused the bureau of “fabricating temperature records” that represented a “smoking gun that threatens the integrity of global temperature records”. As rhetorical overreach goes, Newman has form. “The scientific delusion, the religion behind the climate crusade, is crumbling,” Newman has written.  The current non-story centres on two of the bureau’s 695 automatic weather stations (AWS). As temperatures reached -10.4C in Thredbo and Goulburn in July, a hardware card in the AWS stopped working. This event, detected by the bureau, kick-started several internal quality control processes. The bureau found four other hardware cards in areas where things can get chilly and replaced them. The cards should not have been used, as they could become faulty at low temperatures.  That’s essentially it. But the Australian and the IPA and the network of climate science denial blogs have once again screamed scandal. In an interview with shock jock Alan Jones, who thinks climate science is “witchcraft”, Marohasy claimed the bureau had “reached a new low”. Jones called for people to be sacked.  A report was also commissioned by the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, with three external independent reviewers joining bureau staff.  Was this really a scandal? A smoking gun? No.  The review found the incident, if we can even grant it that status, had “no direct or indirect” impact on the bureau’s long-term climate dataset (known as ACORN-SAT). The bureau’s procedures worked and its data quality control processes were “of a high standard”, the review found.  “The Australian people have been well served by the bureau and can continue to rely on the excellent services it provides,” Frydenberg said. Much of the current noise is like deja vu for Vertessy, who is now a part-time professor at the University of Melbourne’s school of engineering. “I was exposed to a lot of it and it took up a lot of my time that’s for sure,” he says. “I feel for my successor and the team at the bureau having to constantly devote energy to this. It’s really quite debilitating. “Time and time again there has been one independent review by experts after another, all telling the same story. The simple, unimpeachable facts are that the BoM is doing an exemplary job at managing the nation’s climate data and multiple independent reviews have confirmed that and we are recognised by our World Meteorological Organisation peers as being amongst the best in the world; that keeps being restated and restated.  “I think the Australian play on very dangerous ground here,” he says, adding that some editors at the newspaper were guilty of “perpetuating nonsense”. “For a newspaper that has a strapline that reads ‘for the informed Australian’ they really should refocus on talking to people that know something about the topic, instead of perpetuating this bizarre myth that the BoM are fraudsters [or] conspirators.” Vertessy says staff inside the bureau are well aware of the concerted attempts to attack their work. “They understand that there is an organised climate denial network and that it has a fever swamp that communicates amongst itself and occasionally tries to enter the national debate through the agency of leading newspapers and the like,” he says.  “That’s very well understood, because it is very well documented. It remains hurtful and creates anxiety among the technical specialists involved in this but those people do the right thing and buckle down. They are a great bunch of people.”  In 2009, the bureau’s then most senior climatologist, Dr Michael Coughlan, told me that the agency had stopped responding to claims being pushed in the Australian newspaper. “The Australian clearly has an editorial policy,” he said. “No matter how many times the scientific community refutes these arguments, they persist in putting them out – to the point where we believe there’s little to be gained in the use of our time in responding.’’  So how should the agency respond when it comes under attack?  Vertessy says: “It has perplexed us all over the years about the extent to which we should or shouldn’t engage in the so-called ‘ping pong’ of this stuff. I think Mike’s commentary remains largely intact.  “We see limited gains in arguing with a newspaper that has got a rusted on view about these matters and is not open to reasoned debate.” He says that, instead, the bureau’s staff put their energies into “continual improvement” of their methods. Vertessy says that, while he considers the current wave of attacks “a tremendous waste” of the government’s time, he has sympathy for ministers. “When something makes front-page news in a national newspaper, it requires a political response and I think over the years the government has done a pretty good job in sticking with the bureau and independent experts in examining these matters rationally and reporting on them and communicate them transparently to the public.” He says that, during his own tenure, the government has consistently supported the bureau because it trusts its experts. “I’m not saying they would not be concerned about the claims that are made but, at the end of the day, they have a reasonable level of trust and certainly supported me through my time and I never felt under siege by the government. But I felt under siege by the Australian and the IPA.” He says the constant attacks have also changed the way the bureau interacts with the media on climate change. “The BoM provides amazing access for the media to its people but, on climate change, we have had to implement stricter protocols about who is authorised to talk and how. I implemented a lot of that stuff, quite frankly, because the minute you are entering the polity of the country in the debate, as are senior bureaucrats, you have to treat it carefully and look at it as a risk and manage it accordingly.  “If someone says the wrong thing then it’s likely to be amplified one hundred times fold into something that looks like a scandal, when it is anything but.”  So when a shock jock or a thinktank employee claims the bureau is trying to cook the books, how should the public react?  What needs to be front of mind, Vertessy says, is that there is “virtually complete consensus on the extent to which the planet has warmed and why, since the beginning of the industrial revolution”. “The facts are just unequivocal because they have been replicated so many times, by so many teams, using multiple independent methods.” He says if the bureau “was really making a hash of managing its climate data” then it would be documented in scientific “journals and at symposia” but “that’s clearly not happening”. He says it “beggars belief” that these commentators “actually profess to know better”.  “They simply don’t,” he says. “Think about the big picture and don’t get lost in the smokescreen that’s created by people who are trying to undermine the science. “The data absolutely confirms that we have already seen consequences from climate change, certainly in the way the climate system is behaving. There’s just zero doubt about it any more.  “Looking into the future is of course more fraught, but that strongly suggests that we are on a very dangerous trajectory.” He says while making predictions of the future clearly comes with uncertainties, the planet is on “a very dangerous trajectory”. “We know plenty enough to say that unless there is corrective action in the amount of emissions – very significant corrective action I might add – then we will enter increasingly dangerous times that will be very costly throughout the world to life, food security, water security and to the economic damage wrought by severe like we have seen in the United States in the last few days.  “So I have to admit that I am something of a climate pessimist because I worry about the trajectory that we are on.  “But, as the costs of climate change accumulate in the years ahead, I can see that leaders of this climate change denial movement will really be seen as culpable.”"
"Like the debate over gun control, the public discussion in the US about whether to take action on the climate has often been characterised as a struggle between powerful lobbies and violent reality. After each campus shooting or hurricane disaster, there is a brief uptick of concern followed by a gradual return to entrenched positions as the National Rifle Association or the oil industry reassert their influence, inevitably raising the question: just how bad do things have to get to reach a tipping point?  Fortunately, such parallels go only so far. The past few days have shown not only that the scale of catastrophe is getting worse, but the price of a solution is getting cheaper. The apocalyptic devastation wreaked by hurricanes Irma and Harvey is clearly in line with scientific predictions that a warming world will come with an immense humanitarian and financial toll. In the US alone, the cost of the damage caused by the two hurricanes is estimated at $290bn – or 1.5% of GDP. The toll in the worst-hit Caribbean islands has not yet been calculated but it will be far greater relative to the size of the battered economies. But while the problem has never looked grimmer, the most likely solution – a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy – has rarely looked as desirable or financially feasible as it does now. Yesterday brought news from the UK that offshore wind prices have fallen by half in the past two years and are now – for the first time – lower than nuclear and gas. This is an exciting breakthrough, perhaps the biggest ever for the renewable industry in Britain. It is no longer just academics and campaigners pushing clean energy for scientific and idealistic reasons. Now the market has bought into the hard-headed business case – and ahead of time. The speed of this transformation has stunned industry observers and delighted climate campaigners, who see it as part of a faster, and cheaper, worldwide takeup of wind and solar power than was forecast . Technology needs to advance further for this revolution to maintain momentum. The fossil fuel and nuclear industries are increasingly struggling to compete in terms of cost but they argue they are a more stable supplier of electricity when there is no wind and no sun. But that does not have to be the case. It can change if the government and business sector do more to develop and promote battery technology so that solar and wind energy can be stored and distributed at night and between breezes. There are already promising steps forward. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, has grabbed most of the headlines with his attempt to build the world’s biggest lithium battery to support the grid in Australia, expanding the range of electric cars and enabling solar homes to spread energy use across the day. But he has many rivals. China and Germany are investing billions of dollars in this game-changing field. In Spain, one company – Acciona – is already combining batteries with turbines to extend the duration of wind supply. In the deserts of Chile, a giant solar plant uses locally mined salt as a store of thermal energy. Elsewhere power companies are experimenting with silicon and graphite – which may one day provide abundant alternatives to scarce lithium. Even the British government – which has cut subsidies for renewable energy – has bought into the argument for better batteries and smart meters to smooth out the peaks and troughs in electricity supply and demand. In July it announced plants to create a national battery institute as part of a £264m funding pledge for research into the field – all of which will erode the need for fossil fuels as the devastating long-term costs of oil, gas and coal become more apparent and publicly challenged. Lawsuits have already been filed against ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP for rising sea levels, with some scientists claiming these three companies alone are responsible for 6% of sea level rise. The hurricanes and wildfires in the US – like the floods, droughts and extreme temperatures that have struck India, Bangladesh, Chile, Peru and many other countries over the past year – are a reminder that the transformation cannot come quickly enough. Donald Trump may be trying to slow or reverse this process, but the events of the past few days have underlined there is enormous positive momentum, a strong business case and increasing risks from inaction. A key thing now will be public opinion in the US. The powerful oil lobby has rarely had such a strong presence in the White House. But the past few weeks ought to make a difference. The scientific debate is long since over, the business case is now clear, and the humanitarian consequences have never been more apparent. But without political change, the tipping point is more likely to be towards expensive disasters than cheap energy. • Jonathan Watts is the Guardian’s global environment editor"
"In a manner reminiscent of Stephen King’s Bazaar of Bad Dreams, dark clouds of despair and destruction hover yet again over the Caribbean with the passage of Hurricane Maria. The most recent version of our recurring ecological nightmare included Hurricane Harvey followed by Hurricane Irma, the latter setting a new record of three consecutive days as a category 5 storm with maximum wind speeds of 185mph, and leaving a trail of devastation British foreign secretary Boris Johnson described as “absolutely hellish”.  Maria’s full fury is yet to be revealed but social media posts from Dominica’s prime minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, and acting high commissioner for Dominica to the UK, Janet Charles, early on Tuesday morning described the destruction, the latter posting on Facebook: “Dominica has been brutalised by the hurricane. Please let the world know. We need help!” Communications with Dominica have since been lost. The London-based high commissions from the Caribbean, while outside the hurricane’s path, are not immune from its wrath. We’re currently contacting loved ones at home, planning yet another round of appeals for assistance, and continuing our prayers for protection from the ravages of this cycle of bad weather and failing that, the strength to resist until the close of the Atlantic hurricane season at the end of November. The Caribbean now finds itself fighting on two fronts. First, against nature’s fury, second, against public opinion that questions whether the hurricane-ravaged islands are deserving of international aid. Britain’s call for urgent changes to international rules on aid to allow UK development assistance budgets to be used to help victims of these hurricanes has unbelievably been met with resistance. Many in the Caribbean share Theresa May’s frustration with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) development assistance committee (DAC) rules that exclude countries such as St Kitts and Nevis and British Overseas Territories including Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos from receiving much-needed official development assistance from international aid budgets. However, the response to the UK’s call for an update to these rules established 40 years ago has been disheartening. The prevailing view of the international donor community is that the gross national income per capita of these islands is too high for them to have access to aid budgets designed to relieve poverty, a perspective shared by the international NGO community. As people in hurricane-struck islands struggle to find any kind of footing, the international development charity Christian Aid argued: “The [UK] overseas aid budget is quite rightly subject to serious scrutiny and a set of rules which ringfence overseas aid spending to ensure it goes to the poorest people in the poorest countries. Overseas Territories are not among the world’s poorest countries. In fact, the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven, has a higher GDP per capita than the UK.” The statement concluded with the stony suggestion that: “The companies and investors that use tax havens like some of the British Overseas Territories, all have a role to play in rebuilding those communities.” This perspective is premised on two misconceptions. First, the egregious notion that “tax havens” exist in the Caribbean. While the Caribbean contains low tax jurisdictions, they form part of a wider strategy to diversify Caribbean economies. Moreover, the development of international business and financial centres mirrors the practice of many developed countries as shown by a report published by Oxfam last December, in which Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are ranked among the world’s 10 lowest-tax jurisdictions. The second fallacy is the limited way in which the deserving poor are identified. DAC rules restrict overseas aid to low- and middle-income countries based on GNI per capita as computed by the World Bank. This classification by economic data alone is both dated and myopic. It ignores the acute vulnerability of small countries, particularly those island states in the Caribbean and Pacific vulnerable to catastrophic storms. For over four decades, the Commonwealth of Nations, the recognised champion of small states in terms of policy research and global advocacy, has demonstrated that small states face a unique set of development challenges because of their size, limited range of products and exports, scarce financial resources and susceptibility to the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Through the Commonwealth vulnerability index, the international donor community was offered an additional criterion to determine the classification of developing countries. This is yet to become a reality. In the blink of an eye, small islands states can be hurled from seeming prosperity to absolute poverty, lacking the basic human needs: water, food, clothing, shelter and sanitation. As Roosevelt Skerrit wrote following the passage of Hurricane Maria: “Initial reports are of widespread devastation. So far we have lost all what money can buy and replace. My greatest fear for the morning is that we will wake to news of serious physical injury and possible deaths as a result of likely landslides triggered by persistent rains … We will need help, my friends, we will need help of all kinds.” And ironically, although Antigua and Barbuda was pummelled by Irma, as it recently exceeded the DAC country income threshold, it may be deemed ineligible for official development assistance at this year’s review. Unlike those in the US threatened by Harvey, Irma and possibly Maria, there is nowhere to run to on Caribbean islands. And there is no pool of resources domestically to mobilise afterwards. As depicted in the media recently following Irma, it is almost like game over; nothing left but hardship and faith. And in the midst of the efforts to rebuild – for Caribbean people are formidable – the provision of essential needs is thwarted by DAC rules. It is not as if the OECD, the club of the world’s wealthiest countries, is being asked to set a precedent, for this has already been done by the European Union through the European Development Fund (EDF). In 2013, when the 11th EDF, the EU’s main instrument for providing development aid to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and to overseas countries and territories, was concluded, the main modification was to ensure more flexibility and faster reactions in the case of unexpected events. A new shock-absorbing scheme was created to help countries to mitigate the short-term effects of exogenous shocks such as natural disasters. I hope that the UN and the Commonwealth will discuss the vulnerability of small island developing states in New York this week as the international community gathers for the United Nations general assembly, the Commonwealth foreign affairs ministers meeting and the UK-hosted pre-2018 Commonwealth summit reception. On Tuesday, as St Kitts and Nevis braces in anticipation of Hurricane Maria, it also marks its 34th anniversary of independence. We pray that it has cause for thanksgiving and, if it comes to the worst, that the Commonwealth will demonstrate duty of care and the international community will follow in doing what is right and just and come to its aid. Like every island ravaged by hurricane, it deserves it. • Guy Hewitt is Barbados high commissioner"

"It’s always hot in Bidyadanga but a few degrees can make a big difference in the remote Aboriginal community, about 190km south of Broome in Western Australia. “It’s always hot – it’s the desert – but the difference between 33C and 36C can be quite oppressive,” said Shaun Burgess, a teacher in the community.  This winter, it mattered more than most – 2017 was Australia’s warmest on record for average maximum temperatures, which reached nearly 2C above the winter average and beat the previous record set in 2009 by 0.3C, according to a report released by the Climate Council on Tuesday. In July alone 72 records were broken for the highest maximum temperature, including in Sydney, which set a record high of 26.5C. Bidyadanga was one of those 72; on July 27 it reached 36.3C, the hottest day in Australia’s warmest July. It also broke its previous July record of 35.7C, set in 2016. “It’s made it really difficult to do things like go camping or fishing with the students, which is something we’ve done a lot of in previous years,” Burgess said. “There’s been less of an opportunity to clear the mind, less of a reprieve, I guess.” And the reprieves may be becoming rarer. Australia has set new seasonal highs for maximum temperatures 10 times so far this century and the Climate Council report found that more than 260 heat and low rainfall records were broken between June and August this year. It was the fifth warmest winter on record for average temperatures, and the driest since 2002. Daytime temperature averages were above average for almost the entire country; more than 90% of Australia was in the highest 10% of historical observations. And as summer approaches, a third of the country is at above average risk from bushfire damage as a result of the hot, dry weather. “Winter warm spells are lasting longer, occurring more often and becoming more intense,” the report said. “The likelihood of such warm winters occurring will continue to increase as global temperatures rise.” The report used research by Andrew King, a climate extremes research fellow at the University of Melbourne, to argue that the “exceptionally” warm and dry winter was caused by climate change. King used computer climate models to compare today’s human-impacted climate with simulations representing an alternative world that excluded human influences.  He found the record winter temperatures were 60 times more likely to have been caused by human-included climate change. “Another way of putting that is if we hadn’t had climate change at all the chance of getting a winter like this would be much smaller,” he said. “It would be a very, very unlikely event.” The Climate Council report warns that the increased incidence of runs of hot weather affects the agriculture and energy sectors. As summer approaches, large parts of the country are in increased bushfire danger. Last week firefighters across Australia’s east coast were tested by record September temperatures as a total fire ban was issued in parts of New South Wales.  “In the south these areas broadly include the Australian Capital Territory, south and east Victoria, eastern NSW, south and central Queensland, and southern and northern regions of South Australia,” it warns. “Further, the warm and dry winter conditions mean the southern fire season is likely to begin earlier than usual.” The warmer-than-average temperatures were predicted by the Bureau of Meteorology in its winter outlook published in May. It stated that, in addition to “natural drivers” such as the El Niño weather pattern, Australia’s climate was “being influenced by the long-term increasing trend in global air and ocean temperatures”."
"In an industrial greenhouse about 30km from Zurich, plump aubergines and juicy cherry tomatoes are ripening to perfection. Growing Mediterranean crops in Switzerland would traditionally be energy intensive but these vegetables are very nearly carbon-neutral. The greenhouse uses waste energy from a nearby refuse plant, and carbon dioxide from the world’s first commercial direct air capture plant. The facility, designed by Zurich-based start-up Climeworks, pumps the gas into greenhouses to boost the plants’ photosynthesis and increase their yield, it hopes, by up to 20%. Climeworks says it will extract around 900 tonnes of CO2 a year from the air.  The company’s end game is not plumper tomatoes but something far more ambitious – proving that carbon dioxide can be recycled from the atmosphere and turned into something useful. If this installation is a success, Climeworks wants to sell its concentrated carbon dioxide to companies producing carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels. With concentrations of CO2 at their highest in the last 400,000 years, the world needs to remove the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere – as well as cut emissions – if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change.  Of course, nature has been recycling carbon dioxide for millions of years. Photosynthesis turns sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into sugars which fuel plants, which provide us with food, wood and complex sugars for fuel. But most plants turn less than 1% of the solar energy they receive into useful energy-rich compounds.  Scientists and entrepreneurs are working on technologies that they hope will improve on nature and make recycling carbon dioxide a profitable industry.   The World Economic Forum and Scientific American recently named an artificial leaf as one of the top emerging technologies of 2017. Dan Nocera, a chemist at Harvard University, is one of the scientists working on developing this “leaf”, which looks like a small, plain computer chip.  Nocera’s leaf has an energy efficiency of around 10%, according to his paper published last year in Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal. It has two processes. The first is an electrochemical system that uses metal catalysts and electricity from solar panels to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Then the hydrogen, along with carbon dioxide, is fed to bacteria commonly found in soil and water. The bacteria convert the gases into alcohols like methanol and ethanol that are the precursors to liquid fuels.  These “solar fuels” – so called because they are made from nothing more than sunlight, water and air – could be a carbon neutral drop-in replacement for today’s fossil fuels.  Nocera’s ultimate vision is a cheap, standalone solar-powered system for developing countries to turn water into fuel for vehicles, cooking or power generation. His initial target market is India, where he hopes local scientists and entrepreneurs will help to commercialise the system, although he admits that his technology is years from commercialisation.  In the meantime, several start-ups are trying to beat Nocera to a practical system to recycle CO2 into useful products. Like Nocera’s leaf, all are designed to run on a trickle of electricity from solar panels.  In 2015, Staff Sheehan left Yale University and founded Catalytic Innovations to use metal catalysts like Nocera’s to turn carbon dioxide and water into ethanol, a biofuel that is already added to petrol in many countries to reduce its carbon footprint. Another start-up, Opus 12, recently spun out of Stanford University in Silicon Valley says it’s “recreating photosynthesis, but at warp speed”. The company says its tech can be used at any source of CO2 emissions to produce syngas. This mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be burned like natural gas or used to produce a range of industrial chemicals.  And at the annual American Chemical Society meeting in Washington DC last month, a small company called Dioxide Materials said that it had developed electrolysis technology that could split carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbon monoxide – a precursor for methanol – with twice the efficiency of previous systems.  In order for CO2 recycling systems to operate efficiently, however, the gas has to be captured and concentrated from sources such as factories and power stations – or extracted from the air using a system like Climeworks’. And that isn’t cheap.  Capturing CO2 at a factory chimney could cost up to $80 per ton, according to research from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Extracting from thin air is pricier still. Climeworks says it currently costs around $600 to extract a ton of CO2, although it expects that price to halve in its second-generation plant. “Technologies to capture CO2 from the air, like Climeworks’ units, have the potential for the sort of steep price declines that we’ve seen from solar, wind, and batteries, which are also factory manufactured products,” says Matt Lucas of the Center for Carbon Removal, a non-profit dedicated to curtailing climate change. “But if we want to compete with gasoline,” says Sheehan, “that cost has to be practically nothing.”   There are a couple of dozen large-scale projects underway to capture and store carbon dioxide from industrial facilities, including a pilot in India turning CO2 into baking soda. However, the International Energy Agency says they are not on track to meet its objective for more than 100 projects by 2020.  Another challenge is the swift change in the political climate. “Traditionally, solar-fuelled artificial photosynthesis has been a government-funded effort,” says Dick Co, director of the Solar Fuels Institute, a global team of scientists working to recycle CO2 into fuels. “But accelerated by the US election last year, we’re seeing a quick shift from government money to philanthropists like Bill Gates and Tom Steyer.” It’s unknown whether these philanthropists will be committed to funding solar fuels over the years and decades they will need to reach commercial reality.  For young companies like Catalytic Innovations, that means seeking out every source of funding. Sheehan’s start-up has made it to the semi-finals of the NRG Cosia Carbon XPrize, a $20m competition to recycle waste carbon dioxide from power plants into valuable fuel or building materials. He is now looking for money to build a larger prototype in the hope of making it to the final round – which would come with half a million dollars seed money.  "
"Senior Trump administration officials on Sunday signalled a further softening of America’s resolve to leave the Paris climate accord, amid signs that the issue will be discussed at the United Nations general assembly in New York this week. Secretary of state Rex Tillerson and national security adviser HR McMaster both indicated that the US is open to negotiations on staying in the landmark international agreement to limit mankind’s role in global warming.  Donald Trump announced the withdrawal from the deal in June, leaving the US with only Syria and Nicaragua for company outside the global agreement. A US withdrawal from a deal made under the Obama administration was a Trump campaign pledge. The rules of the pact do not, however, allow the US to physically pull out until 2020. On Saturday the White House denied reports that it planned to remain in the agreement, saying its position on leaving was unchanged and that it would only stay in if it got more “favourable” terms. Although Tillerson and McMaster reiterated that the US wants a better deal, their willingness to talk about potential discussions on remaining in the accord was in striking contrast to the hostile tone taken by Trump on the issue and America’s previous position: that it planned to leave first and negotiate later. “The president said he is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue,” Tillerson told CBS’s Face the Nation. Tillerson said Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, was overseeing policy discussions for the White House. “So I think the plan is for Director Cohn to consider other ways in which we can work with partners in the Paris climate accord. We want to be productive. We want to be helpful.” The Trump administration was forced to issue its statement on Saturday after reports emerged from ministerial talks in Montreal, involving more than 30 countries and held in preparation for the next UN climate summit, in Bonn in November. Citing the European Union climate commissioner, Miguel Cañete, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump officials had said they would not pull out of the Paris accord and were offering to re-engage. Jochen Flasbarth, the German environment ministry state secretary who attended the Montreal meeting, disputed the accuracy of the report, saying in a statement emailed to the Guardian: “This is obviously a misunderstanding. The head of the US delegation did not imply that the US would reconsider its decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement.  “However, the Montreal talks were constructive and showed that the US administration does not want to cut all ties with the international climate community.”  McMaster said on ABC’s This Week it was possible the US would stay in the accord “if there’s an agreement that benefits the American people, certainly”. “The president is open to any discussions that will help us improve the environment,” he said, “that will help ensure our energy security and will advance out prosperity and the prosperity of American businesses and American workers.” Flasbarth said: “The Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated. National pledges can be updated but not weakened. After all, current pledges are not sufficient to limit global warming to 2C, let alone 1.5C.” The accord was reached in 2015, after many years of trying. Negotiators cheered and wept as more than 200 countries including the US and China pledged to limit emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Tillerson said that according to Trump, “we are willing to work with partners if we can construct a set of terms that we believe is fair and balanced for the American people.” He said the accord gave too much favour to China, but said the president was open to “finding the right conditions”. The apparent switch to diplomacy from such prominent White House officials could signal that Trump is retreating from his hardline course on climate change, which he famously called “a hoax”.  Staying in the Paris deal would also be another reversal on a signature policy issue. In recent weeks, Trump has secured a deal with Democratic leaders over the debt ceiling and government funding and indicated he is open to working across the aisle on immigration. Such moves are not popular with the hard-right Republican base that sustains a president with historically low approval ratings. McMaster, who said the Paris accord “gave the biggest polluters a free ride”, said Trump had said the US would pull out of the accord but could re-enter if conditions were favourable."

"They sat through hours of pummelling by Hurricane Irma, with winds pounding them at up to 115mph and rain driving in a solid white sheet as bright as a snow blizzard. Then on Monday, Floridians woke up to survey the damage, begin the cleanup and get back to carrying on regardless. By noon, the jet skiers were back on the water, buzzing around the west coast waterways under a blue sky where only hours before Irma had shaken the trees and put fear in people’s hearts. The catastrophe that had been forewarned over countless hours of rolling cable television appeared to have been avoided. But only narrowly. For its lucky escape, the US has Cuba to thank, given that the northern coast of the island soaked up an important part of Irma’s energy before the storm reached Florida. Not that the debt of gratitude will be repaid by the current incumbent of the White House. On Marco Island, a residential area on the west coast south of Naples where Irma made landfall on Sunday afternoon, hundreds of cars were lining up at the causeways. Their owners were desperate to get back home. They always tell us we will have a storm surge. I know they're doing it for safety reasons but I’ve never seen it happen But police barriers were preventing access and the island continued to be eerily empty of vehicles and people. You could have mistaken the day for one of the major holidays, Christmas or Thanksgiving, were it not for hundreds of trees strewn across the roads like green confetti. Despite the profuse warnings and orders to evacuate, about 1,000 people rode out the storm on Marco Island. All appeared safe, though windows were blown out in condominiums on the main waterfront. The question now is whether local residents, Floridians and by extension America writ large will ponder the lessons of Irma, consider its portent of intensifying extreme weather in the wake of climate change, and decide to do something about it. The early message coming from Marcos Islanders on Monday was crystal clear. No. Chris Roche, 52, a real estate lawyer, was taking a long hard look at the damage to his home. Three trees were down in the yard, some tiles had come off the roof and there were signs of grey mud on the road – Irma’s calling card, dredged up from the seabed and deposited right outside his door. That was enough destruction to be getting on with. Wasn’t he fed up with the constant disruption of his life, a pounding that was certain to get worse with sea-level rise and growing weather disturbances caused by climate change? This was the fifth or sixth hurricane he had sat through since he moved on to the island in 1979, he said with the nonchalance of someone discussing trips to the theater. He was more than a little skeptical of the warnings to evacuate which he had heard and duly ignored. “They always tell us we will have a storm surge,” he said. “I know they are doing it for safety reasons, but I’ve never seen it happen.” As for climate change? “I don’t think climate change is such a big deal.” That was quite a striking comment just hours after a massive hurricane of terrifying force, some of which may have been the gift of global warming, tore through his home.  “I don’t think man is the tipping point. I think it’s more natural than that. We’re not experiencing historically close [to] high temperatures, not even close to it.” On the other side of the island, in a group of mansion houses known as “the estate”, John Sullivan, 63, was cleaning up the driveway of a friend’s house that was strewn with palm fronds. He’d ridden the storm out there as it had a generator for power, which was otherwise down throughout the west coast. “I really thought we were going to get hammered this time,” he said. “Take away the downed trees and the missing roof tiles, for a cat[egory] 4 hurricane we could have done a whole lot worse.” Back in the evacuated hotel in Naples, Florida, where the Guardian and other journalists hunkered down as the storm passed through on Sunday, the storm chasers were packing their bags and preparing to move on to the next Big One. This time in Taiwan. “I think Irma did great,” one said. “It was a very solid hurricane. Very solid indeed.” "
"The Florida Keys are still closed until further notice. On the far side of the blockade that inhabitants of the lower Keys negotiate to return to their homes, the US One highway, a tarmac spine over the limestone vertebrae of the islands, makes its way 127 miles down to Key West, battered and torn. Key West, final south-easterly outpost of mainland North America and the self-styled “last resort”, is, still, four days after Hurricane Irma hit, almost completely out of contact with the outside world. Images have been surfacing all week. In Marathon, the sea draining away from an entire bay like dishwater off a dirty plate, leaving the ocean floor exposed to the daylight, while a woman films it from her balcony and screams: “My God! My God! The sea is gone!” In Key Largo, a stretch limousine banked crosswise across the highway. Big fridges stranded on plinths of trashed seagrass and mangrove leaves, their doors open, still full of food. Cars blown the short distance from road to shoreline, sideways in the shallows in a rusty puddle of their own fluids. Boats that have cracked the road with the force with which they’ve landed; in Islamorada, someone’s house being thrown along a lagoon and landing crooked in a new spot. I know and love these islands well. I’m wondering what they did with the dolphins in the sea aquarium; how the evacuation of the mental health facilities went; whether the drive-through bank where I used to cash my pay cheque got wrecked; what it’s like in the Winn-Dixie supermarket right now, and in the Kmart, in the dark. As the search-and-rescue operation moves further into the devastated Keys, I’m watching from England to see how this first-world humanitarian disaster unfolds. It’s an extraordinary corner of America: sub-tropical, subaqueous, and not especially suited for habitation. I’m wondering if its 70,000 inhabitants may be the canaries in the coalmine for the realities of climate change as it hits the developed world. The Keys are extreme. Curving away from the bottom tip of Florida, they nose out to sea in dribs and drabs towards the Caribbean. They’ve been fully inhabited for only 150 years. Drinking water has to be piped in from the mainland; the inhabitants used rainwater until 1940. The first Coca-Cola bottling plant arrived here in 1908 and they made the Coke with rainwater. Limestone, Miami oolite and white coral form what land there is; much of the territory consists of tracts of rich, eggy sea grass and webs of island-building mangrove. The boundaries between land and sea are porous: they call this terrain “the heavy dew”. Hurricane season lasts from May to November, during which time everyone is on evacuation alert. Inhabitants are below or only just above sea level. It’s scorching nearly all the time. Humidity is high. Reliance on air-conditioning is total. Machines roam the streets misting inhabited areas with mosquito repellent. The sewage infrastructure is questionable. These islands are a complex and fragile ecosystem. They are surrounded by the only living barrier reef in the continental United States, which forms a natural surf-break: their rigid structures absorb the shock of the impact of waves and wind and are essential in restraining high tides and hurricanes. Coral is a delicate creature; the reefs have, in recent years, been showing signs of stress. It is heartbreakingly beautiful. Jewel-blue sea stretches away to all horizons, replacing landscape. Everything oozes salt: the ground, the air, the leaves. At the edges, boardwalks lead through sparse, creaking pockets of resolutely inhospitable wilderness. On higher ground lie incredibly species-rich hammocks: homes for gumbo limbo trees, the giant Florida tree snail, and hundreds of other site-specific creatures. This is prime real estate, too: building continues apace on these swampy blobs of land. Key West is a kind of ocean frontier town, with an eye-poppingly eccentric history. The major industry now is tourism. It brands itself relentlessly: it is the Conch Republic, Home of the Sunset, Margaritaville, and – because Route 1 runs out there – The End of the Rainbow. It’s also Paradise, trademarked: its police cars have “Protecting Paradise” stencilled on them. The official town motto is One Human Family. Paradise? It sometimes feels like it. Protected? I’m not so sure. Spending time there was, for me, both joyous and uneasy. I was preoccupied by how frightening it must be in hurricanes, finding yourself where you actually are: on a pitch-dark, stiflingly humid island; a tropical coral-drift that beneath its veneer is entirely wild. Living there is a kind of conjuring trick, a process of mind over matter. It demands a hefty measure of denial in your margarita – eyes half-shut as another perfect sunset commences and the steel band strikes up beside the cruise liner. Denial is also there in the recent news that the US Department of Agriculture is censoring the term “climate change”. Call the weather what you want, the past few days have shown that the Americans in these outposts may find themselves living in a whole new kind of frontier: involuntary pioneers in the face of these new “weather extremes” and their unprecedented storms. • Joanna Guthrie is a poet and writer"

"The giant Anglo-Australian miner BHP has agreed to reconsider its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia, as well as other industry groups, and to clarify how BHP’s position on climate and energy policy differs from those bodies. The move comes as BHP faces a shareholder resolution urging the company to terminate membership of bodies that demonstrate a pattern of advocacy on policy issues at odds with the company’s positions since 2012.  The resolution was moved by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility on behalf of more than 120 shareholders of BHP. “The last decade or longer of Australian climate and energy policy has been characterised by short-lived policy subject to relentless scrutiny and adversarial campaigning by industry bodies, or no policy at all,” the ACCR said on behalf of about the shareholders in a supporting statement. The statement called for BHP to review membership of industry bodies, and singled out the Minerals Council of Australia, noting its activities have “diminished the federal government’s ability to resolve a national policy issue of material relevance to our company and the stability of its operations”. “The MCA’s activities undermine the possibility of achieving what our company has stated an ‘effective policy framework’ should include: a complementary set of measures including a price on carbon, support for low-emissions technologies, energy efficiency and measures to build resilience,” the statement said. “Over time, these activities have the potential to undermine shareholder value, given our company’s exposure to climate-related risk and energy instability.” In 2016 AGL, Australia’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, left the MCA, citing material differences in their positions on climate change and energy. “AGL’s positions on climate change and renewable energy differed from those held by the Minerals Council of Australia and the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, and AGL has elected not to renew its membership of these organisations,” the company said. In recent months BHP has expressed public displeasure at some of the MCA’s lobbying activities.   The CSIRO has come under fire for its membership of the MCA. In a statement uploaded to the BHP website on Monday, the miner said it would review its membership of industry bodies, specifically mentioning the Minerals Council of Australia. It also committed to publishing statements on how its positions differ from industry groups on climate change. “In the past, we have always sought to make our position on significant public issues clear,” BHP said. “However, we will further our efforts to ensure that material differences with industry associations on key issues are clearly understood. “To that end, we will make public, by 31 December 2017, a list of the material differences between the positions we hold on climate and energy policy, and the advocacy positions on climate and energy policy taken by industry associations to which we belong.”"
"Public support for marriage equality has dropped 4% in a fortnight and opposition is up 3%, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. With the postal survey campaign now in full swing, and with analysis suggesting opponents of marriage equality have outspent the yes campaign by about five-to-one in television ads, the latest poll shows 55% (down 4% from a fortnight ago) support changing the law to allow same-sex couples to marry and 34% (up 3%) are opposed.  But while support for a yes vote has fallen as the no campaign has intensified its efforts to raise concerns about religious freedom, including with public interventions by the former prime minister John Howard, there is a structural upside for the yes campaign – given the postal survey will turn ultimately on efforts to get out the vote in a non-compulsory ballot. People indicating they will definitely vote in the survey are more likely to support same-sex marriage than oppose it and, of the group who have already cast their votes, 59% support same-sex marriage and 37% oppose changing the law. The latest poll of 1,808 respondents indicates 71% of people in favour of same-sex marriage will definitely vote compared with 60% of those opposed. Nine per cent of the Guardian Essential poll sample have already cast their vote and 62% (no change from a fortnight ago) say they will “definitely” vote and 12% (down 4%) will “probably” vote. The poll finds 11% yet to take a position on whether to vote yes or vote no. A clear majority of Labor and Greens supporters are yes voters, while the Coalition cohort is more evenly split, with 47% voting yes, 42% voting no and 12% undecided. Those most in favour of changing the marriage laws are Labor voters (65%), Greens voters (83%), women (62%) and people aged between 18 and 34 (61%). The latest poll shows federal Labor maintaining an election-winning lead over Malcolm Turnbull’s government on the two-party preferred measure – but the gap has narrowed over the past week in the government’s favour. Last week, Labor was ahead of the Coalition on 54% to 46%. This week, Labor is ahead 52% to 48%. The margin of error for the Guardian Essential poll is plus or minus 3%. Survey respondents were also asked a number of questions about climate change and cost of living – with both of those issues featuring in the political debate over energy policy, which dominated the last parliamentary sitting fortnight. There has been an increase since February in the number of Australians agreeing with the statement that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity. A clear majority agrees with that statement, 60% of the sample, up 4% from when the question was last asked in February – while 24% (down 1%) believe we may just be witnessing a normal fluctuation in the Earth’s climate. People under 35 are more likely to have the view that climate change is happening than people over 55 but a majority of the over 55s (54%) also say climate change is happening and is caused by human activity. Voters are also increasingly concerned that not enough is being done to mitigate the risks, with 56% (up 7% since December) believing Australia is not doing enough to address climate change and 20% (down 2%) thinking Australia is doing enough. Young people and people with university-level education are the most concerned about government inaction on climate change. Of the cohort who believe that climate change is happening, 75% think Australia is not doing enough. In making its decision about energy policy over the coming weeks, in political terms, the Turnbull government will have to balance community concerns about climate risks with cost of living pressures and it is clear that rising energy prices are also biting. When it comes to cost of living pressures, people are most concerned about rising electricity and gas bills (46%), followed by housing (34%), medical and dental (25%) and fresh food (21%). Voters aged between 18 and 34 were most concerned about the cost of housing (47%), followed by electricity and gas (42%) and fresh food (25%). People aged between 35 and 54 were more worried about utility bills (52%) than housing (39%) – followed by medical and dental costs (28%). Voters over 55 were also most concerned about costs of electricity and gas (52%) and medical/dental (28%). With slow wages growth also a hot button political issue, as well as a challenge for the Australian economy, 52% of the Guardian Essential sample said they had not had a salary boost in the past 12 months. Thirty-six per cent of workers reported a wage increase in the past year, with 43% of full-time workers and 34% of part-time workers saying they had received a pay increase in the last 12 months. Workers earning higher salaries were also more likely to have had a boost to their pay packet in the past 12 months, with 46% of workers earning $2,000 or more per week saying they had a wage increase compared to 25% of those earning less than $1,000 per week. When asked to reflect on their personal financial situation, 33% of the sample said they were financially comfortable, 43% were “managing” and 20% said they were under financial pressure."
"“It’s a very sorry sight,” says Iain Cameron. It is late August and we are standing in front of Scotland’s very own Sphinx. It never had claws, paws, nor a mysterious countenance, but if it once had they would have melted away, just as the rest is about to do. “Grim,” says Cameron with gravel in his tone.  “It’s pretty much in its death throes.” Sphinx – so-called because of the rock climb directly above it – is a fast disappearing patch of snow situated in the most isolated of the corries in the Cairngorms. We have cycled six miles out from Whitewell near Aviemore along Gleann Eanaich trying to ignore scenery and the loudly blooming heather in our hurry to cover the distance to the slopes of Am Bràigh Riabhach – or Braeriach in the southern tongue – Scotland’s third-highest mountain at 1,296 metres (4,252ft). We scoot past the source of the River Dee with only a glance and a hasty slurp. Even lunch waits until we have plunged gravely over the steep side of Garbh Choire Mòr where our diminishing shrine lies.  Scotland does not have glaciers but usually, each year, a number of resilient patches of snow survive through the summer until they are once again covered by the fresh fall with the arrival of winter. Currently there are three patches left and their demise is imminent. Cameron, Scotland’s leading snow patch expert, says he would expect there to be 50-100 patches left at this time. Last year there were 82, and in the exceptional 2015 there were 678. The ground beneath the Sphinx snow patch has probably seen daylight for less than a few months since the start of the little ice age in the 16th-19th centuries.  This is the closest Scotland comes to having a glacier and makes Sphinx the most permanent and closely studied patch of snow in the British Isles. It has disappeared only a total of six times in the last 300 years: 1933, 1953, 1959, 1996, 2003 and 2006, almost always being the last patch to melt. A select trickle of discerning visitors have made the unlikely pilgrimage to this mountaineers’ sanctuary on the side of Braeriach. The celebrated Scottish naturalist Seton Gordon (1886–1977) came to record and photograph here in October 1910. A few days after our visit, my first and Cameron’s 16th, Cameron intends to bring his tally up to 17 in the company of the stand-up comic Ed Byrne, who happens to be an outdoors enthusiast and respected writer on the topic. When Sphinx disappeared in 1933 it was such an unusual occurrence that a member of the Scottish Mountaineering Club wrote a letter to the Times of London to say that such a thing “had never been known before” and that it was well worth “recording in a paper of record” because it was “unlikely to happen again”.  This late in the season, the snow patches sometimes look like dollops of dead dinosaur on the scree. Their skin-like surface is scalloped with ablation hollows formed by the passage of warm air over the snow creating ridges. These become more pronounced and attract pieces of debris that further accentuate the melting in the hollows. As snow of recent years melts it exposes harder, darker older layers. The 11-year-old hard “firn” at the base will be the last to go. Close by, you can also see the virgin pink of the granite. Even lichens and mosses struggle to get a toehold because the growing season is so short, leaving the granite pink in colour compared to the cliffs above where the same granite is greyer and darker, coloured by plant growth. Even lichens and mosses struggle to get a toehold, leaving the granite pink in colour compared to the darker cliffs The situation was very different last year when we took a similar September trip to the north face of Ben Nevis. There, at an altitude of 1,130 metres (3,707 ft) in Observatory gully, we found not only an enormous patch of snow but a tortoiseshell mini cathedral beneath it. Warm streams hollow out large snow patches from beneath leaving precarious but sculpturally spectacular caverns. If you find one – do not enter. They are highly unstable and very dangerous.  Despite being forever in the mountains it is unlikely Cameron will ever complete all of the Munros – the consequence of a childhood and lifelong fascination with summertime snow. “Year after year I go back to the same mountains, not only that but to the same locations on them, so I am getting to see them in all sorts of moods and atmospheres. I very seldom go to the peak in fact, as the snow tends to sit in the little gullies and corries below the peaks. I go straight to the snow.”  Having avoided the dominant culture of ticking off summits, he is well on the way to instituting an off-beat alternative. Going to highly inaccessible places for no other reason than to observe persistent patches of snow has become a minor social media phenomenon. His Snow Patches of Scotland Facebook page has 1,500 followers. “A multitude of people are now aware of what I do. The more ears and eyes that are out there, the easier my job.” A volunteer group has formed under his leadership which has, since 2008, conducted an annual snow patch survey gathering accurate data for the scientific community that monitors these subtleties of change in climate and environment."
"Asia’s mountain glaciers will lose at least a third of their mass through global warming by the century’s end, with dire consequences for millions of people who rely on them for fresh water, researchers have said. This is a best-case scenario, based on the assumption that the world manages to limit average global warming to 1.5C (2.7F) over pre-industrial levels, a team wrote in the journal Nature.  “To meet the 1.5C target will be a task of unprecedented difficulty,” the researchers said, “and even then, 36% (give or take 7%) of the ice mass in the high mountains of Asia is projected to be lost” by 2100. With warming of 3.5C, 4C and 6C respectively, Asian glacier losses could amount to 49%, 51% or 65% by the end of the century, according to the team’s modelling study. The high mountains of Asia comprise a geographical region surrounding the Tibetan plateau, holding the biggest store of frozen water outside the poles. It feeds many of the world’s great rivers, including the Ganges, the Indus and the Brahmaputra, on which hundreds of millions of people depend. Nearly 200 nations adopted the Paris agreement in 2015, which sets the goal of limiting warming to a level “well below” 2C, while “pursuing efforts” to achieve a lower ceiling of 1.5C. Earth’s surface has already warmed by about 1C, according to scientists. For high warming scenarios, experts predict land-gobbling sea-level rise, worsening storms, more frequent droughts and floods, species loss and disease spread. The Asian high mountains, the new study said, were already warming more rapidly than the global average. A global temperature rise of 1.5C would mean an average increase in the region of about 2.1C, with differences between mountain ranges – all of which will warm by more than 1.5C. The Hindu Kush mountain range would warm by about 2.3C and the eastern Himalayas by 1.9C, the study forecast. “Even if temperatures stabilise at their current level, [glacier] mass loss will continue for decades to come,” the researchers added. For the high mountain glaciers to survive, “it is essential to minimise the global temperature increase”. Swaths of south Asia and China depend on meltwater from Himalayan glaciers for drinking water, electricity generation and irrigation.  At the same time, the regions are also vulnerable to more intense flooding from accelerated glacier melt, combined with heavier rains and superstorms boosted by global warming. A study in July in the journal Nature Climate Change said there was only a 5% chance of holding global warming under 2C. For 1.5C, the odds were about 1%. On current trends, some experts project Earth is on track to warm by about 3C."
"Claims in the Mail on Sunday that global warming data had been exaggerated in order to secure the Paris climate change agreement have been criticised by the UK’s press regulator. The Independent Press Standards Organisation censured the newspaper for publishing a story in early February that was flawed in key aspects. The news story suggested that data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of the world’s gold-standard sources of weather and climate research, had been treated in such a way as to suggest greater warming than had really occurred.  The research hinged on the “pause” in global warming that had been seized on by dismissers of climate change as evidence that the concerns of mainstream scientists had been overblown. The so-called pause or hiatus has long been a contentious issue in climate science. The outlier year of 1998 was exceptionally hot, owing to a strong El Niño, and these record temperatures were not surpassed for several years.  This allowed sceptics to claim that global warming had stopped until 2013. However, as mainstream scientists pointed out, the years following 1998 still exhibited an upward temperature trajectory compared with the long-term average, so while the upward march of temperatures was slightly slower, and some years were cooler than others, talk of a “pause” that suggested an end to global warming was misleading. NOAA published research shortly before the Paris climate change negotiations suggesting the pause was less than had been claimed. Subsequent research backed up NOAA’s findings. The Mail on Sunday article alleged that the NOAA had taken data that was “unverified” and used it to suggest the pause had not happened. Ipso ruled that the Mail on Sunday had “failed to take care over the accuracy of the article and had then failed to correct these significantly misleading statements”. Further, a graph published with the article that purported to show large differences between NOAA’s published data and data on warming from other sources was found to be wrong, owing to the newspaper’s “failure to plot the lines correctly”. Some of these examples were deemed to constitute breaches of the editorial code to which newspapers sign up. David Rose, the author of the original story, frequently writes on global warming, often reporting on sceptics’ views on climate science. He is a respected journalist and won the British Press Awards’ prestigious reporter of the year title for 2015. He writes frequently on issues such as police corruption and miscarriages of justice. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, pursued the Ipso claim against the newspaper. He said: “Fake news stories about climate change are a significant threat to the public interest in the UK, US and other countries. The expert community must continue to fight back against the deluge of propaganda from climate change deniers.” He said several other media outlets had repeated the false claims, and they had even been cited in a letter to NOAA from a leading committee chairman in the US Congress. He called the Ipso ruling “a significant victory”. A spokesman for the Mail on Sunday said: “The subject of the rate of climate change is fiercely debated, with reputable scientists taking positions on both sides. The Mail on Sunday has published articles that challenge some widely held opinions. The complainant in this case is a professional spokesman for two academic institutions involved in the debate. He has complained to the press regulator on three previous occasions about our articles on climate change, but those complaints were rejected.” The spokesman added: “This newspaper is fully committed to the principle of independent press regulation and is a member of Ipso. We are disappointed with this finding, but we accept it and are publishing the adjudication with prominence in the newspaper and online.” Not all of the complaints made by Ward against Rose’s article were upheld, and some of those upheld reflected narrow technical points, for instance over the archiving of data."

"China, the world’s biggest vehicle market, is considering a ban on the production and sale of fossil fuel cars in a major boost to the production of electric vehicles as Beijing seeks to ease pollution.  The move would follow similar plans announced by France and Britain to outlaw the sale of petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040 in order to clamp down on harmful emissions. Xin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology, told a forum in the northern city of Tianjin at the weekend that his ministry had started “relevant research” and was working on a timetable for China. Xin said the policy would be implemented “in the near future”, according to the official Xinhua news agency. “These measures will promote profound changes in the environment and give momentum to China’s auto industry development,” he said in remarks broadcast by CCTV state television. “Enterprises should strive to improve the level of energy saving for traditional cars, and vigorously develop new energy vehicles according to assessment requirements,” he said. China produced and sold more than 28m vehicles last year, according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. The sale of new energy vehicles topped 500,000 in the world’s second-largest economy in 2016, over 50% more than the previous year, according to national industry figures. The government introduced in June a draft regulation to compel vehicle manufacturers to produce more electrically powered vehicles by 2020 through a complex quota system. As the measure looms, foreign vehicle manufacturers have announced plans to boost the production of electric cars in China. Volvo will introduce its first 100% electric car in China in 2019, while Ford will market its first hybrid vehicle early next year and envisions 70% of all its cars available in China will have electric options by 2025."
"Misleading attacks on Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology by climate deniers in the Australian are “debilitating” to the agency and limiting its ability to predict risks and protect the community, the former head of the bureau has told the Guardian. Rob Vertessy, who retired as director of the BoM in April 2016, said climate deniers’ attempts to confuse the public about the science of climate change were dangerous, in an interview for the Guardian’s Planet Oz blog.  “I was exposed to a lot of it and it took up a lot of my time that’s for sure,” Vertessy said. “I feel for my successor and the team at the bureau having to constantly devote energy to this. It’s really quite debilitating.” Vertessy was succeeded by Andrew Johnson, who has since had to deal with a barrage of criticism led by the rightwing thinktank the Institute for Public Affairs and expressed mostly in the pages of the Australian newspaper. Earlier this week, the former Abbott government adviser Maurice Newman accused the bureau of “fabricating temperature records” and said it represented a “smoking gun that threatens the integrity of global temperature records”. Vertessy said these sorts of attacks were dangerous. “From my perspective, people like this running interference on the national weather agency are unproductive and it’s actually dangerous,” he said. “Every minute a BoM executive spends on this nonsense is a minute lost to managing risk and protecting the community and it is a real problem. “As the costs of climate change accumulate in the years ahead, I can see that leaders of this climate change denial movement will really be seen as culpable.” He said the government had done a “pretty good job” of supporting the bureau and independent experts. But he said politicians’ jobs had been made difficult by the Australian. “It will just continue and it will limit the ability of the government to focus on more important matters – not just climate ones but all the works of government. It’s distracting for politicians to have to deal with this chatter.”"

"The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has pulled back from a comment he made to the Coalition party room on Tuesday that AGL was “shorting” the market by refusing to sell the ageing Liddell coal-fired power plant to a competitor. Joyce would not repeat the accusation during an interview on Sky News late on Tuesday – but he insisted the company had not provided a reasonable answer to the question of why it would decommission the New South Wales plant if a rival generation company wanted to buy it. “Why pull a plant to pieces if there are people out there who want to buy it,” the deputy prime minister said – adding that he knew two interested parties who were serious buyers. The negative public commentary about AGL’s market behaviour was echoed by the chairman of the Coalition’s backbench committee on energy, Craig Kelly, who said he intended to call the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, to ask for an investigation. “There’s an arguable case that AGL are acting in an anti-competitive manner, and I will be calling on the ACCC to investigate,” Kelly told Guardian Australia. The ACCC has expressed public concern about market concentration in power generation and retailing, and is currently inquiring into energy affordability, with an initial report expected late this month. Energy industry players argue power prices are a function of tight gas supply and coal capacity leaving the system, not market manipulation and anti-competitive behaviour. The focus by government MPs on AGL’s market behaviour are part of the Turnbull government’s continuing efforts to strongarm the energy retailer into either selling Liddell, or extending its operating life for another five years – pressure the company is attempting to resist. The company has agreed to give the Turnbull government a plan within 90 days detailing how it will supply the electricity market with reliable power when Liddell is retired in 2022. The public commitment came after a meeting between the AGL chief executive, Andy Vesey, the prime minister, and senior government ministers, in Canberra on Monday, where the company was asked to take a proposal to the board to either sell the plant, or keep it open for another five years. AGL has agreed reluctantly to take that proposal to the board, as well as its own plant to replace Liddell’s current generation capacity with peaking gas and renewables. Energy policy continued to dominate political debate in Canberra on Tuesday, with roiling contention inside the parliament and continued internal ructions inside the Coalition. The former prime minister Tony Abbott, who is an opponent of the clean energy target recommended by Australia’s chief scientist Alan Finkel, told the Coalition party room the government needed to keep its focus on keeping energy affordable. Abbott told colleagues if the government was to add Finkel’s proposed clean energy target to the existing renewable energy target, which peaks in 2020, but tapers out to 2030, that would be a “difficult position to sustain”. The proposed clean energy target remains alive, but will not emerge from the current policy development process in the form Finkel modelled during his inquiry. The government is making it clear the new investment framework, which it wants to resolve before the summer parliamentary recess, will need to be geared to reliability and affordability as well as to emissions reduction. Government players are now talking in more generic terms about an investment mechanism or framework that will deal with a range of issues, while ensuring Australia is on track to meet the Paris climate target. With some Nationals MPs are flat-out opposed to the clean energy target, Joyce said on Tuesday the policy was something that needed to be “negotiated” both inside the government, and between the Liberals and the Nationals. He has previously signalled he would support a clean energy target with a threshold set high enough to allow coal generators to get certificates. The deputy prime minister said the government would need to “land on a target that keeps our base-load power in play”."
"We’ve known for decades that the Earth is warming, but a key question is, how fast? Another key question is whether the warming is primarily caused by human activities. If we can more precisely measure the rate of warming and the natural component, it would be useful for decision makers, legislators, and others to help us adapt and cope. Indeed, added ocean heat content underlies the potential for dangerous intense hurricanes. An answer to the “how fast?” question was partly answered in an Opinion piece just published on Eos.org, the daily online Earth and space science news site, by scientists from China, Europe and the United States. I was fortunate enough to be part of the research team. To measure how fast the globe is warming, we focused on the extra heat that is being trapped in the climate. The key to measuring the extra heat is by comparing the incoming and outgoing energy – just like you watch your bank account, keeping track of income and expenses to tell whether your bank balance will increase or not.  Okay so how do we measure these incoming and outgoing flows? In our view, the best way is in the oceans. We know that the oceans absorb almost all of the excess heat – so, perhaps we can detect energy increases in ocean waters? Measuring the oceans is challenging. They are vast and they are deep – measurements can be noisy. Detecting a long-term trend (a signal) within the noise can be a challenge. But this challenge is exactly what we focused on. We wanted to know how large the signal-to-noise ratio is for ocean heat measurements because this would tell us how many years of data are needed to detect warming. Can we detect global warming with one year of measurements? With a decade? Or do we need multiple decades of measurements to be sure the climate is changing? Our work shows that scientists need less than 4 years of ocean heat measurements to detect a warming signal. This is much shorter than the nearly three decades of measurements that would be required to detect global warming if we were to use temperatures of air near the Earth’s surface. It is also slightly better than the nearly 5 years of sea level rise data that are needed for detecting a long-term trend. This means that the warming is not natural, but rather stems from the human-induced climate change, primarily from increases in heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. This finding should help change the way we talk about global warming. Normally scientists and the public wait for the official annual “global temperatures” to be released (every January or February) by major research groups like Nasa, Noaa, and the Hadley Centre in the UK. Avid consumers of global warming news often use these air temperatures to “prove” or “disprove” global warming. If it was hot last year, “its global warming!” If last year was cool, “global warming is over!”  But the year-to-year fluctuations of air temperatures are predominantly associated with El Niño and weather variability and mislead those who use any one year as climate-change proof. We saw the impact of fluctuations over the past two decades where a slowing of the rise of global surface temperatures led to false claims that global warming had “stopped” or that there was a “hiatus.” No such cessation occurred for ocean heat content. Hence global ocean heat content data isn’t so noisy. It represents the total thermal energy in the ocean waters, and is now known with a high degree of certainty (see the figure below), in part because scientists have improved ocean temperature sensing methods and increased the number of sensors throughout the ocean waters.  According to our analysis, the top 10 warmest years of ocean heat content are all in the most recent decade (following 2006) with last two years being the hottest. The heat storage in the ocean corresponds to 3×1023 Joules (a 3 with twenty-three zeroes after it) since 1960. Prior to the 1980s, values are not as well known, and the global record is unreliable prior to about 1960. In the most recent 25 years, the Earth has gained approximately 0.7 Watts for every square meter of surface area. That may not sound like much but think about how many square meters are required to cover the surface of the Earth. To put these numbers in perspective, the heat increase in the oceans since 1992 is about 2000 times the total net generation of electricity in the USA in the past decade. We believe, and argue, that ocean heat content is the key to quantifying how fast the climate is changing, and it has important implications for regional patterns of climate. According to Trenberth: A key reason for the exceptionally active Atlantic hurricane season this year is because of the regional build-up of ocean heat along with its global warming component that fuels hurricanes. “Ocean Heat Content” should become a standard metric not only for measuring climate change but for testing our computer models that are used to predict the future climate."
"Which living person has done most to destroy the natural world and the future wellbeing of humanity? Donald Trump will soon be the correct answer, when the full force of his havoc has been felt. But for now I would place another name in the frame: Angela Merkel. What? Have I lost my mind? Angela Merkel, the “climate chancellor”? The person who, as German environment minister, brokered the first UN climate agreement, through sheer force of will? The chancellor who persuaded the G7 leaders to promise to phase out fossil fuels by the end of this century? The architect of Germany’s Energiewende – its famous energy transition? Yes, the very same. Unlike Trump, she has no malicious intent. She did not set out to destroy the agreements she helped to create. But the Earth’s systems do not respond to mission statements or speeches or targets. They respond to hard fact. What counts, and should be judged, as she seeks a fourth term as German chancellor in the elections on Sunday, is what is done, not what is said. On this metric, her performance has been a planetary disaster. Merkel has a fatal weakness: a weakness for the lobbying power of German industry. Whenever a crucial issue needs to be resolved, she weighs her ethics against political advantage, and chooses the advantage. This, in large part, is why Europe now chokes in a fug of diesel fumes. The EU decision to replace petrol engines with diesel, though driven by German car manufacturers, predates her premiership. It was a classic European fudge, a means of averting systemic change while creating an impression of action, based on the claim (which now turns out to be false) that diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide than petrol. But once she became chancellor, Merkel used every conceivable tactic, fair and foul, to preserve this deadly cop-out. The worst instance was in 2013, when, after five years of negotiations, other European governments had finally agreed a new fuel economy standard for cars: they would produce an average of no more than 95g of CO2 per km by 2020. Merkel moved in to close the whole thing down. She is alleged to have threatened the then president of the European council, Irish taoiseach Enda Kenny, with the cancellation of Ireland’s bailout funds. She told the Netherlands and Hungary the German car plants in their countries would be closed. She struck a filthy deal with David Cameron, offering to frustrate European banking regulations if he helped her to block the fuel regulations. Through these brutal strategies, she managed to derail the agreement. The €700,000 donation her party then received from the major shareholders in BMW does not suggest they were unhappy with what she had achieved. In 2014, the European commission wrote to the German government, warning that the air pollution caused by diesel engines was far higher than its manufacturers were claiming. The government ignored the warning. Even now, two years after the dieselgate scandal broke, Merkel has continued to defend diesel engines, announcing that “we will use all our power to prevent” German cities from banning them, and stifling the transition to electric cars. The “mistake” made by the diesel manufacturers, she insists, “doesn’t give us the right to deprive the entire industry of its future”. Instead, her policy deprives thousands of people of their lives. But this could be the least of the environmental disasters she has engineered. For this lethal concession to German car companies was predated by an even worse one, in 2007. In that case, her blunt refusal – supported by the usual diplomatic bullying – to accept proposed improvements in engine standards forced the European commission to find another means of reducing greenhouse gases. It chose, disastrously, to replace fossil fuel with biofuels, a switch Merkel has vociferously defended. Merkel and the European commission ignored repeated warnings that the likely consequences would include malnutrition and massive environmental destruction, as land was converted from forests or food crops to fuel production. The European biofuel rule is now a major driver of one of the world’s greatest environmental disasters: the razing of the Indonesian rainforests and their replacement with oil palm. While greenhouse gas emissions in other European nations have fallen sharply, in Germany they have plateaued Not only has this wiped out vast and magnificent ecosystems, and the orangutans, tigers, rhinos, gibbons and thousands of other species they supported; but it has also, by burning trees and oxidising peat, caused emissions far higher than those produced by fossil fuels. What makes this history especially bitter is that the target she derailed in 2007 was the one that had first been proposed, in 1994, by a German environment minister called – let me think – ah yes, Angela Merkel. Is this the worst? It is hard to rank such crimes against the biosphere, but perhaps the most embarrassing is Germany’s shocking failure, despite investing hundreds of billions of euros, to decarbonise its electricity system. While greenhouse gas emissions in other European nations have fallen sharply, in Germany they have plateaued. The reason is, once more, Merkel’s surrender to industrial lobbyists. Her office has repeatedly blocked the environment ministry’s efforts to set a deadline for an end to coal power. Coal, especially lignite, which vies with Canadian tar sands for the title of the world’s dirtiest fuel, still supplies 40% of Germany’s electricity. Because Merkel refuses to restrict its use, the peculiar impact of Germany’s Energiewende programme has been to cut the price of electricity, stimulating a switch from natural gas to lignite, which is cheaper. (In Germany they call this the Energiewende paradox). But Merkel doesn’t seem to care. She has announced that “coal will remain a pillar of German energy supply for a prolonged time span”. Shouldn’t the European emissions trading system have sorted this out, pricing coal power out of the market? Yes, it should. But it was sabotaged in 2006 by a German politician, who insisted that so many permits be issued to industry that the price fell through the floor. I think you can probably guess who. All these are real impacts, while the paper agreements she helped to broker have foundered and dissipated as a result of special favours and dirty deals of the kind I have listed in this article. Yet still she attracts an aura of sanctity. This is quite an achievement, for the world’s leading environmental vandal. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"Theresa May has issued a veiled warning to Donald Trump, arguing that his plan to withdraw from the Paris climate change treaty ranks alongside North Korea’s nuclear missile tests as a threat to global prosperity and security. In a speech to the United Nations general assembly, the prime minister, whose authority at home has been severely tested since June’s general election result, sought to project her vision of a “rules-based” international order. She said global cooperation was the only way to confront shared international challenges, including terrorism, climate change, and mass movements of refugees – and condemned countries that fail to play by the rules. The prime minister did not name the US president directly but made clear that she believed ongoing membership of the Paris climate change accord was as important as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in maintaining global security.  “As the global system struggles to adapt, we are confronted by states deliberately flouting – for their own gain – the rules and standards that have secured our collective prosperity and security,” she said. She singled out Russia, Syria and North Korea for direct condemnation, but described the climate change treaty as part of the “rules-based system” that protects global peace and security. “It is the fundamental values that we share, values of fairness, justice and human rights, that have created the common cause between nations to act together in our shared interest and form the multilateral system. “And it is this rules-based system which we have developed – including the institutions, the international frameworks of free and fair trade, agreements such as the Paris climate change accord, and laws and conventions like the non-proliferation treaty – which enables the global co-operation through which we can protect those values.” She warned that undermining these international institutions, including the UN, ultimately threatened states’ national interests. “If this system we have created is found no longer to be capable of meeting the challenges of our time, then there will be a crisis of faith in multilateralism and global cooperation that will damage the interests of all our peoples.” The prime minister was the first world leader to visit Trump in the White House, brushing off concerns in some European capitals about his unpredictability.  But she has repeatedly expressed concern about his decision to seek to renegotiate the Paris treaty, and a planned state visit to the UK has been indefinitely postponed, amid fears of public protests. She delivered the speech just an hour before she was due to meet Trump for a bilateral meeting in a New York hotel. In his own speech to the UN general assembly on Tuesday, the US president described the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, as “rocket man”, and threatened to “totally destroy” Kim’s country if it did not rein in its nuclear ambitions. May issued her own strongly worded condemnation of North Korea’s actions, but stopped short of threatening military action.  “Time after time he has shown contempt for the international community of law-abiding states,” she said of Kim Jong-un. “Contempt for his neighbours. And contempt for the institutions and rules that have preserved peace and security.  “On this challenge the UN has in recent weeks shown it can step up to the task, with last Monday’s security council resolution creating the biggest sanctions package of the 21st century. We have seen regional and global powers coming together and – as in its founding charter – putting aside limited self-interest to show leadership on behalf of the wider world.” She also criticised Russia for using its veto on the UN security council to block tougher action against Syria for using chemical weapons on civilians. “One country in particular has used its veto as many times in the last five years as in the whole of the second half of the cold war. And in so doing they have prevented action against a despicable regime that has murdered its own people with chemical weapons,” she said. May was applauded when she recounted the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester earlier this year, and said: “The terrorists did not win, for we will never let anyone destroy our way of life.” The prime minister’s trip to New York has been overshadowed by speculation about Boris Johnson’s future, after the foreign secretary wrote a 4,000-word article for the Daily Telegraph that appeared to set out a distinctive vision for Brexit. But on Wednesday night her spokesman said Johnson had changed plans and would fly back to London alongside May on the prime minister’s RAF ­Voyager jet to attend a specially convened meeting of the ­cabinet, where she hopes her colleagues will back her on Brexit. Her UN address, delivered as she prepares for a major speech on Brexit in Florence on Friday, was aimed at presenting Britain as a free-trading, outward-looking country that would continue to play its role in the world. May also urged the UN to reform, and repeated a pledge by her international development secretary, Priti Patel, that Britain would withhold up to 30% of its £90m a year core funding to the UN, unless it could meet performance targets showing that it was delivering value for money. “Throughout its history the UN has suffered from a seemingly unbridgeable gap between the nobility of its purposes and the effectiveness of its delivery,” May said. “When the need for multilateral action has never been greater, the shortcomings of the UN and its institutions risk undermining the confidence of states as members and donors.  “Even more importantly, they risk the confidence and faith of those who rely upon the blue helmets; who rely upon that sign I stand in front of today coming to their aid in the darkest of hours.” After delivering her speech, May went straight to the bilateral meeting with Trump, at the Lotte New York Palace hotel. Seated in front of US and UK flags, Trump said: “We will be doing a lot of trading with the UK and we look forward to it.” May said: “We’ve had many discussions between our representatives and ourselves on a whole variety of issues – including trade, which is important for us, and some other policy issues – and our security and defence relationship, which of course is the closest we have.” The prime minister used the meeting as an opportunity to lobby Trump over the importance of preserving jobs at aerospace giant Bombardier in Northern Ireland, and to press the president over the importance of the international nuclear deal with Iran, which he has threatened to tear up.

"President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser said at the United Nations on Monday the US has not changed its plans to withdraw from the Paris climate pact without a renegotiation favorable to Washington, a step for which there is little appetite in the international community. Trump in June announced his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, saying it would put US industries at a disadvantage, cost jobs, weaken American national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. “We made the president’s position unambiguous, to where the president stands, where the administration stands on Paris,” Gary Cohn said after the informal breakfast meeting with ministers from about a dozen countries on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.  In a statement issued after the meeting, a White House official said: “We are withdrawing from the Paris agreement unless we can re-engage on terms more favorable to the United States. This position was made very clear during the breakfast.” US officials attended a Montreal meeting on Saturday of ministers from more than 30 of the nations that signed the climate change agreement. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump administration officials had said Washington would not pull out of the agreement and had offered to re-engage.  “There was some confusion over the weekend and I think we removed all the confusion,” Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters, adding that he was referring to the meeting in Montreal. The secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said on Sunday that the US could remain in the Paris climate accord under the right conditions.  Cohn, who is overseeing the issue for Trump, on Monday declined to elaborate on suitable terms that the US would consider to remain in the climate change pact.  “The mood was good,” Cohn said of the meeting. “Very constructive. Everyone wants to work together. Everyone wants to understand everyone’s position. I think everyone has a understanding where we all want to get to.”"
"Reading Australian James Bradley’s “cli-fi” novel as large areas of Asia and Texas are flooded ramps up the disturbing effect of its incrementally apocalyptic scenarios. Bird die-offs, mass fish deaths, wildfires and storms are just the beginning as Bradley zooms into the future via a sequence of linked narratives. The “clade” of the title is the set of all the descendants of Adam Leith, a climatologist; each chapter focuses on the next generation of Adam’s family (and naturally his name has symbolic resonance), enabling Bradley’s predictions for Earth to fast-forward at Koyaanisqatsi-like speed while the human actors replay their inherited traits of awkwardness, poor communication skills and attachment issues. The structure, at once intimate and epic, works well as a means of delivering human-scale stories against the backdrop of the most human story of all: our heedless despoiling of the home planet. Almost inevitably, there is something of the blockbuster movie about this: the beleaguered family battling to stay together as the world ends. But Bradley’s deft merging of near-future predictions and cutting-edge science into a convincing setting for his family drama enables us to focus on the interactions between the characters. The apocalypse is happening, even as our messed-up lives distract us. • Clade is published by Titan. To order a copy for £6.79 (RRP £7.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

"Recent days have seen Houston, Texas literally sunk under sheer weight of rain, Carribbean islands battered by powerful storms barrelling across the Gulf and now Florida homes blasted by Irma, the largest of three hurricanes churning in the Atlantic basin. It seems almost certain that man-made climate change has a role in such events. Scientists used to be circumspect at attributing any single extreme event to global warming. No longer. Now scientists make the link between climate change and droughts in Kenya, record winter sun in Britain and torrential downpours in south-west China.  The unmistakeable fingerprint of extreme weather at the crime scene of global warming seems intuitively obvious: consider that Houston is reckoned to have been hit by three “500-year floods” in three years. A 500-year flood does not have to happen only twice a millennium. But a run of three indicates that past climate is no longer a reliable guide to the present weather. The explanation is that the climate itself is changing.  Such thinking should be a wake up call for the world, which has to understand how profoundly we must make a shift in the way we produce, distribute and consume energy, and how disruptive this will be for the real economy. While governments have, via the Paris agreement, signalled the end of the fossil-fuel era, the political processes by which states will decide how to meet their mitigation targets have been hijacked and influenced by Big Carbon. Fossil-fuel companies, hydrocarbon billionaires and their allies, particularly in the west, have for years now been funding a massive and sophisticated campaign to mislead voters about the environmental harm caused by carbon pollution. They have good reason to: a landmark study released earlier this year revealed 50 corporations account for more than one-fifth of all carbon released into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began. The groundbreaking research not only helps establish legal accountability for climate change, it also weakens any corporate defence of wilful blindness. A major polluter cannot say it was going ahead with its activities because it was unaware its products caused great harm. Corporations have made handsome profits as the globe ended up a degree warmer than it should be. These polluters privatised the fossil-fuel profits and socialised the cost to the world’s poor, global taxpayers and future generations. Big Carbon entities and individuals who claim their lobbying activities are just an expression of their democratic rights sound a lot like Big Tobacco when it was denying the health dangers of smoking. Three major legal actions will test such thinking. First in the Philippines, where it is being determined whether polluters violated the human rights of Filipinos for their role in creating the conditions for Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest ever tropical storm to make landfall, which left more than 7,000 dead. Second in Germany, where a German utility company is being sued for costs associated with glacial lake flooding in Peru. Last in the US, where two California counties are suing 37 oil, gas and coal companies, claiming they knew their products would cause sea-level rise and coastal flooding, but failed to reduce their greenhouse gases. Fossil-fuel companies should be held accountable for the effects of climate change. Legal warfare has a two-fold aim: to overhaul transgressors’ business models so that they are in line with the global commitment to phase out fossil fuels and limit temperature rises to 1.5°C; and to get them to pay for damages resulting from global warming. Climate litigation is the inevitable result of a failure of two decades of talks. But it is also an important way of reframing the climate crisis as a human rights emergency."
"  Although individual action to protect the environment – consuming less, recycling more, reducing one’s carbon footprint – might be a contribution if enough people did it, the battle to minimise human-induced climate change has to be a worldwide endeavour among cooperating states. The outcome of the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference was one of the most optimistic and encouraging steps hitherto achieved in that battle – that is, until Donald Trump said he intended to withdraw the US, the biggest climate polluter in history, from the agreement. The Paris agreement and President Trump’s decision illustrate the two ends of the spectrum of effort and concern. Our planet cannot be protected from a warming atmosphere – with melting ice caps, rising sea levels, droughts, floods, famines and migrations of desperate populations – without vigorous joint effort by the world’s states.  It is thought that climate catastrophes caused turmoil in the past – perhaps at the beginning of the fourth millennium BCE, and in the early 12th century BCE, when entire civilisations in the Mediterranean and Near East collapsed in rapid succession into centuries of dark ages. Only this time – today, in our present world, with a global population of over seven billion that is growing ever faster – any such catastrophe will be many orders of magnitude greater. That is the situation that makes concerted international effort imperative. At the other end of the spectrum, President Trump’s announcement illustrates the fragility of international cooperation. It takes just one large rogue elephant in the herd to negate the endeavour. Any one of the US, China, India and the EU could undermine the sacrifice and determination demanded by the Paris agreement. It is a desperately sad move by any one large polluting economy if it refuses to cooperate. Such a decision condemns – actually condemns, not merely threatens to condemn – hundreds of millions of people to suffering, and almost certainly the whole planet to new dark ages.  Democracy is, as has been well said, the least bad of a lot of bad systems. But it pays a high price for the noble ideal of locating political authority in the consent of the people. Tyrants can make and act on quick decisions. Democracies debate and disagree, and move slowly. Tyrannies are efficient to the point of mercilessness. Democracies are inefficient to the point of ineffectiveness at times. The very nature of the political process in democracies means that leaders are reluctant to burden the populace with restrictions and sacrifices, lest they are voted out of office. But saving the planet requires restrictions and sacrifices. Leaders are reluctant to burden business with extra costs on emissions and other good environmental practices, lest they damage the economy, and again in consequence lose office. Tyrants have no such anxieties: they worry only about the assassin or eventual rebellion.  Democracy, accordingly, is not a natural ally of the tough measures required to combat climate change. And yet populations of democracies will be the first to punish their political leaders when the disastrous effects of climate change start hitting home.  What is required for democracies to become fully engaged in the fight to save the planet is that their citizens should be informed and thoughtful, and willing participants in the required sacrifices. Given the realities, say cynics, is not this a vain hope? Efforts to inform are manifold, but they are undermined by deniers and sceptics, among them Mr Trump. Efforts to encourage thoughtfulness and sacrifice among the people meet with the age-old reluctance on the part of too many people to attempt either.  Short-termism, self-interest, lack of real understanding, a head-in-the-sand attitude and several kinds of laziness and self-indulgence make us humans our own worst enemies: and in a democracy we all feel entitled to be all these things as a right.  There is nothing new in this. Plato, two and a half millennia ago, criticised democracy precisely because of this. But this is now a major life-threatening dilemma for our time.  The international order is effectively an anarchy if any of its members – sovereign states – refuse to play ball with the rest, or refuse to adhere to agreements previously made. What is the sanction against, say, the US if indeed it does withdraw from the Paris agreement? The international order is itself a loose form of democracy, and suffers the same deficits.  This fact illustrates where the nub of the problem lies: a lack of a sense of binding obligation to act for the benefit of others. Short-termism and self-interest are endemic weaknesses both of democracies and those who live in them. And these are precisely the things that have already wrought so much damage to the world’s climate, and threaten the people of the world with ever-increasing danger.  Human survival is of course not the only, though it is the most obvious, point at issue in the climate emergency we are facing. Peace, stability, human rights, the welfare of children – these will all collapse before the survival issue becomes the only one left. Now, not one of us should or would, I hope, seek to overturn democracy. But every one of us should, I hope, bend our thoughts vigorously to the problem of how to make the saving of our planet consistent with democracy. For surely, democracy and survival do not have to be in conflict. There have to be ways in which democracies can be full, compassionate, sensible partners with each other – indeed with everyone, no matter what the political system – in rescuing the planet from the peril that our historical self-indulgence and exploitation have already placed it in.  To ensure that the aims of the Paris agreement are met, there therefore has to be another effort alongside the drive for far greater sustainability in industrial-commercial activity. This is an overwhelming, unceasing drive to educate and re-educate every single individual on the planet about climate change.  The real and imminent dangers to lives and societies have to be driven home. People have themselves to become the goads driving politicians and governments to act. If the world’s people can be mobilised, then the short-termism and self-interest of the political classes in democracies will be addressed. Measures will be taken that people can understand are genuinely in their own real interests, as well as the interests of their fellows in the human story around the world.  Many are cynical about the potential of education to achieve anything like what is required here. Time and again, dreamers and idealists have launched themselves into education to better the world. But in the face of how things are in both national and international politics, other than climate-induced civilisational collapse itself, education is the only thing that has a hope of changing minds. It is all we have. But with massive effort we can make a difference, and perhaps enough of one to save our lives. We have to teach ourselves into freedom from this danger: nothing less can or will do.  • AC Grayling is master of the New College of the Humanities, London, and its professor of philosophy.

"New nuclear power stations may not be the best option for keeping Britain’s lights on and meeting the country’s carbon targets, the Liberal Democrats have said. The party said there were legitimate concerns over nuclear’s cost and the risks it would not be delivered on time, just days after windfarms secured state support far more cheaply than the Hinkley Point C atomic power station.  However, the party, which voted in support of nuclear four years ago after decades of opposition, said the technology should still be considered an option in the UK’s future energy mix.  “Nuclear power should be kept open as an option – but there is a risk that it may not be able to keep the lights on and that it may not be the lowest-cost option,” said the Lib Dems in a new report, authored by the former coalition minister Lynne Featherstone. Vince Cable, the party’s leader, said this week that the breakthrough low subsidy prices for offshore windfarms should prompt a “radical reappraisal” of how Britain is powered.  If the Lib Dems were to go so far as opposing atomic power again, it would mark a break in the pro-nuclear cross-party consensus of the three main parties.  Senior Lib Dems believe the party has an opportunity to seize the momentum on environmental issues, with Labour constrained on issues such as nuclear power because of its close association with trade unions.  Ed Davey, the Lib Dem MP and former energy minister who was pivotal in the party’s support for nuclear, said of the report: “It’s not about taking nuclear off the table. It’s responding to the evidence of the last two years. “It’s a recalibration off the back of the fact nuclear is not proving to be a practical, affordable technology. It’s not saying never [to nuclear], but the costs are coming down fast with renewables.” The report also backed an acceleration of renewable energy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and greater flexibility of the energy system through storage and interconnectors with other countries. The party accused the Conservatives of “unravelling” progress on climate change made by the Lib Dems during the coalition government years.  “What worries me about the Tories is they have taken CCS off table, they’re not pushing forward with renewables,” said Davey. The report concludes that the UK is on course to miss its contribution towards the Paris climate agreement aspirational target of keeping global temperature rises below 1.5C.  To get back on track, the Lib Dems are calling for the Climate Change Act’s target of an 80% cut in carbon emissions by 2050 to be brought forward by five to 10 years.  Last year the government’s climate advisers warned that the UK lacked policies to meet half of the carbon reductions required by 2030. Ministers have produced a blueprint on how to close the gap, the Clean Growth Plan, which could be published as soon as next week. Before the party’s annual conference in Bournemouth this weekend, Cable said the world would “soon reach a tipping point beyond which catastrophic global warming will become irreversible” and Britain had a responsibility to set an example.  “Instead, these past two years the Conservatives have done their best to trash our green industries and undo the progress made during the coalition years,” he said.  “This report shows that becoming carbon-free by 2050 will be crucial if we are to meet the Paris agreement’s ambitious target of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. Furthermore, it sets out how this ambition can be delivered.” The party will also hope to burnish its environmental credentials in the coming months with the debate over Heathrow expansion, which it opposes. The majority of Labour MPs are in favour of expansion, as is the Unite trade union, although the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are against further expansion."
"The impacts of hurricanes Harvey and Irma were blunted because we saw them coming. Weather models accurately predicted the hurricane paths and anticipated their extreme intensities days in advance. This allowed millions of Floridians to evacuate the state, sparing countless lives. Some contrarians have tried to downplay the rising costs of landfalling hurricanes by claiming they’re only more expensive because there are now more people living along the coasts with more expensive stuff vulnerable to hurricane damages. However, those arguments fail to account for our ability to predict hurricane tracks earlier and more accurately by using better and better scientific models. We’re able to prepare for hurricanes much better today than in the past because we have more warning.  Although they focus on much different timescales and resolutions, climate and weather models are based on the same core physics. Scientists have a solid understanding of the Earth’s oceans and atmosphere, and that understanding is improving all the time.  Millions of people watched the evolution of the model forecasts for hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and made important decisions based on those forecasts. People trusted the models, and their trust proved to be well placed, as the model predictions were accurate.  And climate models have an even better track record. As I documented in my book Climatology versus Pseudoscience, since their inception in the 1970s, climate models have been remarkably accurate at predicting global warming. In a 1975 paper in Science, renowned climate scientist Wallace Broecker was one of the first to use early simple climate models to predict future global warming. Based on scientists’ understanding of the climate at the time, Broecker was only able to include the effects of human carbon emissions and ‘natural cycles’ (whose effects he overestimated) in his model, but the prediction was nevertheless remarkably accurate: Renowned Nasa climate scientist James Hansen made even better global warming predictions in 1981 and 1988, and the IPCC improved further yet in 1990, 1995, 2001, and 2007. On the other hand, the few climate contrarians that have had the courage to make their own predictions (without using climate models) have fared remarkably poorly.  Meanwhile recent research has shown that climate models have been even more accurate than we thought, when we compare apples-to-apples. And of course what those climate models tell us is extremely alarming. If we stay on our current path, we’re headed for 3–4°C global warming by 2100, which research indicates would lead to severe consequences like 40–70% of global species being at risk of extinction, millions more people being hit by coastal flooding, increased mortality from intensified heat waves, droughts, and floods, and so on. This raises an obvious question – if people trust weather models, and climate models with their even stronger track record predict we’re on such a dangerous path, why aren’t people loudly demanding climate action? In 1998, leading up to the critically important Kyoto Protocol international climate negotiations, Patrick Michaels from the fossil fuel-funded Cato Institute ‘think tank’ testified before Congress. Not surprisingly, considering his heavy reliance on fossil fuel funding, Michaels made the case that the US should not sign on to the Kyoto agreement (and succeeded - although the Clinton administration signed the treaty along with 150 countries, the US Senate refused to ratify it). In his testimony, Michaels essentially committed perjury in a reprehensibly dishonest effort to discredit Hansen’s 1988 global warming predictions. Hansen’s study had projected temperature changes under three different possible scenarios, which he called A, B, and C. In his testimony, Michaels deleted all but Scenario A with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, which was also the scenario that was least representative of real-world conditions. Worst of all, Michaels didn’t mention that he had deleted Hansen’s other scenarios, simply claiming (falsely): [Hansen’s] model predicted that global temperature between 1988 and 1997 would rise by 0.45°C (Figure 1). Figure 2 compares this to the observed temperature changes from three independent sources. Ground-based temperatures from the IPCC show a rise of 0.11°C, or more than four times less than Hansen predicted. You can see Michaels’ figure here – it even labeled Scenario A, but at no point did Michaels mention Hansen’s other scenarios. His claim that Hansen’s model predicted 0.45°C warming between 1988 and 1997 was flatly false – that was the model estimate under a scenario of much higher greenhouse gas emissions. Hansen subsequently asked, “Is this treading close to scientific fraud?” (yes, and to perjury). That was the start of a now nearly 20-year effort by climate deniers to discredit climate models. According to Skeptical Science, the claim that climate models are unreliable is the 6th most popular climate denial myth. It’s one that contrarian scientists repeat at every opportunity in congressional testimony to this day.  The reason is quite simple – if climate models are right, then if we don’t start cutting our consumption of fossil fuels, we’re in big trouble. But the GOP has now effectively become the Grand Oil Party – a subsidiary of the fossil fuel industry that does its bidding. They don’t want to curb our reliance on fossil fuels, so they attack the models, or like Rush Limbaugh, claim it’s all a hoax and then flee to California, leaving the duped followers behind to face the ugly consequences of science denial. There are some exceptions. The bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, which now includes 28 House Republicans, acknowledged the impacts climate change is having on disasters like Harvey and Irma. We need more conservatives to accept reality and join their ranks. Scientific models saved countless lives from Harvey and Irma because we listened and acted. They can also save countless lives from climate change if we listen and take action to slow global warming. Or we can listen to the conspiracy theorists, ignore the scientists and their models, and suffer the consequences while the Rush Limbaughs of the world flee in their private jets to higher ground."
"As a strong supporter of same-sex marriage I am not happy about the postal survey. But as a career researcher, I am even more dismayed. It’s not a plebiscite, obviously. It’s not a vote as we understand it in the Australian context (not compulsory, not conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission and no satisfying sausage afterwards). And no self-respecting researcher would call it a survey. I’ve started referring to it as “a thingy”. But let me be clear – it is a vitally important “thingy”. In fact it is probably more important to take part in this “thingy” because the usual rules around voting and surveys don’t apply. The results will not be weighted to reflect Australian Bureau of Statistics data, as any decent survey would be. And the usual carrot and stick involved in voting is absent. If enough Australians deliver their postal survey in time, we can transform this into something real and meaningful. If almost all of the community gets involved – not just the dedicated supporters for and against – then this “thingy” becomes something else. More than deciding the issue of marriage equality, it will also be an interesting test of our civic engagement. How prepared are we to have our say if a fine or a cake stall is not involved?   And so I was pretty excited to see in the Guardian Essential Poll that 62% of those polled definitely intend to vote and a further 12% will probably vote and 9% have already voted. That’s 83% likely to vote or already voted (the last federal election saw 95% of eligible voters turn up at the ballot box).  Of those likely to vote, the predictable trends are still evident. The older you are the more likely you are to report you will vote. The more likely you are to support marriage equality the more likely you are to report you will vote. Older people are less likely to support marriage equality and more likely to post letters. And yet the AEC saw a surge in young people putting their names on the electoral roll once it was clear the postal survey was going ahead.  It’s a guessing game at this stage whether one demographic tendency will cancel out the other. I’ve been asked my view about what will happen, but to be honest I have no idea because so many elements are unprecedented and unpredictable. If enough postal surveys flow in roughly reflecting the makeup of the population, then the result will be predictable. The yes option will prevail. That would be, in research terms at least, unprecedented. While our political leaders have constructed the most convoluted process to decide such a straightforward issue, there is the continuing challenge of climate change and energy transition crackling in the background, where simplistic ideas are constantly put forward to solve complex problems. (More coal stations! Create a green army of unemployed youth to plant more trees!) You don’t have to be an expert prognosticator to know that energy prices and energy transition are on the political agenda permanently throughout the government and the nation. As the Essential Report shows, concerns about the costs of electricity and gas trump housing, medical and food costs (across age groups, too, and even among those who are financially comfortable). Concern about addressing climate change is up 7% since December last year, with 56% saying we are not doing enough.  As so many other polls have shown consistently, the majority of Australians believe climate change is happening and is caused by human activity. Could a concern about the rising costs of utilities be somehow connected to a concern about lack of action on climate change? The qualitative research I’ve conducted over the last decade says yes. Without a long-term approach to energy that is more reliant on investment in renewables and less on old technologies of oil and gas, we will need more power to do the same things we do today and costs will increase.  You don’t need an expensive postal survey to know the public expects a more sophisticated, less partisan approach to energy policy. Forget about bakers forced to fire up the ovens to make cakes for same-sex weddings in the new year. Australians worry about keeping the lights on in the years to come. • Rebecca Huntley is the director of research at Essential Media"
"Joss Hanbury, master of the Quorn hunt, says foxhounds have “been bred for generations to hunt live prey”, giving this as a reason why hunts keep killing foxes, implying that it’s just one of those unfortunate things that can’t be helped (News). If someone’s bull terriers savaged a bull, it would be no good the owner pleading that the breed had been bred for bull-baiting and therefore there wasn’t much he could do to stop them. He would be prosecuted and the dogs might well be destroyed. But hunts take out packs of 30-plus dogs that they state are uncontrollable and take them to coverts almost certain to contain foxes. So foxes get chased and killed and the hunts pretend they thought the hounds were on a non-existent “trail”.  I have been a hunt monitor for 23 years and have watched hundreds of hunts. I am convinced that trail hunting does not exist, but is a front for every hunt to continue hunting live quarry, a “cynical subterfuge” in the words of one unusually percipient judge. However, considering its fatuousness, this excuse is remarkably successful at repeatedly getting hunts out of trouble. The National Trust should bear in mind that a landowner allowing illegal hunting to take place can be prosecuted. If it succeeds in crushing the motion to ban all trail hunting on NT land, it will have placed itself in an invidious position.Penny LittleGreat HaseleyOxfordshire The extreme weather that has caused devastation in Florida, Houston, the Caribbean and south-east Asia is symptomatic of climate breakdown, which is happening as a result of global warming caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels (“Survivors of Irma beg for aid”, News). We have about 15 years to stabilise the atmosphere before climate breakdown becomes unstoppable. It will result in the failure of staple crops in tropical zones, floods, droughts, wars over land and resources such as clean water and chaotic, forced mass migration to temperate parts of the world. The maturing of the renewable energy industry and developments in smart grids and battery storage mean we have a chance to avert climate breakdown. The most effective action we can take is to switch to a 100% renewable energy supplier. Nuclear power is too expensive, too slow to build and too dangerous. Cumbria’s police and crime commissioner recently described Sellafield as a big strategic target for terrorists. This applies to all nuclear power plants. The only sensible future is based on clean, safe, affordable and abundant renewable energy.Anne DismorrNorwich I read with interest of the looming “winter of discontent” (News). Living in a seaside resort with problems of deprivation, it beggared belief that universal credit was trialled here. I think the disingenuous premise was that if it could work here, it would work anywhere. But this led to severe problems for many. The chancellor cannot rule and divide between public sector workers. The removal of this unfair pay cap needs to apply to all. If this is achieved, we may begin to believe in the government’s tarnished mantra of wanting a society that works for all.Judith A DanielsGreat Yarmouth As an addendum to Catherine Bennett’s article (“PR execs behaving badly…, Comment), it is worth noting that during the Bell Pottinger scandal, the Public Relations and Communications Association did little or nothing to rein in the agency’s shocking activities in South Africa, until its shamefully silent hand was forced. It is legitimate to ask who else within the PRCA membership is enjoying the comfort of a blind eye while they pursue similar immoral activities.Mike AbbottLondon W4 Your review of Andy and Peter Holden’s Natural Selection exhibition (“Birds do it…”, New Review) talks of the “former Newington Library” but the library still exists, housed in a metal container above a collection of takeaways rather than in the distinguished building purpose-built for it 125 years ago. Four years ago, a fire started in the neighbouring Cuming Museum and it and the library have been closed since. Southwark council said it would cost £40m to make safe and yet a private art academy did so for £30,000. In consultation, residents asked for a library – instead, they got this. Admirable as I’m sure the exhibition is, it is under the shadow of the wider gentrification of the Elephant. Did the council deliberately come up with an unworkable figure? It has a good record on libraries. Clarity would be welcome.

"The health implications of coal-fired power should be a main concern in Australia’s debate over energy generation, doctors have argued.  Speaking on the ABC’s Q&A program, the chair of Doctors for the Environment New South Wales, Dr John Van Der Kallen, asked panellists why health was not a primary consideration in the discussion over the closure of coal-fired power stations such as the Liddell plant in the Hunter Valley “when we know that the pollution from these coal-fired power stations contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular illness, as well as premature death?”  Doctors for the Environment also oppose the proposed Adani coalmine in Queensland, which if built, will be the largest in Australia, and one of the largest in the world.  “It will significantly increase Australia’s contribution to international carbon emissions and threaten the health of millions of people in Australia and around the world.” Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said health concerns over coal-fired power were driving movement to renewables in other parts of the world. “You only have to look at China which is grappling with some really substantial and quite dangerous health impacts on the community in terms of not having heavily regulated the coal-fired power industry and not managing the health implications of coal-fired generation.” Herd said governments and business needed to take into account the physical and environmental effects of different types of energy generation. “Interestingly enough, it is this very driver of managing environmental pollution which is actually now the basis of so much of China’s actions in terms of being a world leader in investing in renewable energy, taking it to more than 50% of global investment in renewable energy in the last few years.” Why is health not a consideration in closure of coal fired power stations? @MichaelSukkarMP & @emmalherd respond #QandA pic.twitter.com/594EK9ladY The assistant minister to the treasurer, Michael Sukkar, said Australia’s energy’s policy needed to be a balance between reliability, affordability and environmental concerns. “The government has a focus, we want to ensure reliability, we want to assure affordability, and, of course, we want to meet our emissions reduction targets – 26 to 28% under the Paris accord. We are focused on those three objectives.” Sukkar said each objective needed to be carefully weighed against the others. “Of course, the environmental objective … is one very important one. But we do have to manage this transition and … at the end of the day, when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining … everyone around the country still expects to be able to switch their lights on and know that it’s going to be there. “That’s what we need. Now, coal for the foreseeable future, will play a role in that. Of course, it’s playing a diminishing role over time, but in our lifetime, it will stay a big role.” When will the Federal Government formulate a comprehensive energy policy? @MichaelSukkarMP & @SenatorWong #QandA pic.twitter.com/2n5lDUUvDf"
"Three decades ago when serious debate on human-induced climate change began globally, a great deal of statesmanship was on display. A preparedness to recognise that this was an issue which transcended nation states, ideologies and political parties. An issue which had to be addressed proactively in the long-term interests of humanity, even if the existential nature of climate risk was far less clear cut than it is today. Then, as global institutions were put in place to take up this challenge and the extent of change this would impose on the fossil-fuel dominated world became more obvious, the forces of resistance mobilised. Today, despite the diplomatic triumph of the Paris climate agreement, debate around climate change policy has never been more dysfunctional, indeed Orwellian, particularly in Australia.  In his book Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell describes a double-speak totalitarian state where most of the population accepts “the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane.” Orwell could have been writing about climate change and policymaking.  International agreements talk of limiting global warming to 1.5–2°C, but in reality they set the world on a path of 3–5°C. Goals are reaffirmed, only to be abandoned. Coal, by definition, is “clean”. Just 1°C of warming is already dangerous, but this cannot be said. The planetary future is hostage to myopic, national self-interest. Action is delayed on the assumption that as yet unproven technologies will save the day, decades hence. The risks are existential, but it is “alarmist” to say so. A one-in-two chance of missing a goal is normalised as reasonable. Climate policymaking for years now has been cognitively dissonant, “a flagrant violation of reality”. So the lack of understanding among the public and elites of the full measure of the climate challenge is unsurprising. Yet most Australians sense where we are heading: three-quarters of people see climate change as a catastrophic risk and half see our way of life ending within the next 100 years.  The previous norms of statesmanship and long-term thinking have long since disappeared, replaced by an obsession with short-term political and commercial advantage, particularly where climate and energy policy is concerned. An emergency-scale transition to a post-fossil fuel world is essential to address climate change. But this is considered to be too disruptive. The orthodoxy is that there is time for an orderly economic transition within the current short-termist political paradigm. Discussion of what would be safe – less warming that we presently experience – is non-existent. And so we have a policy failure of epic proportions. In the magical thinking of Australian policymakers, a pathway of gradual change, constructed over many decades in a growing, prosperous, coal-fired world stretches enticingly before us. The world not imagined is the one that now exists: of looming financial instability; of a global crisis of political legitimacy; of a sustainability crisis that extends far beyond climate change to include all the fundamentals of human existence, and of severe global energy sector dislocation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the UN in 1988 and charged with regularly assessing the global consensus on climate science as a basis for policy-making. The IPCC assessment reports produced every five to six years play a critical part in the public framing of the climate narrative. The IPCC has done indispensable work in pulling together a periodic consensus of what must be the most exhaustive scientific investigation in history.  However, the process suffers from all the dangers of consensus-building in such a wide-ranging and complex arena. For example, its reports, of necessity, do not always contain the latest available information. Consensus-building can lead to “least drama” lowest-common-denominator outcomes which overlook critical issues, particularly the implications of the “fat-tails” of probability distributions, namely high impact but relatively low-probability events where scientific knowledge is limited. Vested interest pressure is acute; climate denialists accuse the IPCC of alarmism, whereas climate action proponents consider the IPCC to be far too conservative. To cap it all, the IPCC conclusions are subject to intense political oversight before being released, which has had the effect of substantially watering down sound scientific findings.  These limitations were not of overriding importance in earlier years. However, it is now clear that the risks are far greater than previously anticipated. Climate change has moved from the twilight period of much talk but limited impact; it is now turning nasty, as witnessed with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, in South Asia, and not to forget Cyclone Debbie in Australia earlier this year. The distinction between climate science and risk is now the critical issue, for the two are not the same. Scientific reticence, the reluctance to spell out the full risk implications of climate science in the absence of perfect information, has become a major problem, allowing politicians to ignore the real dangers we face. But waiting for perfect information means it will be too late to act, as any sensible risk manager or military leader knows only too well. Like an iceberg, there is great danger in ignoring “What lies beneath”. The irresponsible invective passing for political debate on climate and energy policy is replete with assurances that politicians are devoted to ensuring the security of the Australian people. Nothing could be further from the truth. Those assurances are meaningless unless climate risk is honestly addressed and that must happen long before we are confronted with our own equivalent of Irma. At present that risk is totally ignored."

"The Arctic ice cap melted to hundreds of thousands of square miles below average this summer, according to data released late on Tuesday. Climate change is pushing temperatures up most rapidly in the polar regions and left the extent of Arctic sea ice at 1.79m sq miles at the end of the summer melt season.   This is the time when it reaches its lowest area for the year, before starting to grow again as winter approaches. The 2017 minimum was 610,000 sqmiles below the 1981-2010 average and the eighth lowest year in the 38-year satellite record. Scientists from the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) said the rate of ice loss this summer had been slowed by cool mid-summer weather over the central Arctic Ocean. The record minimum came in 2012, when the ice area fell to 483,000 square miles below the 2017 extent. Ted Scambos at NSIDC said the Arctic sea ice had set a record for the smallest winter extent earlier in 2017 and was on track to be close to the 2012 record minimum until July. But a cloudy and cooler than normal August slowed the melting. “Weather patterns in August saved the day,” Scambos said. The fast shrinking Arctic ice cap is increasingly thought to have major impacts on extreme weather patterns much further south, due to its influence on the jet stream. Floods, heatwaves and severe winters in Europe, Asia and North America have all been linked to the Arctic meltdown. “It’s bound to have an impact on global climate,” Scambos said. The 2017 sea ice level fits with an overall steady decline over the decades, but one that varies from year to year, Scambos said. “It’s not going to be a staircase heading down to zero every year,” he said. “[But] the Arctic will continue to evolve towards less ice. There’s no dodging that.” Rod Downie, head of polar programmes at WWF, said: “From space, the loss of Arctic sea ice is the clearest and most visible sign of climate change, and human beings are responsible for most of it. We are engineering our planet and its climate.”  “That’s not good for the people of the Arctic who depend upon sea ice for their traditional way of life and for people across the world who depend on a stable climate,” he said. The Arctic could be virtually free of ice in summer within people’s lifetimes, he warned, and called for more action on climate change by reducing carbon emissions."
"Tony Abbott has been an implacable force against rational climate action in this country for the best part of a decade, and nothing has changed. Having destroyed one set of energy policies designed to achieve orderly economic transformation and emissions reduction, and created a monumental policy botch-up as a consequence, he’s determined to destroy another.  After warming his vocal cords for months, Abbott now says it would be “unconscionable” for Malcolm Turnbull to “go further down the renewables path”. By this he means implement a clean energy target. Let’s be very clear about this. What is actually unconscionable, and I don’t invoke the word lightly, is Abbott’s own behaviour. Let’s also be very clear about what is happening right now. Abbott wants to lead an insurgency with the aim of sinking Malcolm Turnbull’s climate and energy policy, which is now, and has always been, a proxy for his leadership. Like an armchair general summoning a militia, using his favoured media proxies as loud hailers, the former prime minister has seeded a story that he might cross the floor. If he does cross the floor (as opposed to threatening to, in order to pressure Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg into producing the most coal-friendly energy policy imaginable over the next few weeks), with a posse of sharpshooters (Craig Kelly, potentially; George Christensen, who is already on the record as a no vote; a handful of others) it doesn’t mean the policy is dead. The government could still wrangle an energy policy through the parliament with Labor’s support, if it manages to produce a policy framework which Labor can live with (a big if, on current indications, but not impossible). But there’s still a poison pill. If Turnbull does the rational thing and tries to end the climate wars – an outcome which business, the energy sector, climate groups, state governments and many Australian voters are now desperately looking for – then Abbott will characterise this as a fundamental betrayal of conservative values. Turnbull will be signing up with Labor and the Greens, and conspiring in the de-industrialisation of Australia. Being constructive is considered a mortal sin in Australia’s hyperpartisan, knock-down clown politics. Being constructive makes some of the current crop of parliamentarians – now hardwired for a permanent war which is diminishing them and diminishing the country – nervous. So in Abbott’s brutal calculation, it’s heads I win, tails I win. Damage is the ultimate objective. Now before we get to conviction, or the lack thereof, let’s look again at what Abbott has done when he’s had power and opportunity, as opposed to the expression of feelings during his second career delivering careless whispers in Ray Hadley’s locker room, or during staff reunion night on Sky News After Dark. I’ve already pointed out in some detail that Abbott is actually the primary architect of the problem Turnbull is now trying to fix in energy policy. Abbott scrapped the investment mechanism which was legislated to drive orderly transformation in the energy sector and the economy, and left in place the pull-forward mechanism for renewable energy investment, albeit with a lower target. If investment in energy infrastructure is now lopsided, as Abbott contends, we can start by interrogating his own clustercuss. Abbott also agreed Australia would sign up to the Paris international climate accord, which is one of the reasons Australia needs renewable technologies to generate low-emissions electricity. Cause, meet effect. In September 2015, Abbott certainly sounded like he meant to sign up, that this wasn’t some random accident: “Unlike some other countries which make these pledges and don’t deliver, Australia does deliver when we make a pledge.” These are just facts. They are inconvenient facts for Abbott now, which is why he fudges and disavows them, and blames others – but facts they remain. Having reviewed the Abbott record, and noted a gap between present statements and past actions, now let’s consider conviction. Abbott’s behaviour would still be muddle-headed, vengeful, negative and destructive, regardless of his motives – but the most disconcerting thing, from my perch, appears to be the lack of intrinsic values behind the pugilism and the flip-flops. Unburdening himself in Ray’s locker room on Tuesday, Abbott told the 2GB host the government needed to drop the clean energy target, obviously, to make coal great again, that being the preferred virtue-signalling du jour of the reactionary right, which is otherwise completely post-materialist – but also to create a partisan point of difference with Labor at the next election. Let that last point just settle on your mind for a moment. It might take a moment to absorb the vacancy of that statement, because if you absorb its true meaning, you grasp that the person making it is in pure expediency territory. If you are a political leader, you can drop the clean energy target because it is third or fourth worst policy (which is my own view). You certainly can drop it because you’ve got a better idea, and you’ve got a hope of getting your better idea through the parliament. You can certainly shape your policies to work with the politics of the day. But to say let’s drop it to win the next election means you need to be prepared to forget what the country needs, forget what the chief scientist recommends, forget the fact business is now becoming desperate for certainty, forget the fact voters think politics is little better than a stinking carcass – you need to be in a headspace where cheap intra-day political argument triumphs over everything. Forget the substance. More about the wedge. More about me. Onwards, to self-indulgence, to the great unreason, to policy oblivion. That, for me, is the working definition of unconscionable.  • Support our independent journalism by giving a one-off or monthly contribution"
"Commonwealth Bank shareholders Guy and Kim Abrahams have dropped their world-first court proceedings against the bank for failing to disclose climate change risks in annual reports. They said CBA’s 2017 annual report, which was published last month, included an acknowledgement for the first time from CBA directors that climate change posed a significant risk to the bank’s operations, with a promise to undertake climate change scenario analysis on its business in the upcoming year to assess the risk. They said those two changes were a big turnaround for the bank and meant their case did not need to proceed. “After years opposing resolutions to improve climate change reporting and refusing to rule out participating in Adani’s Carmichael coalmine, the Commonwealth Bank’s directors have finally acknowledged the seriousness of climate change in the 2017 annual report,” Guy Abrahams said in a statement on Thursday. “Cultural change within the bank has been remarkably slow – the threat of climate change has been evident for decades. “We are pleased the Commonwealth Bank has said it will not fund Adani’s Carmichael coalmine and is taking its first steps in a business-wide review of climate risks.” The Abrahams’ claim, brought by lawyers at Environmental Justice Australia, said CBA’s 2016 directors’ report did not adequately inform investors of climate change risks. They had been seeking an injunction to stop the bank making the same omissions in future annual reports. Their case would have been the first anywhere in the world to test in court how companies are required to disclose climate change-related risks in their annual reports and follows calls by shareholders, regulators and central banks around the world for greater clarity. But less than a week after the Abrahams’ claim was filed in the federal court, CBA published its 2017 annual report, telling shareholders that climate change posed a significant risk to the bank’s operations. It also published its first climate policy position statement, saying it would target an average emissions intensity decrease of its business lending portfolio consistent with its commitment to a net zero emissions economy by 2050. It also said it would not lend money to Adani’s proposed Carmichael coalmine, leaving the controversial project without financing from any of Australia’s big four banks. CBA says it considers climate change is “a significant long-term driver of both financial (credit, market, insurance) and non-financial (operational, compliance, reputation) risks” and it has pledged to develop a long-term strategy to manage its response to climate change. “In line with the recommendations by the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (Apra), we are undertaking a scenario analysis to inform and guide the longer-term strategy,” CBA has said. David Barnden, a lawyer for the shareholders, said CBA’s climate change policy had still been criticised for failing to phase out investments in industries like thermal coal that exacerbate climate change.  “The Commonwealth Bank has been a long-time laggard on telling its shareholders about climate risks, so this is an important change,” he said on Thursday. “Under the Corporations Act, directors of Australian companies must give shareholders information about financial risks. CBA now acknowledges climate change is a material financial risk to the bank.” In February, Apra warned that climate change posed a material risk to Australia’s entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Geoff Summerhayes from Apra said companies must start incorporating sophisticated “scenario-based analysis” of climate risks into their business outlooks. He said Apra intended to start running stress tests of the financial system to see if it would survive various adverse climate shocks. Barnden said lawyers acting for Guy and Kim Abrahams had been working pro bono. The Commonwealth Bank has welcomed the fact that proceedings have been dropped, saying allegations the bank was not compliant with its statutory reporting obligations were incorrect. “Claims that such action has changed how CBA reports on climate change are untrue, with our 2016 and 2017 annual reports being compliant with statutory reporting obligations,” a spokesman said. “The section in the 2017 annual report regarding climate change as a business risk was the result of careful and extensive consideration over many months by the board and senior executives and was already well advanced when the claim was served.”"
"For the sake of keeping things manageable, let’s confine the discussion to a single continent and a single week: North America over the last seven days. In Houston they got down to the hard and unromantic work of recovery from what economists announced was probably the most expensive storm in US history, and which weather analysts confirmed was certainly the greatest rainfall event ever measured in the country – across much of its spread it was a once-in-25,000-years storm, meaning 12 times past the birth of Christ; in isolated spots it was a once-in-500,000-years storm, which means back when we lived in trees. Meanwhile, San Francisco not only beat its all-time high temperature record, it crushed it by 3F, which should be pretty much statistically impossible in a place with 150 years (that’s 55,000 days) of record-keeping. That same hot weather broke records up and down the west coast, except in those places where a pall of smoke from immense forest fires kept the sun shaded – after a forest fire somehow managed to jump the mighty Columbia river from Oregon into Washington, residents of the Pacific Northwest reported that the ash was falling so thickly from the skies that it reminded them of the day Mount St Helens erupted in 1980. That same heat, just a little farther inland, was causing a “flash drought” across the country’s wheat belt of North Dakota and Montana – the evaporation from record temperatures had shrivelled grain on the stalk to the point where some farmers weren’t bothering to harvest at all. In the Atlantic, of course, Irma was barrelling across the islands of the Caribbean (“It’s like someone with a lawnmower from the sky has gone over the island,” said one astounded resident of St Maarten). The storm, the first category five to hit Cuba in a hundred years, is currently battering the west coast of Florida after setting a record for the lowest barometric pressure ever measured in the Keys, and could easily break the 10-day-old record for economic catastrophe set by Harvey; it’s definitely changed the psychology of life in Florida for decades to come. Oh, and while Irma spun, Hurricane Jose followed in its wake as a major hurricane, while in the Gulf of Mexico, Katia spun up into a frightening storm of her own, before crashing into the Mexican mainland almost directly across the peninsula from the spot where the strongest earthquake in 100 years had taken dozens of lives. Leaving aside the earthquake, every one of these events jibes with what scientists and environmentalists have spent 30 fruitless years telling us to expect from global warming. (There’s actually fairly convincing evidence that climate change is triggering more seismic activity, but there’s no need to egg the pudding.) That one long screed of news from one continent in one week (which could be written about many other continents and many other weeks – just check out the recent flooding in south Asia for instance) is a precise, pixelated portrait of a heating world. Because we have burned so much oil and gas and coal, we have put huge clouds of CO2 and methane in the air; because the structure of those molecules traps heat the planet has warmed; because the planet has warmed we can get heavier rainfalls, stronger winds, drier forests and fields. It’s not mysterious, not in any way. It’s not a run of bad luck. It’s not Donald Trump (though he’s obviously not helping). It’s not hellfire sent to punish us. It’s physics. Maybe it was too much to expect that scientists’ warnings would really move people. (I mean, I wrote The End of Nature, the first book about all this 28 years ago this week, when I was 28 – and when my theory was still: “People will read my book, and then they will change.”) Maybe it’s like all the health warnings that you should eat fewer chips and drink less soda, which, to judge by belt-size, not many of us pay much mind. Until, maybe, you go to the doctor and he says: “Whoa, you’re in trouble.” Not “keep eating junk and some day you’ll be in trouble”, but: “You’re in trouble right now, today. As in, it looks to me like you’ve already had a small stroke or two.” Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are the equivalent of one of those transient ischaemic attacks – yeah, your face is drooping oddly on the left, but you can continue. Maybe. If you start taking your pills, eating right, exercising, getting your act together. That’s the stage we’re at now – not the warning on the side of the pack, but the hacking cough that brings up blood. But what happens if you keep smoking? You get worse, till past a certain point you’re not continuing. We’ve increased the temperature of the Earth a little more than 1C so far, which has been enough extra heat to account for the horrors we’re currently witnessing. And with the momentum built into the system, we’re going to go somewhere near 2C, no matter what we do. That will be considerably worse than where we are now, but maybe it will be expensively endurable. The problem is, our current business-as-usual trajectory takes us to a world that’s about 3.5C warmer. That is to say, even if we kept the promises we made at Paris (which Trump has already, of course, repudiated) we’re going to build a planet so hot that we can’t have civilisations. We have to seize the moment we’re in right now – the moment when we’re scared and vulnerable – and use it to dramatically reorient ourselves. The last three years have each broken the record for the hottest year ever measured – they’re a red flashing sign that says: “Snap out of it.” Not bend the trajectory somewhat, as the Paris accords envisioned, but simultaneously jam on the fossil fuel brakes and stand on the solar accelerator (and also find some metaphors that don’t rely on internal combustion). This is a race against time. Global warming is a crisis that comes with a limit – solve it soon or don’t solve it We could do it. It’s not technologically impossible – study after study has shown we can get to 100% renewables at a manageable cost, more manageable all the time, since the price of solar panels and windmills keeps plummeting. Elon Musk is showing you can churn out electric cars with ever-lower sticker shock. In remote corners of Africa and Asia, peasants have begun leapfrogging past fossil fuel and going straight to the sun. The Danes just sold their last oil company and used the cash to build more windmills. There are just enough examples to make despair seem like the cowardly dodge it is. But everyone everywhere would have to move with similar speed, because this is in fact a race against time. Global warming is the first crisis that comes with a limit – solve it soon or don’t solve it. Winning slowly is just a different way of losing. Winning fast enough to matter would mean, above all, standing up to the fossil fuel industry, so far the most powerful force on Earth. It would mean postponing other human enterprises and diverting other spending. That is, it would mean going on a war-like footing: not shooting at enemies, but focusing in the way that peoples and nations usually only focus when someone’s shooting at them. And something is. What do you think it means when your forests are on fire, your streets are underwater, and your buildings are collapsing? • Bill McKibben is a writer and the founder of the climate campaign 350.org"
"The Cassini mission, which will end on Friday, is one of the most wonderful achievements of the human race. A slack-jawed awe is the only proper reaction to the spacecraft’s travels and to its intricate route over seven years to Saturn, aided by the slingshot effects of its grazing the orbits of the inner planets, first Venus and then Earth, as it passed them in vast loops, representing astonishing feats of calculation. Nor was it enough just to reach the outer planets and their region of immense distances from the Sun, from us and from each other. The flypasts of Jupiter and its moons, reached after three years, and then the orbit of Saturn attained four years later, are wonders of remote control and communication. The pictures that Cassini has sent back of the surface of the moons it has explored – and it actually landed the smaller probe, Huygens, on one of them – enlarge our vision of the universe as nothing else could.  Now that the probe has spent 12 years in orbit around Saturn and among its moons, the end is close. It is being deliberately steered into the atmosphere to avoid its remains contaminating two of the moons where the presence of liquid water suggests that life in some form might evolve or even have evolved already. We can be proud, as members of a technological civilisation, that we reached the point where we were faced with the chance of infecting entirely hypothetical alien bacteria with our debris, and proud, too, that we chose not to do so. This act of self-conscious renunciation is not the dream which first fired the exploration of space. That was fuelled by an aggressive and apparently inexhaustible confidence. Travel to the stars was our manifest destiny and it would put to altruistic use the competitive instincts of the human race. The confidence may have reached its peak at a dark moment in 1944; war was raging across Europe, and Hitler unleashed his long-threatened secret weapon against England. The members of the nascent British Interplanetary Society (BIS), meeting in a London pub, cheered when they heard the explosion of a V2 rocket because they understood that this meant rockets worked, whatever the price in civilian lives. Even the sombre grandeur of Olaf Stapledon’s Last and First Men, which ends with the extinction of the last post-human race, is infused with an irresistible outward urge. It is nearly 50 years since the Apollo programme first put men on the moon; nearly 45 since the last man walked on soil not of Earth. The rocket technology which the optimists of the BIS cheered on is now in the news only when North Korea tests a missile that threatens millions of civilians. As for the world government which seemed such a natural and inevitable progression from space flight in all but the most dystopian science fiction, that seems much further than ever. Instead, we have a possible and partial revival of manned space exploration. The Chinese government seems to want an expedition to the moon; the billionaire Elon Musk plans private space tourism, perhaps as far as Mars, although there is considerable scepticism about his prospects. Nasa itself has a hugely ambitious project under way to send a manned flight to Mars some time after 2030. But there is a note of sinister farce over all these efforts, supplied by the involvement of Donald Trump, who has a juvenile enthusiasm for space travel. In the spring, Mr Trump called the international space station to speak to Peggy Whitson, the US astronaut who had just become the American who had spent most consecutive time in space, and told her that he wanted a manned Mars mission within the time of his presidency. But at the same time, his government threatens to undermine the funding of Nasa’s priceless surveys of our own planet, which are providing hard data about the effects of climate change or, as the Republican party sees it, “politicised science”. The turn towards Earth and away from manned space missions was made explicit under Barack Obama in 2010, and it corresponds with the feeling among space scientists that for purely scientific purposes, there is nothing much that humans can accomplish which robots cannot do as well, more cheaply, and with less risk of tragedy. It would be wonderful to land a human being on Mars and then to bring them home again, but it is not nearly as urgent as preserving the habitat for the billions of us who are left on Earth. • This article was amended on 12 September 2017 because an earlier version said that it had been nearly 60 years since men first stepped on the moon and almost 50 since the last manned landing. This has been corrected."

"Congratulations Australia. Two years have passed without a leadership coup being launched against a sitting prime minister. In our unhinged system, that level of stability is a genuine achievement. So, hooray for #auspol. Except the voters are still ropeable, and politics doesn’t feel all that stable, does it?  Old debates churn round in enervating circles, deeply silly business persists, and one of Malcolm Turnbull’s rewards for surviving two years in the top job was a harrowing account of Tony Abbott’s wounding and scarring exit from the prime ministership “at the height of his political career” in the Daily Telegraph on Friday. Poor old Tony (the paper’s political editor, Sharri Markson, noted by way of exposition) didn’t like talking about his emotions, “like most men”. But given opportunity, Wronged Tony™ rose nimbly to the occasion. Of course losing the prime ministership was wounding. “Of course you carry scars,” Abbott noted, movingly. Not being prime minister still hurts, but you just have to put disappointments behind you “and make the most of every day and that’s what I’m doing”. It certainly is what he’s doing. Fortunately for him, sorrow seems a healthy working distance from Abbott’s daily default disposition. This week, the former prime minister took a day off from his parliamentary duties to help put out bushfires. That made a refreshing change from lighting them – metaphorically of course. Two years after his own party ran him out of Dodge, Abbott is not ubiquitous in the political landscape, but he’s determined to be assertively present, a little pulse of mischief. He’s present in the marriage equality debate, defending religious freedom, holding back the scourge of progressivism – although it is mildly curious that the public running on that issue at the moment has defaulted to John Howard, rather than the member for Warringah, almost as if there has been a subtle baton change. Abbott is also making noise in the government’s fraught energy debate, having warmed his jets on the tarmac on that issue for some months, telling that nice Ben Fordham on 2GB all about his plans for a “100% reliable energy target” – a policy that carries the mild inconvenience of being technically impossible to deliver, given no energy system is ever 100% reliable. But then targets are, presumably, strictly optional for a political leader who willingly signed Australia up to the Paris climate agreement, and now says we don’t have to do anything serious on emissions reductions, because international agreements are not a “straitjacket”. While Abbott is never one for fine policy detail, or constrained particularly by facts in the crafting of a deft political argument, he’s been very determined to front run the inevitable crab walk by the government in the direction of coal. The government is in the middle of its energy policy crab walk, and has picked a partisan fight with Labor, and the energy company AGL, to kick up sufficient dust for shellshocked Coalition MPs to get their tails up, and allow the cabinet to get on with settling the new investment framework. The energy plan is in transition, right before our eyes. The volume is being turned right down on the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and we are moving clearly in the direction of an overhaul of national electricity market rules. The market operator wants a day-ahead market, which allows better planning to ensure sufficient quantities of dispatchable energy are available in the system, and there is talk of a shift to a capacity market, which exists in Western Australia. While the rule changes look sensible, how any clean energy target fits with an energy market overhaul remains a bit moot, except it’s clear that if it survives, the level of ambition for emissions reduction will fall below the already low level aspired for in Finkel’s report.  If all this comes to pass, the question will be about how can Australia meet it Paris climate change target – the one Turnbull says is not aspirational, despite what you might hear on 2GB every Wednesday afternoon and every second Monday morning. The next question will be whether the government can get its energy policy fix through parliament – or whether it actually wants to fail on that front in order to dust off the old political fight with Labor over climate policy and energy. Could it think that failing to fix this mess up is the viable path, politically, to winning the next election? Out in the real world, tolerance for such antics is low, but the picking of the old partisan fight has been mildly positive for morale among government MPs, as has the postal ballot’s survival against the high court challenge. You’d think shouting your way, incoherently, to victory would be impossible, absurd, ridiculous – except that modern politics is really a curious business. Shouting furiously about things often substitutes, successfully, for doing them. One little reported example this week can tell you a story about what sort of collective hole #auspol is in, when it comes to posturing and blathering being more important than substance. In the media policy debate, the main verb of the political week, the Australian Conservatives senator Cory Bernardi drafted some amendments that would have allowed One Nation to vote for the deal it had negotiated with the government. Let me step through this carefully lest I get confusing. Several weeks ago, the One Nation bloc gave the Coalition its support for the government’s long-planned overhaul of the media landscape – the one that is going to make the Australian media sector even more concentrated in terms of ownership than it already is – in return for some nasty business against the ABC. The ink was no sooner dry on that agreement when it became clear it was an agreement in air quotes – a deal in name only. Being nasty to the ABC would require changes to completely separate pieces of legislation, not the broadcasting bill now before parliament, and no one else in the parliament was that interested in being nasty to the ABC, mass political suicide not really being in contemplation. Bernardi, who is of course in competition with One Nation for votes, thought he’d fix that problem for them by drafting detailed amendments grafting the ABC changes to the bill immediately before parliament. See Pauline, I’m delivering your deal, Bernardi said – cherubic. So did One Nation go ahead and vote for Bernardi’s amendments to deliver their own deal with the government? Well, no, it did not. The senators hovered outside the chamber during the division, abstaining from the vote to deliver their wish list. The numbers weren’t there in parliament to legislate the Bernardi amendment, but that doesn’t explain why One Nation refused to vote for, wait for it ... its own deal. Dare we suggest it is more important to have a Facebook live event moaning about the ABC than doing anything concrete to follow through on your moaning? It would seem Australian politics really can be that postmodern."
