"For anyone who takes notice of the climate change debate, a mass of often-contradictory information comes flooding into our lives. Some of it prompts great alarm. The Great Barrier Reef is suffering severe bleaching. Wild fires are consuming Alberta. Last year was the warmest on record, and 15 of the 16 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001. Yet there are also some positive signs that the world is at last getting serious about the threat. Global investment in renewable energy last year exceeded investment in fossil energy for the first time. Coal use in the United States is falling rapidly. China has stopped approving new coalmines. And the Paris Agreement of December 2015 was hailed as a breakthrough, a turning point in the battle. So what are we to think; or rather, what are we to feel? Let me try to give an assessment of the factors and forces that have been buffeting me. As I will be speaking of factors that make an impression on me I will not worry too much about linking to sources. Although frightening reports appear in the media every day, here I will point to the underlying trends. Each year since the late 1950s a scientific team working at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii measures the change in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. When the level broke through the 400 ppm mark last year, some 40% above the level before humans began burning fossil fuels on a large scale, it was higher than it had been for 23m years. If we look back over the geological record, this level of CO2 is off the scale. If the trend continues for several more decades (or even if it stops rising soon and starts slowly to decline) the conditions of life on Earth will be profoundly and irreversibly changed. And it won’t be pretty. We’re heading for a world warmed by 3-4C of warming or more, giving us an Earth hotter than it has been for several million years and way beyond human experience. If the nations of the world abide by their current commitments to reduce their emissions, or growth of their emissions, then we are heading for a world warmed by 3.5C, which will be calamitous by any definition of the word. Even worse, it is actually misleading to say the world is heading for 3.5C of warming, or 3C or 4C, because to do so gives the impression that we can set the global thermostat at a certain temperature, whereas beyond a certain amount of warming (maybe 2C, although scientists do not really know) feedback mechanisms will be set in train that will amplify human-induced warming and take the Earth to a warmer, perhaps much warmer, state. Even at 2C, and certainly above it, it is thought that the Earth would cross certain tipping points, beyond which the operation of the Earth System is changed in an irreversible way, at least over timescales of hundreds of thousands of years. The tipping points include the melting of Arctic summer sea ice (which is really gone already), melting of Tibetan glaciers and the Greenland ice-sheet (eventually bringing about six metres of sea-level rise), and destruction of the vast and vitally important Amazon rainforest through dieback and fires. All of this would be accompanied by a catalogue of catastrophes – extreme weather events, sea-level rise and so on – the harms of which would be magnified many-fold by geopolitical conflict and mass migrations. It is a fact rarely understood, especially by our political leaders, that we are speaking of irreversible change because CO2 persists in the atmosphere for many centuries, and because the entire Earth System is transformed by climate change. It’s wrist-slashing stuff. There are, however, signs that the global community has finally woken up and may reduce emissions fast enough to avoid the worst effects of the world we are headed towards. Let me briefly trace the evolution of global negotiations in order to set the scene for Paris. In 1997 great hopes were vested in the Kyoto Protocol. After hard negotiations, emission reduction targets for rich countries were agreed and would become legally binding for those nations that honoured their commitments by ratifying the treaty, once it entered into force. But soon these hopes were dashed, in large measure because the United States under President Bush rejected the treaty, followed soon after by Australia under John Howard. The Protocol entered into force in 2005 and did guide some nations in their climate policies, notably the European Union. But it was widely recognised that a treaty without the inclusion of the biggest polluters, the United States and increasingly China, could not make serious inroads. As emission rose faster than ever and as the scientific warnings became louder, expectations grew that an effective global agreement could be reached at the 2009 international gathering at Copenhagen, which was to create a second Kyoto commitment period. But it ended disastrously for a number of reasons, with much of the blame directed at Chinese recalcitrance. With shifting global power dynamics, it began to be argued that an effective treaty built on legally binding emission reduction obligations was no longer feasible and a new approach was needed. The new approach began to be called “pledge and review”. Nations would pledge to reduce their emissions or emissions growth by a certain amount and undertake to review those commitments on a regular basis within an international framework. Such a system would not give legal force to pledges but did open up the possibility that countries of the South as well as those of the North would buy in. Comprehensive coverage was becoming more important by the year because the share of global emissions from the South, led by China, had been rising rapidly. And that is what happened at the Paris conference of the parties in late 2015. It is true that expectations were lowered after Copenhagen, but it is also true that in the intervening six years global attitudes and political positions has shifted enormously, permitting the giant step forward taken in Paris. In the months leading up to the conference all nations had formally submitted their pledges, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDCs. Haggling in tense rooms over the fair contributions of each nation was off the Paris agenda, and so was the impossible issue of how to make commitments legally binding. Because nations of both North and South made pledges, one of the main arguments used by conservative opponents of action was eliminated. The Paris accord committed all parties to review their INDCs every five years, beginning in 2018, with the expectation that stronger commitments will be made. The review component of the Paris Agreement is legally binding. In the accord all nations recommitted to the goal of limiting the rise in the global average temperature to no more than 2C above the preindustrial level. But in a remarkable and unexpected development, the nations of the world also pledged to “pursue efforts” to limit warming to 1.5C. For years the Small Island Development States (SIDS) had been complaining bitterly that 2C of warming would see them disappear under rising seas, so to have their call for a 1.5C limit heard and adopted was a major breakthrough. Not even the big environmental NGOs believed it possible before the conference and they actively attempted to discourage a handful of activists convinced it could be pulled off. Although I cannot discuss the other elements of the accord here, it made stronger provision for forest protection but was disappointing in its commitments to climate finance and compensation for loss and damage. One worrying sleeper issue is the unjustified reliance of the IPCC’s 2C projections on “negative emissions technologies”, mainly bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Pursued on the scale implied in the projections it would require devoting huge land areas to growing trees to provide wood chips or wood pellets for thermal power stations. When the final gavel come down to adopt the Paris Agreement there were scenes of jubilation, and a great wave of relief swept across the vast community of climate change negotiators, activists, advisers and engaged citizens everywhere. The Guardian described it as “end of the fossil fuel era”, as did 350.org. President Obama said that the agreement was “the best chance we’ve had to save the one planet that we’ve got.” The Economist’s reaction captures the best news out of Paris: “Perhaps the most significant effect of the Paris agreement in the next few years will be the signal it sends to investors: the united governments of the world say that the age of fossil fuels has started drawing to a close. … [After Paris] the idea of investing in a coal mine will seem more risky.” The contrast with Copenhagen could not have been starker. Yet some of the world’s most influential scientific voices immediately attacked the agreement as woefully inadequate. Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre (whose work has had a decisive influence on my thinking) made the astonishing claim that the Paris Agreement was worse than the one struck at Copenhagen. He said the INDCs did not go nearly far enough, that the accord failed to adopt a “budget approach” (which would reveal the real task without fudging) and left out emissions from international aviation and shipping. James Hansen vented to the press: “It’s a fraud really, a fake. It’s just bullshit for them to say: ‘We’ll have a 2C warming target and then try to do a little better every five years.’ It’s just worthless words.” Why were there such contrasting reactions to the Paris Agreement among some of the best-informed and most committed people? The answer is that those who celebrated Paris as a breakthrough and those who condemned it were responding to different questions. The first were asking: What could we reasonably hope for? The critics were asking: Does the Paris Agreement firmly commit the parties to acting in a way that the science tells us is necessary to avoid dangerous climate change? Anyone who takes climate science seriously knows that the commitments under the Paris accord fall well short of those needed to give us a good chance of keeping warming below 2C, let alone 1.5C. It’s the role of scientists like Anderson and Hansen to keep reminding us of this fact in an uncompromising way (although Hansen’s dismissal of the accord as a worthless scrap of paper shows again that, while we must admire his science, his political pronouncements range from the naïve to the daft). On current pledges we are on track for a world warmed by around 3.5C. That amount of warming would be disastrous and means we should remain scared about the future in the way I wrote about in my book Requiem for a Species, which led some to see me as a “Dr Doom” figure. But if we ask ourselves what kind of diplomatic agreement would set the world on a trajectory leading to much stronger commitments, so that warming might be contained within the 2C guardrail or better, then what happened in Paris is as good as could be hoped for. If there is a turning point in global action then Paris is what it looks like. Both questions, the scientific one and the political one, are legitimate. Before the conference we knew the answer to the scientific question because parties had made their pledges before they arrived. We did not know the answer to the second question, the degree of commitment behind the pledges; at any point the whole thing could have blown up, as it did in Copenhagen, and wrecked all the good work leading up to the conference. That’s why when the final gavel came down the emotions came pouring out. The two questions can be brought together in two simple numbers: when will global greenhouse gas emissions reach their peak (2020, 2025, 2030?) and how quickly will they decline thereafter (2.5% pa, 4.5%, 7%)? Curves drawn by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit can be seen by going to this link. So now the big question is: What was it about the Paris conference that gives some hope that a turning point in global action has been reached? Five factors have influenced my thinking. Firstly, the agreement itself indicated a level of commitment that was as strong as could be expected; in fact the ambition to aim for 1.5C makes it substantially stronger than could have been expected. It sets a new benchmark that governments around the world can be held to. With deeper and earlier emission pledges at the five-yearly reviews limiting warming to 2C can be achieved. Second, the atmospherics around the Paris conference were unlike any previous one. Although serious arm-wrestling occurred in back rooms, the mood was calm, determined and collaborative, in contrast to the fractious, divided and accusatory mood of all previous conferences. Much of this can be attributed to the extraordinary diplomatic skills practiced by the French hosts both at the conference and in the year leading up to it. Another was the powerful signal sent by the joint US-China announcement in September. This cemented the impression that China had done a U-turn on climate change in the six years since it torpedoed the Copenhagen conference. In short, there was a new world order, and it showed in Paris, with only India, among large nations, playing the old game, and even there with less aggression. Third, the costs of renewable energy have been plunging making it cheaper than coal in some parts of the world. Unit costs will continue to decline and battery technology is the next big thing, extending the reach of renewables. Two-thirds of all new electricity capacity installed in the United States in 2015 was renewable. Peabody Energy, the world’s largest private coal company, has filed for bankruptcy (although coal’s problems are due mostly to fracking for natural gas, which by some measures is as bad as coal). China is now not only the world’s biggest producer of solar panels but the biggest consumer, by far. Nevertheless, China and India continue to build coal-fired power plants, with lifetimes of 50 years or so. On the other hand, these plans will come under increasing pressure. For example, the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, has said new coal-fired power plants in Asia would be a “disaster for the planet” and the bank is spending big on renewables. Fourth, it became very apparent at Le Bourget, the conference site on the edge of Paris, that the global climate debate is receiving a substantial boost from the Lima-Paris Action Agenda. I had barely heard of it, but the LPAA was an agreement reached at the previous conference of the parties in Lima 2014 aimed at mobilising “non-state actors” – cities, provincial governments, civil society organisations, businesses, pension funds and so on. With heavy diplomatic backing, it has been extraordinarily successful in its first year of operation, with some 6,000 cities and local authorities signing up and committing themselves to the 2C or less objective and adopting action plans to match. As much as national governments, provincial and local governments are now at the forefront of the push to cut emissions. National policies are often left to non-state actors to implement. The final influence on my thinking at Paris was completely unexpected, and was captured in this observation made at a side event: “Investors are running ahead of governments.” Perhaps the most striking and encouraging statement heard at the Paris climate conference, it was uttered at a forum on private financing by Martin Skancke, chair of Principles for Responsible Investment, the world’s largest network of institutional investors, at a side-event packed with some 400 delegates who shared something I had never before seen at a COP – a sea of suits. Big finance had turned up at a climate conference. To drive home the point Skancke referred to the Montreal Carbon Pledge, which in a little over a year has been signed by 120 investors who control over $10tn in assets (these guys speak in trillions). It is true that signatories only commit to measure and disclose the carbon footprint of their portfolios, but what gets measured sooner or later gets managed. Another panellist at the forum referred to “the quiet revolution” in green investment, including huge growth in green bonds, expected to be more than $40 billion this year. The aim is to expand it to $900bn soon. The CEO of ING France said her bank’s recent offering of green bonds was seven times over-subscribed within 48 hours. The sea-change in the global investment community had occurred only in the previous 12 months. The signs have all been there, not the least of which is the recognition by the G20 finance ministers that climate change represents a threat to the stability of the global financial system. In April 2015 G20 finance ministers and central bank governors asked the Financial Stability Board of the world’s central banks to prepare a report on climate risk. This is a big deal; it’s the system, not individual corporations, that’s now seen to be at risk. The FSB is chaired by the Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, who in September created waves in the global financial sector with a speech to insurers warning of serious risks to investors from climate change due to, among other factors, a sudden asset write down with “jump-to-distress prices”. Exposure of capital providers to an “abrupt transition” leaving vast amounts of stranded assets could cause a global financial meltdown. He wants a market structure that will bring about “an ordered transition” to a zero-carbon economy. When confronted with the basic facts of climate science, some people simply declare “I am an optimist”. But it is vacuous to be optimistic without defining the outcome you are optimistic about. To put my assessment crudely, if the question is whether we can be optimistic that Paris and all of the changes happening around it can save us from serious and long-lasting climate change, then my answer is “no”. If the question is whether we can be optimistic that global emissions might peak early enough and decline fast enough to avoid catastrophic change in which large parts of the Earth become permanently uninhabitable, then my answer after Paris is “yes”. Some worry that many nations will not honour their commitments at Paris so that even 3.5C is optimistic. I think this misses the sea-change that has occurred. The post-Paris signs are good, with many key players working hard to build on progress. Deniers are losing their influence, while the global campaign for climate action has shifted to a much higher level over the last three or four years and will only gain strength through new avenues like the divestment campaign. In sum, both the scientific question and the political question are valid, and any honest assessment leaves us torn between the negative answer to the first and the positive post-Paris answer to the second. It’s awkward, but I think we have to sit with this discomfort rather than plunge into the gloom of the scientific projections that obscure the light or bask in the optimistic glow of future possibilities without remembered how hard the numbers make it."
"The internet represents an extraordinary opportunity for democracy. Never before has it been possible for people from all over the world to access the latest information and collectively seek solutions to the challenges which face our planet, and not a moment too soon: the year 2015 was the hottest in human history, and the Great Barrier Reef is suffering the consequences of warming oceans right now.  Yet despite the scientific consensus that global warming is real and primarily due to human activity, studies show that only about half the population in some countries with among the highest CO2 emissions per capita understand that human beings are the driving force of our changing climate. Even fewer people are aware of the scientific consensus on this question. We live in an information age, but the information isn’t getting through. How can this be?  While the internet puts information at our fingertips, it has also allowed misinformation to sow doubt and confusion in the minds of many of those whose opinions and votes will determine the future of the planet. And up to now scientists have been on the back foot in countering the spread of this misinformation and pointing the public to trustworthy sources of information on climate change.  Climate Feedback intends to change that. It brings together a global network of scientists who use a new web-annotation platform to provide feedback on climate change reporting. Their comments, which bring context and insights from the latest research, and point out factual and logical errors where they exist, remain layered over the target article in the public domain. You can read them for yourself, right in your browser. The scientists also provide a score on a five-point scale to let you know whether the article is consistent with the science. For the first time, Climate Feedback allows you to check whether you can trust the latest breaking story on climate change. Last year the scientists looked at some influential content. Take the Pope’s encyclical, for instance. The scientists gave those parts of the encyclical relating to climate science a stamp of approval. Other “feedbacks,” as we call them, have made a lasting impact. When the scientists found that an article in The Telegraph misrepresented recent research by claiming that the world faced an impending ice age, the newspaper issued a public correction and substantially modified the online text. But there’s more work to be done. Toward the end of the year the scientists carried out a series of evaluations of some of Forbes magazine’s reporting on climate change. The results give an idea of the scale of the problem we’re tackling. Two of the magazine’s most popular articles for 2015, one of which attracted almost one million hits, turned out to be profoundly inaccurate and misleading. Both articles, reviewed by nine and twelve scientists, unanimously received the lowest possible scientific credibility rating. This rarely occurs, and just in case you’re wondering, yes, the scientists do score articles independently: ratings are only revealed once all scientists have completed their review. We argue that scientists have a moral duty to speak up when they see misinformation masquerading as science. Up to now scientists have however had little choice but to engage in time-consuming op-ed exchanges, which result in one or two high-profile scientists arguing against the views of an individual who may have no commitment to scientific accuracy at all. Climate Feedback takes a different approach. Our collective reviews allow scientists from all over the world to provide feedback in a timely, effective manner. We then publish an accessible synthesis of their responses, and provide feedback to editors so that they can improve the accuracy of their reporting. We’ve got proof of concept. Now we need to scale up, and for that we need the support of everyone who values accuracy in reporting on one of the most critical challenges facing our planet. Climate Feedback won’t reach its full potential until we start measuring the credibility of news outlets in a systematic way. We want to be in a position to carry out an analysis of any influential internet article on climate change. We want to develop a ‘Scientific Trust Tracker’ – an index of how credible major news sources are when it comes to climate change. We’re all increasingly relying on the internet to get our news. But the internet has engendered a competitive media environment where in the race to attract the most hits, sensational headlines can trump sober facts. We’re building into the system a new incentive for journalists with integrity to get ahead. Some journalists are already coming to us, asking our network of scientists to look at their work. We want readers to know which sources they can trust. We want editors to think twice before they publish ideological rather than evidence-based reporting on global warming. On Friday 22 April 2016, more than 170 countries signed the Paris climate agreement. But this unprecedented international treaty will lead to real action only if the leaders of those countries can garner popular support for the measures needed to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The fate of the Paris deal lies largely in the hands of voters in democratic countries, and we cannot expect democracies to produce good policy responses to challenges of climate change if voters have a confused understanding of reality. Scientists from all over the world are standing up for better informed democracies. You can help them make their voices heard. We invite you to stand with us for a better internet. We invite you to stand with science. Daniel Nethery is the associate editor and Emmanuel Vincent is the founder of Climate Feedback. Climate Feedback is launching a crowdfunding campaign today.

"  Al Gore has said the decision by Australia’s science agency CSIRO to cut climate research should be “re-evaluated at the highest level”, since they limit a source of critical information for the entire world as it attempts to solve the challenges posed by climate change.   The former US Democratic vice-president also praised the government’s support for renewable energy and the Labor party’s recent climate change policy announcement. The comments by Gore, a leading climate change campaigner, were made in a wide-ranging conversation in the latest edition of the Australian literary quarterly the Griffith Review, which has also been published online by Guardian Australia.  “In the face of this harsh new climate reality, there have been political forces in your country working to prevent Australia’s ability to act as the global leader it once was in the effort to solve the climate crisis,” he said, in conversation with Don Henry from the University of Melbourne, and former director of the Australian Conservation Foundation. “The most recent example of this is the announcement of major cuts to Australia’s CSIRO, a global leader and reference point for climate science. These cuts will deeply affect the source of valuable research for the entire world at a time when such information is critical to solving the challenge of our changing climate,” he said. “They should be re-evaluated at the highest level.” The comments follow remarks Gore made in February, shortly after the cuts were announced. “Further development of climate modelling and observations by CSIRO and colleague scientific organisations is essential to planning for climate mitigation and adaptation to global warming,” he said at the time. “This effort needs strengthening, not weakening, after the Paris Agreement in December.” Besides praising state governments and businesses that are driving investment in solar PV, he also singles out the Australian Labor party’s recent climate policy announcement. “These examples, along with the Labor party’s pledge to adopt a 50% renewable energy target by 2030, show that there is a strong support and opportunity for climate action in this country.” In order to solve the challenge, Gore said the world needed “a highly functioning global ideology”. He said capitalism needed to find a way to price environmental damage and democracy needed to be fixed after it was “hacked by large corporations and special interests,” which meant it was “dominated by the unchecked influence of money in politics”. But Gore said there was hope all this could be achieved. Previous estimates of how quickly renewable energy would be adopted have regularly been far exceeded, and the agreement in Paris sent a signal around the world that “we can and we will solve the climate crisis,” he said."
"Aside from the facial hair and the petrol-guzzling international airline, one thing Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson is known for is his passion for fighting climate change. “We need every person on Earth to acknowledge that climate change is real, and encourage each other and our leaders to address the challenge,” wrote billionaire Branson last year.   So with this in mind, some listeners might find it odd to hear on the latest official Virgin podcast that human-caused climate change is not a fact agreed upon by every credible science academy on the planet, but is instead “essentially a bankrupt theory.” These were the words of James Delingpole, the British polemicist, climate science denialist and guest of Dominic Frisby, the writer, comedian and Virgin podcast host. In a knockabout 20-minute segment full of laughs and japes, Virgin podcast listeners can hear how volcanoes emit more carbon dioxide than humans, that global warming stopped 18 years ago and how wind turbines are “bat chomping eco-crucifixes” (Frisby especially liked that one).  Let’s quickly look at a couple of these claims.  Leading climate scientist Dr Ben Santer, of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, told me the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen 40% since the start of the industrial revolution. Only 1% of that increase is due to volcanoes, compared to roughly three-quarters caused by burning fossil fuels.  “Mr Delingpole’s statement is clearly incorrect,” he said. The US Geological Survey says humans emit about 100 times more carbon dioxide than volcanoes.  Global warming stopped 18 years ago?  Neither Delingpole nor Frisby mentioned that 14 of the 16 hottest years on record, according to Nasa, have all occurred since the year 2000. In one embarrassing gaffe after another, Delingpole trotted out well-worn climate science denial talking points while Frisby confessed to being “confused”.  At one point, Frisby said “the UK has actually been getting colder” – a statement based on how, when he was a student in the 90s, “we always had amazing summers.”  According to the UK Met Office, eight of the 10 warmest years in the UK have happened since the year 2002. What about those warm summers in the 90s?  While the “amazing” summers of 1995 and 1997 were warm, they were not as warm as 2003 or 2006, according to Met Office data. “Surely some countries have got hotter,” asks Frisby, apparently seriously, to which Delingpole replies: “No, I don’t think they have.”  Really? 2015 was the warmest year for the continents of Asia and South America and the second warmest for Africa and Europe. Those continents may contain “some countries”.  In introducing Delingpole, Frisby pointed out his Virgin bosses had agreed to have him on as a guest, knowing his fringe views were not shared by the corporation. This was a credit to Virgin, Frisby said.  Delingpole’s appearance was “in the interests of balance”, Frisby told listeners. Previous guests had included three outspoken advocates of climate change action, Tim Flannery, Jeremy Leggett and former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed.  In a long response to questions, Frisby said he had invited Delingpole after some listeners asked for a guest “to air the other side of the debate.” A Virgin Group spokesperson said featuring Delingpole was “neither an endorsement of, nor an agreement with, his positions” and, like Frisby, pointed out the names of three other guests who had been vocal on climate action.  Clearly, when several studies have found that more than 90% of actual climate experts agree humans are causing climate change, the idea that there are “two sides” which need to be balanced is either naïve or reckless ‑ possibly both.  I asked Frisby if it was incumbent for a host of a podcast bearing the Virgin brand to “avail themselves of a few facts” when discussing a crucial issue (and one on which Virgin itself is vocal).  “The problem with availing myself of facts is that this argument is now so politicised it is difficult to know what is fact and what is dogma,” said Frisby. “And many are so aggressive in the way they argue the case it actually has an alienating effect of the undecided, less knowledgeable neutrals like me. Hence my decision to speak to people in person and learn that way.”  Inviting a consistently wrong non-expert who once wrote that the “climate alarmist industry” should answer questions in the “defendant’s dock in a court of law, before a judge wearing a black cap [worn by UK judges when handing out death sentences]” hardly seems like a safe route to inclusiveness. Oh – I almost forgot to mention the Virgin podcast tag line. “Grown up conversations with interesting people.”"

"An interesting question is, what are you waiting for?  Global warming is the biggest problem we’ve ever faced as a civilisation — certainly you want to act to slow it down, but perhaps you’ve been waiting for just the right moment.    The moment when, oh, marine biologists across the Pacific begin weeping in their scuba masks as they dive on reefs bleached of life in a matter of days. The moment when drought in India gets deep enough that there are armed guards on dams to prevent the theft of water. The moment when we record the hottest month ever measured on the planet, and then smash that record the next month, and then smash that record the next month? The moment when scientists reassessing the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet have what one calls an ‘OMG moment’ and start talking about massive sea level rise in the next 30 years?   That would be this moment – the moment when 135 children have drowned in Thailand trying to cool off from the worst heatwave on record there. The moment when, in a matter of months, we’ve recorded the highest windspeeds ever measured in the western and southern hemispheres.  For years people have patiently and gently tried to nudge us on to a new path for dealing with our climate and energy troubles – we’ve had international conferences and countless symposia and lots and lots and lots of websites. And it’s sort of worked—the world met in Paris last December and announced it would like to hold temperature increases to 1.5C or less. Celebration ensued. But what also ensued was February, when the planet’s temperature first broke through that 1.5C barrier. And as people looked past the rhetoric, they saw that the promises made in Paris would add up to a world 3.5C warmer—an impossible world. The world we’re starting to see take shape around us.   So there’s a need to push harder. A need, as it were, to break free from some of the dogma that’s surrounded this issue for a very long time. Yes, we need to have “everyone work together.” Yes, we need a “multi-faceted, global effort.” But you know what we really need? We need to keep oil and gas and coal in the ground, keep it from being burned and adding its freight of carbon to the global total.  Which is why, from one end of the planet to the other, people are taking greater risks this month. In one of the biggest coordinated civil disobedience actions the world has ever seen, frontline communities and climate scientists and indigenous people and faith leaders and just plain people who actually give a damn will be sitting down and sitting in and standing pat—blocking, at least for a few hours, those places where the coal and oil and gas currently reside, in the hopes of helping keep them there.  In Australia they’ll be taking to kayaks at the world’s largest coal port in Newcastle, and in Brazil it’s the fracking onslaught they’re opposing. In Vancouver they’ll be surrounding a new proposed oil terminal on the coast, and in Indonesia they’ll be outside the presidential palace in Jakarta. Coal will be the target in the Philippines and Turkey and the UK; oil in Nigeria; gas in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado—on and on around the planet, a swell of people saying the time has come.  The time has come to turn up the heat on the small band of companies and people still willing to get rich off fossil fuel, even though it’s now utterly clear they’re breaking the planet.   The time has come to show that we understand we’re in this together across borders and boundaries.  The time has come to take action commensurate with the scale of the problem. Yes, risking arrest is harder than signing a Facebook petition. But experience has shown it can often work—that’s what kicked the fight against the Keystone pipeline into high gear, turning it into the highest profile defeat of the oil industry in a generation. That’s what made it impossible for Shell to keep drilling in the Arctic, and for Adani to find the funds they need to build Earth’s biggest coal mine.  Not everyone can do it—there are regimes that are too authoritarian for anyone to dare even peaceful civil disobedience of this kind. But for those of us who still live in places theoretically committed to freedom, it’s time to put that privilege to use. The planet is well outside its comfort zone—that’s what it means when whole ecosystems are obliterated in a matter of days. Which means its time for us to be there too. "
"The world’s failure to prepare for natural disasters will have “inconceivably bad” consequences as climate change fuels a huge increase in catastrophic droughts and floods and the humanitarian crises that follow, the UN’s head of disaster planning has warned. Last year, earthquakes, floods, heatwaves and landslides left 22,773 people dead, affected 98.6 million others and caused $66.5bn (£47bn) of economic damage (pdf). Yet the international community spends less than half of one per cent of the global aid budget on mitigating the risks posed by such hazards.  Robert Glasser, the special representative of the secretary general for disaster risk reduction, said that with the world already “falling short” in its response to humanitarian emergencies, things would only get worse as climate change adds to the pressure. He said: “If you see that we’re already spending huge amounts of money and are unable to meet the humanitarian need – and then you overlay that with not just population growth … [but] you put climate change on top of that, where we’re seeing an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters, and the knock-on effects with respect to food security and conflict and new viruses like the Zika virus or whatever – you realise that the only way we’re going to be able to deal with these trends is by getting out ahead of them and focusing on reducing disaster risk.” Failure to plan properly by factoring in the effects of climate change, he added, would result in a steep rise in the vulnerability of those people already most exposed to natural hazards. He also predicted a rise in the number of simultaneous disasters. “As the odds of any one event go up, the odds of two happening at the same time are more likely. We’ll see many more examples of cascading crises, where one event triggers another event, which triggers another event.” Glasser pointed to Syria, where years of protracted drought led to a massive migration of people from rural areas to cities in the run-up to the country’s civil war. While he stressed that the drought was by no means the only driver of the conflict, he said droughts around the world could have similarly destabilising effects – especially when it came to conflicts in Africa. “It’s inconceivably bad, actually, if we don’t get a handle on it, and there’s a huge sense of urgency to get this right,” he said. “I think country leaders will become more receptive to this agenda simply because the disasters are going to make that obvious. The real question in my mind is: can we act before that’s obvious and before the costs have gone up so tremendously? And that’s the challenge.” But Glasser, speaking ahead of next month’s inaugural world humanitarian summit in Istanbul, said international disaster risk reduction (DRR) efforts remain woefully underfunded.  According to UN figures, in 2014 just 0.4% of the global aid budget of $135.2bn – roughly $540m – was spent on DRR. Glasser said the UN wanted that proportion to rise to at least 1% and would push for an increase at the Istanbul meeting. “That would still be a very small amount of money to meet the problem and that is a big challenge,” he said.  “I used to work for a company that used to say, ‘Once we get a little more money in, we’ll start spending more of it on training our staff. But it’s too tight this year; maybe next year.’ This is one of those things like capacity-building with people: you have to start doing it. You can’t wait. You just have to make choices.” He said that the internationally agreed Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction, which was adopted last year, offered the best way to reduce the human and financial cost of disasters. “It’s basically about beginning to think of disaster risk as a core planning activity so that when countries invest in infrastructure they’re not building a hospital in a flood zone or establishing communities in areas vulnerable to storm surges and are not creating risk but identifying ways of reducing it,” he said. “That’s the only way that I can imagine we’re going to be able to cope at all and even then, it’s a huge challenge to do that.” The special representative said that DRR simply could not be seen as an adjunct of development or humanitarian relief: they were all part of the same structure. He said that in countries such as Bangladesh, which regularly experiences devastating floods, thousands of lives had been saved over recent decades because DRR had been factored into core economic planning and money invested in infrastructure, storm shelters and early warning systems. Last year’s earthquake in Nepal was another case in point – and an example of the need for a more holistic approach to development and DRR.  “If you take Nepal, there was a school safety programme that retro-fitted something like 350 to 400 schools to be prepared for earthquakes. As I understand it, not one of those schools collapsed or was damaged significantly during the earthquake,” said Glasser. “So this is a great example of the links between sustainable development and risk reduction. There’s something like 35,000 public and private schools in that country. If you build them and they’re not earthquake-resilient, and tens of thousands of them are destroyed, it just highlights that you need to get it right the first time if you’re going to achieve a development outcome like improving literacy or the education of girls.” Dr Matthias Garschagen, scientific director of the World Risk Report (pdf), said large-scale disasters such as the earthquakes in Nepal and Haiti often act as stark reminders of fundamental development problems. “Nepal, in a very sad fashion, reminded us of the importance of infrastructure for humanitarian assistance,” he said. “Nepal is a country that is very challenged by its geography and has very limited road and rail networks; there wasn’t the helicopter infrastructure in place to distribute humanitarian assistance in a sufficient manner.” He said the 2010 earthquake in Haiti – which is estimated to have killed between 90,000 and 316,000 people and displaced more than 1.5 million – served as a warning of the need for building codes, and for health and sanitation plans to deal with the aftermath of a disaster. But although international attention is quick to focus on huge disasters and lessons are often learned, Garschagen says the momentum is not always sustained. A recent trip to Indonesia, he said, had yielded evidence of a familiar post-disaster pattern.  “After the Indian Ocean tsunami there was a lot of attention and international resourcing into building tsunami resilience. “The tsunami early warning system worked well for three or four years – and worked well institutionally – but afterwards, it started to fade so the equipment hasn’t been well maintained and the institutional capacity-building was not kept alive. In educational terms, the topic [has] faded out of awareness.” And therein, he added, lies the challenge: “Every time there’s a mega disaster, there are lessons learned – or at least there’s a lot of attention in the scientific and political realm. The key question is always, how do you keep up the awareness after a couple of years?”"
"In Minnesota, an administrative hearing resulted in a judicial recommendation that will have impacts across the country. It was a case argued mainly between environmental groups (such as Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, and their clients Fresh Energy and the Sierra Club) and energy producers (such as the now-bankrupt coal company Peabody Energy) regarding what a reasonable social cost of carbon should be.  I was called as an expert witness in the case along with respected climate scientist Dr. Andrew Dessler. We were opposed by the well-known contrarians Drs. Roy Spencer, Richard Lindzen, and William Happer (who has recently received attention related to his charged fees in the case). In full disclosure, Dr. Dessler and I were not paid for our work in the case. I recently wrote about the testimony and provided links to the testimonies submitted for the case. The judge’s recommendations and how they will impact energy decisions in the USA were the keys to this trial.  On April 15th, the Administrative Law Judge decided that the estimated cost of carbon pollution currently used in Minnesota is too low. New knowledge about how fast the climate is changing, how much it will change, and how it will affect societies and economies would be reflected in a larger carbon cost. This leads to a large increase in the estimated cost, from $0.44-4.53 per ton to $11-57 per ton. A summary of the ruling can be found here and the full report is available here. How was this case won? Well certainly it helps to have science on your side. Without that, even the most expensive expert witnesses struggle. But Peabody’s scientists made errors that were easy to identify and point out to the Judge. Furthermore, the Judge was smart, quickly able to see through nonsense non-science. For those of you that read the report, you’ll notice that the Peabody side made claims about the natural variability of Earth’s climate, about Earth temperature changes, and about extreme weather events. The environmental group’s side rebutted these viewpoints (see pages 15-19).  We also showed that the experts for Peabody relied extensively on non-peer-reviewed reports, blog sites, and think tanks to support their conclusions (paragraph 359 in the report). The peer-reviewed scientific literature is the best source for accurate climate science information. In other areas, the Peabody experts used scientific papers that we showed were incorrect (paragraph 360 in the report, for example).  Perhaps the key findings are best articulated in the judicial conclusions, which begin on page 114. Among the conclusions are:  22. The Administrative Law Judge concludes that Peabody failed to demonstrate that an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1 or 1.5°C is correct. 23. The Administrative Law Judge concludes that the climate sensitivity is reasonably considered to be in the 2-4.5°C range. 47. The Administrative Law Judge concludes that Peabody failed to demonstrate that the relied upon process is neither peer-reviewed nor transparent. I hope that this case will serve as a standard for other utility commissions as they work through the complex issues of the cost of carbon pollution. I also hope that the high standards of science used in Minnesota will be reflected in other areas where similar cases arise. You can’t just bring in some contrarian scientists to make unsupported statements that minimize the costs of climate change. You have to bring in the best scientists and base your conclusions on high-quality peer reviewed studies. "

"Links between climate change and the sinking of five islands in the Pacific Ocean have been exaggerated, the author of a widely reported new study has said. The report, published on Friday, tracked the shapeshifting of 33 reef islands in the Solomon Islands between 1947 and 2014. It found that five had been washed away completely and six more had been severely eroded. The study blamed the loss on a combination of sea-level rise and high wave energy.  Many media outlets, including the Guardian, jumped to the conclusion that the islands were lost to climate change. But this largely misinterprets the science, according to the study’s author, Dr Simon Albert. “All these headlines are certainly pushing things a bit towards the ‘climate change has made islands vanish’ angle. I would prefer slightly more moderate titles that focus on sea-level rise being the driver rather than simply ‘climate change’,” Albert told the Guardian. The major misunderstanding stems from the conflation of sea-level rise with climate change. As a scientifically robust and potentially destructive articulation of climate change, sea-level rise has become almost synonymous with the warming of the planet. However, as Albert’s paper points out, the ocean has been rising in the Solomon Islands at 7mm per year, more than double the global average. Since the 1990s, trade winds in the Pacific have been particularly intense. This has been driven partly by global warming and partly by climatic cycles - in particular the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. “These trade winds have basically pushed water up into western Pacific and have driven these exceptionally high rates of [sea-level rise] in the Solomons,” said Albert. “The trade winds are partly a natural cycle but also the recent intensification is related to atmospheric warming.” The proportion of the extra rise driven by climate change was not considered by Albert’s study.  Areas of the Pacific where seas are rising at closer to the global average have not yet experienced the same loss of land as the Solomon Islands. A few studies, based on comparing aerial photos of islands from world war two with current satellite images, have thus far have been inconclusive. There is even a suggestion that atolls in the central Pacific are getting bigger. The loss of land in the Pacific is a totemic image of climate change. Residents of low-lying nations see incursions of the sea where it did not use to be and blame the burning of fossil fuels. This study shows that the issue is more complex than this. But it also contains a dire warning. By the second half of this century the sea-level rise across the Pacific will be close to the rate observed in the Solomon Islands in recent decades. Albert’s team also observed a disturbing trend of wave energy increasing along with local sea-level rise, meaning islands exposed to high seas were trounced into oblivion.  In this respect, the drowning of these lands is a window into the future. For the first time, we can see clearly that the amount of sea-level rise we expect from climate change will overwhelm entire landscapes. “The key aspect I stand by is that these observations from the Solomons are a warning of things to come irrespective of if climate change alone caused it or a range of factors,” said Albert. It appears that in some cases journalists did not contact the researchers and instead quoted from a comment piece the authors wrote on The Conversation website. “This is the first scientific evidence,” said the authors, “that confirms the numerous anecdotal accounts from across the Pacific of the dramatic impacts of climate change on coastlines and people.” This was used to justify erroneous headlines. Albert told the Guardian: “I understand why these more dramatic titles are used and it does help bring attention to the issue that I firmly believe will become a major issue for the islands in the second half if this century from climate change.”"
"Shell, BP and five other top oil companies could raise their collective stock market value by up to $140bn (£97bn) if they set new strategies based on ensuring global warming is held to a 2C (4F) rise above pre-industrial levels, a new report claims on Thursday. These leading energy companies including Exxon Mobil should ditch high-cost projects in deep water and Canadian tar sands to concentrate on cheaper schemes that make money at low crude prices, says the report, Sense and Sensitivity, by the Carbon Tracker Initiative.  The report follows shareholder resolutions calling on oil companies to undertake “stress tests” on operations in the face of stronger carbon regulation and weakening fossil fuel demand as countries move to lower-carbon economies. “A simple carbon sensitivity analysis shows that oil majors pursuing volume at all costs can deliver lower shareholder value than a more disciplined approach. That is why financial regulators need to make 2C stress tests standard practice for the energy sector to help avoid companies wasting capital,” said James Leaton, research director at Carbon Tracker, a non-profit financial thinktank.  Shell and others have been criticised by environmentalists for setting allegedly unrealistic goals for their oil and gas output that could only be realised with the Earth’s temperatures rising by as much as a further 4C.  The industry argues it is always trying to lower its carbon emissions while at the same time meeting the needs of a growing world population and helping to alleviate fuel poverty. The new Carbon Tracker analysis compares a business-as-usual value of the oil companies with one where only those lower-cost projects are needed to satisfy a reduced need for their products. “In a 2C world, the major oil and gas companies will need to manage declining demand for oil. However, this can still prove to be a value­-add proposition if they simply avoid developing high-cost, high-carbon projects,” said Mark Fulton, a former Deutche Bank analyst who is now an adviser to Carbon Tracker and co‐author of the new report.  The analysis came as Shell reported first quarter profits down 83% to $800m and promised to speed up cost-cutting in the light of its acquisition of BG and a continued slump in oil prices."

"Phasing out coal, oil and gas extraction on US federal land would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 100m tonnes a year by 2030 and even more after then, providing a useful brake to climate change, according to a new study. A quarter of all fossil fuel extraction in the US occurs on the 650m acres of land under federal management. The outer shelf of the US’s marine territory, used for oil and gas drilling, is also under federal control. A study by research organization Stockholm Environment Institute found that denying new mining leases and allowing existing leases to expire would lead to a sharp decrease in emissions from coal and oil extraction, offset slightly by an increase in gas emissions. Overall, carbon dioxide emissions would drop by 100m tonnes per year by 2030, with the reductions increasing after this point. The research states that this reduction compared well to other proposed measures, such as vehicle emission standards and methane restrictions from the oil and gas industry.  Only the Obama administration’s clean power plan, forecast to cut carbon pollution by 32% by 2030 based on 2005 levels, would exceed the emissions savings. The plan is currently on hold, pending a supreme court challenge. “Federal leasing practices could play an important role in US efforts to achieve its climate protection goals,” the study states. “Our findings suggest that policymakers should give greater attention to measures that slow the expansion of fossil fuel supplies.” The US has been expanding its drilling for domestic fossil fuels in recent years in a bid to lessen its dependence on foreign oil and gas. Natural gas imports are at a 20-year low, with the US Energy Information Administration expecting the US to be a net exporter of natural gas by next year. This increase in domestic production jars with the US’s commitment to slash emissions and help keep global temperatures below a 2C rise on pre-industrial times. This internationally agreed goal would require the US to cut its fossil fuel energy production by up to 60% from current levels by 2040, even though output is on track to increase by 11% by the same year. In his final State of the Union address in January, Barack Obama lauded an increase in renewable energy uptake and said the US needed to “accelerate the transition away from dirty energy”. “That’s why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet,” the president said. Shortly afterwards, Obama’s administration announced a three-year freeze on new coal leases on federal land, pending a review. Plans to allow the Atlantic seaboard to be drilled for oil and gas were also shelved. However, the administration has not committed to halting all fossil-fuel leases on federal land, despite the idea being pushed in two bills proposed by liberal lawmakers in Congress, including the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. A 100m-tonne reduction in emissions would help the US towards its commitment to cut heat-trapping gases but is put into context by the fact the country currently emits more than 6.8bn tonnes of greenhouse gases a year.  The Stockholm Environment Institute report highlights that other policies to boost renewable energy and curb emissions from coal-fired power plants will be needed to help the world cope with the droughts, floods, food insecurity and extreme sea level rise of runaway climate change. “We are looking at the supply side because we see very little attention around what should be done, but this shouldn’t be viewed as a substitute for other policies,” said Michael Lazarus, co-author of the report.  “If we are serious about addressing climate change, there no silver bullet. We need policies working hand in hand, not policies that work against each other. We need to show policies on the supply and the demand side.”"
"As seas rise, as floods and droughts become more extreme, as crops fail and as storms intensify, the world will increasingly face a new challenge – climate refugees. In the US, witness the recent plan by the federal government to resettle a Native American tribe before their Isle de Jean Charles home in Louisiana vanishes underwater – an example that hits close to home. I have deep family roots in south Louisiana: my mother, sister and brother-in-law, aunt and uncle were refugees from a weather disaster exacerbated by climate change, losing their homes in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. A year before, a heart condition killed my father in the aftermath of a stressful evacuation from Hurricane Ivan.  Some scientists already argue that the hundreds of thousands of Syrians fleeing their war-torn country are as much refugees from climate change as from conflict, because of years of climate-related drought. Others predict the world will see hundreds of millions more climate refugees by mid-century, at a staggering human, financial and political cost. And sadly, this looming problem is not a surprise. Way back in 1988, I represented Louisiana on a global warming task force of the National Governors’ Association. Even then, the sobering effects of increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide were clear. We didn’t miss the irony that oil-producing coastal states like Louisiana and Alaska would be hit hard by climate change. Many years later, in 2004, while serving on a federal climate-change task force, I saw the simulated devastation wreaked by computer-generated storm “Pam” along the Gulf coast. I was shaken, and prayed it would never actually come to pass. But it did in Katrina and, just three weeks later, the record-setting Hurricane Rita. And we can expect far more extreme weather. Over my decades of work on climate change, what has been a surprise is that these impacts are coming faster than we once thought, as the rate and extent of changes – such as climbing temperatures, increased heat waves and floods, and rising seas – outstrip projections. The massive ice sheets covering Greenland and west Antarctica are disintegrating far more quickly than scientists calculated even in the last IPCC report in 2014. Earlier this year, on a trip to Antarctica, I saw enormous icebergs calving off the continent – a stark reminder of the immense changes under way on the planet we all call home. As a result, seas are now expected to rise by feet rather than inches this century, and other changes are accelerating. The first three months of 2016 have already shattered historical temperature records, with soaring heat in the Arctic speeding the rate of sea ice loss. With no ice to protect their coastal villages from storm-tossed waves, Native American communities in Alaska are also becoming climate refugees, with a price tag to move just one Inuit village, Shishmaref, estimated at $180m. Like many other subsistence cultures living near the water, the people of Isle de Jean Charles or Shishmaref did little to contribute to climate change. Neither have many other coastal communities around the world that will suffer similar fates. It may be that the Louisiana climate refugees will be among the luckier ones—in the sense that they are getting help to move away from their sinking island. Countless others will have to leave their homes with an uncertain future and no place to welcome them. I witnessed the heartbreak of losing home and community at first hand. After Katrina flooded 80% of New Orleans, my relatives, a friend and their five cats relocated to Arlington, Virginia and lived with me for several months. I saw the pain of being away from a home that you did not choose to leave. My sister said that losing her cherished New Orleans life and being thrown into mine in the Washington, DC area was like being in the witness protection programme. When it was unclear if the city would survive, she worried if the culture, food, music, neighbourhoods and people that made New Orleans unique and irreplaceable would be lost forever. My family was able to return to New Orleans, working to make it stronger. The Isle de Jean Charles tribe doesn’t have that option. But thanks to support from the National Disaster Resilience Competition and the state, it does have a chance to rebuild elsewhere, though maintaining their cultural bonds in a new environment could be a challenge. It’s unlikely that millions of others will be given the same opportunity. From Bangladesh to Boston, from London to Vietnam, low-lying areas near coasts are endangered. Meanwhile, prolonged droughts will continue to fuel migration and conflicts in the Middle East, central and eastern Africa and other regions. Is there hope in his bleak picture? The Paris Agreement to curb emissions that cause climate change was a huge, historic step. Now, every nation must live up to its pledges in that agreement – and go beyond them – if we are to keep the planet’s temperature from rising more than 2C, the level that scientists believe will prevent catastrophic consequences. However, we are already in a warming world and we must prepare for the changes happening today and in the future. We need to use the best available science to identify and reduce our vulnerabilities to rising seas, droughts, floods and other impacts. We need not only to invest more in resilient infrastructure – roads, railways, bridges, ports and subways; water, wastewater and electricity systems – but also to change how we invest and rebuild, taking future climate conditions into account instead of building for historic norms. We also need to update our laws and policies to make it easier to get permits for protective measures, including green solutions such as living shorelines, or for retreating from encroaching water. And at a time when one major political party in the US denies the very reality of climate change, we need to find the political will and the economic resources to do this and to help the most vulnerable. We need to support not just those displaced, but also those communities that accept climate refugees. Perhaps most difficult is the need to engage in wrenching but necessary conversations about what it means to leave the only home you’ve known, and the home where your ancestors are buried, to try to create a more stable future. These must be conversations for all of us, not just those in Louisiana or Alaska. The economic, political and psychological toll of the coming droughts, famines, wars, storms and rising seas is difficult to fathom. Yet remarkably, even in this active political season, the need to adapt to climate change has hardly been mentioned. For Louisiana, my home state, the stakes couldn’t be higher. We’ve lost the equivalent of Delaware’s entire landmass over the past century, and the familiar outline of the state is being eaten away. The wetlands that once provided bountiful resources while serving as a buffer against storms and floods are continuing to vanish at an alarming rate. Watching the Louisiana coast sink faster than any other shoreline on the planet while being buffeted by ever-rising seas and storms, one thing is clear. It’s not that we are leaving home, but that home is leaving us. Vicki Arroyo is executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center and Professor from Practice at Georgetown Law."
"It is “inconceivable” that the Greens would form a minority government with the Coalition if the election came to that, given their views on global warming, asylum seekers and renewable energy, says the party’s leader, Richard Di Natale. But they may consider an agreement with Labor because that would provide an opportunity to pursue serious Greens initiatives at the federal level, he said.  Speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday, Di Natale unofficially kicked off his party’s 2016 election campaign with a broad speech about the Greens’ vision for Australia. He criticised the lack of courage shown by Coalition and Labor MPs, and attacked the political establishment – the “old parties” – for deserting progressive mainstream voters in recent years, saying the Greens have been the only innovative and disruptive party promoting new ideas. “We announced our policies on negative gearing before anyone dared to go there,” he said. “We paved the way for Labor to announce their policy. We announced our policy on superannuation tax concessions, again, long before that issue was discussed in mainstream economic circles.” The Greens’ priority in the next parliament would be to renew Australia’s energy system, legislate strong climate laws to protect the Great Barrier Reef and protect Australia’s forests, Di Natale said. “It’s time to make the big polluters stop getting a free ride ... We have to get back on track,” he said. “Too many years have been wasted.” Di Natale also announced his plan to introduce a so-called Buffett Rule to force Australia’s wealthiest citizens to pay a legislated minimum amount of tax – 35% of their total income – to make it impossible for them to pay less tax than teachers, nurses or shop assistants. By forcing the top 1% of earners to pay a minimum amount of tax – the rule would apply to people with income above $300,000 a year – it would raise $7.3bn in revenue for the commonwealth over four years, he said. “Last year, 56 people who earned a collective $129m paid no tax, not a single cent, but spent $47m on tax advice,” he said. “Meanwhile, Australians are being told to tighten their belts, while the government rips $80bn from our schools and hospitals.” That policy is similar to an idea Labor has been considering since July last year. Di Natale is the first leader of Australia’s major political parties to speak at the Press Club since the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced his plans to hold the election on 2 July. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will speak at the Press Club next Wednesday – the day after his highly anticipated first budget. Di Natale criticised the Abbott-Turnbull government for preventing the country from transitioning to a new, post-mining economy. He said it had neglected to invest heavily in infrastructure, clean energy, world-class communication and fast, efficient public transport. “These are the fundamentals of the new economy and on each of them, the prime minister is failing,” he said. Di Natale also criticised Labor and the Nationals for siding with the Liberal party in its support for the fossil fuel industry and the “sacred cow” of industry assistance: fossil fuel subsidies. “It’s remarkable that [the Labor leader] Bill Shorten and Malcolm Turnbull have remained tight-lipped about the billions of dollars each year gifted to the likes of Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer, considering that abolishing fossil fuel tax credits returns $13.5bn to the budget over the forward estimates – that’s $13.5bn more for hospitals, for the NDIS [National Disability Insurance Scheme], for science and research,” he said.  Di Natale said the Greens also wanted to establish a $250m fund, called Renew Australia, to help workers move out of old dirty-energy jobs into new renewable ones, and the economy to modernise. He would like it to fund projects worth $1bn over the next 15 years."
"A veteran Mexican diplomat has been chosen to head the United Nations’ newly upgraded climate office, UN chief Ban Ki-moon announced in a letter to France’s environment minister. Ban said he will appoint Patricia Espinosa Cantellano “as the new UNFCCC Executive Secretary for a term of three years,” referring to the body which oversaw the international negotiations in December leading to a historic climate pact.  The letter, obtained by AFP, is dated 28 April and addressed to French minister Segolene Royal, whose country hosted the 195-nation climate talks. A former foreign minister, and currently Mexico’s ambassador to Germany, Espinosa made her mark in climate circles when she took the helm at the UN talks in 2010, a year after the process was nearly derailed in Copenhagen.  She will replace Christiana Figueres of Costa Rica, who held the post for six years and will step down in July. Figueres confirmed the selection in a tweet, noting that the process of confirmation – a formality – is under way.  News! @secgen selects Patricia Espinosa @PEspinosaC as new Exec Secretary UNFCCC. Consultation w/ Bureau underway. pic.twitter.com/kEG0pWf7tg The mandate of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, now in its 21st year, is to slash dangerous carbon pollution and help poor countries cope with climate impacts. The 2015 Paris Agreement vows to cap global warming at “well under” 2C above the pre-Industrial Era benchmark – a hugely ambitious target.  Espinosa’s appointment comes at a crucial time in the climate saga as the focus shifts from setting goals to carrying them out, analysts said.  “It is a different role now that you have the [Paris] agreement in place,” said Alden Meyer of the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists. “There is a lot more nitty-gritty implementation to be done,” he said before Ban’s choice was known. The position has been elevated to the status of under secretary general, and comes with a salary in the neighbourhood of $200,000 (€173,000).  Ban’s letter said that he interviewed four short-listed candidates before making his choice, though he did not say who they were. One might have been Laurence Tubiana, France’s top climate negotiator during the Paris talks. Tubiana was widely credited – along with French foreign minister Laurent Fabius – with ushering the fraught negotiations to a happy ending. At the request of Royal, the application window was extended so that Tubiana’s candidature could be taken into consideration."
"Two of Australia’s most shameful political failures – asylum and climate policy – are back in the news. Labor has had another stab at a climate policy – half brave, half cautious and vague, but certainly more credible than the current government’s fig leaf of a “plan”. And the PNG government has called time on the festering human rights catastrophe that is Manus Island, a development that left both parties gawpingly devoid of answers.  Each of these failures has been driven by politics.  Australian climate policy is at near crisis point because it can be solved only with a degree of bipartisanship, absent in the past seven years of brain-dead fact-free sense-paralysing conflict. Asylum policy is already at crisis point because the leading parties are in a bipartisan death lock that refuses to acknowledge the human and moral cost of achieving the stop-every-single-boat objective.  But instead of discussing how we got ourselves into these messes or how we might get out of them – what the climate policy might actually mean for the economy or the environment, or what the Manus decision by the PNG supreme court might mean for the poor souls we’ve left languishing there – politicians and some commentators leap straight over the detail and discuss how the developments will “play” in the political “game” of the imminent election campaign. Or launch a completely inaccurate scare campaign written for a different policy altogether. Or argue over who’s “fault” it all is. Because those things are obviously way more important than, I don’t know, the future of our environment, our economy, or the lives of the 850 utterly desperate men detained at our behest for years. Of course, we’ve always assessed the political impact of events or announcements but there was a time when we used to make some attempt to understand what they meant first, or what might be done about them. But much of the response to each of these politics-fuelled crises ignored the substance and immediately reacted to, and assessed their impact on ... politics.  When the Papua New Guinean supreme court brought down its widely anticipated decision that the Manus offshore detention centre was illegal, everyone’s first reaction was to pass the buck. The latest agreement for processing on Manus Island was struck by Kevin Rudd, but Labor’s Richard Marles immediately said the mess was all the government’s fault. “We have seen a complete failure on the part of the Turnbull government to properly negotiate resettlement arrangements with PNG and to negotiate resettlement arrangements with third country options,” he thundered. “The Manus facility was established to serve as a circuit breaker ... It was never intended to serve as a punitive place of indefinite detention.” But according to the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, it was all Labor’s fault. “Well this arrangement obviously was put together by the Rudd government back when they lost control of our borders and thousands of people were arriving,” he said. And when a few Labor MPs reiterated their long-standing opposition to the policy, Dutton insisted the real issue at stake here was “a leadership” question for Bill Shorten. Yep, right, that would be the big question. He said the refugees on Manus were PNG’s problem. PNG said they were Australia’s problem. Meanwhile, commentators busied themselves with the really critical conundrums – was this a crisis for Malcolm Turnbull or in fact a “political gift”? Because it was great for the Coalition to be talking about boats during an election campaign. Even accepting the overriding policy priorities of both major parties to keep people smugglers out of business, these responses are pathetic. Yes, the government has been working furiously behind the scenes to try to find another country that will take refugees from Manus and Nauru, and if Labor was in government it would be doing the same thing. But the Coalition appears to be ruling out options with at least some chance of success, such as resettling refugees in a third country from where they could apply to come to Australia after a period of time, or New Zealand’s long-standing offer to take some refugees, apparently because a solution cannot even be contemplated if there’s a risk even one more boat might come. The political scoreboard is the top priority. Of course, there aren’t easy answers, but a solution would surely be simpler if we just concentrated on finding it, rather than apportioning political blame.  And on the same day Labor released its climate change plan, which retreated on so many aspects of the former emissions trading scheme that even the Business Council of Australia said it could provide a bridge towards bipartisanship. One of the Coalition’s own advisers concedes the scheme Labor is proposing for the electricity sector is almost identical to the one Turnbull championed as a “greener, cheaper, smarter” option in 2009, and exactly what everyone thinks the “Direct Action” plan will be morphed into when it is reviewed in 2017 – if the Coalition actually wants to achieve its greenhouse gas reduction targets, that is. Did the prime minister, who promised to respect the intelligence of the electorate, concede any of these things? As his predecessor might have said, nope, nope, nope. He and his ministers dusted off the same old, factually incorrect scare campaign that Tony Abbott was using – misused the same modelling data to sprout the same incorrect assertions about the possible cost of Labor’s scheme, and cranked up the same lines about “big thumping electricity tax” that is about to impoverish Australian households. Stay tuned for dire predictions about Whyalla and lamb roasts. The Daily Telegraph has already responded to the semblance of a climate policy with a full front page picture of a masked ghoul, screaming “Horror Show”, because a “nightmare” was returning. Apparently if we have no credible climate policy we can all sleep easy. Business and environment groups alike were dismayed by the reaction, because, as modelling by the former Reserve Bank of Australia board member Warwick McKibbin clearly shows, the thing that will push up power prices far further than anything either party has on the table is the cost of continued investment uncertainty, the kind that is caused by continued climate “wars” and stupid screaming headlines and political paralysis. As recent modelling by The Climate Institute showed, continued deadlock and delay in taking action will cause massive economic disruption in Australia when we finally realise that we have to do something in coming years. And still politicians tell us, straight faced, that they are really interested in good policy because that leads to good politics in the end. It’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry. Or scream."

"The latest survey data from Yale and George Mason universities underscores the partisan divide on climate science denial – 73% of Americans realize that global warming is happening, including 71% of liberal/moderate Republicans, but the average is dragged down by the mere 47% of conservative Republicans who answer this question correctly. On the bright side, this is a big improvement from the 28% of conservative Republicans who realized global warming was happening just two years ago. Similarly, 56% of Americans realize global warming is mostly caused by humans, including 49% of liberal/moderate Republicans, but the number is again dragged down by the 26% of conservative Republicans correctly answering this question.   The numbers and demographics expressing concern about global warming are almost identical to those accepting human-caused global warming. That particular correlation lends support to a recent paper published in Nature Climate Change, by Jing Shi and a team of social scientists from ETH Zurich and the University of Michigan.  Social scientist Dan Kahan has argued that ideological and cultural identity can be so strong that scientific evidence, facts, and information can’t break through it. Kahan thinks that on certain issues like climate change, ideological biases make many conservatives immune to facts.  In fact, conservatives with higher education and general scientific knowledge are often more wrong about climate change, in what’s been coined the “smart idiot” effect. This has led Kahan to conclude that on climate change, facts and knowledge can’t sway people. However, other research has found that climate-specific knowledge does correlate with acceptance of climate science. In the new study led by Jing Shi, the authors surveyed a total of 2,495 people in Canada, China, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. They asked questions to evaluate the participants’ specific knowledge about the physical characteristics of climate change and understanding of its causes and consequences. Critically, they found that knowledge about the causes of climate change was correlated with higher concern about climate change in all countries, and knowledge about the consequences was linked to higher concern in most countries. respondents from Germany and Switzerland had significantly higher scores on knowledge about physical aspects of climate change than participants from Canada and the US. Chinese respondents knew significantly more about the causes of climate change than the respondents from the other countries. German and Swiss respondents were most knowledgeable about the consequences of climate change. In contrast, participants from the US had the lowest level of knowledge about climate change among the six countries we surveyed, independent of the type of knowledge. In short, as illustrated in the Yale/George Mason poll numbers, people who realize that humans are causing global warming are more likely to be concerned about the problem. In Shi’s survey, the Chinese respondents had the most knowledge about the causes of global warming, with the German and Swiss participants most accurately answering the questions about its consequences. These nationalities also expressed the greatest concern about climate change. Americans showed the least climate knowledge and the least concern. The Chinese and Swiss participants were also the most altruistic (caring about the welfare of others), and the most concerned about environmental health. Americans cared least about the welfare of others and the environment. public education and risk communication efforts regarding climate change may not be the lost cause that some researchers (and some policymakers) assume they are. The emphasis on the causes (versus the physical and consequential dimensions) of climate change should be encouraged in risk education and communication Social scientists have identified several key pieces of knowledge that might convince people – even conservatives – about the need to tackle global warming. This social science research shows that teaching people about the expert consensus and how the greenhouse effect works can increase their likelihood of accepting the reality human-caused global warming and potentially increase their support of policies to solve the problem. It may be the case that ideology acts as a mental block preventing conservative Republicans from accepting facts like the 90–100% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. However, while there’s certainly a group who are unreachable due to ideologically-based science denial, they are a relatively small and dwindling segment of the population. For the vast majority of people who underestimate the expert consensus and don’t understand the mechanics of the greenhouse effect, this knowledge can make a difference.  In the 2016 US elections, climate change may be a winning political issue. The Yale/George Mason survey found that 43% of Americans (including 36% of liberal/moderate Republicans) are more likely to vote for a candidate who strongly supports taking action to reduce global warming, with just 14% less likely to vote for such a candidate.  However, only Democrats view climate change as a relatively high priority, with Independents and Republicans viewing it as a low priority. The survey also found that 75% of all voters (including 61% of Republicans) support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and 68% (including 47% of Republicans) support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. As this research shows, if climate communicators can successfully inform people about how the greenhouse effect works and that humans are responsible for global warming, more will come to support climate policies, and it will become even more of a winning political issue."
"Malcolm Turnbull has warned Australia would lose vital “leverage” in international negotiations under Labor’s plan to dramatically increase Australia’s emissions reduction target.  On the first official day of the election campaign the prime minister criticised the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, for failing to realise that the world had “moved on from ideology” in the climate change debate towards practical negotiations.  But the Climate Institute contradicted Turnbull’s comments, saying Australia had little leverage in climate negotiations because its emission targets were too low, not too high. Turnbull used his first press conference of the campaign to criticise Labor’s plans to increase Australia’s renewable energy target to 50% of electricity generated by 2030 and to reduce carbon pollution by 45% by 2030 based on 2005 levels. The Coalition has a renewable energy target of 23% by 2020, but it has not settled on a post-2020 target. It has plans to reduce Australia’s emissions by 26% by 2030 on 2005 levels, compared with Labor’s 45% target. Turnbull said Labor’s plan to boost Australia’s emissions target would destroy the country’s bargaining power in climate negotiations. “What Mr Shorten has overlooked is not just the economic interests of Australians but the global objective,” Turnbull said. “Everything changed in Paris at the Paris climate change conference. What happened there was remarkable. All of the nations in the world agreed to emissions targets for 2030. Each of them exerted some leverage on the other. “For an opposition leader who wants to be prime minister, to say that Australia would unilaterally nearly double its target, [that] abandons all leverage we would have. “The way these targets will rise in the future ... is by mutual agreement. So one nation will say, ‘We’ll go up a bit more if you go up a bit more.’ That is the way these agreements are put together.” But John Connor from the Climate Institute said Turnbull’s interpretation of the Paris agreement, and the way countries were to move forward in international negotiations, was “respectfully, incorrect”. He said Australia had little bargaining power because the government’s targets were not ambitious enough. “This was highlighted last month when Australia wasn’t invited to a ‘high ambition coalition’ meeting including US, EU and small island states,” Connor said. “If Australia is to have any leverage it will need to lift its ambition and then engage globally, not the other way around. “History shows that when countries advance credible targets it drags up the targets of other nations, not the opposite. Australia is actually limiting its leverage by advancing an inadequate 2030 target.” Connor said Turnbull’s claim that all countries at the Paris conference had agreed to emissions targets for 2030 was also incorrect. “Before Paris, countries put forward a range of initial targets for 2025 or 2030. Counties only formalise their targets when they ratify the agreement,” he said. “The Abbott government submitted its initial, and inadequate 2030 target, well after most other advanced economies. “A process to update these targets starts in 2018. Updated 2030 targets are to be submitted in 2019-20.” He said Turnbull had implied other countries had not already agreed to strengthen their emissions targets but that was wrong. “In Paris they did and [they agreed] that targets will be strengthened every five years,” he said. “As the PM notes this will be a collective process and a key test against which countries will be judged is whether the target is consistent with the goal [to limit warming to 1.5-2oC]. Labor environment spokesman Mark Butler also said Turnbull seemed not to understand how international negotiations work. “Individual country targets weren’t negotiated in the Paris agreement, countries committed to the goal of keeping global warming to well below two degrees Celsius.  “It is then the responsibility of each country to set the appropriate targets to achieve the global goal,” Butler said. “Mr Turnbull also doesn’t understand that to keep pace with similar advanced economies and to inspire other nations to do better, Australia needs to show leadership in achieving our fair share of the global burden.”"
"The danger of gala events like the official signing of the climate change treaty at the UN in New York on Friday, crowned with a guest appearance from Leonardo DiCaprio and with 60 heads of state in attendance, is the impression they create that the job is done. It was certainly a spectacular demonstration of global intent to get more than 170 signatures on the deal agreed in Paris in December at the first time of asking; but what matters is making it legally binding. For that, it must be not just signed but ratified by at least 55 countries, and it must cover 55% of emissions. Nor does the Paris deal go far enough. It was only a step on a long, hard road. The targets that each country set themselves do not go nearly far enough. Now the gap between reality and the ambition of holding global warming below 2C needs addressing. In Churchillian rhetoric, this is not the end, nor the beginning of the end, but it is the end of the beginning. There are powerful reasons to pursue the Paris summit objective. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, each of the past 11 months was warmer than the 20th-century average. Nasa statistics showed that 2015 was even hotter than the previous record-setting year of 2014. Yet despite the way the evidence is stacking up, political leaders in polluting countries continue to argue about whether and how fast they need to act. In the US, President Barack Obama’s climate plan has hit trouble in the supreme court, where the regulation of emissions from coal-fired plants has been blocked. Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic candidate for the presidency, is pledged to continue Mr Obama’s commitment to tackling emissions, but her probable rival, Donald Trump, is certainly not. The US and China are committed to ratifying the climate change treaty, but for others, such as India, it may be more complicated.  In the UK, 10 years after David Cameron hugged that husky, his record is in tatters. Not only has “the green crap” been whittled back by big cuts in subsidies and incentives that have left solar power, onshore and even offshore wind all less attractive, but policies to limit emissions have been repeatedly portrayed as harmful to the economy. High energy costs have been widely blamed for the crisis in British steel. Yet, while it is true that energy prices are higher than elsewhere in Europe – partly because of climate change programmes and partly because of the fragmented nature of the privatised industry largely beyond government control – they are mitigated by compensation. As fact-checkers point out, for steel, the actual costs of energy policy amount to around just 1% of total manufacturing costs. The double whammy of an uncompetitive currency and a slump in global demand are the real problems that Tata and other steelmakers are facing. Energy costs get the blame because that’s where the government might have real traction. As divestment lobbies chalk up triumph after triumph, there are signs of parallel trends. In the past few days, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has pulled out of scores of companies for being over-reliant on fossil fuel, and the Rockefeller Foundation has divested from fossil fuel entirely. Yet governments still resist the commitment to greening their economies that will turn the Paris deal from an exercise in global cooperation to a watershed for global warming."

"Devastating images showing the complete destruction of coral colonies on the Great Barrier Reef have been obtained by Guardian Australia and illustrate what is happening to coral there that would fill an area the size of Scotland. They reveal the rapid death of coral impacting much of the Great Barrier Reef, with estimates that as much as half of the coral in the northern third of the 2000km reef had this fate.  The photos were taken from around Lizard Island by Lyle Vale from Coral Watch at the University of Queensland. Justin Marshall, a biologist at the University of Queensland, says more than 90% of the coral around Lizard island is dead or dying. “The thing that struck me about this event is two things,” Marshall said. “The severity of the bleaching in the first place. And the rapidity of the death, which I was completely blown away by. When I went up to the reef in March I was already seeing corals that were dying.” Marshall said that was going to be devastating for the tourism industry there. “Lizard Island has just rebuilt their resort after the cyclone. They spent millions of dollars. Tourists are going to go there and go: ‘Where’s the reef?’  “These photos show a story … The shocking thing to think about is what you’re seeing there is happening over a 1000-kilometre stretch of the reef, to at least half of it. An area of the Great Barrier Reef the size of Scotland has coral that is dying right now. Or dead – probably dead.” The four photos show the rapid effects of warm water on coral. The first image shows healthy corals from around Lizard Island on 20 December 2015. It includes two large colonies of hard coral in the centre known as acropora. Around the top of them is a common soft coral called lobophytum and nestled in at the bottom is a spiky coral called seriatopora. There are also fish swimming around the coral that feed on plankton and use the coral as shelter. The second image was taken on 12 March 2016 and shows all the corals becoming severely bleached. At that stage they’re unlikely to be dead. The third image shows the same colony one month later. Marshall says that, even as a biologist, it was easy to be confused by the colour that appears to be returning but was not the coral recovering but rather being taken over by seaweed. At this stage, the fish are still able to use the coral as shelter on the reef. The final image was taken just two weeks later on 2 May. It shows the algae has taken over and the coral – including the soft coral all around the edges – is completely dead. The spiky seriatopora that was nestled in the bottom is completely gone. With that much algae covering the coral skeletons, fish aren’t able to use them as shelter, Marshall said. He said the crisis on the Great Barrier Reef, and the billions of dollars in tourism that relies on it, demands that Australia take strong immediate action on climate change, stop building new coalmines and institute strict controls on farm run-off. “We have to grow up and actually take the COP21 plan forward at the speed of light,” he said. But with recent analyses showing that the warm conditions driving this bleaching event will be normal by the 2030s – and cooler than average after that – Marshall said he was pessimistic about the future of the reef. “Yes, maybe it’s too late. But that’s not a reason not to do it. I’m not going to sit back and buy a Hummer and just let it all slide. With biology there are always things around the corner that we don’t know. These things are fantastically resilient and biologically programmed for survival. “I’d rather be pessimistic and doing something than being pessimistic and not doing anything at all.”"
"Twenty Conservative MPs have written to the prime minister urging him to accept the steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions required by the UK’s ‘fifth carbon budget’. On the eve of local elections in several regions, and the poll for the next London mayor, the MPs have made a strong statement that climate change is a problem that cannot wait. The 20 backbench Tory MPs include former fisheries minister Richard Benyon, chair of the health select committee Sarah Wollaston, former under secretary of state for health Daniel Poulter, and member of the environmental audit committee Rebecca Pow. “[The carbon budget] is tailored to meeting our carbon obligations at the lowest possible cost and with the highest ancillary gains,” they wrote to David Cameron on Wednesday night. “Early and full acceptance of that advice will give investors and government the confidence to act and so maintain this government’s proud record of lower emissions combined with sustained economic growth.” The letter was co-ordinated by Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness since 2005 and a long-time campaigner for climate action who is also vice-chairman of the Globe group of legislators around the world pushing for laws on greenhouse gases. Under the fifth carbon budget, emissions must fall by 57% below 1990 levels by 2032. The budget was set out by the Committee on Climate Change, the statutory body set up under the climate change act to advise ministers on how to meet the UK’s long term climate target of an 80% reduction in emissions by mid-century. The budget must be approved by the end of June, but the timing is awkward for the government because of this week’s local elections, and – more significantly – the referendum on 23 June on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union. If the budget is not approved, the government will be open to legal challenge and judicial review, under the terms of the act. David Cameron could face significant opposition from his MPs over the fifth carbon budget. He had to step in to quell dissent among right-wing backbenchers over the last carbon budget, introduced in 2011 when the coalition was still fairly new. Dissent is likely to be heightened this time, without the dampening effect of a coalition, and in the fever of an EU referendum debate. Environmental concerns have not played a leading role to date in the EU referendum rows, but the UK’s green regulations could be dramatically affected by its outcome. A vote to leave would throw into doubt the UK’s efforts on emissions, which currently are bound up with the EU’s efforts, as agreed under the Paris accord reached last December. Theoretically, the Climate Change Act and thus the carbon budget are separate from any EU considerations. In practice, however, those campaigning for a Brexit have often expressed scepticism on global warming science and policy. Lord Lawson, who has spearheaded the exit campaign, is also founder of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate sceptic thinktank. A no vote would call into question the UK’s climate change commitments, and could embolden opponents of the climate change act to seek its repeal. Green campaigners added their voices to the MPs. Matthew Spencer, director of the Green Alliance, said: “As Tory MPs make clear, it’s vital that the fifth carbon budget is accepted in full, without caveats, if it is to reassure investors that were staying the course to a near zero carbon electricity system in 2030. The prime minister should be bullish about this decision and then bang heads together across Whitehall to increase momentum on delivery of new low carbon infrastructure.” Simon Bullock, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, urged the government to go even further. “Climate change’s impacts are already affecting us all, and this letter reflects the strong desire for action across the political spectrum,” he told the Guardian.  “The government must develop a much stronger strategy to meet the commitments it signed up to in Paris last year. Passing the fifth carbon budget is an essential first step. Putting in place a clear climate plan is essential to give businesses confidence to continue investing in Britain’s growing low-carbon economy, as the Conservative backbenchers rightly point out.” The MPs told the prime minister that the UK’s work in helping to reach a global agreement on climate change in Paris should provide the momentum to put the economy on a low-carbon footing, and meet the fifth carbon budget. They said this would open up new economic opportunities and job gains. “Following the historic outcome of the Paris climate conference, the shift to low-carbon technology in transport, buildings and energy markets is accelerating again,” they wrote. “The UK played a pivotal role in the agreement and we now need to make sure that we attract the greatest possible investment in UK low and zero carbon infrastructure, with the supply chain and employment benefits this can bring.”"
"The Obama administration has warned the US will need to deal with a wave of “climate refugees” as the Arctic continues to warm, joining with the Canadian government to express alarm over how climate change is affecting indigenous communities. Sally Jewell, US secretary of the interior, painted a stark picture of communities relocating and lives disrupted in her first official visit to Canada. The Arctic, which is warming at twice the rate of the global average, has just recorded its lowest recorded peak ice extent after what’s been called a “warm, crazy winter”.  “We will have climate refugees,” Jewell said. “We have to figure out how to deal with potentially relocating villages. There’s real tangible support we need to do from a government basis, working alongside indigenous communities as they make very difficult choices about what is right for them. “We can’t turn this around. We can stem the increase in temperature, we can stem some of the effect, perhaps, if we act on climate. But the changes are under way and they are very rapid.” The escalating Arctic temperatures, diminishing ice and rising sea levels are having consequences for humans as well as other animals such as polar bears and walruses. The ability to catch fish and travel – or even to hold the famed Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska – is at risk. Jewell said the remote town of Kivalina in Alaska is “washing away”. The coastal town, located around 80 miles above the Arctic circle, has been visited by Barack Obama following warnings its 400-strong population will have to be moved due to thinning ice that exposes the town to crashing waves. It’s a problem that is expected to be replicated elsewhere in Alaska and in Canada. Jewell said political leaders need to “act and support” efforts to make communities more resilient to climate change. US Republicans have, so far, opposed any funding to protect or relocate Alaskan towns. “The changing climate isn’t just about melting permafrost, it’s having a huge impact upon cultures,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment minister, who met with Jewell in Quebec. “When your ice highway has gone, communities can’t interact. It’s having a huge impact upon food and food insecurity.” McKenna said there is a “huge commitment to do more” from Obama and Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister. The two leaders met in Washington DC in March to agree to help lead the world to a low-carbon economy and to bolster efforts to protect the Arctic and the people who live there. Scientists expect the Arctic to be completely ice-free for at least a few days during the summer by the 2040s. The area of summer ice has shrunk by around 3m sq km since 1980.  The disappearance of this ice is set to open up new opportunities for shipping lanes through previously inaccessible areas, raising concerns over oil spills and further disruption to indigenous livelihoods. "
"The head of the United Nations climate science panel has declared it is still possible to avoid a dangerous 2C increase in global warming – despite more than a dozen record hot years since 2000. But the costs could be “phenomenal”, he said. In an interview with the Guardian, Hoesung Lee, the leader of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), defied the bleak outlook of climate scientists who warn the world is hurtling to a 2C rise far faster than anticipated. Governments set 2C as the danger limit for global warming at the Paris climate conference last year – and agreed to work to limit warming to 1.5C. Global average temperatures have already risen about 1C since the pre-industrial era because of warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions. February’s hot temperatures stunned scientists, even after a string of record-breaking years.  But Lee insisted the 2C goal remained technically feasible, although it could become prohibitively expensive. “2C is achievable, and if we fail to act according to what the IPCC has been advising, the cost will rise phenomenally,” Lee said. “The sooner we act, we will be able to achieve 2C stabilisation cost-effectively,” he went on. “The longer we wait to take action, the cost will be a lot higher.” An economist who began his career at ExxonMobil, Lee took over the UN climate panel last year after Rajendra Pachauri was forced to step down amid charges of sexual harassment. The UN panel, which produces exhaustive reports on climate science, agreed last month to study the feasibility of the aspirational 1.5C temperature goal. Small island states at risk of being swallowed by rising seas argue they need the stronger target to help assure their survival. The IPCC is due to produce its special report on the goal by 2018. But there have been multiple warnings from scientists, business leaders and campaign groups since Paris that even 2C is moving beyond reach. Christiana Figueres, one of the architects of the Paris agreement in her role as former UN climate chief, has called for a peaking of emissions by 2020 to keep the 2C limit within reach. However, the IPCC chair insisted the temperature goal would remain technically possible if emissions continue to grow beyond 2020, or even 2030. “It is a daunting task, but the assessment clearly indicates that we have the technology and the means that will allow us to achieve that goal,” Lee said. The commitments made so far under the Paris agreement would allow warming of close to 3C. Some scientists have called for the rapid deployment of technologies to suck carbon emissions from the air. Lee, speaking on the sidelines of a gathering in Washington last week of business leaders and mayors, aimed at spurring investment in low-carbon technologies, said such investments needed to be ramped up fast to hold down the costs of the energy transition.  “Now the cost of meeting 2C in the most cost-efficient manner in terms of reduction of growth rate over the next seven or eight decades will be much less than one percentage point a year,” he said. Delaying until the middle of the century would be ruinously expensive. “If we fail to act properly, then the emissions reduction will have to double to something like 6% a year, which is unprecedented in any experience.” Even then, however, Lee refused to rule out the feasibility of the 2C goal. “It is achievable if there is a drastic change in the way of doing business,” he said.  Scientists have also said that the world’s carbon dioxide concentration is now on the brink of never again dipping below the 400 parts per million (ppm) milestone, as two important measuring stations, at Cape Grim in Australia and Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano, sit on the point of no return. With the science on the causes of climate change now certain, and growing evidence in real time of its consequences, Lee said the time had come for the IPCC to focus more on solutions.  He said the next blockbuster report from the UN climate science panel – due to come out in three stages between 2020 and 2022 – would look more closely at policies for dealing with climate change. That could include studies of the relative effectiveness of carbon taxes in different economies, the impacts of technology standards, government funding for research and development, and policies for protecting cities and rural areas from climate change. “We need to improve our understanding of the effectiveness of carbon pricing in the real world – not in the textbook,” he said. “We need to firm up our understanding of policy measures.”  Lee said the IPCC should also be looking at geoengineering, or climate intervention on a planetary scale. He said he would like to see the climate panel explore the governance of geoengineering, and not just its technical aspects. "

"Australia’s lack of follow-through on climate change will leave the Great Barrier Reef “completely cooked” despite it signing the Paris climate deal, the Greens say. The federal environmental minister, Greg Hunt, has joined leaders from 170 other countries in New York to sign the Paris Agreement to limit global warming by at least 2C.  Hunt says Australia will beat its Kyoto emission reduction targets by 78m tonnes and meet a 2030 target of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels. “These are some of the highest targets anywhere in the world and certainly on a per capita basis we’re right at the top,” he told the ABC from New York on Saturday. But the Greens senator Larissa Waters says Australia signing the agreement won’t enable it to avoid warming of 3C to 4C if it’s not backed up by action. “Unfortunately, minister Hunt likes to bandy about some figures but Australia has been a laughing stock on the international stage,” she said. “Our pollution reduction targets are so far below the science and people know that our policies aren’t even getting us towards those very low targets.” Senator Waters rejected the government’s commitment of a further $11m on projects to continue improving water quality on the Great Barrier Reef following a study this week showing 93% of the reef was bleached. She pointed to the Queensland and federal government’s backing of the Adani coal mine, which critics say will further imperil the reef. “We need to really have a change of policy when it comes to approving every coal mine anyone ever thinks of and instead really fund and support the transition and speed it up to clean-energy,” Senator Waters said."
"Police have arrested 66 people in anti-fossil fuel protests in the Newcastle, home to Australia’s biggest coal export port.  Hundreds of kayaks and boats blocked the entrance to Newcastle harbour in an attempt to stop coal ships from leaving or entering. Another group blocked train tracks used to transport coal on the Sandgate Bridge in the city’s north west.   The protests are part of several anti-fossil fuel actions happening across 12 countries. Organisers estimate more than 1,000 people attended the protest in Newcastle, which lies approximately 160km north of Sydney, on Sunday, calling for the government to take action on climate change and wind down the use of fossil fuels. The Break Free From Fossil Fuels group said it was targeting “some of the most iconic and dangerous fossil fuel projects on the face of the planet”. Newcastle is also one of the world’s biggest coal export ports. In the early hours of Sunday protesters hung banners from coal ships docked in Newcastle harbour, organisers said. New South Wales police confirmed 66 arrests, of which 57 were people removed from the train lines over Sandgate bridge, where they had staged a blockade until police broke it up in the early afternoon.  Among the others arrested – who were aged from 22 to 50 – was one woman who locked herself on to a mooring line of a coal carrier, and three women who abseiled from the Stockton bridge. “Also arrested was a male master of a rigid-hull inflatable boat, used to transport them to the location and a male passenger,” a spokeswoman said. “The boat has been seized by police. A fourth person has been arrested for operating a drone near a populated area.” All people arrested were released on bail and will face local court next month. “On a day when the election is going to be called, it’s sending a signal to our elected leaders that climate change is an election issue,” said 350.org spokesman Campbell Klose. One protestor, Jesse Kalic, said there were about 70 people taking part in the protest action on the rail track. “The risk we face by not taking action on climate change is far greater than the risk of sitting on train tracks,” she said. “I’m a masters student, studying climate change at the University of Melbourne. Everything I’ve learned tells me we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, to avoid ... 2C of global warming.” Coal, don't dig it! 50 of us on bridge still - each minute is less coal into Newcastle #breakfree2016 #auspol pic.twitter.com/iCQ8fNoQwr Several hundred kayaks and other vessels also took to the water in the shipping channel, blocking access for any coal ships going in or out of Newcastle harbour. One of the protestors, Nicola Bowskill, said she wanted to see the government act on the commitments made in the Paris agreement: “I’m really worried about climate change and I believe we’ve got to break free … and move towards 100% renewable energy”.

The flotilla is an annual event, and “gets bigger every year” Bowskill said. In 2014 it was joined by a large contingent of people from the Pacific Islands, who sought to draw attention to the impact climate change was already having on their countries.  The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, who attended the Sunday protest, and said the Coalition government was holding Australia back from making the transition to “a new 21st century clean economy”. “We stand as Greens with the community on the first day of an election campaign, where you’ll see the two old parties, standing with vested interests saying let’s continue to dig coal out of the ground, to pollute the atmosphere, to make dangerous global warming worse, to lose the Great Barrier Reef, to lose that precious wilderness we all so dearly love, and to hold us back from making that transition that we as a country so desperately need to make.” Di Natale said the Greens had never been in better shape for an election campaign."

"Climate scientists at the CSIRO who are earmarked for redundancy will learn their fate this week. Staff in the organisation’s oceans and atmosphere business unit began being told of their “potential” redundancies on Tuesday, and the process was expected to continue until Thursday. Last week a similar process occurred for scientists in the land and water business unit.  After public outcry followed CSIRO management initially identifying nearly 100 climate scientists for redundancy in February this year, that number dropped quickly to 70 and was finally reduced to about 40. The scientists are given two weeks to explain why their position should be saved, followed by a two-month process during which management tries to find them another position in the organisation. After that, the scientists will have up to nine weeks to tie up loose ends before they leave. In the meetings, the scientists are told that their position has been “impacted”. Reasons given centre on a lack of “customer support” for the work they do; a lack of “external earnings” associated with their work; and the fact that CSIRO needs to reduce some capabilities to invest in other areas. “A lot of people are upset,” a senior climate scientist at CSIRO told Guardian Australia. He said all the internal avenues for fighting the cuts had been exhausted. Only a political decision could stop it now, he said. “Unless there is a change in government and they were ordered to stop the cut.”"

"Bill Shorten has released his own part-memoir part-manifesto, a book casting his life, career and policies for government as part of Labor’s centrist reforming tradition and in the mould of Bob Hawke’s consensus-driven leadership style. Published Monday as an ebook and next week as a paperback, For The Common Good: Reflections on Australia’s Future, is similar in intent to Tony Abbott’s Battlelines, combining childhood memories and personal reflections with a broad brush description of Shorten’s positioning across the policy spectrum and views about the task of leadership itself.  The book, published by Melbourne University Press, seeks to define Shorten’s image ahead of the full force of the election campaign, and recast the thing he is best known for, being a unionist and ALP factional leader, asserting that he has now left factional sparring behind him. The Liberal party has already run ads asserting that Shorten is “not a leader” because he has “too much baggage” from his involvement in the two leadership coups of the Rudd/Gillard years and is “too weak to stand up to the unions and the factions”. In his book, Shorten addresses those claims. “For all of my 31 years in the ALP, I’ve been a moderate,” he insists, in a chapter where he addresses his role in both the plot to overthrow Kevin Rudd for Julia Gillard in 2010 and then to overthrow Julia Gillard for Kevin Rudd in 2013. Of 2010 he says he “formed a strong view only in the last few days before the challenge” and repeats that the change was not adequately explained to the electorate. Of 2013, he says the change was necessary to avoid electoral annihilation and was “very hard personally” because he was “closer to Julia than to Kevin”.  He then turns to the role of factions in his party more generally, conceding excessive involvement in his “youth”. “Factions within the Labor party have long attracted bad press, sometimes justifiably so,” he says. “I think it is simplistic, however, to reduce the organisation of a party into factions. Political factions have always been a feature of parliamentary politics. Their basic role is to bring individuals together around a common political purpose ...  “Excessive factionalism is damaging to political parties and you will often see it at work in youth wings. I probably indulged in a bit of it in my youth: you tend to imitate the conflict of your elders without quite understanding the basis for it. Labor’s factions work best when they’re a fulcrum for ideas and debates. They operate at their worst when they act as a patronage machine to promote mediocre people. As federal leader I don’t think factionally and I don’t attend faction meetings.”  Shorten says he was politicised by Hawke’s ascent to the prime ministership, describing Hawke’s national economic summit from his perspective as a high school student. “Watching it all unfold in the newspapers and then discussing it in class was a thrilling experience for a political nerd like me. Most of all, I was impressed by the consensual way in which Hawke led, his way of bringing people together; of uniting the nation rather than playing groups off against each other; repudiating extreme solutions; and the coming together of employers and workers,” he says. Within pages, he is describing his own leadership style in similar terms, an approach learned, like Hawke, from the working in the trade union movement.  “Some people think strong leadership means telling people what they must do or being the smartest person in the room. That’s wasn’t my view as a unionist, and nor is it my view now as Labor leader. Real leadership shows that consensus and negotiation is a sign of strength, not weakness. Real leadership means understanding the minimum and the maximum that people will accept. You go for the maximum, yet always understand the minimum. In every negotiation I have been involved in, I refer to the 90:10 rule—let’s work on the 90% we agree on, not the 10% where we differ. This is the belief I have carried into politics.  “As Labor leader, I still think like an organiser. Whether it’s dealing with the rising influence of vested interests or solving a community-level problem, empowering people is the key. Relationships are crucial: get people to come together, define their position and work from there. Don’t begin with a pure ideological solution. Take account of all viewpoints.”  The centrist approach extends to He says he’s “mindful of the drift in recent years of some Labor supporters to the Greens party” but says “Labor will not win those people back by out-Greening the Greens.” Instead he insists the electorate will back “bold ideas”, citing as an example the National Disability Insurance Scheme which he successfully advocated as a junior minister. “The lesson I take from my involvement in the creation of the NDIS is that substantial policy trumps spin every time and great policy tops personality. In this era of media fragmentation and the 24/7 news cycle, advocating big and complex ideas is more difficult – and yet more rewarding – than ever before. Voters will reward a political party that takes them into its trust by arguing the case for practical, achievable, worthwhile change. The NDIS was a relatively expensive, complicated policy. Its realisation shows that people are willing to back bold new ideas if the case is made properly.  Much of the book is an exposition of Labor’s policies and beliefs but it contains snippets of information including:  • A fairly blunt assessment of his father, Bill snr, who died of a heart attack in 2000: “Mum always said Dad was an intelligent man ... He was street smart and possessed good people skills, but ended up taking refuge in the drink like many men of his generation. Looking back, Dad was probably depressed, but they didn’t have counselling then. When I was 10, the same age he was when his father died, Dad suffered a heart attack. It hurt seeing that. No child should ever have to see their father so vulnerable at that age. Yet it changed him. He stopped drinking as much, which was welcome, although he developed a shorter fuse. Why? I suppose it shocked him – he was only 47 – but maybe he was experiencing pain, too. He’d smoked a lot and drunk a lot, to the point that his health was less than wonderful. If you watch old cop shows from the 1970s and see the blokes with big fat ties and the cigarette ash spilling down their jackets, that’s the world my Dad inhabited. This time left an indelible mark upon me. Dad would take my brother and me to the football to see the Swans on Saturdays. He’d be dressed in his big woollen overcoat, park us in the grandstand, and go off to meet his mates and drink beer. I guess for him it was an escape of sorts. It was this lifestyle that contributed to his premature death ... Dad was an old-fashioned father – he grew up during the Depression after all. I can’t pretend there wasn’t conflict at home. Dad was never physically violent towards Mum, but there were plenty of arguments and, looking back, I can see that a permanent undercurrent of tension persisted in our home life. I don’t want other children to experience that in their formative years. • That Shorten once considered becoming a social worker: “It had taken me a while as a kid to work out what I wanted to do. The Jesuits placed an emphasis on community involvement and so I did volunteer work when I was at school. Visiting the kids at St Paul’s School for the Blind and yarning with pensioners on a Friday afternoon was rewarding, so much so that I considered a career as a social worker. I’d also thought about following Dad and going to sea. I toyed with the idea of joining the armed forces and so enlisted with the Army Reserve. I clearly saw appeal in joining an institution that gave meaning and purpose to so many people. In the end, I settled on the law.”  • That he likes German works councils - bodies where employees participate in, or are informed of management decisions: “During my time at the AWU I grew to admire works councils, the committees that can be formed to represent all employees at an enterprise. In Germany, the works council model is mandated by law and is especially popular. It has been an important factor in making that nation’s economy dynamic, strong and efficient. It is supported by both sides of politics, along with codetermination, whereby employees are allowed to play a role in the management of the companies they work for, especially large organisations.”  • That if elected, his first overseas visit will be to the Asia–Pacific. “Papua New Guinea and East Timor will be my earliest ports of call.”  • That defence policy would also have a regional focus: “The priorities of our defence policy should be an enhanced ADF regional presence, increased multinational military exercises, high-profile humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts to assist neighbours in distress, and the Pacific Maritime Security Program, which would build on the success of Kim Beazley’s Pacific Patrol Boats Program.”  • That a Labor government would successfully introduce an ETS this time because it was now seen as a “blue-collar” issue: “I’m convinced that Labor will be able to introduce, implement and bed down an emissions trading scheme when it takes office. That’s because Labor sees climate change action as part of a comprehensive set of policies aimed at renewing and modernising the Australian economy and its workforce. Concern over dealing with climate change is not confined to an inner city, white-collar elite: it is a blue-collar issue too. Australians should not be tricked by threats of ‘they will take away your job’. Australians are not daunted by the future.”  • That he is prepared to reject the “dole bludger’ meme: “No one condones the small minority who cheat or bend the rules. Yet it is dishonest and lazy to attack the straw man of a bloated welfare system. Indeed, the word ‘welfare’ itself is used pejoratively in many parts of our media, and by the Coalition government, as a code word for sloth and waste and undeserved income. This is disappointing not because of the cheap, chest-beating rhetoric masquerading as government policy, or the bullying of people who are often doing it tough— it’s that the facts tell a very different tale. Australia already has one of the best-targeted systems of social investment in the world. While there is always room for improvement in the way assistance is targeted, it is important to note that Australia spends less on welfare than almost every other advanced country and our system works reasonably well. When those who earn more in a week than people with disabilities or the unemployed or carers will earn in an entire year rail against welfare, it’s hard to take them seriously.”"
"Carbon pricing is “too sluggish a weapon” against climate change, top UK envoy Sir David King said on Monday. Speaking at a sustainability event in London, Sir David argued innovation to bring down the cost of clean technology would bring swifter results.  “I don’t think it [carbon pricing] is a fast enough driver for change,” he told Climate Home on the sidelines. “It needs to go hand in hand with other regulatory systems.” His stance contrasts with the priorities of neighbouring France and indeed the UK government’s line within the EU. Last week, France was among six countries calling for an expansion of carbon pricing to cover half the world’s emissions by 2030. President Francois Hollande promised to make France a “role model”, charting a path to a price of €100 a tonne. On the EU market, permits trade at €5/t. The World Bank and IMF champion emissions trading or taxes as the main lever to cut emissions, supported by many large corporations. Yet Sir David said these mechanisms were unlikely to take effect early enough to hold warming to 2C or 1.5C – the international goal agreed in Paris last December. “I don’t see India, China or South Africa coming in with a sufficiently high carbon price to drive them off coal,” he said. Instead, he called for efforts to make clean technology cheap enough to compete with traditional energy sources. Sir David was one of the architects of Mission Innovation, a commitment by 20 governments to double research funding to $20 billion within five years. “The point of Mission Innovation is to make sure we have all the technology we need to move away from a fossil fuelled economy,” he said. “Once you get to the point where the prices are competitive, you no longer really need a carbon price.” Renewables development is “self-accelerating”, as increased demand brings prices down, which encourages further take-up. Within the EU, Britain pushed the rollout of emissions trading a decade ago. Sir David said that had helped bring reluctant member states on board with the climate agenda. He hinted at disagreement with UK lobbying to limit alternative climate policies that might interfere with the market price signal, however. Asked about the UK position, he said: “There is a tension between those who see the free market as the overall objective and those who see the need to reduce CO2 emissions quickly.”"

" It is hard to imagine a less hospitable niche for a startup to enter than gasoline – a combustible commodity that is (one hopes) being innovated into obsolescence.  And yet, over the past 18 months, at least six startups have launched some variation on the theme of “Uber for gas” – your car’s tank gets refilled while it is parked somewhere.   The gas delivery startup founders all share similar stories of discovering the wannabe entrepreneur’s holy grail: a point of friction that can be translated into an app.  “David, one of the co-founders, basically said, ‘I hate going to the gas station’,” said Nick Alexander, the other co-founder of Yoshi, of their company’s origins. “I think he had run out of gas recently, so he said, ‘What about an idea where someone comes and fills your car up?’”  For Ale Donzis, co-founder of WeFuel, the moment came when he was trying to get gas in the middle of winter in upstate New York and realized he had forgotten his gloves. For Frank Mycroft, founder and CEO of Booster Fuels, it was during his wife’s pregnancy when he started refueling her car as well as his own.   “It wore on me,” Mycroft said. “I didn’t like doing it.”  The tales of gas station woe are the kind of first-world problems that have inspired a thousand parodies of startup culture. (A customer testimonial on the website of Purple, another gas delivery service, reads: “I live across the street from a gas station, but I don’t always have time to make the stop.”)  But delivering large quantities of a toxic and flammable liquid is significantly more complicated – and regulated – than delivering sandwiches. The companies generally source their gasoline from the same distributors that supply 10,000-gallon tankers to retail gas stations. But the app companies put the fuel into the back of pickup trucks or specially designed mini-tankers. Booster Fuels only services cars in open air, corporate parking lots on private property, but other companies offer to refill your car wherever it’s parked.  And while ignoring outdated regulations is practically a virtue in this age of disruptive innovation, there are good reasons for the careful control of gasoline.  “Some of the [companies] are using 1,000-gallon tanks,” warned Greg Andersen, division chief of the California office of the state fire marshall. “If they’re going into the basement parking lot of a high rise, that actually is a large concern.”  Several of the startups treat their regulatory compliance as a selling point.  “You’re supposed to have a fire extinguisher,” said Chris Aubuchon, co-founder of Filld. “We have two.”  Yoshi’s Alexander said, “We’re using DOT-certified equipment. … We’ve had our trucks inspected by multiple parties, including the highway patrol.”  But it’s not clear that Filld and Yoshi actually are in compliance with the law.  Both companies offer their service in San Francisco, where Lt Jonathan Baxter of the fire department says mobile fuel delivery is not currently permitted. He added that none of the companies have even sought permits.  “We are not saying that we are not ever going to permit this,” he said. “We are saying that we are working with other state agencies to figure out what is going to be best.”  In the meantime, Baxter is asking members of the public to report any fuel delivery trucks they observe to the department for inspection, corrective measures and possible violations.  Filld CEO Aubuchon responded to Baxter’s remarks in a statement, saying: “We have carefully studied the legal requirements, operate within them, and serve our customers in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”  Yoshi co-founder David Gobaud also rejected the fire department’s assertion.  “Under the law we don’t actually need a permit,” he said by email, explaining that only companies who use tank vehicles or tank cars are required to obtain permits.  Andersan suggests that the companies currently operating in California are exploiting a “grey area” in the fire code. There are regulations that allow for mobile fueling with diesel, but the code is silent on gasoline, presumably because no one was offering the service before last year.  “You can read the intent and say, ‘Look at all the things you have to do for diesel fuel. Are we assuming that you have to do nothing for gasoline?’ That doesn’t make sense,” he said.  But whether or not the companies’ practices are safe and legitimate, it’s hard not to wonder at founders and investors pouring their resources into an area that so many other tech companies are trying to innovate out of existence.  “I call these ‘bridge startups’, and I shy away from them because you spend the same amount of effort innovating in a dying market as you do in a growing one,” said Jason Calcanis, a prominent tech angel investor and entrepreneur. “On-demand valet services, gas delivery and even car ownership itself will get demolished by the one-two punch of Uber and Tesla.”  Calcanis is an investor in Uber and a proud owner of two Teslas, so he has biases. But it’s hard not to think that the best and the brightest should be focusing their energies on non-carbon-emitting solutions to society’s transportation needs.  Of course, while we wait for the invention that will avert climate collapse without requiring too much sacrifice on our parts, there is still plenty of money to be made in gasoline.  “Fossil fuels have a long runway,” WeFuel’s Donzis said.  “Today’s cars are going to be around for the next 15 to 20 years, so I don’t see our business going away, even though I welcome that change,” Filld’s Aubuchon said.  At least one of the startups is also focused on a more “longterm, grandiose vision,” one that’s about more than squeezing the final dollar out of the fossil fuel economy.  Alexander, co-founder of Yoshi, argued that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are actually cheaper and more environmental than electric cars. There’s little market for the cars right now, however, because there’s no distribution network for hydrogen fuel.  “The problem is that the cost to retrofit all the gas stations to hydrogen would be tens of billions of dollars,” he said. A successful mobile fuel delivery service could change all that.  “Almost everything that we solve right now – the trucks, the app, the customer stuff – all that stuff is independent of what we’re carrying,” Alexander said. “We could have hydrogen trucks on the road tomorrow.”"
"Peabody Energy, the world’s largest private sector coal company (now bankrupt), recently faced off against environmental groups in a Minnesota court case. The case was to determine whether the State of Minnesota should continue using its exceptionally low established estimates of the ‘social cost of carbon’, or whether it should adopt higher federal estimates.  The social cost of carbon is an estimate of how much the damages from carbon pollution cost society via climate change damages. In theory, it represents how much the price of fossil fuels should increase to reflect their true costs.  The coal company called forth witnesses that represented the fringe 2–3% of experts who reject the consensus that humans are the primary cause of global warming, including Roy Spencer and Richard Lindzen, while their opposition invited witnesses like Andrew Dessler and John Abraham who represent the 97% expert consensus.  John Abraham previously summarized the proceedings and ruling in favor of the higher carbon cost estimates, but it’s worth delving into some of the details of the climate science and economics arguments to see why the judge ruled against the coal company and its contrarian witnesses. The losing case from the coal company witnesses (rebutted by John Abraham here and here) can be summarized as follows: In between these primary arguments, Peabody coal’s witnesses made a variety of false and/or conspiratorial statements, dredging up numerous long-debunked climate myths. Much of the coal witnesses’ testimony focused on recent global temperatures. The testimony was written before 2015 shattered the previous global temperature record, which had been set just a year earlier, and now 2016 is on pace to break the record once again. This record-breaking new reality invalidates much of their testimony, but much of it was inaccurate to begin with. For example, at one point Roy Spencer claimed: we now stand at 18 years without warming in the real climate system. This statement is unequivocally false. Over the past 18 years the surface has warmed, the atmosphere has warmed, the oceans have warmed, ice has melted, sea levels have risen, and so on. Even Spencer’s own satellite data showed that the atmosphere had most likely warmed over the cherry-picked 18-year period in question. Anyone can easily check the warming trends with this useful tool. Spencer also presented a number of graphs comparing observed and modeled temperature data – graphs that have never been subjected to peer-review. These graphs were intended to dispute the accuracy of climate models, but the reality is that these models have proven their reliability and accuracy, as I show in my book Climatology versus Pseudoscience. NASA GISS Director Gavin Schmidt recently detailed the problems with these “misleading” graphs. Spencer and Lindzen both claimed that a growing body of research suggests the climate is much less sensitive to the increasing greenhouse effect than the IPCC report concluded. This is a clear-cut case of cherry picking, as is evident simply by understanding that the IPCC report takes all research into consideration, including studies with relatively low (and high) climate sensitivity estimates. While some recent studies have suggested a relatively low climate sensitivity, those studies have generally not withstood scientific scrutiny or the test of time, and other recent studies have suggested a relatively high climate sensitivity. The latter were completely ignored by the coal witnesses. To argue for a low sensitivity, Lindzen even went as far as to reference a paper he published in 2001 hypothesizing that clouds will act to slow global warming. Within a year, four separate studies had found errors in the hypothesis and/or identified contradictory evidence. Again, the hypothesis simply hasn’t withstood scientific scrutiny or the test of time. Ultimately Lindzen admitted that the coal company case relied upon trusting the 3% of fringe contrarian scientists and ignoring the expert consensus as summarized in the IPCC report: All of this [opposition] testimony is flawed to the extent it simply relies on … predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change … today the best evidence indicates that … a much lower climate sensitivity value of 1°C or 1.5°C is correct In other words, trust these outlier scientists’ judgment about what evidence is “best” and ignore the expert consensus. The judge did not find this argument compelling. Incredibly, the coal company actually made the case that carbon pollution is so terrific, we should be subsidizing it: Because the initial impacts of climate change are positive, due to carbon dioxide fertilization, reduced winter heating, and few cold-related deaths, the social cost of carbon is negative for the highest discount rates, that is, carbon dioxide emissions should be subsidized rather than taxed. This testimony came from the same economist wrote the following in showing that further global warming will hurt the economy: Most countries benefitted from climate change until 1980, but after that the trend is negative for poor countries and positive for rich countries. The global average impact was positive in the 20th century. In the 21st century, impacts turn negative in most countries, rich and poor. In short, carbon generally ‘fertilizes’ plants, which is good, but carbon pollution also causes climate change, which leads to more extreme weather like heat waves and droughts, which are not so good for crops or most species in general. We’re already well beyond the point where the costs are outweighing the benefits. Lindzen’s testimony in particular included numerous long-debunked climate myths, for example denying that the increase in atmospheric carbon is wholly due to human activities. It also included conspiratorial thinking with regards to the global temperature record: it is highly suspicious that “adjustments” almost invariably produce results that favor advocates of a certain camp … Under these circumstances, the recent attempt by Karl et al (2015) to adjust data so as to eliminate the so-called ‘pause’ of the last 18 years is suspect ab initio. The coal testimony thus checked off each of the 5 telltale signs of science denial: Ultimately, the judge was able to see the difference between science and denial, concluding: The Administrative Law Judge concludes that Peabody Energy has failed to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that climate change is not occurring or, to the extent climate change is occurring, the warming and increased CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere are beneficial. On nearly every key point the judge ruled that the “preponderance of evidence” was on the side of the environmental groups and not the coal company, and recommended that the State of Minnesota use the federal social cost of carbon estimates. Coal’s climate contrarians took their best shot at climate science, and they lost."
"Modelling hailed by the Liberal party as proof its Direct Action plan could meet Australia’s long-term climate promises in fact assumes the Coalition would turn its policy into a type of emissions trading scheme, according to the authors. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, released the modelling, by the Energetics consulting firm, just days before the election was called and told the Australian newspaper it was proof that critics of the government’s policy – who say it has no hope of reaching Australia’s target without changes – were totally wrong.  Malcolm Turnbull and Hunt are now campaigning against Labor’s plan for an emissions trading scheme, saying it is a “massive carbon tax” that will force huge rises in household electricity prices, while claiming their own policy can meet its 2030 target with no such impost. The Energetics modelling found that the government’s emissions reduction fund and so-called “safeguards mechanism” could achieve around half the emissions reductions required between 2020 and 2030 to reach the government’s target of cutting emissions by 26% to 28%, around 500m tonnes. But Peter Holt, associate at Energetics, told Guardian Australia that the policies would only achieve those reductions with changes – either large funding top-ups to the ERF (estimated by others at at least $6bn) or a strengthening of the safeguards mechanism so it turned into a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme. The economist Danny Price – who has advised the government on Direct Action – agrees with Holt’s assessment that despite the government’s scare campaign against Labor’s ETS, it is going to have to introduce a similar version of emissions trading itself to meet its international pledges. Holt said the modelling was “bottom up” – looking at what sectors had the potential to deliver emissions reductions and then allocating those reductions to the policies that could conceivably achieve them. But the estimated reductions from the ERF and the safeguards mechanism “relied on the assumption that the policies would be adjusted to achieve that outcome”. “To achieve the government’s target we would need to see the safeguards mechanism coming into play, either with declining ‘baselines’ that put more stringent conditions on large emitters, so it formed a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme, or else we would need to see a lot more money put into the emissions reduction fund, or a combination of the two,” Holt said. That means the modelling confirms exactly what Malcolm Turnbull said of Direct Action when he told Lateline in 2011: “If you want to ... cut carbon emissions ... in a very substantial way to the levels that the scientists are telling us we need to do by mid-century to avoid dangerous climate change, then a direct action policy where ... industry was able to freely pollute, if you like, and the government was just spending more and more taxpayers’ money to offset it, that would become a very expensive charge on the budget in the years ahead.”  The Climate Institute thinktank also said the “turbo-charging” assumed in the Energetics modelling would require “at least another $6bn” tipped into the emissions reduction fund, through which the government buys emissions reductions, or stronger safeguards to introduce a form of emissions trading for industry and electricity generators by tightening emissions “baselines” and forcing companies who exceeded them to buy permits. “This modelling is chock full of heroic assumptions that the government is hoping it won’t be asked about in detail during the election campaign,” said the Climate Institute’s chief executive, John Connor.  “They include the need for either billions of extra dollars or some form of emissions trading scheme, which sends a penalty or price signal to companies.” Price – whom the government recently appointed to the Climate Change Authority and who acted as an adviser on Direct Action – has also said the Coalition was likely to be forced to move to a form of emissions trading scheme similar to the one now proposed by Labor for the electricity industry. “The government’s Direct Action plan – its safeguard mechanism – could be modified to create exactly this same type of scheme,” he said. “I’ve always thought that was the most likely way for them to go after the review they have scheduled for 2017, because they are obviously going to have to make changes to meet even their existing targets and this is a low-cost way to do it. Under Direct Action the “safeguards mechanism” is supposed to ensure that increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government’s $2.5bn scheme, by setting baselines for their emissions. At the moment the baselines are lenient, ensuring industries don’t “go rogue” but not seeking to force them to reduce their greenhouse emissions from existing levels. But many observers, including business groups, expect they will have to be tightened after 2017 to gradually reduce industrial emissions. And that would turn Direct Action into much the same scheme as Labor is proposing. The government has already spent 67% of its $2.5bn ERF to achieve only 7% of the emission reductions it needs to meet its Paris target. It did not allocate any more money to the scheme in the budget. In its report, Energetics found that land use and energy efficiency could contribute significant emissions reductions by 2030. “Energetics’ analysis found that improved land management and low emissions farming practices and low carbon transport are capable of contributing the most to Australia’s total low-cost abatement by 2030. In total the two groups account for just over 50% of Australia’s total identified abatement potential,” the report said. “The remaining abatement opportunities were allocated to the ERF and safeguard mechanism ... ERF projects could help to reduce emissions at safeguard facilities; and safeguard facilities can purchase [carbon credits] to offset their emissions and help them to meet their safeguard obligations.”"

"A little-noticed part of Labor’s climate policy could push up retail power prices by between 8% and 25%, economist Danny Price has claimed, with price hikes in Victoria exceeding the impact of the former Labor government’s carbon tax. Price, who helped devise the Coalition’s climate policy, told Guardian Australia last week the main plank of Labor’s policy – a new style electricity emissions trading scheme – was exactly what he designed for Malcolm Turnbull in 2009 and mirrored what the Coalition’s Direct Action plan would almost certainly have to become to meet Australia’s greenhouse targets. He said the price rises under that scheme would be “minimal” for many years.  But Price has now modelled a second plank of Labor’s policy – a scheme under which big brown-coal generators, near the end of their operational life, would submit bids for how much money they would need to receive to shut straight away and deal with the community and employment fallout. The cost of the winning bid would be paid for by all the other generators in the market, who would enjoy higher prices because of their competitor’s closure. The academics who first proposed the idea, Frank Jotzo and Salim Mazouz, estimated it could cause a one-off rise of between 1% and 2% in retail power bills, while recent modelling by analysis company Reputex found the impact could be even lower – between 0.2% and 1.3% – or that perhaps there would be no price rise at all. “For residential electricity bills, falling network costs may completely offset any cost impact of the new policy, with retail energy prices expected to fall out to 2020,” said Bret Harper, associate director of research at Reputex. “The closure of a large coal generator is likely to have a negligible impact on residential electricity bills.” But according to Price, in a brief to clients of his firm Frontier Economics, that did not “ring true” and he modelled the example of Hazelwood, a brown coal-fired power station that produces over 20% of Victoria’s electricity and produces 3% of Australia’s greenhouse emissions, suddenly closing down under the scheme in July 2017. He found this could cause a short term price shock adding up to 25% to retail prices in Victoria, falling to between 14% and 15% in a few years as investments in other energy sources came on line. In New South Wales and South Australia, connected with Victoria in the east coast electricity market, the retail price increases would be an initial 13% or 14% falling to 8% or 9% over time, he said. Despite Price’s praise for sections of his policy, Labor’s climate spokesman Mark Butler said Price “helped Tony Abbott write his Direct Action policy” and “regularly rails against our policies to expand renewable energy, so I’m not surprised that he is again campaigning against our Climate Change Action Plan”. “Labor has responded to overwhelming calls in the electricity industry for government to adopt an orderly framework around the transition from Australia’s heavy reliance on coal fired power to modern, clean energy. Mr Price’s opinion is directly at odds with modelling from the ANU and energy analysis firm, Reputex. That modelling supports electricity industry projections that average household power bills will decline in real terms over the period to 2020,” Butler said. Jotzo, an associate professor at the Crawford School of public policy, and Mazouz, a principal at the Centre for International Economics consultancy, responded to the substance of Price’s claims. “The key point is that without effective carbon pricing, an exit mechanism of some form is needed for an orderly transition from old coal-fired power stations to renewables. There is a broad consensus about this in the policy community and in industry. Danny Price attacks our proposal for how this could be achieved but does not offer any solutions,” they said. Jotzo pointed out that their plan included “a safety valve in case the costs turn out unacceptably high. As we state in our paper, government would not need to go ahead with the closure scheme if the bids in the reverse auction were judged too high. And as Frontier point out, high expected price impacts would be visible through high payments demanded for exit, so the government would know what to expect.” And Mazouz said the Frontier modelling “assumes that the market is taken by surprise by the sudden retirement of an entire plant”. “This would not be so. The market would know the schedule for plant retirement, and indeed a plant could be phased out gradually by retiring the several units that a power station consists of one at a time. Our proposal is all about orderly transition, and any policy mechanism can be designed to be gradual and fully predictable,” he said. Price last week said “the emissions intensity part of Labor’s plan appears to be exactly what we were proposing for Malcolm Turnbull and Nick Xenophon in 2009”. Price modelled the scheme for Turnbull and Xenophon when Turnbull was the opposition leader and considering his response to the then Labor government’s cap and trade ETS. Turnbull lauded it as a “cheaper, greener, smarter scheme” and said it could deliver deeper cuts to greenhouse emissions but impose far lower increases in electricity prices. But the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, dismissed it as a “magic pudding”.  Price said the new Labor policy was “a bit light on detail but it looks pretty much the same [as the Turnbull 2009 plan]. Malcolm Turnbull thought it was a good idea then. I’m delighted the Labor party is proposing it now.” Price – who the government recently appointed to the Climate Change Authority and who acted as an adviser on Direct Action – said the Coalition would probably have to move to a similar scheme itself in order to meet its own emissions reduction targets. “The government’s Direct Action plan – its safeguard mechanism – could be modified to create exactly this same type of scheme,” he said. “I’ve always thought that was the most likely way for them to go after the review they have scheduled for 2017, because they are obviously going to have to make changes to meet even their existing targets and this is a low-cost way to do it. “It is actually emerging as an idea with the potential to be adopted by both major parties.” Under Direct Action the “safeguards mechanism” is supposed to ensure increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government’s $2.5bn scheme, by setting baselines for their emissions. At the moment the baselines are lenient, ensuring industries don’t “go rogue” but not seeking to reduce their greenhouse emissions. But many observers, including business groups, expect they will have to be tightened after 2017 to gradually reduce industrial emissions. And that would turn Direct Action into much the same scheme as Labor is proposing."

"As presidential nominees Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, respectively, call climate change a “religion” or a “bullshit … total hoax” dreamed up by China, it is deeply unfashionable for any Republican to take the issue seriously, let alone push for radical reforms to remedy it. Kevin Faulconer, the mayor of San Diego, could therefore qualify as one of the most outlandish, as well as green-tinged, Republicans in the US. Faulconer has thrown his weight behind a binding plan to make San Diego run on 100% renewable power by 2035 – the largest American city to have such an ambition.  Faulconer is as much a product of his largely liberal surrounds as he is of his party, of course. The 49-year-old mayor will march for LGBT pride and supports a path to US citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But San Diego’s bipartisan push to embrace clean energy such as solar and wind, while radically paring back greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, is a glimpse into how the rancorous brawls over climate change could have been avoided across the rest of the US. “This isn’t a partisan issue,” Faulconer told the Guardian. “I’ve said from the very beginning there’s enough partisan politics at the national level. I was a volunteer for our parks before becoming mayor; I love our natural resources, our beaches and landscapes. I feel strongly about protecting them.” While Republicans, including Florida senator Marco Rubio, have warned any action to cut emissions will raise power bills and lead to economic ruin, Faulconer has sold a vision of low-carbon innovation, jobs and clean air. San Diego’s business community is now on board, although Faulconer admitted it took “a lot of persuasion”. “I pride myself on being fiscally responsible and environmentally conscious,” he said. “The two aren’t exclusive. I’ve never seen it as a zero sum game. We want a plan that is ambitious and leads the way for the rest of the country.” A plan endorsed unanimously by San Diego’s Democrat-dominated council in December would see America’s eighth largest city transformed into one riddled by bicycles and public transport, with roofs swathed in solar panels. The city will switch half its fleet of vehicles to electric power, and almost all the methane from sewage and water treatment will be recycled. A key selling point for the plan is the resulting jobs and investment in clean energy – San Diego ranks second in the US in electrical output from solar energy, and the city is openly courting clean tech firms to set up shop there. It already derives 40% of its power from clean sources. But public concern about climate change is also a key driver. “People have seen and felt the drought, the wildfires, the flooding,” said Nicole Capretz, who wrote the first iteration of the climate plan before the controversial exit of previous mayor Bob Filner. “People were witnessing a lot of things in their backyard. When you see your quality of life is at risk, people start to wake up and say ‘it’s time.’” “The beautiful part about having a Republican mayor embrace this plan,” she added, “is that he did outreach to his own friends and factions and persuaded them it was the right thing to do for economic reasons.” There remain hurdles for San Diego to clear. An implementation plan has yet to be finalized but much will rest upon an intervention into the electricity market. San Diego’s utility has said it cannot meet the 100% renewable goal itself, meaning that the city will have to branch out to source its power elsewhere while the utility retains control over poles and wires. “There’s a battle brewing on that,” Capretz admitted. “It’s the largest part of the climate plan – we can’t get to the goal without it.” On the plus side, the 2035 decarbonization plan is legally binding, unlike the aspirations of other large cities. And some measures should be straightforward to achieve, such as an initiative to increase San Diego’s tree canopy cover to 35%, which would soak up carbon and help cool the city with more shade.  Improvements to train and bike infrastructure should also prove popular, but a price tag has yet to be put on this. It’s likely that help from Californian or federal coffers will be required. Regardless of whether the target is met, San Diego is among a large group of cities impatient with federal government bickering over climate change. Municipalities from New York to San Francisco have goals to either majorly or completely switch to renewable energy, while Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, has spearheaded an international coalition of mayors that is looking to wean urban areas off fossil fuels. While a record number of nations have signed up to cut emissions, there is still a significant gap between their pledged action and what is required to avoid the worst ravages of climate change, such as drought, extreme weather events and sea level rise. Faulconer said this shortfall can be plugged, in part, by cities taking the lead. “Cities are leading the federal government, yes,” he said. “They are leading on innovation and policy. The technology is advancing incredibly quickly. We need to have our eyes wide open on this.”"

"The Paris climate agreement, already signed by more than 175 countries, was successful in large part because national governments recognized cities’ progress in reducing carbon emissions. On Thursday, as world leaders gather in Washington DC to discuss how to reach the goals set in Paris, they should focus on helping cities do even more, and act faster, to reduce those emissions. Cities account for most of the world’s carbon emissions, and their share will continue to increase as cities increase in size. Today more than half of the world lives in cities, and by 2050, two-thirds will. Every day, the world’s cities grow by about 60 square kilometers – an area equal to New York City’s borough of Manhattan. How that growth takes shape in the next few years will determine whether we can avoid the worst impacts of climate change, and it will also have major economic and public health implications. Cities planned around affordable mass transit expand economic opportunity while cleaning the air we breathe. Smart buildings and land use save energy and protect people from extreme weather events, helping cities avoid enormous potential costs. National governments can do a lot to help cities accelerate this work, and that’s a key goal of the Coalition for Urban Transitions, a new initiative from the New Climate Economy launched at the Climate Action Summit in Washington DC. The coalition, made up of global financial and business leaders, thinktanks, city officials and urban planning experts, will help achieve the Paris climate goals by making cities a focus of national economic planning, improving city access to financing for low-carbon infrastructure and making the economic case for climate friendly urban growth, particularly in developing countries. To us, the case is clear. Actions to reduce carbon emissions in urban areas are expected to be a $17tn global economic opportunity by 2050 based on energy savings alone. Those efforts will save lives, because air pollution contributes to more than 10,000 premature deaths each day. Mass transit can help reduce traffic accidents, and also increase economic activity by reducing congestion. And pedestrianizing key areas – such as the river banks in Paris in the summer – can improve quality of life for urban dwellers. But in order for cities to take these steps, national governments must empower them. For instance, outdated national laws prevent many cities from utilizing local tax revenues or borrowing money on their own. That’s a reason why only 4% of the 500 largest cities in developing countries are rated creditworthy by international financial markets. Recently, the city of Lima, Peru, worked with international banks to get a credit rating, which enabled it to issue bonds to invest in low-carbon mass transit. More cities need to be able to take steps like these. Mayors usually have some degree of control over the biggest sources of emissions, and can often act on their own to reduce those emissions, without the political and bureaucratic hurdles that national governments face. Those that don’t ought to be given such authority. A new analysis by the Compact of Mayors shows that cities with control over building rules are 30% more likely to take steps to make buildings more energy efficient than those without such control. In many cities, buildings are the single largest source of carbon emissions, so these actions can make a very big difference on a global scale. National governments can also help cities by removing national fossil fuel subsidies that undermine incentives for public transit and clean energy. And they can help broaden the growing networks of cities that are working together to fight climate change. Through the Compact of Mayors, more than 490 cities have committed to reducing emissions and publicly reporting their progress. These include our home cities of New York, Rio de Janeiro and Paris, along with London, Tokyo, Mexico City, Jakarta and myriad others. And through the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, 83 of the world’s largest cities are sharing best practices, which further accelerates progress. Stronger cities are in every nation’s best interest – they account for 85% of global GDP, and they are engines of technological process and policy innovation. Many national governments recognize this and are already taking steps to better integrate cities into national economic planning. China’s central government released a National Plan for New Urbanization 2014-2020, which provides support to help cities grow sustainably. India’s national government launched its 100 Smart Cities initiative as part of a larger effort to help improve lives in its growing cities. And about one quarter of all African countries have national urban development strategies. Still, much more needs to be done, and the clock is ticking. By giving cities the power to act, and putting them at the center of national economic strategies, we can protect our planet while building a better future for the increasing number of people who call cities home."
"The government has now spent two-thirds of its emissions reduction fund but has only achieved 7% of the emissions cuts it would need to reach its 2030 target, according to analysts. Today the Clean Energy Regulator announced the results of its third Emissions Reduction Fund auction, the centrepiece of government climate policy by which it pays polluters to pollute less. In the auction, it bought 50.5m tonnes of carbon abatement for an average of $10.23 per tonne – a drop from $13.50 it paid in its first auction in April 2015.  “Our objective is simply to purchase as much abatement as we can with the funds available. All three auctions have exceeded our expectations in this regard,” said the chair of the Clean Energy Regulator, Chloe Munro. Between the three auctions, 67% of the money has now been spent, leaving $816m left.  “This is an outstanding result,” the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said. “The policy is not just working and reducing emissions, but we are hitting our targets and tackling climate change without Labor’s electricity tax.” To reach the government’s 2020 target of 5% below 2000 levels, the government would not need to cut domestic emissions. Instead it would rely on accounting rules for “carry-over” from an earlier period and international carbon credits. It estimated that avoiding just 186m tonnes by 2020 would be enough, leaving just another 43m tonne for the ERF after today. But to meet its 2030 targets agreed to in Paris, which are 26 to 28% below 2005 levels, the Climate Institute estimated the three auctions amount to only 7% of the task. But the 2030 targets themselves aren’t enough to keep the world under 2C. If Australia were to act on that objective, the auctions only account for 3% of the abatement needed by 2030, said the Climate Institute CEO, John Connor. In the latest auction, the vast majority of carbon reduction came from vegetation projects such as avoiding land clearing and revegetation schemes – they accounted for more than 93% of the carbon abatement bought in the auction. Recent analysis from the Wilderness Society showed that a land-clearing surge going on in parallel – particularly in Queensland – was completely undoing the ERF’s abatement work. That analysis came before the NSW government released a draft of its overhauled land-clearing laws, which aimed to cut red tape for farmers wishing to clear their land. “At the current rate of tree clearing, the entire 98.5m tonnes of abatement from tree projects bought in the latest ERF auction will be wiped out in just under two years,” said the Wilderness Society national director, Lyndon Schneiders. And Hugh Grossman, from energy analysis firm RepuTex, said national emissions were mostly rising as a result of the biggest industrial emitters, which weren’t engaging with the ERF. “In isolation, it is doing a really good job – it’s doing what it’s expected to do and purchasing abatement,” Grossman said. “But what we’re seeing is that national emission are growing in parallel, despite the ERF.” Munro said another auction was expected to be held before the end of the year, with details to be announced in the coming months."

"A growing list of major investors is backing calls on ExxonMobil to acknowledge climate risk, after its credit rating was downgraded on Tuesday. British insurer Aviva and Seattle’s public pension fund are among the latest to declare their support for a shareholder resolution to be considered at next month’s AGM. California’s CalPERS, New York City Pension Fund and the Church of England are also in favour. They are asking Exxon to analyse the impact of a 2C global warming limit on the value of its oil assets and publish the findings by 2017. Standard & Poors has stripped the world’s largest private oil company of the triple-A credit rating it had held since the Great Depression. The ratings agency cited Exxon’s pursuit of high cost ventures as part of the reason its debt levels have more than doubled in recent years. Scientists estimate at least a third of the world’s proven oil reserves and half of natural gas is unburnable under the 2C threshold. Previously, Exxon has insisted its assets will not be affected. Governments are “highly unlikely” to restrict emissions enough to meet the international 2C goal, it argued. The firm’s credibility has been dented by emerging evidence it misled the public about climate science, however. An investigation by Inside Climate News uncovered internal documents showing industry researchers were flagging the risks as early as the late 1960s. The latest to surface, a 1980 report by Exxon subsidiary Imperial Oil published by blog DeSmog on Tuesday, said: “It is assumed that the major contributors of CO2 are the burning of fossil fuels… “There is no doubt that increases in fossil fuel usage and decreases of forest cover are aggravating the potential problem of increased CO2 in the atmosphere.” Yet over the next few decades, Exxon mounted a PR campaign to undermine that scientific consensus. While Exxon has been singled out for a legal inquiry into these allegations, the shareholder resolution is part of a wider movement. Coalitions of investors have lodged similar requests with other oil and mining majors to assess their exposure to carbon risk. Rio Tinto, BP and Shell embraced the challenge, recommending shareholders vote in favour. Exxon has fought every step of the way, unsuccessfully appealing to regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, to strike the vote off the ballot. In one of the most closely contested votes to date, 42% of shareholders in US utility AES backed a 2C “stress test” last week. Investor activists are privately confident of getting at least 20% at the Exxon AGM in Dallas on 25 May. Shanna Cleveland of sustainable investor network Ceres wrote: “This proxy season, shareholder proposals on climate risk are being propelled by a powerful set of tailwinds: an historic climate accord, rapidly changing market forces, and unprecedented shareholder collaboration.”"
"Can Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP be held accountable for the vulnerable communities most affected by climate change? It’s a question a legal case in the Philippines could answer. Last month, lawyers for the petitioners met with the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHR), a constitutional body tasked with investigating human rights violations. Their goal was to identify expert witnesses for a hearing into the liability of 50 of the biggest fossil fuel companies for violating the human rights of Filipinos as a result of catastrophic climate change. This follows a petition filed on 22 September 2015 by Greenpeace and the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement on behalf of typhoon survivors, which called for the devastation of extreme weather-related disasters to be properly recognised: “The real-life pain and agony of losing loved ones, homes, farms – almost everything – during strong typhoons, droughts, and other weather extremes, as well as the everyday struggle to live, to be safe, and to be able to cope with the adverse, slow onset impacts of climate change, are beyond numbers and words.”  The hearing will consider whether companies’ policies and investments adequately address the human rights issues specified in the petition. The Philippines is among the countries most exposed to natural hazards in the world, with 130m Filipinos affected by weather-related disasters between 1995 and 2015. In 2013, for example, Typhoon Haiyan wreaked devastation, killing more than 6,300 people and causing billions of dollars worth of damage. It is widely acknowledged – including by the Filipino government’s Climate Change Commission – that climate change is exacerbating these problems. The decision to invite climate scientists as witnesses to the Philippines investigation is seen as a significant opportunity to demonstrate the links between climate change and extreme weather. “It’s encouraging because it shows that we managed to get the message out there that this branch of science [the attribution of extreme weather events to climate change] can robustly say things,” says Dr Friederike Otto, senior researcher at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute. A decade ago the field was dominated by generalised predictions about the frequency of events. Today, advancements in computer modelling mean that scientists can make quantitative assessments in real time. When Storm Desmond hit the UK in December, for example, researchers pronounced within days that climate change had increased the likelihood of the floods by 40%. But, despite progress in the scientific understanding of the connection between extreme weather events and climate change, the Filipino case still faces challenges. Jurisdiction is a major one. The CHR can only compel the seven major carbon companies that have branches in the Philippines – although this does include Shell, BHP Billiton and ExxonMobil – to defend their policies in writing and at public hearings. The 43 other companies will also be asked to attend. If they resist, the complainants have recommended that the CHR seeks the assistance of the UN to encourage them to co-operate. The jurisdictional issue touches on one of the central legal hurdles that those suffering from the impacts of climate change face in attempting to hold governments and corporations to account – does an actor operating in one country have legal responsibility towards those who may suffer the consequences in another? Lawyers face many other questions. Is it possible to hold any one corporation responsible for its relatively small contribution to a global crisis caused by many? Can anyone be held accountable for harm caused by emissions that go back to the industrial revolution? “The amorphous nature of climate change presents unique problems that courts are now being asked to rule upon,” says climate lawyer Gillian Lobo from ClientEarth, who cites cases including the claim of public nuisance brought by the Alaskan Village of Kivalina against 22 energy companies, and the Urgenda Foundation case, where the Dutch government was ordered to reduce its emissions by a minimum of 25% by 2020. “Judges are generally cautious when it comes to developing the law, but given the urgent need to tackle the harmful effects of climate change they must be willing to so,” says Lobo. When the investigation concludes, the Filipino government will be mandated to consider the recommendations of the CHR. Although the companies will not be legally bound to any changes to their policies and investments requested by the CHR unless they agree to be so early on in the process (the case is yet to reach this point), Zelda Soriano, the lawyer at Greenpeace acting on the case, says that the findings would hold weight with the courts and the CHR could recommend that specific cases be filed against corporations by victims.  “The world will be watching this investigation and how the carbon majors are responding and behaving,” says Soriano. “If there was a positive finding [against these companies] by the commission, it should move the shareholders and investors to think if it is worth investing in the carbon majors, not just on moral grounds but because the very social licence and the profitability of these corporations would also be in question … It will set a precedent.”"
"This week the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) will hold the third emissions reduction fund auction and farmers across Australia will move to the forefront of efforts to rescue a “clapped-out” country. Australian farmers have long bought and sold their wares at auction. Sale yards were the hub of country towns and the din of a moleskin-clad auctioneer shouting over the bleating and mooing of fattened livestock has long been a familiar rural backdrop.  But an overloaded agricultural system has depleted the land’s carbon content and its replenishment is vital in the face of climate change. “Farmers use the term ‘clapped-out paddock’ but we have clapped-out Australia,” says Louisa Kiely, director of Carbon Farmers of Australia. “Improving the land should be put on a war footing because food security is a real issue in the face of climate change.”  Similar to the carbon offset programme, carbon sequestration could be a viable solution, with farmers encouraged to store carbon dioxide (CO2) in soil and trees and prevent additional emissions from animal waste methane. And again, farmers take part in an auction, albeit a more sedate, less visible one, to make it profitable. The ins and outs of the fund take some navigation, however. At the auction, bidders undertake to store a set amount of carbon or not emit a set amount of CO2, within a fixed time period and for the lowest price they can profitably deliver carbon abatement. Each endeavour for landowners, whether it is storing carbon or cutting CO2 emissions, is classified as a project and the methods used to deliver their outcomes are set out by the regulator. For example, a farmer who undertakes to boost his soil’s carbon content by changing his grazing practices or by increasing organic compost has to nominate a specific method to achieve the improvement.  Provability is the lynchpin of the system and navigating the stringent demands of a contract can be challenging for landowners. Kiely has been campaigning for a farm-based carbon offsets industry for many years and Carbon Farmers of Australia prepares submissions on behalf of those bidding for contracts. Kiely says the criteria for registering and delivering a project makes the carbon credit system robust and transparent. “On the face of it, you are selling air. No one can see it, so you have to prove it. But I do think the soil-testing processes could be streamlined.” If you want adoption of carbon neutral farming, we should have a simple system. Farmers want to make the land better. Core samples of soil are taken from random spots on a carbon-farmer’s land before and after a project. They are tested for carbon content and payment is made if there is an improvement. Chloe Munro, the regulator’s chief executive, said the reporting criteria are demanding because carbon abatement processes and measuring results are so complex. “When we issue a credit we need assurance that there is genuine abatement,” Munro says. “There is a balance to be struck between maintaining the integrity of the system and the burden [of proof] on the farmer. It’s not foolproof, but we are vigilant.” There is considerable money to be made by those who take part. The $2.55bn fund pays a sum for each tonne stored or not emitted through the currency of ACCUs (Australian carbon credit unit). Each ACCU represents one tonne and is paid when contracts are delivered. The average price paid per tonne in the first auction in April 2015 was $13.95, which fell to $12.25 at the second auction in November. Unsurprisingly, all eyes are on the price to emerge from this week’s auction. There are 583 projects on the register and 275 of those are under contract, which collectively promise to deliver about 93m tonnes of carbon.  Munro says the past year has been positive, though some projects have been renegotiated because farmers underestimated the time it would take to deliver. She expects a wider range of participants in this week’s auction. David Bruer, co-founder of Temple Bruer vineyard in South Australia, runs a carbon neutral business. An ardent advocate for sustainable farming, Bruer says it is not good enough just to cut CO2 emissions and instead uses special growing methods to remove it from the atmosphere. He plants giant cane (arundo donax), a species that captures more CO2 than any other plant, near his vineyards. Watered with the highly saline winery wastewater and then used to nourish the soil with bio-char compost, it is an innovative process. Bruer says the regulator’s auction scheme is technically very complicated and would be “vastly assisted by a domestic price set on carbon dioxide”. “If you want widespread adoption of carbon neutral farming, we should have a simple system. I have a great deal of faith in Australian farmers and, by and large, they want to make the land better.” Kiely agrees, but insists that the incentives need to be meaningful. “Farmers have always been price-takers, not price-setters. It’s taking a while for the industry to come on board and you need a few leaders to set an example.  She tells of a contract-holder in Cobar, in western New South Wales, who announced to a gathering of local farmers that his first ACCU cheque was $1m. “That got them listening,” she says."
"Will 2015 be a watershed in the human effort to solve global problems, or just another chapter in the history of collective inaction?  The answer will soon become apparent on construction sites around the world.    The two most ambitious international agreements of 2015 – the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris climate accord – amount to a historic decision to build a world that reconciles improving human welfare with the reality of climate change.   The SDGs chart a path for eliminating poverty and securing a better life for all by 2030. The Paris accord seeks to stabilise global carbon emissions by the second half of the century, through a rapid move away from high-carbon energy, transport, housing and land use towards efficient, low carbon, climate-resilient alternatives.   But as nations set out to reflect these commitments in planning and budget processes, they face difficult choices: coal or renewables? Highways or public transport? Suburban sprawl or compact cities?  And the window for making such choices is narrow. Existing and projected carbon emissions show the urgency of implementing the Paris commitments. But infrastructure projects are time-consuming and long-lasting. Power plants, for example, take from five to 15 years to plan and build and can then last for half a century. And 70% of the forecast increase in emissions from developing countries is expected to come from infrastructure that has yet to be built.   This means that infrastructure decisions we make in the next few years could cement our ability to meet the Paris goals – or condemn us to a future in which global temperatures rise well above 2C. In the latter scenario, environmental conditions could be so hostile that development goes into reverse, leading to rising poverty and social conflict.   Unfortunately, infrastructure planning is largely disconnected from climate change agendas for many governments and the current economic downturn threatens to widen this disconnect.  For example, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the end of the commodities supercycle has brought a painful economic contraction. Citizens are clamouring for jobs, wage increases and long-delayed improvements to services ranging from transport to healthcare. In this context, can elected officials justify using scarce public resource to build low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure?  We believe the answer is a resounding yes. In the near-term, such spending can generate demand for labour and supplies, providing the stimulus that developing economies desperately need. In the longterm, it serves to simultaneously modernise and increase the efficiency of energy, manufacturing, mobility and logistics. This will in turn raise productivity and competitiveness, fostering domestic drivers of growth.  The convergence of these two needs creates an extraordinary opportunity to get things right. Many of the requirements for a radical expansion of sustainable infrastructure are already in place. The managers of trillions of dollars of capital and pension fund assets are looking for predictable returns. Interest rates remain at historic lows. Critical technologies, from large-scale solar to clean transport, are mature and continue to drop in cost.   What is missing, in many countries, are the policies, institutions and financial partners necessary to generate a pipeline of projects such as wind farms, bus-rapid-transit systems, or geothermal power plants.   Private banks and investors have little experience with these sectors in emerging markets and are hesitant to take the lead. Multilateral development banks (MDBs), on the other hand offer decades of experience in planning and executing complex infrastructure projects. They also have the credibility to serve as trusted brokers between governments, investors and civil society.   In Paris the six leading development banks (pdf) committed to expand their lending for climate-related projects. It’s a small fraction of what will be needed to meet the Paris commitments, but these funds could have a powerful exemplary effect, enticing other financial institutions to join in. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Brics New Development Bank (NDB) or the Latin American Development Bank (CAF), for example, are much more likely to co-finance complex infrastructure if they can work jointly with other MDBs.   By establishing a robust institutional structure of MDB-led lending, private capital could be mobilised on a scale that could mean countries meet their Paris commitments, while responding to the development needs of their people.   In the coming months this unprecedented opportunity will either be seized or squandered in the boardrooms of development banks. Borrowing governments must push smart infrastructure to the front of their project pipelines as their best route to sustainable development and poverty reduction. And donor nations, through their shareholdings, must do everything possible to facilitate financing for these projects.   If they do not, 2015 may be remembered solely for its good intentions.

"Water shortages will deliver a “severe hit” to the economies of the Middle East, central Asia, and Africa by the middle of the century, taking double digits off their GDP, the World Bank warned on Tuesday. By 2050, growing demand for cities and for agriculture would put water in short supply in regions where it is now plentiful – and worsen shortages across a vast swath of Africa and Asia, spurring conflict and migration, the bank said.  Water shortages could strip off 14% of GDP in the Middle East and nearly 12% of GDP in the Sahel – without a radical shift in management, according to the bank’s projections.  Central Asia could lose close to 11% of GDP and east Asia about 7% under business-as-usual water management policies, according to a new report. Taking into account all regions, the mid-range toll of water shortages on GDP was about 6%. “There is a severe hit on GDP,” said Richard Damania, lead environmental economist for the Bank and author of High and Dry: Climate Change, Water and the Economy. Governments have grown increasingly concerned about the threat to water supply because of a combination of climate change and increasing demand. Barack Obama invited business leaders to the White House last March for a business summit aimed at protecting California from the next drought – by mobilising investment in data and other technologies that would promote more efficient use of water. The biggest economic hit due to water deficits were expected to occur in the Middle East, north Africa, central Asia, and parts of south Asia, the report found. There would be virtually no impact on the economies of North America and western Europe.  Much of the world faces a hotter and drier future under climate change, according to scientists. Rainfall – including the monsoons that fortify agriculture in south Asia – will become more unpredictable. Storm surges could contaminate freshwater reservoirs. But there will also be pressure on water supply from rising populations – especially in cities – and increased demand from agriculture. “It turns out that economic growth is a thirsty business,” Damania said. Some cities could see water availability drop by two-thirds by 2050, the report found. Water shortages could have rebounding effects on food production, public health, and household incomes – with families forced to pay more for a basic necessity.  But, the report said, encouraging more efficient use of water could make a big difference in the mid-century economic scenarios for regions threatened by water shortages.  In some countries, about two-thirds of water is lost to old and leaky pipes.  Good water management policies would add more than 11% to the GDP of central Asian countries and blunt the impact of water shortages in the Middle East, the report found. "
"The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has sold off its entire holding in oil giant BP, in a move welcomed by fossil fuel divestment campaigners. Bill Gates has called the selling off of coal, oil and gas stocks a “false solution” to climate change, but the known investments of his foundation in major fossil fuel companies has fallen by 85% since 2014.  The foundation, which has spent many billions of dollars improving global health, sold its $187m stake in BP between September and December 2015, according to recent regulatory filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  It had previously dumped its entire $824m holding in ExxonMobil. BP posted a record $6.5bn annual loss in February while ExxonMobil is under investigation about whether it lied in the past to investors about the threat of climate change. The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign has called on the Gates foundation to divest its $40bn endowment from fossil fuels. Climate change poses the greatest threat to health in the 21st century, according to doctors, and to avoid catastrophic impacts, most known fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground. If the world’s governments succeed as promised and halt global warming, those reserves could become worthless, and divestment campaigners argue there are both financial and moral reasons for divestment. “We are thrilled that the Gates foundation continues to divest from fossil fuel stocks, but it’s time to divest the rest. Investing in oil companies is completely inconsistent with the Gates foundation mission to ensure that everybody has the chance to live a healthy, productive life,” said Alec Connon, an organiser for the Gates Divest campaign, a coalition of scores of social justice groups, politicians and faith leaders in Washington State, where the Foundation is based. Mike McGinn, who as mayor of Seattle in 2013 was the first mayor to commit a city to divestment, said: “They’re moving their financial capital - now it’s time to use their moral capital and publicly commit to divestment.  “By taking a public stand, Bill and Melinda Gates could help change the debate and speed up the international response to global warming.”    The Gates foundation does not comment on its investments. Public records show that at the start of 2014, the Foundation held $1.4bn of investments in major coal, oil and gas companies. The sell-off of its BP and ExxonMobil stocks leaves just $200m of those stocks.  It is unknown whether some or all of the remaining fossil fuel stocks have been sold, as the foundation only has to declare holdings of over $100m in US-related companies to the SEC. New fossil fuel investments may have been made below that threshold or in undeclared companies. An analysis in November found that the Gates foundation would have been $1.9bn better off if it had divested from fossil fuels in 2012. The world’s second biggest health charity after the Gates foundation is the UK-based Wellcome Trust and the Guardian’s campaign also asks it to divest. The trust lost an estimated £175m on its investments in fossil fuel companies in the year to August 2015, according to a Guardian analysis. But in December, it was revealed that Wellcome had defied divestment campaigners and increased its investments in coal, oil and gas over the year.  Investors managing over $3.4tn of assets have already committed to fossil fuel divestment, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest. The Bank of England has also warned of potentially huge losses."

"Public support for fracking in the UK has fallen to a new low, according to government polling, at the same time as backing for renewable energy has hit a record high. The survey, which is repeated every few months, shows that public enthusiasm for the controversial energy extraction method has fallen steadily in the past two years while opposition to it has risen dramatically. The government has consistently advocated shale gas as a future home grown energy source – no commercial fracking wells are currently operating in the UK – while at the same time cutting subsidies for solar and wind power. Just 19% of people back exploration for shale gas in the latest edition of the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s long-running public attitudes tracker, down from a high of 29% two years ago. The percentage against has risen to a new high of 31%, while the proportion neither for or against has remained largely stable, at 46%. The Decc polling, published on Thursday, showed a jump in support for renewable power to a new high of 81%, with only 4% opposing it. Backing for renewables has remained steadily high at 75-80% in recent years. The news follows a protest by actor and anti-fracking campaigner Emma Thompson who broke an injunction to film a mock Great British Bake-Off film with Greenpeace on shale gas explorer Cuadrilla’s site in Lancashire. The stunt prompted the farmer who owned the land to drive-by in his tractor spreading slurry close to the filming. The next big planning decision on fracking comes on 20 May, when North Yorkshire county council will decide whether to approve an application by Third Energy to frack at Kirby Misperton. Cuadrilla meanwhile is appealing against a rejection by Lancashire county council last summer. A Decc spokesman said: “These findings show that half of the people asked still don’t have a view on fracking, but more importantly that the vast majority (88%) said that they do not know a lot about it. This is exactly why we want people to have access to all the facts so they can see past the myths and understand the benefits which include greater energy security, more jobs and growth.” Ken Cronin, chief executive of Ukoog, the trade body that represents the shale industry, said: “This research shows that two thirds of people are concerned that we cannot heat ourselves and keep the lights on, and nearly half are worried that we are too dependent on gas imports from abroad.  “The solution is to source energy from the ground beneath our feet and the industry must continue its efforts to ensure that factual evidence based information is provided to the public rather than scaremongering and myths.” Statistics published by the government today also show that there is now 9.5GW of solar power installed in the UK, up by nearly a fifth on last year. Around half is in the form of big solar farms (greater than 5MW) which ministers such as environment secretary, Liz Truss, have attacked and undercut with subsidy changes. Juliet Davenport OBE, chief executive of green energy company Good Energy said: “The message from the British public is loud and clear. 81% of us back renewables for our energy – people want to see a transition to a renewable future here in the UK.” Last year’s historic climate agreement in Paris – and the recent signing of the deal – may also have given a small fillip to public concern on climate change, which was up slightly on earlier polling, from 66% previously to 70% now."

"Labor is proposing two emissions trading schemes – one for big industrial polluters and an electricity industry model similar to one once backed by Malcolm Turnbull – in a climate policy that trumps the Coalition’s ambition but minimises the hit on household power bills and leaves important detail to be determined post-election. The policy will cost $355.9m over four years, with $300m earmarked to help regions and industries facing upheaval in the transition to a cleaner economy. As Australia’s greenhouse emissions from electricity generation continue to rise, Labor’s policy promises to speed the shift to renewables, through a radical plan under which power generators would be forced to pay for the closure of a competitor’s dirty brown-coal fired plant and also through an electricity-industry specific “intensity based” trading scheme, similar to the kind of scheme many in business expect will be created post-election after a review of the Coalition’s Direct Action plan. But the policies have been cautiously crafted – and some crucial details deferred – to avoid a repeat of the anti-carbon tax campaign waged by the Coalition in the past. The intensity-based scheme would require generators with an emissions intensity above an electricity industry wide baseline to buy “credits” from those below it – effectively penalising polluting power stations and rewarding clean ones. The idea was most recently proposed by the Australian Energy Market Commission in a submission to the Coalition government, with the AEMC stating that it could operate “without a significant effect on absolute price levels faced by consumers.” The plan is similar to the model originally proposed by Turnbull in 2009 when he was opposition leader, and to the sort of scheme that could evolve from existing Coalition policy if the government “ratchets up” the baselines, leaving open some prospect of bipartisanship in the bitterly-contested policy area. Australian National University academics first proposed the second-part of Labor’s policy – the radical scheme under which big brown-coal generators, near the end of their operational life, would submit bids for how much money they would need to receive in order to shut straight away and deal with the community and employment fallout, with the cost of the winning bid spread across all the other generators in the market, who would enjoy higher prices because of their competitor’s closure.  The academics estimated the scheme could cause a one-off rise of between 1% and 2% in retail power bills, but subsequent modelling by Reputex found the impact could be even lower – between 0.2% and 1.3%. Labor is hedging on the third aspect of its policy to force change on national electricity generation – the possibility of an extension to the renewable energy target – saying it remains committed to to its 50% renewable generation target by 2030 but would consult on what extra policies might be needed to achieve it, with a further RET not the favoured option. With the costs of “gold plating” investments in poles and wires now washed through the electricity market, residential power prices are forecast to fall in coming years, meaning Labor is likely to argue that any minor cost increases from its policies will be barely noticed. The ALP is also taking a highly cautious approach to reducing emissions from heavy industry, proposing a two-stage ETS and deferring decisions on details. Between 2018 and 2020 a “cap” would be imposed on big industrial emitters, but those exposed to international competition exceeding the cap would be allowed to meet their entire liability by buying international permits, currently priced at less than $1 a tonne. This means the cost would be minimial. After 2020 the scheme would morph into a more traditional ETS, but Labor says it will consult on the details. Agriculture, road transport and refrigerants will be left out of the first phase of the scheme. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who will unveil the policy with his environment spokesman, Mark Butler, on Wednesday, said that unlike the Coalition, Labor accepted climate science and was prepared to avoid the high costs of inaction. “We do not consider climate change a question of ‘belief’, we know it is an economic and environmental reality ... The cost of inaction, to our economy and the environment, will be profound. This is not a price Labor is prepared to make the next generation of Australians pay,” he said.  Labor’s policy would also: When Labor first committed to the 45% reduction several Coalition frontbenchers, including the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said Labor’s plan would cost the economy $600bn. That claim was discredited by the leading economist Warwick McKibbin, in modelling done for the government, who found that a 45% reduction in emissions would result in a loss 0.7% of Australia’s gross domestic product, compared with 0.3% for the Coalition’s target. $600bn is about 2% of Australia’s GDP. Most experts believe Direct Action has little chance of meeting Australia’s long term greenhouse commitments. The Coalition has said it will review the policy next year."

"In the outpouring of media coverage after Prince’s death at the age of 57 last week, fans around the globe began to learn more about the notoriously private star – including that he gave away a lot of money. Van Jones – the activist, author, former Obama administration official, and current CNN commentator – revealed that Prince had secretly funded causes from public radio to Black Lives Matter to the Harlem Children’s Zone. He also conceived of #YesWeCode, an initiative to train black kids for work in tech. And he supported Green For All, a group working to fight climate change and bring green jobs to underprivileged populations. Jones is in the leadership of the latter two organizations. “I was an Oakland activist giving speeches about the need for green jobs,” Jones told me over the phone, recalling how he first came into contact with the musician 10 years ago. “Prince heard me in the media and sent a $50,000 check to support the work I was doing. But he did all his giving completely anonymously, so I sent the check back. You never know when someone is trying to set you up – it could have been from Chevron or from a drug dealer or whatever. So then he sent the check back and I sent it back again, and then he sent it back and then I sent it back, until finally a representative called and said, ‘Will you please accept this check? I won’t tell you who it is from, but the guy’s favorite color is purple.’ I said, ‘Well, now you have a different problem: I’m not gonna cash this check, I’m gonna frame it.’”  Soon after, Prince reached out to Jones, and the two became friends – a friendship that would last until his death. Jones’ role in Prince’s life was, he says, as “his lead guitarist for social impact, for lack of a better term.” Jones helped distribute Prince’s resources when he didn’t want the attention, including providing solar panels for families in Oakland. The families never knew who their benefactor was. As a Jehovah’s Witness, Prince wasn’t permitted to advertise his good works. But even without his spiritual tradition, Jones says Prince would have been modest about his giving. “He thought it was in poor taste for these celebrities to get millions of dollars and then write a check and have their publicists all over the media bragging about it,” Jones said. “He was like, ‘This is ridiculous. We get enough attention. We’re celebrities.’” Jones says that what Prince really cared about was humanity. “He cared about life and love and freedom,” Jones says. “His politics were not red. They were not blue. They were purple. He had a mind that let him see answers – musically, spiritually, even politically. Rather than argue about global warming, he said, ‘Let’s help kids put up solar panels.’” It’s clear in conversation that Jones deeply mourns the loss of his friend. When asked what he will miss most, he takes a long pause, so long I think for a moment that the line has gone dead. “Everybody will tell you about the songs, but the genius didn’t stop when he walked out of the studio,” Jones says. “He was so hilariously, ridiculously funny. He was Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Kevin Hart–level funny. Dave Chapelle is probably funnier, but he’s the only one. Everybody else, Prince could have eaten their lunch, and half the time with no curse words. That’s irreplaceable. You can’t find that on YouTube or iTunes.”"
"The global agrochemical and seed industry is undergoing profound upheaval, with a spate of mergers and attempted mergers consolidating the sector and raising concerns about the future of the food system. It began last year when Monsanto started looking for a partner, trying three times (unsuccessfully) to link up with Syngenta. By the end of 2015, Dow and DuPont announced they were teaming up. Subject to regulatory approval, the new $130bn company – DowDuPont – plans to split into three parts, one of which will focus exclusively on agricultural chemicals and seeds and is set to command a hefty market share. It is estimated DowDuPont could account for around 40% of the corn and soybean seed market in the US.  In February this year, ChemChina announced a $43bn purchase of Syngenta, bolstering ChemChina’s genetically engineered seed capacity and giving it the largest slice of the agricultural chemical market. The remaining players – Monsanto, Bayer and BASF – are now under pressure to join the mega-merger dance, with talks on various potential permutations reportedly under way.  These proposed corporate mega-mergers are the result of pressure from financial investors. Years of low interest rates since the financial crisis have made corporate borrowing cheap and easy. But the onset of low agricultural commodity prices and faltering economic growth in emerging economies has weakened demand for commercial seeds and crop protection chemicals, making it harder for agribusiness firms to generate high returns for their shareholders, and to pay their debts. Concerned about excessive borrowing and weak performance, investors have increasingly put pressure on agribusiness managers to improve their performance. In the case of Dow and DuPont, individual activist investors – each managing enormous hedge funds for wealthy clients – pushed hard on these firms to cut costs through restructuring. Essentially, mergers and acquisitions have been the tools of choice to attempt to placate restless investors. Regulators in the countries in which these firms are based are scrutinising the details of these deals, deciding whether to allow them to proceed. No doubt they are reviewing the mergers looking for evidence regarding traditional concerns about the effects of corporate consolidation – that it stifles competition, reduces innovation and can lead to a loss of tax revenue if the firm relocates its headquarters. These concerns merit close consideration, but there is so much more at stake. For starters, mergers are likely to lead to higher costs of inputs for farmers. Already, the seed and chemical industries are highly concentrated. In 2013, the top six firms controlled 75% of the agrochemical market and 63% of the commercial seed market. If the number of firms drops, it will be that much easier for them to raise prices.  Consolidation in the agribusiness industry also tends to concentrate political power as giant firms lobby governments to shape the rules of the food system in ways that support their interests. According to the non-profit, ETC Group (pdf), small-scale farmers feed around 70% of the world’s population, and do so mainly with seeds saved from one harvest to the next rather than commercially purchased seed. Changes in government policies that favour big corporations’ desire for more large-scale industrial agriculture will directly threaten small farmers’ livelihoods. Further spread of the industrial agricultural model is also likely to have devastating ecological effects. Large-scale, chemical-based monoculture farming is recognised as a major contributor to both climate change and biodiversity loss, problems that pose significant threats to long-term food security.  If the proposed mega-mergers proceed, the food system will face profound changes in the name of increased short-term financial returns for relatively few investors. Ironically, there is little evidence to show that corporate consolidation is even economically productive in the long run.  A short-term financial boost for a handful of investors is hardly justification for allowing the mega-mergers when they threaten farmer livelihoods, the environment and long-term food security.  "

"The investor uncertainty caused by a continuing climate policy war would push power prices up by more than the policies proposed by either the government or Labor, according to a leading modeller.  Modelling by the former Reserve Bank of Australia board member Warwick McKibbin, done for the former Abbott government, found the Coalition’s promise to cut emissions by between 26% and 28% – if achieved with efficient policies – would shave between 0.2% and 0.3% from GDP in 2030, whereas Labor’s 45% target would reduce GDP by between 0.5% and 0.7%. But the same modelling found the difference between the two policies (0.3% of GDP), or even the cost of the Labor target, would be dwarfed by the potential cost of continued investor uncertainty – which could be as high as 1% of GDP.  “Uncertainty increases the cost of capital for electricity generation and that increases electricity prices, which flows through the whole economy. Those price increases can be significantly larger than the price rises flowing from any of the policies to achieve a modest reduction in emissions,” McKibbin told Guardian Australia. “The most critical thing is to achieve clear bipartisanship; continued political deadlock and disagreement increases uncertainty and means investors need a higher rate of return. Bipartisan policy gives you real economic benefits, and uncertainty costs as least as much as any difference in the estimated costs of meeting the targets proposed by each of the major parties,” he said. McKibbin has raised concerns that, in practice, Labor’s target might be difficult to achieve.  He also says the government will struggle to meet its target using its current policy, largely relying on buying emissions reduction with the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund. “The problem with the government’s existing policy is it’s very difficult to scale up. They will almost certainly have to modify it so it became a baseline and credit trading scheme and get it off budget. “If the government did that there would be an overlap there with Labor’s policy on the electricity policy.” Labor is now proposing a separate “emissions intensity” trading scheme for the electricity sector in which generators with higher emissions than an industry-wide baseline would have to buy credits from those with lower emissions. This is a big shift from the “cap and trade” scheme it previously introduced. The Coalition’s “Direct Action” scheme includes provisions that – with adjustment – could become the same kind of trading scheme. McKibbin joins the economist and adviser to the Coalition government Danny Price and the Business Council of Australia in pointing out that these similarities provide a possible basis for a bipartisan policy. Price, the chief executive of Frontier Economics, who advised the Coalition on “Direct Action”, told Guardian Australia the Labor plan was very similar to a scheme advocated by Malcolm Turnbull in 2009, and to the scheme that could be formed from “Direct Action”. “The emissions intensity part of Labor’s plan appears to be exactly what we were proposing for Malcolm Turnbull and Nick Xenophon in 2009,” he said. Price modelled the scheme for Turnbull and Xenophon when Turnbull was the opposition leader and was considering his response to the then Labor government’s cap-and-trade ETS. Turnbull lauded it as a “cheaper, greener, smarter scheme” and said it could deliver deeper cuts to greenhouse emissions but imposed far lower increases in electricity prices. But the then prime minister Kevin Rudd dismissed it as a “magic pudding”. The then climate minister Penny Wong, now the leader of the opposition in the Senate, also dismissed the scheme that now forms part of Labor’s policy. And Price – who the government recently appointed to the Climate Change Authority and who acted as an adviser on Direct Action – also said the Coalition would probably have to move to a similar scheme itself to meet its own emissions reduction targets. “The government’s Direct Action plan – its safeguard mechanism – could be modified to create exactly this same type of scheme,” he said. “I’ve always thought that was the most likely way for them to go after the review they have scheduled for 2017, because they are obviously going to have to make changes to meet even their existing targets and this is a low-cost way to do it. “It is actually emerging as an idea with the potential to be adopted by both major parties.” Under Direct Action, the “safeguards mechanism” is supposed to ensure that increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government’s $2.5bn scheme, by setting baselines for their emissions. At present, the baselines are lenient, ensuring industries don’t “go rogue” by not seeking to reduce their greenhouse emissions. But many observers, including business groups, expect they will have to be tightened after 2017 to gradually reduce industrial emissions. And that would turn Direct Action into much the same scheme as Labor is proposing. But the Turnbull government immediately attacked Labor’s policy as an “electricity tax”. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, called it a “big, thumping electricity tax” and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said Labor, the Greens and the independents wanted to “make people poorer because it’s good for you, because it’s righteous”."
" Unseasonably warm weather across Australia, which is set to continue through the coming month, might be putting a spring in people’s step but is a clear sign of dangerous climate change, according climate scientists and meteorologists. Australia and the rest of the world have been reeling from a string of temperature records being smashed. February caused alarm when it was the most unusually warm month on record by a huge margin. But that record was broken immediately by March.   In Australia March 2016 was the warmest March on record. And this week the Bureau Of Meteorology released its seasonal outlook, showing above average temperatures are set to continue across the country at least throughout May. According to David Karoly, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne, climate change increased the chance of March breaking the temperature record in Australia by at least seven times.  “The previous record had about a one in 43-year chance due to natural climate variations alone but now occurs about one year in six in the present climate, that is already affected by human-caused climate change,” he told Guardian Australia. “It’s evidence that climate change is already happening – and increasing the risks of hot extremes.”  Blair Trewin from the Bureau of Meteorology said: “April won’t be a record but it will be well above normal.”  Throughout May temperatures across most of the country have an 80% chance of being warmer than the average from 1961 to 1990. By June and July most coastal regions will continue to have unusually warm weather, however temperatures will return to normal around central and southern Australia. The current spike in warm weather is happening partly because of the monster El Niño that spread a pulse of warm water across the Pacific Ocean in 2015. That El Niño is dissipating, spreading the warmer water around Australia, raising temperatures. But all that was happening on top of the background of global warming, Trewin said. He said that these days, in an El Niño year, the world tended to experience extreme temperatures and merely “above average” temperatures in other years. Only when a La Niña cooled the globe were there normal or slightly cool temperatures."

"New studies suggest that the weather in far off Greenland, one of the fastest warming parts of the Earth, is affecting the rainfall patterns in Britain. This is linked to the extremely wet summers of 2007 and 2012. Sheffield University, checking data back to 1851, found that since the 1980s there has been an increase in the number of summer high pressure blocking systems that become anchored over this vast island ice sheet. The result has been to drag warm air over Greenland causing melting on a much-increased scale.  This is bad news for sea level rise everywhere, but additionally for Britain, because it prevents storm systems from moving over Greenland and diverts them south across the Atlantic and across the UK. The warmer air carries more moisture, released when clouds rise over the land. Blocking highs also occur in December, which has a similarly destabilising effect on the climate. This happened this winter, moving warm air northwards over the Arctic, preventing sea ice forming as extensively as normal. Over time, this leads to less sea ice overall, speeding up Arctic warming. It is the temperature difference between the Arctic regions and the temperate Atlantic that drives the jet stream and brings constantly changing conditions to Britain. This wonderful variety of weather that has provided the nation with an ideal opening to any chitchat with strangers, and that does not appear likely to change any time soon.  But just for now, it might be wise to leave blocking highs over Greenland and kinks in the jet stream out of the conversation until you know people better.    "

"We’re off to the polls again. Australia has so much in abundance: coal, sunshine, iron ore and nine parliaments for 24 million people. There is always an election round the corner. Yet for all this endless political activity, nothing much gets done.  Government should be so easy in this prosperous, orderly country. But it is remarkably hard. Parliaments are short. Leaders don’t last. Power is fragmented. This is the land of unfinished political business. Each election campaign is much like the last. Only the faces change. This time Malcolm Turnbull, a former barrister and Goldman Sachs banker, faces Bill Shorten, a lawyer who climbed swiftly through the ranks of a big trade union to lead the opposition. Political cartoonists can’t resist the caricature: the hard hat v the top hat. But when Turnbull returned from Government House on Sunday after the rituals of the dissolution of parliament, he delivered a campaign speech that might have been given anytime in the past decade. The mantra was “jobs and growth”; the mood was upbeat; the only threats Turnbull saw on the horizon were refugees (“Australians know that we will keep our borders secure”) and the Labor party “with its higher taxing, higher spending, debt and deficit agenda”. The banality was staggering. He had not a word to say about global warming. Yet despite him, that will be fought over again in this campaign as it has been – unresolved – in the last three national election campaigns in this country. How could it not be? We’ve had another summer of record heat; half the Great Barrier Reef has been severely affected by coral bleaching and we continue to belch CO2 into the air. Australians want action. Polls year after year have shown we believe climate change is real. We know Australia isn’t doing enough. We are more uneasy than ever that it’s Australian coal destroying the atmosphere. But the political system can’t deliver a solution. So we head into yet another election campaign – and this the longest anyone can remember – arguing over familiar problems with little hope that the next election will be any more use than the last in solving them. Education standards sag; life grows steadily worse in remote Indigenous communities; marriage remains beyond the reach of the LGBTI; multinational corporations operate largely untaxed; and budget deficits deepen year after year. We do executions better than solutions. Turnbull is Australia’s fourth prime minister in five years. Australians want this leadership churn to end. They crave continuity. But victory no longer guarantees survival. Since John Howard went to his reward in 2007 – losing even his own seat after 11 years in office – politics in the antipodes have proved volatile, brutal and repetitive. Kevin Rudd was an opposition leader of genius. After the dull and fractious Howard years, he seemed to promise the country a more modern, more open future under Labor. Australians loved him. He lasted 30 months. His nemesis, Julia Gillard, a politician of amazing resilience, led a mildly reformist minority Labor government until Rudd returned to tear her down a few weeks before the 2013 elections. Tony Abbott then inflicted on Labor the worst defeat the party has suffered in generations. His Liberal National party Coalition won 90 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives. The new government seemed set for a long and deeply conservative existence. Abbott lasted two years. Almost from the moment he was elected, Australia was gripped by what the pollster Andrew Catsaras calls “buyers’ remorse”. Opinion polls showed, despite the hash Labor had just made of government, that the party would be welcomed back with open arms under its new leader, Bill Shorten. So Turnbull executed Abbott. The new prime minister’s eight months in office have seen almost nothing done in Canberra. Even in a political system where modest achievement might seem the norm, the bare record of the Abbott/Turnbull years is embarrassing. Turnbull can only talk about the future. He wants to harness Australia’s hopes for change. Those hopes are strong. That so little happens here is taken by many to mean Australians flinch from change. That isn’t so. The mood of the country is more progressive than its politics. On his return from Yarralumla on Sunday, Turnbull repeated the message he delivered the day he toppled Abbott: he is on the side of the future and unafraid of change. “We live in a time of remarkable opportunity,” he said. “We live in an era when the scale and pace of economic change is unprecedented through all of human history. The opportunities for Australia have never been greater. “There are many challenges. But if we embrace this future with confidence and with optimism, with self-belief and a clear plan, then we will succeed as we have never succeeded before.” Opinion polls show Australians back equality. They want better protection for human rights and a clearer separation of church and state. Euthanasia and marriage equality enjoy the support of more than 70% of the community. Backers of a republic outnumber monarchists two to one. Australians want a fairer tax system, a federal anti-corruption agency, better regulation of campaign funding, constitutional recognition of its Indigenous peoples and, it’s worth repeating, effective action against global warming. Turnbull once backed nearly all these positions. He poured millions from his own fortune into the 1999 referendum on the republic. As leader of the opposition under Rudd, he staked his political future on addressing global warming. That a man with such an outlook had become prime minister made him extraordinarily popular in his early months. Shorten looked finished. Labor was said to have no hope next time at the ballot box. Then reality bit. Turnbull leads a big mainstream party, the Liberals, with little enthusiasm for reform which governs with a little party of farmers and miners, the Nationals, that is almost comically hostile to change. Abbott was their man. Turnbull secured Abbott’s downfall by agreeing to continue to back most of his policies – including an expensive plebiscite on marriage equality that threatens to open faultlines between old and new Australia. As Turnbull’s entrapment became clearer over the summer, his popularity collapsed. He remains the man the country wants as prime minister but half the electorate is dissatisfied with his performance and, as the campaign begins, support for the government and opposition is running neck and neck. Though it is eight weeks until we gather in the kindergartens and church halls of the nation to vote – and nearly all adult Australians turn out to do their duty by democracy – key outcomes are already clear. Australia will continue to imprison refugees in the Pacific. The camps on Nauru and Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island have seen rape, assault and murder over the past three years. Two desperate refugees have set themselves alight. One died. A Somali woman of 21 is fighting for her life in a Brisbane hospital. Set up to block refugees from reaching Australia by boat, the camps cost a billion dollars a year. New Zealand has offered to take hundreds of these trapped people but Australia refuses to allow them to go to such a soft destination. No other country is offering to take them off our hands. Yet the government and opposition are in lock step here. The country backs them. Only a few brave Labor MPs and the Greens speak for that minority of Australians appalled at what is being done in their country’s name. Not even PNG ordering Australia to close its camp provoked fresh political debate in this country. The PNG supreme court had declared that holding refugees prisoner there was in breach of the right to liberty guaranteed in the country’s constitution. The refugees are still behind the wire on Manus as the two nations squabble over their fate. In this campaign there is also no contest between the government and the opposition over the forest of security laws that has grown up in the past few years, provoking criticism from legal authorities on the threats they pose to media freedom and fundamental rights. Bret Walker, a distinguished barrister and former independent national security legislation monitor, told the Press Council last week: “We have a national addiction when we see a problem for throwing a law at it, or 53 laws at it. We have more anti-terrorism laws than any other country on earth and I think I’d win a bet if I said more than every country put together.” And barely contested in the coming campaign will be the revenue-busting generosity Australia shows to its most prosperous citizens. Australia is not, of course, alone in this. And the damage done doesn’t match the budget carnage in Europe and the US: federal government debt is expected to peak this year at a modest 18% of GDP. But so much has been given away for so long – particularly through the great mining boom that ran almost uninterrupted from 2003 to late 2011 – that one of the most prosperous countries on earth is left scrambling to pay its bills. We have no death duties. That’s about $10bn forgone each year. Capital gains are taxed at half the rate of income. Family homes are exempt entirely. Last year, that one concession, according to the leftwing thinktank the Australia Institute, cost the revenue $46bn. Income taxes are among the lowest in the OECD after huge cuts offered by Howard – and essentially matched by Rudd – in 2007. Company taxes are a little high by world standards but Turnbull is proposing to cut them by billions over the next few years. For decades, landlords have been allowed to write off losses on their investments against general income. This negative gearing costs the revenue about $8bn a year. And superannuation – though compulsory for wage earners – is supported by massive tax breaks that will cost about $47bn next year. This is unaffordable. We’re not broke. It’s nothing like that. But another reason politics is so hard in this prosperous country is that so much energy must be devoted, year in and year out, to addressing problems we never needed to have. We’ve given away our room to move. In 2016 the government and opposition will bicker over the revenue, as they always do in election campaigns. But neither side of politics will approach the underlying problem here. Preserving Australia as a paradise for the prosperous is their joint enterprise. Minor adjustments are allowed. In the budget he brought down last week, Turnbull proposed to cap superannuation concessions for the rich. Shorten has promised to rein in negative gearing if Labor is elected in July. But the few billions such measures might collect won’t come near fixing the revenue. And Turnbull has turned on Shorten’s proposal the formulaic rage that’s been used to thwart decades of attempts to address the nation’s generosity problem. According to the prime minister, the opposition is bent on destroying the property market. “Labor, claiming to speak for fairness, but in really speaking for nothing more than increasing taxes, stands in the way of Australians getting ahead.” The shouting has begun. Australians like their leader to look like a prime minister. Abbott didn’t. Turnbull does. Shorten might. He’s a man of little magnetism but he’s a professional. He doesn’t make mistakes. He’s as friendly to capitalism as a former trade union leader can be. He has reshaped the political contest by arguing policy. That’s a novel approach in Australia. Usually, an opposition would only begin rolling out its policies now as the campaign begins. But Labor has been campaigning for a year. Along the way, Shorten began to earn respect. The easy victory predicted for Turnbull has evaporated. The government is in trouble in Queensland and New South Wales. Pollsters don’t rule out the possibility of defeat for the Coalition. Party loyalties are dying. More than ever, Australians will take good government from wherever it comes. The usual hyperbole is in the air about a country at the crossroads and the crucial importance of the choice to be made in July. But it isn’t going to make or break the nation. What lies ahead is a gruelling and expensive campaign that will leave Australia much as it was before. Power may shift. Leaders may be humiliated. But neither side is offering what both know is wanted yet politics finds so difficult to deliver in this country: change. "
"The election of Donald Trump would derail the landmark agreement on climate change reached in Paris last December, the architect of the accord has warned. Trump is now virtually certain to be the Republican candidate for president and has said “I am not a great believer in manmade climate change”, leading to fears he would attempt to unpick the historic agreement if he became president.  Without naming Trump, the former French foreign minister Laurent Fabius told an audience in London: “Think about the impact of the coming US presidential elections. If a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption.” He said: “We must not think that everything is settled.” In response to a speech by Barack Obama at the opening of the Paris climate summit, Trump said: “I think one of the dumbest statements I’ve ever heard in politics, in the history of politics as I know it, which is pretty good, was Obama’s statement that our No 1 problem is global warming.” Under the Paris agreement, 195 nations have agreed to limit global warming to no more than 2C, with an aspirational limit of 1.5C, in order to stave off the worst effects of climate change. At a ceremony in New York last month, 175 countries formally accepted the Paris accord, bringing it closer to coming into force. The UN is now pressing to begin the implementation of the deal, needing the formal agreement of countries with 55% of global emissions, which will require countries to take action on emissions and to provide financial assistance to the developing world. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the two remaining Democratic candidates, are both in favour of action on greenhouse gas emissions and support the Paris accord. The US Congress, dominated by Republicans, may also oppose the actions needed on emissions to fulfil US commitments under the Paris agreement, even if a Democrat is elected president in November. However, Fabius noted, the deal was carefully crafted in Paris to ensure that the US president would have the authority to sign up to it. This was the subject of a last-minute hitch in the Paris talks, when as the final draft was published US negotiators balked at the inclusion of a clause saying countries “shall” commit to fulfilling the agreement, instead of the previous wording which was “should”. If the former had been included, it would have caused legal problems in the US as Congress could have claimed the president had exceeded his authority. However, Fabius insisted the change of wording, subsequently dropped, was a “mistake” rather than a deliberate attempt at sabotage, which has since been the subject of conspiracy theories. He pointed out that all countries, after a short discussion, quickly agreed to the change, and this would not have happened if they had wanted the “shall” to be included. “John Kerry came to me and said if it is ‘shall’ we can’t do it. I came to Christiana Figueres [the UN climate chief] and we came to the previous version and the previous version was ‘should’,” he explained. “If it was a mistake in writing, you can change it - if it was a real thing [it would not have been possible]. I said it was really not intentional, it was a mistake. We had three versions of the text. [Shall] was never discussed.” Fabius, who is now president of France’s constitutional council, said he was “désolé bien sur” that Laurence Tubiana, France’s chief official at the talks, had not been chosen to succeed Figueres when she steps down in July. That job has gone to Patricia Espinosa, Mexico’s ambassador to Germany and former foreign minister. Fabius said she was “very competent”. The French government had asked UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon to reopen nominations to consider Tubiana’s candidacy. Countries must press ahead with the implementation of the Paris accord, Fabius added. He warned of “risks associated with reluctant countries”. He refused to be drawn on whether a British exit from the EU would harm progress on climate change, but said that when he was foreign minister he had urged the UK to stay. He met Philip Hammond, UK foreign secretary, on Wednesday but details of what was discussed were not disclosed. He also said he had been concerned over the prospective TTIP agreement when he was in office. François Hollande, France’s president, has said he would not accept TTIP in its current form. Fabius was in London to collect the Green Ribbon award in parliament for the best international environmental achievement of 2015. The Guardian also received a Green Ribbon for the best journalism on the environment, in regard to its “exceptional” coverage of the Paris climate talks and the Keep It In The Ground campaign."
"The May 2016 Perimeter Institute public lecture is this evening. Tim Palmer of Oxford University will take about climate change, and the computational techniques used to evaluate the predictability and dynamics of weather and climate. The lecture will be followed by a question-and-answer session, and a recording will appear here one the live broadcast has finished. "
"The steady rise of Earth’s temperature as greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere and trap more and more heat is sending the planet spiraling closer to the point where warming’s catastrophic consequences may be all but assured.  That metaphoric spiral has become a literal one in a new graphic drawn up by Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. The animated graphic features a rainbow-colored record of global temperatures spinning outward from the late 19th century to the present as the Earth heats up. “The pace of change is immediately obvious, especially over the past few decades,” Hawkins, who has previously worked with Climate Central’s extreme weather attribution team, wrote in an email. The graphic is part of Hawkins’s effort to explore new ways to present global temperature data in a way that clearly telegraphs the warming trend. Another climate scientist, Jan Fuglestvedt of the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research – Oslo, suggested the spiral presentation. The graphic displays monthly global temperature data from the U.K. Met Office and charts how each month compares to the average for the same period from 1850-1900, the same baselines used in the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. At first, the years vacillate inward and outward, showing that a clear warming signal had yet to emerge from the natural fluctuations that happen from year to year. But clear warming trends are present in the early and late 20th century. In the later, it is clear how much closer temperatures have come to the target the international community has set to keep warming within 2°C (4°F) above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century. An even more ambitious target of 1.5°C (3°F) has increasingly become a topic of discussion, and is also visible on the graphic. Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State who created the famous “Hockey Stick” graph of global temperature records going back hundreds of years, said that the spiral graphic was “an interesting and worthwhile approach to representing the data graphically.” He said that using an earlier baseline period would have better captured all the warming that has occurred, as there was some small amount already in the late 19th century. Just how much temperatures have risen is clear in the first few months of data from 2016, it’s line clearly separated from 2015 — which was the hottest year on record — and edging in on the 1.5°C mark. Every month of 2016 so far has been the warmest such month on record; in fact, the past 11 months have all set records, the longest such streak in the temperature data kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (Each agency that keeps such a temperature record handles the data slightly differently, which can lead to small differences in monthly and yearly values, though the overall trend is in broad agreement for all such agencies.) The record-setting temperatures of 2016 have seen a small push from an exceptionally strong El Niño, but they are largely the result of the heat that has built up in the atmosphere over decades of unabated greenhouse gas emissions — as the spiral graphic makes clear. “Turns out that this version [of temperature records] particularly appeals, maybe because it doesn’t require much interpretation,” Hawkins said."
"About 35 climate science jobs at the CSIRO have been saved from initial cuts of 110, as part of a restructure that includes the establishment of a new climate science centre in Hobart.  Of the organisation’s remaining 75 to 80 climate scientists, half will go to the Tasmanian centre.  The federal science and environment ministers welcomed the move but senior climate scientists in the CSIRO said it still represented a large cut to Australia’s climate science capability and expressed concern for the future of those scientists not moving to the new centre. In a statement released on Monday evening, the CSIRO said the Hobart centre would employ 40 scientists and have funding secured for 10 years. On Tuesday morning, the CSIRO’s chief executive, Larry Marshall, announced that 75 positions would be cut from the oceans and atmosphere business unit rather than the 110 originally announced.  More details were expected to be released after a meeting of the unit on Tuesday afternoon. The CSIRO also announced the establishment of a national climate science advisory committee, which would report at a ministerial level. Senior climate scientists in the CSIRO told Guardian Australia they first heard about the changes from the media, including details of the meeting. One said the changes were a “fig leaf” designed to mute the issue as the election approached. “They’re trying to get it off the front pages of the newspapers because the Labor party decided to make an election issue out of it,” he said. “They’re going to say – we’ve given you what you want, take it or leave it.”  It was unclear whether the positions that were not part of the new centre would survive further cuts, he said. “It’s a con,” another senior CSIRO climate scientist said. “What happens to those other jobs? Are they prepared to cut those?” Scientists also questioned why the centre would be based in Hobart, suggesting it might be politically motivated.  Internal emails released to the Senate earlier this month had referred to the political implications.  On 28 January the director of the Oceans and Atmosphere unit, Ken Lee, said he would continue to work on ways to “minimise impacts on Hobart”. He said any cuts “need to address loss of employment in Tas (a regional political issue)”. A senior scientist in CSIRO said the question of which jobs would be made redundant should be based on what capabilities were needed, not where the scientists were based. The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, told ABC radio on Tuesday the government had helped to “broker” the new arrangement. “From what was frankly a difficult situation we worked to engage with the organisation and to get I think the longest, deepest national climate science program that Australia has ever had,” Hunt said. Scientists who spoke to Guardian Australia flatly rejected that suggestion. The centre would hold the remnants of a severely reduced climate science capability in the CSIRO, they said. Funding for climate science was severely reduced when the Coalition cut the Australian climate change science program after the 2013 election. Labor’s research spokesman, Kim Carr, said the move was nothing more than a political fix. He said the move showed the government was happy to intervene, but was not interested in saving “the jobs or CSIRO’s international reputation”. He called on the government to put the changes on hold until staff were properly consulted. “This announcement is a marginal seats strategy, not a science strategy,” he said. According to internal CSIRO documents seen by Guardian Australia, the new centre will house the organisation’s climate modelling and measurement projects. Many scientists had feared the modelling capability would be lost but the documents suggest the CSIRO will continue to invest in it.  The centre would “sit alongside key collaborators and CSIRO’s science and engineering capability supporting the Marine National Facility, the RV Investigator”, the documents say. Andy Pitman, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of NSW, said there were not enough details in the announcement to judge whether Australia would maintain an adequate climate science capability. He said if the 40 scientists in Hobart were required to maintain the climate measuring, the model development and climate projections, there simply wouldn’t be enough people. “This is a good news story relative to the initial cut,” he said. “This is a catastrophic story because Australia is significantly cutting its capability.”"
"Below is this week’s playlist – picked by a reader from the comments on last week’s blog. Thanks for your suggestions. Read more about the weekly format of the Readers recommend series at the end of the piece. In 1974, Jackson Browne’s celebration of the back-to-the-land movement, Before the Deluge, which starts this week’s playlist, contained this one eerily prescient verse that served to dampen the spirits of that generally optimistic generation:   Some of them were angry At the way the earth was abused By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power And they struggled to protect her from them Only to be confused By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour The idiosyncrasies of 20th century weather could be the topic of comical pieces, such as Flanders and Swann’s engaging A Song of the Weather, or the blackly humorous Hard Day on the Planet by Loudon Wainwright III which includes the lines: In California the body counts keep getting higher It’s evil out there, man, that state is always on fire As we approached the turn of the millennium, however, there was a greater sense of accountability for the problems of the planet. Our waste, our emissions, our extractive industries, our sheer numbers were threatening the ecosystems we depended on. You can hear the grief in Tracy Chapman’s haunting song that accuses us of just standing by and watching The Rape of the World, you can hear the anger in Michael Jackson’s Earth Song, and you can hear the profound sadness in New Model Army’s Ballad, accompanied by a fabulously mournful harmonica: When they look back at us and they write down our history What will they say about our generation? We’re the ones who knew everything still we did nothing Harvested everything, planted nothing I chose the next three songs because they seem to me to represent the spirit of enquiry that was the next important step.  ""Liberated Carbon"" by Andy Revkin is a fun one. Not only is it a nice blues, but it has geologically accurate lyrics and is written and performed by the creator of the New York Times's Dot Earth blog: https://open.spotify.com/track/4KVmNgJ2G1NEbu27p6ORpf Corb Lund’s song The Truth Comes Out is an observent but low-key song about the effects of climate change on wildlife in the foothills of Alberta. As Baylor Fox-Kemper’s nomination suggests Andrew Revkin’s Liberated Carbon provides some geological background, and Melissa Etheridge’s passionate anthem to personal responsibility, I Need To Wake Up, was used in Al Gore’s influential climate change documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Next up are two contrasting songs – one angry, one resigned nevertheless both looking towards a very changed planet and a very difficult human future. The Restarts insist there is No Escape from global warming, and French for Rabbits sing an elegy for a home Claimed by the Sea. I can’t completely explain the reason I chose to end this playlist with Harry Belafonte’s Turn the World Around. Several nominated songs made me feel hopeful for the future but none more than this one. I appreciated the simplicity of the message, we need to get back to the basic elements of life, and I was inspired by his amazing, never-give-up energy. Enjoy the music. The theme for next week’s playlist will be announced at 8pm (UK time) on Thursday 28 April. You have until 11pm on Monday 2 May to make nominations. Next week’s playlist will be compiled by Andrew Morrissey, who posts in the comments as Makinavaja. Here’s a reminder of some of the guidelines for RR:"

"The patron saint of quality television is 90 years old today. When his Great Barrier Reef series was broadcast at the start of the year, it was reported that this was likely to be his last series, or at least his last made on location. But it’s difficult to believe David Attenborough won’t always be around. For most people who grew up in 20th-century Britain, he is not just a national treasure but a permanent fixture. But then, that’s what we thought about the Great Barrier Reef. Just before the reef series was broadcast, Attenborough told a journalist that his first dive on the reef is the moment in his career he remembers most vividly: “Suddenly, this amazing world with a thousand things you didn’t know existed is revealed right in front of you, all wonderful colours and shapes. On land, the rainforest is comparable – but the difference is, you can walk for a day and see absolutely nothing. ‘Where are all these bloody monkeys they are always on about?’ But on a reef you see everything immediately.”  Greenpeace is campaigning to protect the Great Barrier Reef from new coalmines – huge mines that would threaten the reef directly through dredging and dumping, and indirectly by adding significantly to dangerous climate change. The more coal that is burned, the warmer and more acidic the oceans become. Warming ocean temperatures are the main cause of the recent bleaching of the reef. Despite the much-publicised collapse of the coal industry, coal-fired power stations are still the world’s biggest source of CO2 emissions, and bear an even greater share of historical emissions. That gives the industry primary responsibility for the climactic changes we are experiencing now, including the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. The reef has undergone three mass bleaching events that we know of, all during the last 20 years. The first two affected about 60% of the reef; this year’s has affected 93%, and about half of the bleached coral is expected to die. New technologies, coupled with new commitment from the world’s governments, might save the reef. But if we continue to burn fossil fuels, it has little chance of survival. Attenborough’s point about the high visibility of the reef’s biodiversity – the fact that you can see hundreds of the reef’s many thousands of species on a single dive – is of key significance. One of Greenpeace’s original goals was to provide people with a clear view of what industries tried to hide – environmental destruction carried out away from prying eyes, normally at sea. But the reef is one of the world’s most dived areas. Amazingly, despite this, the Australian government is ignoring this environmental catastrophe and refusing to recognise the damage caused by coal. Climate campaigners are used to trying to motivate people around a disaster that unfolds silently over decades, but this is different. You are living through the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. Half of it is dead or dying now, because of our addiction to fossil fuels. James Delingpole, chief climate change denier on the far-right website Breitbart, tweeted: “I’ve seen it already so I don’t care. In fact I’m glad because it makes my experience rarer and more special.” As we delay phasing out coal and other fossil fuels, we condemn natural wonders such as the reef to extinction. But we can still learn from the huge bleached skeleton sunk off Australia’s coast. There is no slack left in the system. We cannot keep heading in the same direction and then perform some miraculous handbrake turn just before we reach “catastrophic climate change”. Climate change is already catastrophic, and it’s going to get more catastrophic. The faster we get our act together the more we will save, but every delay in cleaning up our act, every new coalmine and every new airport, is a death sentence for something or someone. The signing of the Paris agreement a fortnight ago is a real cause for optimism in the fight against climate change. With 175 signatories – the most countries ever to sign any international agreement at the same time – it felt like the start of a new era. With the Great Barrier Reef dying before our eyes, it couldn’t have come at a better time. Happy birthday, David Attenborough."

"Hundreds of environmental activists have invaded the UK’s largest opencast coalmine and halted operations across the vast site. Dressed in red boiler suits, groups of protesters crossed barbed wire fences to gain access to Ffos-y-fran mine near Merthyr Tydfil in south Wales. Some chained themselves to machinery, others lay across access roads.

Following a weekend of planning, protesters entered the site shortly after dawn on Tuesday. They had widely publicised their action and there was a large police presence including thesouth Wales force’s mounted section but no attempt was made to stop the demonstrators.  Within hours Reclaim the Power said it had brought operations at the mine to a standstill. Nine people, including an 80-year-old from Penarth and members of Christian Climate Action, were locked to each other, blocking road access to the mine.  #EndCoal stopping that machinery from going. pic.twitter.com/qNnOVjgm8d Hannah Smith, on site at the action, said: “Today we’ve shut down the UK’s largest coalmine because we must keep fossil fuels in the ground to stop catastrophic climate change.” Explaining the significance of the vivid red clothing the protesters wore, she said: “Continuing to dig up coal is a red line for the climate that we won’t allow governments and corporations to cross. We are taking action in solidarity with the local community who have been battling Ffos-y-fran for nearly a decade, and now face the threat of a new mine next door. Ffos-y-fran mine protest pic.twitter.com/YhM6affsa5 “Wales deserves a transition away from dirty coal, and the creation of sustainable employment in an economy that respects our planet and its inhabitants, now and in the future.” The demonstration comes days before the Welsh assembly elections. Smith added: “With Wales going to the polls this Thursday and the climate crisis more urgent than ever, our action sends a bold signal that we must end coal now.” Speaking from the heart of the mine, Sophie Stephens, a project manager from London, said the site felt “quite formidable” but said the atmosphere among protesters was good. She said some had played football and volleyball within the site. Workers had watched but not tried to step in as placards were strung between giant machines.  Among the activists outside the HQ of mine operator Miller Argent was Coralie Datta, from Leeds, who said the idea was to stop traffic going in and out. “We’re not setting out to be arrested – we’re just going to have a party here.”  Protestor Coralie Datta on why she has joined the demo at Ffos-y-fran mine. https://t.co/Z6TQZvkQkI Andrew Dey and Maya Williams, from London, were there with their six-month-old son Robin.

The UK government is failing to act to cut our carbon emissions, instead it is decimating the renewables industry, pursuing fracking and continuing the operation of opencast mines; the UK’s climate change and energy policies are in crisis.” Miller Argent declined to talk to the Guardian. A spokesman told the BBC that the discussion around climate change needed to be “more balanced”. He said the miners were proud of the job they did, which included supporting the steel industry.

It aims to extract up to 11m tonnes in all. It says it has created “high quality jobs” for more than 200 people – 85% of whom live within 10 miles of the site. It has put forward plans to open a second mine nearby at Nant Llesg. Caerphilly county council rejected the application for the new mine but Miller Argent is seeking to overturn this decision."
"As the fire that ravaged Fort McMurray finally moves past the city, and the province tallies the heartbreaking damage, a search will begin to discover the source of the destruction. Investigators will comb the nearby forests for clues, tracing the fire’s path to what they call its “point of origin.” They’ll interview witnesses, collect satellite imagery, and rule out natural causes—much like the work of detectives.  Except in the age of climate change-fuelled mega-fires, this truly is a crime scene.  Not, I mean, the handiwork of troublesome teenagers, nor a campfire left accidentally burning. The devastation of Fort McMurray is the predictable outcome of arson on an entirely different scale.  These arsonists have a name and they’re hiding in plain view—because their actions, at the moment, are still considered legal. They’re the companies that helped turn the boreal forest into a flammable tinder-box. The same companies that have undermined attempts to rein in carbon emissions. The same companies that, by their very design, chase profits with no mind for the ecological and human consequences. Yet in the fire’s aftermath, it has seemed impossible to name them: fossil fuel corporations. Of course they’re not the only ones who have fuelled climate change: all of us consume oil at every level of our lives. But the record is clear that we are not equally responsible: an astonishing 90 companies alone have caused two-thirds of global carbon emissions. And all the oil giants involved in the Alberta tar sands are among them: ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Total, CNRL, Chevron. In the last week, these corporations have escaped accountability as quickly as ordinary Albertans have risen to action. Across the province, people have opened their homes to evacuees, offered gas, shared food. The most marginalized have given the most: First Nations welcoming thousands to their communities; Muslims praying for rain at the Alberta legislature; and Syrian refugees, barely resettled in the province, gathering donations. Stories of heroism have abounded: like the school principal who drove a bus full of children out of the burning city, reuniting each one with their families, and filling extra seats with strangers from the roadside. At almost a moment’s notice, a province often written off as dog-eat-dog individualists proved the naysayers wrong: they have come together in a spirt of fellowship and solidarity. Most of these people had no idea of the disaster that was coming. But there were some who did: the corporate arsonists themselves. As far back as forty-five years ago, certain Canadian oil corporations already knew the lethal climate consequences of their business model. Last month, building on similar revelations about US companies, investigative reporters discovered stunning proof in the archives of a Calgary museum—a clue as good as any about this mega-fire’s “point of origin.” An uncovered report produced in 1970 by Imperial Oil, the Canadian branch of ExxonMobil, put it crystal clear: “Since pollution means disaster to the affected species, the only satisfactory course of action is to prevent it.” Except the oil company proceeded to spend decades lying about what they knew, and ensured the disaster would be as profound as possible. Little wonder the same company report branded its own actions as “anti-social.” The very picture of anti-social? A fire ripping through a city. The incineration of homes. Irreplaceable possessions and family albums burned to ash. Climate refugees spilling across a province and country, stripped of their livelihoods and uncertain of their future. Science may not show a direct link between climate change and the existence of one particular fire, but there is no doubt why the blaze that devoured the Alberta town was so powerful. “We have loaded the dice for more extreme wildfires,” says Mike Flannigan, a wildfire scientist at the University of Alberta. “We attribute the increase in wildfires and their severity and intensity to human-caused climate change. We’ve been saying it for years. Many of us saw a Fort McMurray-like situation coming, but none of us expected anything as horrific as what has happened.”  Today, twice as much land in Canada is being devoured by fires as in the 1970s—and that will double or quadruple again in the decades to come. Climate change is putting such pressure on the boreal, which covers most of northern Canada, that a study published last year in the journal Science issued a stark warning: “this forest will convert to a type of savannah.” To remain mute about those responsible for this devastation is not an act of sensitivity toward the citizens of Fort McMurray. It is to stand idly by while these corporations move on to claim their next victims. To argue, as prime minister Justin Trudeau has, that making the connection between climate change and this infernal fire isn’t “helpful,” is not a gesture of statesmanly maturity. It is the prevarication of political cowards. Other politicians have adopted an even more toxic approach: not letting the crisis go to waste. Former Conservative natural resources minister Joe Oliver argued on national television that Trudeau should seize the fire as an opportunity to force through a tar sands pipeline to the coast. And British Columbia premier Christy Clark insisted the economic impact of the blaze could be balanced by ramming oil and liquified natural gas projects through the regulatory process—doubling down on what helped cause this crisis in the first place. In the days ahead, watch for this argument to grow even louder.  But the greatest model of insensitivity is this: the arsonists don’t seem content with the burning of just one Canadian town. The latest climate science has told us exactly how much fossil fuels we can burn before we lock in catastrophic warming—warming that will make today’s mega-fire look modest. But companies have access to four or five times that amount in their reserves. They plan to extract and burn it all. If we want to contain warming to the Paris climate accord’s target of 1.5 degrees, we will need to keep most fossil fuels in the ground—to strand these assets and shift to clean energy. But corporations have no such intention. “We don’t see any stranded assets. We think all our assets will be required,” an ExxonMobil spokesperson said after the signing of the Paris accord. It “reinforces our approach,” Shell added. In other words, they’re bent on arson on a global scale. The law is finally catching up to this planet-altering recklessness. In the United States, both California and New York’s attorneys general are investigating ExxonMobil for spending decades misleading the public about its knowledge of the risks of climate change. Meanwhile, both Democratic presidential candidates have joined the chorus of voices demanding the federal Department of Justice join the investigation. Last month, lawyers in the Philippines launched another precedent-setting case: a lawsuit against fifty of the world’s fossil fuel companies for damages the country has suffered from climate change-driven hurricanes. This path should show the way forward for Canada, entrenching a basic moral principle: the polluter pays. Fossil fuel companies shouldn’t be celebrated for the minimal corporate paternalism they are now demonstrating—housing, feeding and flying evacuated workers out of Fort McMurray and the surrounding work camps. They should be footing the bill for the devastation. They invested billions in an industry knowing it would prove destructive to the air, water, climate, and health of Albertans? It’s time to put our hands—through higher taxes, royalties, even a public takeover—on some of their gargantuan profits, and use them to transition to a new economy full of good clean jobs and beyond these dangerous energy sources. That would mean rejecting the lopsided sacrifice currently demanded of us: that corporations derive the rewards while we cover their damages. Canada’s fossil fuel companies have vacuumed billions in profits out of Alberta, and used their political influence to prevent the emergence of a more diversified economy in a province with incredible renewable energy potential. Yet the relief and recovery effort, which may cost upward of $10bn, will be paid for by the government and taxpayers. The donations offered by individual Canadians are a testament to incredible generosity: they also represent an outsourcing of responsibility. But that spirit of solidarity and mutual aid, of compassion and confidence in each other, is the best expression of ourselves. It points the way forward. Two people tragically died in the evacuation of Fort McMurray—but many more no doubt were saved, by courage and heroism and the deep care and love for fellow citizens that can flourish in a period of catastrophe. Such are the values we will need to mount a collective fight against the unfolding disaster of climate change. Imagine these values actually governing our society—for a start, relaxing EI rules to ensure dignity for all of the evacuated workers. Imagine this resiliency, courage and generosity being harnessed to lead the transition to a healthier, more just post-carbon society—helping prevent even more extreme weather to come. Imagine the rebuilding of Fort McMurray being not just a page turned on an unprecedented disaster, but the beginning of a new direction. If that can happen, the smoke will truly lift from this country and this town. On Twitter: @Martin_Lukacs"

"The idea that renewable energy can power the UK is an “appalling delusion”, according to the final interview given by former chief scientific adviser, the late Professor Sir David MacKay. The sensible energy and climate change plan for the UK, MacKay said, was for the country to focus on nuclear power and carbon capture storage technology, which traps the carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning. In that scenario, the amount of wind and solar the UK needed would be almost zero, he said. However, solar could be a very important power source in other countries, he said, where sunny summers coincided with a big demand for electricity for air conditioning. Prof MacKay also said electric cars are going to be a “massive hit” but said he was “very disappointed” by the lack of progress on CCS, after the government cancelled a pioneering £1bn programme at the last minute. Prof MacKay was a physicist at the University of Cambridge and served as chief scientific adviser to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) from 2009-2014. He had gained public prominence after writing a book, Sustainable Energy - without the Hot Air, which assessed the potential of energy technologies from physical principles.  The interview with author Mark Lynas was given 11 days before his death from cancer on 14 April and released with the permission of his wife. Prof MacKay argued that solar, wind and biomass energy would require too much land, huge battery back-ups and cost too much to be a viable option for the UK.  “There is this appalling delusion that people have that we can take this thing that is currently producing 1% of our electricity and we can just scale it up and if there is a slight issue of it not adding up, then we can just do energy efficiency,” he said. “Humanity really does needs to pay attention to arithmetic and the laws of physics – we need a plan that adds up.” Prof MacKay had previously avoided being drawn into the political debate about energy, but told Lynas: “I have always tried to avoid advocating particular solutions but maybe because time is getting thinner I should call a spade a spade.” The key for the UK, he said, was a zero-carbon solution that works in the winter, when energy demand is highest but sunshine is lowest and winds can drop for days at a time. “The sensible thing to do for a country like the UK, I think, is to focus on CCS, which the world needs anyway, and nuclear,” said Prof MacKay.  The decision on a new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point, which the government hopes will be the first of a new generation of plants, has been delayed until September. “Then if you ask what is the optimal amount of wind and solar to add in then the answer is going to be almost zero,” he said. “I love wind turbines – they are the cathedrals of the modern age – but they are a waste of money if you have a low carbon solution that gets you through the winter … because when the wind blows you are going to have to either turn them down or something else down that you have already paid for like nuclear or CCS.” Prof MacKay acknowledged this plan was based on his “political value judgements” but added: “The [British public] do seem to care quite a lot about the cost so we should be looking for a low carbon solution that is low cost. If they had different values, the way the Germans seem to be – ‘we don’t care what our energy prices are’ – then maybe you come up with a different attitude and say let’s have the country be filled with wind turbines and big storage facilities.” Prof Mackay said civil servants in Decc had assessed solar and found the numbers did not add up for the UK: “The only reason solar got on the table was democracy. The MPs wanted to have a solar feed-in-tariff. So in spite of the civil servants advising ministers, ‘no, we shouldn’t subsidise solar’, we ended up having this policy. There was very successful lobbying by the solar lobbyists as well. So now there’s this widespread belief that solar is a wonderful thing, even though … Britain is one of the darkest countries in the world.” But Prof MacKay said all energy plans had to be country specific and solar was a good option for hot, sunny nations: “Anywhere you have a correlation between solar and demand, it definitely looks solar is going to be a really, really good idea.”  He added: “Society stops functioning if we don’t have a reliable electricity system going all the time and so for places like Las Vegas, for example, you are still going to need other technologies in that mix. I’d advise Las Vegas to get a nuke.” Prof MacKay stressed the importance of CCS, endorsing other analyses that indicate that the costs of tackling climate change are much higher without the technology. “The lack of progress is very disappointing,” he said, “I had really hoped the UK would be one of the leaders of the development of CCS technology for the world. All the models show CCS is an essential technology, if you want to make cost effective climate change pathways. Asked what technologies he was optimistic about, Prof MacKay singled out electric cars as very promising: “I think electric vehicles are going to be a massive hit, just as people went from cassette to modern iPods. That is going to be a very positive development.”"
"Forty years ago, the wife of the editor at the local paper for the remote Lofoten islands in Norway’s far north had an idea to boost its tiny circulation. The newspaper started to award a bag of coffee and a certificate to any angler who landed a cod over 30kg (66lb). Now the paper’s records, painstakingly compiled over the decades, bear witness to a remarkable outcome of climate change and far-sighted fisheries management. The catch of monster cod has exploded in the last five years, as the fish have feasted on shoals of capelin thriving in warmer waters. Meanwhile, commercial fishing has been tightly controlled, allowing the fish to age and grow … and grow and grow.  Anglers are catching unheard of numbers of kaffetorsk, or “coffee cod”, and the Lofoten Post has had to give away almost half a tonne of coffee this year. As of last weekend, 490 giants had been reported, up from 289 last year and just 49 in 2010. The biggest was 45kg (99lb). Managing cod stocks is not rocket science – it is much more complicated than that “Commercial fishing and angling are extremely important for Lofoten, and the kaffetorsk have become a concept, almost a brand,” says Kai Nikolaisen, the paper’s official coffee-cod correspondent. “I walk through the harbour and fishermen say look, that’s the kaffetorsk guy. When I started the job in 2006, we had only a dozen such fish every year.” Commercial fishermen support the Lofoten Post’s less than scientific observations. “We’ve seen a lot of big cod this season, that’s a fact – this year seems to have been extraordinary,” says Jan-Erik Indrestrand for the Norwegian Fishermen’s Association, the professional fishing union. Anglers have come from abroad to enjoy the bonanza. Last month British pensioner Bert Williams reeled in a 42kg (93lb) animal, the largest ever caught by a Briton, further north up the coast at Sørøya. Two weeks earlier a Swede, Marica Eriksson, broke the world record for a fish landed by a woman, at 38kg (84lb).  The phenomenon of massive cod is partly due to the warming climate, which has greatly expanded the area where the cod can feed, says Knut Korsbrekke, a specialist at the Institute of Marine Research in Bergen. But Norway also began to place limits on the commercial harvest in the 1980s, and this is bearing fruit, he says. In 1989, after an “extreme cooling event” in the Barents Sea when stocks declined rapidly, Norway and Russia agreed to close down the fishery altogether. “Try doing that in the EU,” says Korsbrekke, who compares the “huge success” of Arctic fisheries management with the North Sea, where overfishing has meant cod populations are still only a quarter the size they were in the 1970s. North Sea cod stocks are a “terrible mess”, he says, as countries haggle over quotas. In contrast, Norway and Russia have a long history of successful cooperation. “Managing cod stocks is not rocket science – it is much more complicated than that,” Korsbrekke says. Each female lays some 8m eggs, 1.3mm across; at peak spawning in early spring, the density of eggs can be as high as 28,000 per square metre. Were all the Barents Sea spawn to be placed side by side, an egg at a time, they would stretch for more than 1bn km, Korsbrekke has calculated. But only two eggs per female survive to become mature fish. It takes between 10 and 15 years for them to grow to 30kg, and perhaps as long as 20 – fish can be aged by counting the growth rings in an ear bone, like a tree. And while some cod can live 30 years, the potential for them to grow so large depends on availability of food, and modest harvesting rates. Favourable conditions due to climate change have happened before – the 1930s saw a similar warm period when cod stocks took off, and huge fleets of trawlers landed hundreds of thousands of tonnes before the war. But it is not easy to predict whether the current trend towards an abundance of Barents Sea cod will continue, Indrestrand says. Russia is reporting “vast amounts” of small cod at great depths in the east, possibly related to falling temperatures. “It is normal that the bigger fish arrives first, while in the later part of the season we see a more mixed population with a lot more of the smaller, more normal, fish,” Indrestrand says. “So the big cod may not reflect the real situation in the stock.” Commercial fishermen used to be at loggerheads with scientists demanding stock control, says Korsbrekke. “But we have established a level of trust – we are working for the fisherman too, to create a healthy ecosystem that can be harvested sustainably. As soon as they realise that our objectives coincide, they cooperate.” Norwegian anglers have had their share of luck, with the warming climate roughly doubling the area where the cod can thrive and reach such staggering size. But they are also reaping the rewards of human intervention, Korsbrekke says. “It pays to utilise the resource in a rational way.”"

"Would it surprise you to learn that governments, oil companies, NGOs and major investors are coming together to map—and to motivate—the decarbonization of the global economy? The Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC) is a policy-focused alliance of national and subnational governments, intergovernmental agencies, businesses and institutional investors, nonprofits and stakeholder networks. It was launched on the first day of the Paris climate negotiations, and its mission is simple: to collaborate across borders, across sectors, sharing information, know-how and capacity, to build the most economically efficient tools for decarbonization into every nation’s climate plan as soon as possible.  The Paris Agreement calls for non-state support for national climate action. The 17th Sustainable Development Goal is devoted to partnerships that build capacity and speed implementation. At the CPLC table, all of the partners are peers, and this takes the project well beyond the the conventions of global governance: honest and capable support for success is the shared focus, so governments and leading businesses work with intellectuals and policy advocates, to ensure no good thinking is left off the menu. Asked why he sees this multi-sectoral collaboration as so crucial to success in combating climate change, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said “Putting a price on carbon pollution will cut emissions, improve people’s health, and spur new investments in clean technology,” adding that success “will have a clear impact on our efforts to end extreme poverty in the world in 15 years.” When Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Hailemariam Dessalegn joined the Carbon Pricing Panel last fall, he said his nation wanted to ensure it followed the most cost-effective route to leadership in the 21st century clean economy. Last week, he said he aims “to build a climate-resilient green middle-income economy.” Ethiopia will also produce “recommendations on the role and possible forms of carbon pricing policies in Ethiopia, which might also be applicable to similar low-income developing countries.” On Friday, April 15, the CPLC held its first ever High-Level Assembly, a governance meeting bringing together leading diplomats, heads of government, and executive representation of all Coalition partners. Ségolène Royal, Minster of Environment for France, and Feike Sijbesma, CEO of Royal DSM, co-chaired the Assembly. They were joined by Dr. Kim, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, OECD Secretary General Angel Gurría, and Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan of Côte d’Ivoire. In her opening remarks to the inaugural governing Assembly, Minister Royal called for carbon pricing that is “high enough, significant enough to have a clear and rapid impact on various behaviors, namely on investment choices.” Royal, who is now also President of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Convention, added that “This is the key element of the Paris Agreement.” Specifically, Article 4 of the Paris Agreement calls on all nations to “promote environmental integrity, transparency, accuracy, completeness, comparability and consistency, and ensure the avoidance of double counting” in designing policy strategies that track, limit or eliminate carbon pollution. Article 6 outlines ways to transition market mechanisms developed under the Kyoto Protocol into a sharing of responsibility for climate action across borders, in fulfillment of new national climate action commitments.  As a venue to share policy aims, build new collaborative strategies, and work toward ensuring best practices are made available to all policy-makers, the CPLC has a real chance to ensure effective, efficient, and equitable strategies are part of every nation’s climate action agenda. Some approaches focus on covering one or more sectors of the economy—power generation, transport, agriculture. Others prioritize rewarding early actors while limiting emissions overall. But a simple fee applied to carbon-emitting fuels at the source with revenues recycled back into the economy can cover all sectors while adding day to day economic value at the human scale. It is due to the already serious work being done between the CPLC partners that six heads of state, along with the leaders of the World Bank, IMF and OECD, were able to issue such a bold call to action on the day before the Paris Agreement was signed. Their Vision Statement calls for an expansion in carbon pricing policies from covering 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions now to 25% by 2020, then doubling again to 50%within ten years. Those targets are the framing of a 10-year vision for broadening carbon pricing coverage, deepening carbon pricing where it exists, and expanding and enhancing international cooperation, through a well-designed, diverse, multisectoral coalition of working partners. This first-of-its-kind international policy collaboration is an effort to ensure we transition efficiently to climate-smart energy practices. No community should suffer the degradation brought on by pervasive climate disruption, and all nations can and should be part of a new and inclusive economy of sustainable shared prosperity.  Joseph Robertson is Global Strategy Director for the nonpartisan nonprofit organization Citizens’ Climate Lobby, and serves as CCL’s representative in Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition meetings. "
"Carbon dioxide emissions from the US’s energy sector fell in 2015 and now stand at 12% below 2005 levels, a drop mainly driven by the continuing collapse of the coal industry. Americans’ energy consumption resulted in the release of 5.2bn tons of CO2 last year, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), down from 5.4bn tons in 2014. The 12% cut since 2005 has come during a period in which the US economy has, adjusting for inflation, grown by 15%.   About a third of America’s emissions come from energy consumption, with transportation, industrial activity and agriculture also making significant contributions.  A flurry of coal plant retirements and an increase in the production of natural gas and renewable energy have pushed the US further towards the federal government’s goal of slashing emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2025, prompting some analysts to call for stronger measures to accelerate the decline. “I think we have still got some work to do,” said Colleen Regan, head of North American environmental markets at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “I think Obama has done a lot but the next president will need to do more to bring emissions down in transport and industry. “Maybe we should be asking the power sector to do more. It’s easier to reduce emissions in the power sector than in industry and we should be asked for the cheapest form of abatement. With the drops we’ve seen even without the Clean Power Plan, there’s scope to do more.” According to the EIA, the 2015 fall in emissions was largely due to “decreased use of coal and the increased use of natural gas for electricity generation”. Last year, coal made up 80% of all retired electricity-generating capacity, with plants shutting down across the midwest and south, particularly in Ohio, Georgia and Kentucky.  According to the Sierra Club, 232 coal plants have been retired in total. The closures have become enmeshed in the US presidential race, with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump last week donning a miner’s helmet in West Virginia and promising to get laid-off miners back to work.  However, the low price of natural gas and ageing infrastructure has caused seemingly intractable headaches for the coal sector, including the company Peabody Energy, which went from market leader to bankruptcy in April. US Environmental Protection Agency rules to curb mercury and other toxins at coal plants, which kicked in last year, have also had an impact. This trend could be accelerated by the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which places limits upon power plant emissions. The plan is currently on hold pending a supreme court challenge from states that claim it will place an undue cost upon the public. Regan said the plan was a “backstop” that may not prove crucial if natural gas prices remain favorable. “Natural gas isn’t clean, but it’s much cleaner than coal, so I think we are in pretty good shape,” she said. “If the natural gas price moves back up again, it becomes a concern.” Wind power, primarily in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, expanded the most of all clean technologies in 2015, followed by solar. However, renewable sources of energy are moving up from a low base. “This progress puts America on a path toward meeting our international commitments, and is a direct result of moving our nation beyond coal and increasingly replacing it with clean energy like wind and solar,” said Mary Anne Hitt, director of the Sierra Club’s “beyond coal” campaign. “Our transition away from coal and toward a clean energy economy is one of the great climate success stories of the past decade, and it will continue to shape America’s energy landscape for decades to come as our grassroots movement to get off of fossil fuels continues to grow.”"

"Microbes are hardly the poster-children of climate change, but they have far more impact than polar bears on Earth’s carbon cycle – and therefore on our climate. A new study published Friday in Science Advances finds that seabed bacteria and archaea (which look like bacteria but have very different genetics and biochemistry) are sensitive to climate. Because their habitat covers 65% of the entire globe, they form a huge part of the biosphere and are important in the regulation of carbon in the deep ocean, which affects long-term climate change. The microbes in question are packed together in the top 15 centimeters of the deep ocean seabed, like rush hour commuters in a city metro, up to a million times more abundant than in the sunless ocean water, or buried in deeper layers of seabed sediments. Their city-like crowding is fueled by a sparse sordid snow of excrement and microscopic dead bodies from life in the upper ocean, far above them.  The scientists, led by Professor Roberto Danovaro of Polytechnic University of Marche in Ancona, Italy, collected 228 samples from various locations in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean, from a range of ocean depths (400 to 5570 meters deep) and a wide variety of ocean bottom temperatures. They measured the microbe populations using two independent DNA profiling techniques: “catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization” (thankfully abbreviated to “CARD-FISH”) and “quantitative polymerase chain reaction” (qPCR). They discovered that the seabed microbes thrive where water temperatures are cold, but their populations decline significantly as deep ocean waters warm. Professor Antonio Dell’Anno, one of the paper’s authors, told me: That is also linked to the fact that warmer deep-sea ecosystems have a low input of organic carbon supplied from the surface waters. In other words, their population is limited because their food is limited. Moreover, as the microbes warm so does their metabolic rate, requiring more food to survive, so the meagre food supports fewer individual microbes. The study also discovered that archaea make up a far larger proportion (11% to 31%) of the living matter in the ocean seabed than previously thought (less than 6%), and most of that population is made up of a temperature-sensitive group known as “Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota.” Professor David Archer of the University of Chicago calculated some years ago that there was an unexplained temperature-sensitive CO2 feedback that amplified the warm and cold cycles of the ice ages. He narrowed it down to the oceans, but it remains unsolved. I asked Professor Dell’Anno if deep seabed archaea might be the answer, but It’s too early to say: We do not know yet how temperature shifts can influence the biological interactions within food webs. We cannot yet predict whether prokaryotes will exacerbate or attenuate the magnitude of climate change on marine ecosystems, but they are expected to be a key component that is able to influence the oceans’ feedback on climate change. To move closer to an answer, the team is now looking to incorporate their results into new climate models, but it may be years before we fully appreciate the global impact of these tiniest of creatures. Howard Lee is a geologist and science writer who focuses on past climate changes."
"1. The prime minister says that by promising to cut emissions by 45% by 2030, rather than 26% to 28% (as the government has pledged) Labor is “doubling the burden” on Australians. But modelling commissioned by the Coalition from leading economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin showed that a 45% cut would shave between 0.5% and 0.7% from gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030, whereas a 26% cut would shave between 0.2 and 0.3%. In other words the difference in the economic cost of the Coalition’s target and Labor’s target is about 0.3% of GDP in 2030. That’s 0.3% of an estimated GDP of over $3.5 trillion. It’s not hard to work out that is not doubling an economic burden.  2. Greg Hunt and Barnaby Joyce have recycled the discredited claim that different modelling has shown that Labor’s 45% target will increase electricity prices by 78%. That is wrong. The numbers come from Treasury’s 2013 modelling from the Climate Change Authority. The CCA itself has said it is “incorrect” and “wrong” to interpret its report this way. Its former chairman, Bernie Fraser, said the claim was “weird” and “misleading”. The 78% increase refers to wholesale prices in a scenario where Australia did nothing at all, compared with a scenario where we reached a higher target using only a high carbon price. We have already decided doing nothing is not an option, and no political party is proposing to reach a target using only a carbon price. So the figure is entirely irrelevant to the debate. The McKibbin modelling is far more useful in estimating the costs of what might actually happen. 3. Scott Morrison claims Labor “learned nothing from the last election when voters said ‘no’ to a carbon tax” and is “bringing back ... a big thumping electricity tax” that will “punish Australian families”. Except it isn’t. It is proposing a separate intensity-based emissions trading scheme for the electricity sector, different from the ETS for heavy industry. This idea is very, very similar to one Malcolm Turnbull himself proposed as opposition leader in 2009, and very, very similar to the scheme “Direct Action” could be converted into after the election – something most in the business community assume will have to happen since Australia’s emissions are rising and Direct Action has little hope of reaching the government’s long term target. It’s the scheme the energy market regulator – the Australian Energy Market Commission – recommended that the government adopt in a submission last year and said could operate “without a significant effect on absolute price levels faced by consumers” and which state and federal energy ministers asked that body to develop further late last year. So if prices increase slightly – and they may – it’s a price rise the Coalition itself is very likely to find itself considering when it starts figuring out how to reshape Direct Action into something workable after the election. 4. Malcolm Turnbull says Labor’s proposed target is out of step with the rest of the world, because it is higher than the target he pledged at the Paris conference. But that’s not really right either. The Paris conference was a “bottom up” process, which means countries got to promise whatever they were prepared to do, and peer pressure was the only thing pushing them to higher levels of ambition. Many have judged the Coalition’s target to be too low to represent our fair share of the global effort. Analysis by Climate Action Tracker rates it as “inadequate” The CCA recommended a reduction of 40% to 60% on 2000 levels by 2030. The Climate Institute said the government’s target was “pathetically inadequate”. And the prime minister acknowledges that Australia will almost certainly have to increase its target over time, which raises the question as to whether we wouldn’t be better designing policy to achieve the emission reductions we know we are going to have to achieve. 5. The government claims the broader industrial ETS will be “yet another economic handbrake that Labor is putting on our economy”. But – evidently not keen to walk straight into another major scare campaign – Labor has gone to great lengths to make sure this claim cannot be substantiated. In its first stage, from 2018 to 2020, heavy industry will only have to buy permits over a yet-to-be-determined “cap”. If it’s a trade exposed industry and exceeds its “cap” those permits can all be bought on the international market. The cheapest of those permits, “certified emission reductions”, are selling for less than $1. So while we can’t calculate exactly what a particular firm might have to pay, it isn’t going to be much. After 2020 it will introduce a longer term industrial ETS, and also decide what other sectors might be covered, for example agriculture or road transport. Here the details become even more vague, with most to be determined in consultation with industry after a Labor government won office. And just in case anyone still had concerns, there’ll be a “strategic industries taskforce”, to help design the scheme, and a $300m fund to help hard-hit communities with the transition. Labor might be criticised for leaving important details until later, for erring on the side of caution, for claiming it will get to net zero emissions by 2050 without explaining exactly how it would do it. But it’s made absolutely sure it can’t be attacked for applying an economic handbrake on anything. 6. Which brings us to the final reason this new carbon tax scare campaign rings so totally hollow. Labor, and those in the Coalition who understand that climate change is a thing, are actually converging in their ideas about what policies Australia should adopt. They are moving towards sectoral, and maybe intensity-based, trading schemes and towards using a suite of policies (energy efficiency, vehicle standards, regulations) to get to our targets. And every interest group with a stake in this argument – business, environment groups, investors – are desperately willing the major parties to find some kind of consensus. The Business Council of Australia said Labor’s policy could be a “platform for bipartisanship”. They are right. And the barren, stupid climate wars and dumb fact-free scare campaigns are a guaranteed recipe for a terrible economic and environmental failure."
