"Hay fever season is under way in Britain and, thanks to record-breaking warm weather in February, many trees started producing pollen up to three weeks earlier than average. But if you think it is bad in the UK, try living in Tennessee. With a long growing season and geography that causes air to sit over the region for long periods, the southern state is the hay fever capital of the US.  Now the season is starting earlier and lasting longer. At the start of this month, allergy doctors were kept busy when a yellow haze blanketed much of the south-eastern US, caused by dense clouds of pollen carried on the breeze. Analysis of US weather data shows the growing season – from the last spring frost to the first autumn frost – has been increasing and is now an average of two weeks longer than it was in 1970. Meanwhile, about 30% of Americans have hay fever compared with 10% about 40 years ago. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, scientists estimate the average growing season across most of the US will be a month longer, piling on the misery for hay fever sufferers in Tennessee."
"New York City has approved an ambitious plan to combat climate change by forcing thousands of large buildings to slash their greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation passed on Thursday by the city council puts caps on carbon emissions for buildings over 25,000 sq ft – requiring a 40% overall cut in their emissions by 2030. The mandates, touted as a local version of the Green New Deal embraced by many progressive Democrats, will apply to 50,000 buildings – from buildings with a few dozen apartments to Trump Tower, the president’s Fifth Avenue skyscraper which advocates have targeted as a major polluter. “It will be the largest emissions reduction policy ever, in any city,” said the city councilman Costa Constantinides, who spearheaded the bills. The law puts caps on how many tons of carbon a building may produce per square foot, with different limits for residential, commercial and industrial buildings. To reach them, many buildings will have to replace heating or air conditioning systems with more efficient models or put in better insulation and windows. Or, they can use electricity from clean sources like solar and hydropower, which will not produce emissions. It is an attempt to tackle the biggest source of greenhouse gas in New York, where buildings account for about 67% of emissions. Real estate owners have opposed the plan, calling it too costly and too riddled with exceptions to be effective. “The approach taken today will have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain a broad range of industries, including technology, media, finance and life sciences, that provide opportunity and continued economic growth that is so important for our city,” said John Banks, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. Rent-stabilized apartments will be exempt from the caps, though they will be required to do some upgrades to improve energy efficiency. Churches, synagogues and mosques are also exempt, as is the city’s public housing system. Banks wrote that the exceptions unfairly leave “mostly market-rate housing and commercial buildings to shoulder the entire burden of what is undeniably a shared societal problem”. Buildings that violate the caps will face fines of $268 a year for every excess ton of carbon they put out – which could add up to millions of dollars for the worst offenders. The city is also aiming to set up a carbon trading program, though details have not been determined. By 2050, the aim is to cut the buildings’ emissions by 80%. The package, called the Climate Mobilization Act, also requires new buildings to put in green roofs or rooftop solar panels.  A New York panel has predicted sea level rises of up to 6ft if climate change goes unchecked, leaving wide swaths of the city in the path of floods. Mayor Bill de Blasio last month proposed building a new chunk of Manhattan to protect the existing island from rising seas. New York is one of a host of US cities and states that have vowed to drive down their carbon emissions despite a retreat at the federal level under Donald Trump, who withdrew from the landmark Paris climate change agreement. De Blasio plans to sign the legislation. “It’s going to revolutionize our ability to reduce emissions through our buildings, which are really our number one problem here in New York City,” he said this week. “We were going to need to do something very aggressive, particularly because the federal government is not doing their role.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt appears that now even Professor Chris Turney admits blaming his expedition mishap on global warming was an astronomical stretch after all.
Yesterday I reported here, quoting flagship Swiss daily (NZZ), that his communication director Alvin Stone blamed global warming for the vessel getting trapped in ice. The whole world laughed.
I couldn’t believe it myself so I wrote an e-mail to Stone asking if they really believed this.
Stone answered circa 9 hours later:
Dear Pierre,
That is not quite the quote that I gave.
This is my understanding from talking to Chris and other glaciologists.

The 120km long ice berg B09B that is grounded in Commonwealth Bay broke away from the continent three years ago, very likely as a result of climate change.
B09B collided with the Mertz Glacier, smashing a large ice tongue that released the ice into that area.
It was a mix of this ice that was blown across the path of the Shokalskiy, which led to it being trapped and explains why much of the ice surrounding the ship is old ice.

Chris discusses the situation in a blog entry, here.

I believe you are probably aware of a number of papers this year that show land ice on Antarctica is in decline and that only seasonal sea ice has been expanding, likely due to the increase in westerly winds and potentially because of the decrease in salinity.
Thanks for your interest.”
Here we see that the major backpedalling had already begun. This morning in a piece where the Guardian and Turney attempt to defend the expedition, Turney retracts the claim altogether, sort of: In the Guardian article he writes (my emphasis):
Let’s be clear. Us becoming locked in ice was not caused by climate change. Instead it seems to have been an aftershock of the arrival of iceberg B09B which triggered a massive reconfiguration of sea ice in the area.”
Note here how Turney continues to blame “unforeseen” events for the vessel’s fate, when it is now clear from postings and records that they new well in advance there was ice out there and a storm was approaching. His excuses may be anough for the average Guardian reader, but I don’t expect they’ll hold much water elsewhere.
Expect bogus commissions to clear Turney
I suspect in the end that a commission, even two or three of them, are going to be set up to investigate the whole thing. Then after some months each will issue an authoritive report claiming that although Turney could have done things better, all in all no serious violations were committed and he’ll be cleared. Of course everyone will know that the commissions were bogus. And later, with no one watching, future expeditions will be carried out under far stricter oversight.
In the end the taxpayer will pick up the rescue tab and legal expenses.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that North Sea storm “Xaver” is on its way out and the media hype begins to die down, the question of whether the storm was due to climate change is making the rounds. When Yolanda struck the Philippines early last month, the IPCC momentarily forgot its own science and hysterically blamed man-made CO2 for the catastrophe.

Xaver was just a normal storm, German warmist experts concede. (Photo by Beeston, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported). See here.
Yesterday as Xaver raged, Germany’s DWD Weather Service DPA news agency reported on findings specifically regarding the relationship between climate change and storm frequency and intensity. The DPA writes:

Even with the two storms ‘Christian’ and ‘Xaver’ over Germany this fall, experts see no sign of climate change from them. ‘What we are experiencing are single events’, emphasizes Gerhard Lux, meteorologist at the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Thursday. ‘Over the last 100 years there have always been small waves of more or fewer storms in Germany.’ Also around 1990 and 1999 there were phases with relatively more frequent storms.”


Few major media outlets have bothered to deliver these non-trivial, non-alarmist findings to the public. Why aren’t we surprised?
Higher frequency and intensity found only in model projections

The DPA then explains in its piece that North Atlantic storms are brewed especially when cold polar air masses clash against warm ones from the south. The DPA adds, quoting Lux:
‘For Germany we cannot detect any statistical increased in storm frequency.’ The same applies for storm intensity.”
The über-alarmist Potsdam Institute for climate Impact Research (PIK) models beg to differ, but the DWD statistics and observations are clear on that: Higher frequency and intensity exist only in the model projections, and not in reality.
IPCC scientist affirms one or two storms “not a trend”
Unexpectedly, German IPCC climate scientist Mojib Latif, ever so eager to grab the media spotlight, displayed an unusual level sobriety in response to yesterday’s storm. At Die Welt here he called storm Xaver “a normal autumn storm“:
Indeed we have had two violent storms in a short time, but we cannot discern any trend from that.”
That’s a flabbergasting admission from a leading proponent of the man-made global warming hypothesis. Perhaps Latif has come to realize the foolishness of his earlier claims and that the media attention isn’t worth it.

"The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has returned to the fray to warn dumping the national energy guarantee – a decision taken by Scott Morrison – will drive up power prices. Turnbull took exception to a column at the weekend characterising the national energy guarantee as “Malcolm Turnbull’s Neg”, pointing out the policy had strong support within the cabinet, “including and especially the current PM and treasurer”.  The former prime minister took to social media over the weekend to argue that a majority in the government wanted the policy to proceed but “a right wing minority in the party room refused to accept the majority position and threatened to cross the floor and defeat their own government”. “That is the only reason it has been abandoned by the government,” Turnbull said. “The consequence is no integration of energy and climate policy, uncertainty continues to discourage investment with the consequence, as I have often warned, of both higher emissions and higher electricity prices. “I am simply stating the truth: the Neg was designed and demonstrated to reduce electricity prices. So dumping it means prices will be higher than if it had been retained.” Labor has resolved to try to preserve the framework of the Neg, which imposes security and emissions reduction obligations on the energy sector, if it wins on 18 May. The government proposed an emissions reduction target of 26% and Labor is proposing a target of 45%. Labor is also proposing to keep another government policy mechanism, the safeguard framework, to drive down pollution in heavy industry, again with a higher emissions reduction target. A debate over climate and energy policy has dominated the opening full week of the campaign with Labor facing questions over the cost of its policies and the Coalition blasting Labor’s decision to use international permits, even though the government in 2017 supported their use. Labor has not done new economic modelling to outline the costs of its climate policies, but draws on work already in the public domain to argue the economy will continue to grow with higher pollution targets. Scott Morrison continued to blast Labor’s decision to use international permits over the weekend even though the Liberals had previously resolved to use them in its suite of climate policies and their use is widely supported by the business community. “Bill Shorten has a plan to reduce emissions by 1.3bn tonnes,” the Liberal leader said. “Now, one of the questions he won’t answer is what proportion of that 1.3bn tonnes is going to be satisfied by buying foreign carbon credits? “Now, today those credits cost about 43 Australian bucks per credit, OK? For those credits, that will go to $52 by 2030. Now, our best estimate is around half of him meeting that target will be through carbon credits purchased offshore. Now, that’s about $35bn. “It shouldn’t be hard for Bill Shorten to explain this simple question – of your 1.3bn, Bill, what share of those are going to be achieved by purchasing foreign carbon credits and at what price?” Shorten expressed his growing frustration with the trajectory of the debate over the weekend. “This has been a 10-year torture on climate change, where the climate has got worse, the extreme weather events have got worse, and this government is still trying to delay and discourage,” the Labor leader said. “Here is a bet, here’s a bet I’ll make you. Future generations are going to despise the politicians right now who refuse to take action on climate change”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMaverick meteorologist Pier Corbyn at his site here has issued a statement on the rescue of Professor Turkey and his global warming boatpeople.
As the story unfolds, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Turney’s preparation was really not quite up to standard, to put it kindly. I wrote about this at length 3 days ago here.
Funny how he made sure to have top journalists from the top media outlets right on the spot, yet couldn’t be bothered to seek out competent weather forecasting services. Eventually the expedition ended up relying on help from “denier” meteorologists. Oh the irony.
And as Anthony Watts now mentions here, it’s clear that they really did not charter the most adequate of vessels. Also it seems that communication with the Russian crew was a bit impaired by a language barrier. Did anything go right?
Piers writes:
The Ice will weaken as winds change in WeatherAction’s next big circulation change which is around ~17JAN so maybe by 20th or so they could have another go at getting the ship(s) out. We base this estimate on the fact that the world weather system is just that – a world system. Major changes in the NH circulation and Jet stream have correspondences in the SH. [Follow reports from our New Zealand & Australian subscribers and you can see that]. Subscribers to WeatherAction Eu /Br+Ir or USA will have noticed major changes in circulation through 17-20th and I estimate it is 80% likely this also means DIFFERENT winds in Antarctica which should do the business.
Of course when this happens the Warmist liars in BBC and the intellectually strained Independent, Guardian and New York Times will doubtless say the wind change is a sign of their lost Global Warming cause being redeemed.
I urge all who support evidence-based science and accountable policies THIS YEAR to give these fraudsters, spongers and thieves NO QUARTER WHATSOEVER. We have to make 2014 so uncomforable for them and their lie machine that they would wish they could return to the sanctuary of an ice-bound ship or a Russian jail to escape the wrath of the people who are now suffering – and some dieing – under rising fuel charges and hiked food prices and taxes which are a direct consequence of the insane policies these green parasites have foisted upon the world”.
Finally, I just get a kick out of the way Turney keeps insisting that weather down there is unpredictable and so none of it is his fault. Yet the guy turns right around and has the next person believing he can tell us what the climate will be in the year 2100!

"Police have warned Extinction Rebellion organisers that they face arrest if they incite protesters to block roads around Parliament Square. The Metropolitan police said it was imposing pre-emptive conditions restricting any demonstration outside the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday to the lawn in the centre of the square, after hearing that activists with the group planned to gather there. Protesters must clear the area by midnight, police said, and may not gather in Old Palace Yard, a site the group has requested as a permanent protest camp. In Parliament Square on Tuesday morning, a small crowd of Extinction Rebellion protesters who had been there since Monday waited for the main protest march to arrive. Amber, 23, who did not give her surname, said she was not hopeful the government would change its position on the climate emergency. “We just want to be heard … we have put a lot into these occupations and actions, now we just need some sort of engagement from the government. They have been on holiday so who knows – they might come back and want to engage properly, but I’m not hopeful.” Several hundred people arrived in Parliament Square just before midday on Tuesday, flags flying and drums beating. There was a big police presence as the protesters arrived in an attempt to prevent them blocking surrounding roads or Westminster Bridge. Clarissa Carlyon, from London, said: “We are coming into Parliament Square because we have captured the media’s attention and a lot of attention around the globe, and now it’s time for the politicians to come and talk to us.” Liam Geary Baulch, 26, also from London, said relations between the group and the police had become increasingly strained, with dismay over the Met’s decision to name those charged in connection with the protest and to seize a soundsystem it had been using at its base at Marble Arch. “We have seen thousands of people take non-violent action and over 1,000 arrests, yet we have had no complaints from the police about violence,” Geary Baulch said. “What there has been complaints about is that despite the civil relations between the officers on the ground and the activists, there has been a lack of respect by them releasing the names and locations of more than 50 of the people charged, so I think there has been a breakdown of trust between the people on the ground and some of the officers because that’s making these people vulnerable to being doorstepped by the press.” Activists were also surprised and dismayed by the police operation to seize their soundsystem on Monday night. “There were no liaison officers on shift, which I think was a big mistake, to do something that was going to make the crowd anxious,” Geary Baulch said, adding that the operation had also contributed to the breakdown of trust. Four activists had secured themselves up tall trees at the back of Parliament Square where they had dropped banners saying “eyes on government in action” and “May profiting from war: citizens assembly now.” Their friend, who was at the base of the trees, said they had climbed up in the early hours of the morning.  ""I've got a steeplejack with me, we are rigging the rest of the trees into Systems. We are going to set up a traverse and hang more banners.""Dav, 40, from Bristol, who is up a tree in #parliamentsquare for #extinctionrebellion pic.twitter.com/CptSHK2DZQ More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the past week in a campaign of mass non-violent direct action orchestrated by the group to highlight how little time the world has left to halt manmade ecological breakdown. Most have been arrested for breaching section 14 orders that restrict rights to protest in each location. But Tuesday’s order is the first to explicitly mention that organisers could be targeted for arrest. A statement circulated to the media said: “Any organiser or person taking part in the protest failing to comply with these conditions or inciting others not to comply with them will be committing an offence and will be liable to arrest.” Over the bank holiday weekend it took a mass police operation to clear Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square of the small festivals of protest, which included stages, sound systems, workshops, wellbeing tents and free food. Activists at each location had formed human barricades, securing themselves across roads and to key pieces of infrastructure using lock-on devices and superglue."
"Britain needs to reach, by no later than 2050, net zero emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This means any greenhouse gases we release must be balanced by the removal of an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. The 2050 deadline represents our fair share of international responsibility for implementing the Paris agreement on climate change and meeting its goal of holding the rise in average global temperature to well below 2C – and pursuing best efforts to limit warming to no more than 1.5C.  Until global emissions reach net zero, average temperature will continue to rise. It is already about 1C above its pre-industrial level, and is fundamentally altering the Earth’s climate. Extreme weather events – heavy rainfalls and heatwaves – have occurred, and sea levels have risen. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of very serious consequences if average temperature rises by more than 1.5C, with many millions more people threatened by food and water shortages, for instance. Worse, the higher that temperatures climb, the greater is the prospect of major catastrophic events occurring such as polar ice sheets in west Antarctica and Greenland being destabilised, leading to an inevitable sea-level rise of several metres. The 2008 Climate Change Act commits the UK to reducing its annual emissions by at least 80% by 2050. But that was based on the assumption that global average temperature would rise by up to 2C. Since then scientific evidence has emerged to suggest that this level of global warming would be too dangerous. The UK is leading by example and has already reduced its annual emissions by more than 43% since 1990, a period during which our economy has grown more than 75%, proving that tackling climate change does not mean financial ruin. But this has mainly been achieved by phasing out coal as a source of electricity. To reach net zero emissions by 2050, the UK needs strong action across the whole economy. We have many of the technologies we need already, and we will need to make more use of nuclear and renewable power. But it is not yet clear how we will, for instance, stop emissions from agriculture, including from livestock. We will need to make significant investments, but the returns will be huge, not just in terms of avoided climate change impacts, but also new opportunities for innovative UK businesses serving the growing global demand for zero-emissions technologies. A zero-emissions economy will be cleaner, smarter and more efficient, ensuring prosperity and wellbeing for current and future generations. Bob Ward is policy and communications director at the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science"
"Business groups are defying the Morrison government’s political assault on the use of international permits, arguing a credible climate policy should include access to high-quality international offsets, because they are a key mechanism to help Australia meet its Paris target. With climate change persisting as a significant campaign flashpoint, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, James Pearson, told Guardian Australia international permits were part of the toolkit for mitigating climate change in a cost-effective way.  “Australia’s carbon emissions reduction policies should be stable, predictable and provide long-term certainty for business,” Pearson said. “They should include access to credible international offsets; be market-based; implemented nationally; and minimise the potential for carbon leakage”. Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents institutional investors, such as super funds, with total funds under management of over $2tn, said international carbon credits were a key component of meeting Australia’s Paris targets. “They must have integrity and there should be limits on the amount you can use, but there is wide agreement that they have to be part of the policy toolkit,” Herd said. She noted that the Morrison government – despite its recent criticisms – had been “negotiating hard” for Article 6 of the Paris agreement “to support credible carbon markets which deliver access to international offsets for Australian business”. Herd pointed out that during the last climate change talks in Poland in December last year, that issue “was actually a core priority for Australian negotiators”. The Business Council of Australia and the AiGroup also pointed to their previous statements of support for the use of permits on Thursday. After days of the Coalition bombarding Labor’s climate policy, and in response to claims that business could be forced to spend between $25bn and $35bn on international credits to meet a 45% pollution reduction target, Bill Shorten muscled up on the hustings in Darwin on Thursday. Shorten abandoned the low-key demeanour he has made a study of projecting in the opening week of the campaign, and branded the government’s campaign against Labor’s climate change policies “malicious and stupid”. “It’s a malicious campaign by this government,” the Labor leader said. “What they want to do is scare Australians and say that it’s too hard to take action on climate change. “In climate change, there will never be enough figures to satisfy the climate sceptics. If you don’t believe in the science of climate change, no amount of evidence will ever convince you because, fundamentally, it’s a stupid position not to take action.” Labor is proposing an emissions reduction target of 45% and has signalled business will be permitted to use international permits to help meet its liabilities. Herd told Guardian Australia some of the cost estimates being deployed during the election campaign about permits appeared to be based on the European Unit Allowance, the compliance unit in the European Emissions Trading Scheme. “This is the most expensive reference price you could currently find,” she said. “Project-based international offset credits are usually much cheaper, especially if the company has in place a direct off-take agreement with the project”. She pointed out the local carbon price, the Australian Carbon Credit Unit, was also significantly cheaper than the European allowance price being quoted. “It looks like much of the commentary is potentially conflating the EU compliance price with international offsets, and then using it as a generic carbon price to calculate an inflated total cost of climate action for Australia. This is not helpful for anyone.” While Morrison is now pillorying the use of permits, the Coalition in 2017, when the current treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, was environment minister, took a decision “in principle” to allow the use of foreign carbon credits. When it reviewed its existing suite of climate change policies in late 2017, the government accepted the use of permits and said a final decision “on the timing of use and appropriate quantity and quality limits” would be taken by 2020. On Thursday, on the hustings in Tasmania, Scott Morrison declared Shorten “can’t even tell you how much money that companies are going to have to send offshore”. “The Australian reports today $25bn, we actually think it’s higher than that. I understand it’s around $35bn that they will force companies to send offshore for those foreign carbon credits. “That could be invested here in Australia, in employing more people, increasing wages.” Morrison also appeared to leave open the option the government could consider nuclear energy during a radio interview in Tasmania. He said the government didn’t intend to subsidise nuclear energy but it was “not, not on the agenda”, even though there are legislative bans on nuclear energy. The prime minister suggested the test of whether a project could proceed was whether it could pay its own way, and he said the evidence to date suggested nuclear power was too expensive."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite the hundreds of billions of dollars diverted into CO2 reduction, man-made CO2 gas emissions continue to rise unabated globally. The latest UNEP report says it sees very little chance of the world reaching CO2 reductions targets.
The ever widening gap
Yesterday the online Die Welt here reported that UNEP is warning of “a growing gap” between the target and actual emissions. The UN claims that only by meeting the CO2 reduction targets will it be possible to keep the planet from warming by 2°C by the years 2100. Alarmist scientists say 2°C of warming over pre-industrial level could send the planet over a tipping point. However the science underpinning those claims is very much in dispute.
The UN claims that it is necessary for the global population to reduce its CO2 emissions from 50.1 gigatonnes annually today to just 44 gigstonnes by 2020. However, rather than going down, CO2 emissions are growing, and doing so quite strongly despite the massive investments in renewable energies. Spiegel here writes that CO2 emissions are actually accelerating.
Die Welt adds that at the current rate of increase, CO2 emissions will rise to 59 gigatonnes by 2020, or more than 34% above the target of 44 gigatonnes. Therefore the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars on Co2 reduction has had no effect.

Shift moves to agriculture culprit
What’s remarkable about the latest UN report is that it shifts the focus to a new climate villain: agriculture. UNEP is now claiming that agriculture produces too much Co2 and that new agricultural techniques could lead to savings of 4.4 gigatonnes. The potential here, they claim, is greater than the potential in the electricity sector, where a maximum of 3.9 gigatonnes can be saved. Large CO2 savings can also be achieved sustainable forestry management, the report says.
UNEP completely ignores 15-year temperature stagnation
Die Welt points out that the UNEP in its latest report ignored the 15-year warming stop altogether:

The debate on the stagnation in climate warming over the past 15 years and on man’s share in warming was completely ignored in the calculations by the UNEP: The scientists continued to argue within the established paradigm of a manmade climate change.”

The UNEP is obviously living on another planet and refuses to believe that the climate catastrophe is not happening.

"Donald Trump issued on Monday an Earth Day proclamation that omitted any mention of climate change or the cavalcade of environmental threats posed by deforestation, species loss and plastic pollution. The president chose instead to praise the benefits of a “strong market economy”. In response, one leading climate scientist said Trump’s environmental policy was “in many cases the antithesis of protection”. The executive director of the Sierra Club said Trump was “the worst president for the environment our nation has ever had”. Trump praised the “abundant beauty and life-sustaining bounty” of the American environment but did not echo growing warnings from scientists over rising temperatures or the precipitous decline of many species. “Environmental protection and economic prosperity go hand in hand,” Trump said in his message for Earth Day, a global event held to support environmental protection annually since 1970. “A strong market economy is essential to protecting our critical natural resources and fostering a legacy of conservation. My administration is committed to being effective stewards of our environment while encouraging opportunities for American workers and their families.” Trump added: “At the same time that our nation is experiencing historic economic and job growth, our air and water quality ranks among the highest in the world.” He stated that his administration has “expanded support for conservation of land, water and wildlife”. Last year, US government scientists issued a 1,000-page climate change assessment that warned the country faces hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses due to rising temperatures, flooding and wildfires. Thousands of Americans are expected to die in worsening heatwaves, with diseases such as West Nile, dengue fever, chikungunya and Lyme set to expand in range as temperatures rise and rainfall patterns change. “The fact that they’re not mentioning what many consider to be the gravest existential threat facing humanity is a good indication of the priorities of this administration,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University. “The clear priority of the administration is extracting unsustainable short-term profits from the environment, which is in many cases the antithesis of environmental protection. This is not surprising.” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, called Trump “the worst president for the environment our nation has ever had”, adding: “He has regularly and consistently prioritized the profits of corporate polluters over clean air, clean water and the health of our communities. “The fact that he continues to ignore the climate crisis endangers the nation and will be viewed by history with scorn.” Trump has routinely disparaged climate science and has attempted to dismantle every major policy aimed at lowering planet-warming emissions, favoring a watered down alternative his administration admits would cause an extra 1,400 deaths a year from air pollution. In June 2017, he announced the withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate deal. The administration has thrown open vast tracts of public land and almost all US waters to oil, gas and coalmining, removed protections from some prized landscapes and scrapped rules that stopped mining waste being dumped into rivers. Trump, who recently erroneously claimed that wind turbines cause cancer, has repeatedly stated that the US has some of the cleanest air and water in the world. In fact, while the US’s air is generally far healthier than growing economic powers such as China and India, the American Lung Association has pointed out that four in 10 Americans still live in counties with harmful levels of smog. Millions of Americans are also exposed to drinking water containing industrial chemicals, while lead in water remains a widespread issue five years after the notorious contamination in Flint, Michigan."

Share this...FacebookTwitterEven the prominent German online DIE WELT reports here that Pacific islands are not in danger because they are growing and keeping ahead of rising sea levels. When Germany starts reporting such things, then you know the warmists are sinking fast.According to a very basic but indisputable study, scientists Paul Kench of the University of Auckland and Arthur Webb of the Geosciences Commission of the Fiji Islands simply compared aerial photographs of 27 islands taken in the 1950s and compared them to satellite photos and determined that only 4 islands have gotten smaller. DIE WELT reports:
Climate change and rising sea levels have no effect because many Pacific islands have been  growing over the last 60 years, rather than sinking. That’s the result of a study that contradicts all expectations, reports the British magazine New Scientist.
23 islands were as big or even bigger.
So you mean the Pacific islands aren’t sinking! Afraid not. You AGW alarmists have been screwed again.
The islands are growing because they are made up of dying coral reefs. The coral reefs are living organisms, and so they keep reproducing and thus keep adding more material to the ever-growing islands.

Webb also notes that hurricane Bebe washed roughly 140 hectares of sediment onto the island, increasing its size by a whopping 10% in a single shot. Now there’s new beachfront property for the island. DIE WELT writes:
The study shows that rising sea levels don’t always threaten these islands. ‘Everyone claimed that sea levels are rising and the islands are drowning. But they are not. Sea levels are rising, but the islands are responding accordingly.’
But the scientists warn!!
If the sea level rises more quickly, then sediment accumulation will not keep up and the islands will drown.
Really? Well, I’m sure the inhabitants are just shaking at the knees. Don’t count on it. As the islands continue to grow, they are most likely laughing at the rest of the world, for having suckered it with yet another phony scare story.

"Britain is set for a sunny Easter bank holiday weekend, with temperatures potentially breaking national records. Temperatures reached 25C (77F) on Good Friday and were forcecast to hit 27C on Monday.  The Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said there would be dry, sunny and very warm conditions with temperatures continuing to rise slightly on Saturday and Sunday to a possible 27C on Easter Monday. The Met Office said it would be “a glorious day” in most areas, but that outbursts of rain might clip north-west Scotland on Saturday. On Saturday, temperatures broke records in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with both areas seeing their warmest ever Easter Saturday. Temperatures reached 23.2C in Scotland, compared to a previous record high of 21.4C. For Northern Ireland it was 21C on Saturday, compared to the previous record of 19.4C. Easter Sunday and Monday records are likely to be broken, according to the Met Office. The warmest Easter on record was on Easter Sunday in 1949, when the temperature was recorded at 29.4C in Camden Square, north London.In 2011, the temperature reached 26.9C at St James’s Park in central London on Good Friday, and 25.3C on Easter Sunday and 24C on Easter Monday, both in the Solent. Roberts said these last two temperatures were the ones that could beexceeded this weekend. She said the highest temperature on Friday was 24.5C, recorded at Wisley in Surrey. Southern England and south Wales could experience mist and fog, but that would dissipate pretty quickly in the morning with the strong sunshine. Roberts said cloud and rain would disappear by Monday. The warmest Easter Mondays recorded nationally were 21.4C in Culzean Castle, Scotland, in 2014, 23.2C in Nantmoor, Wales, in 1984, and 21.1C in Knockarevan, Northern Ireland, also in 1984. One person tweeted: “Last night is the very first night this year I’ve slept with the window open. And how did I spend the hottest day of the year so far? At work!” Others expressed concern about the high temperatures, with one person tweeting: “I think the new story here is the fact that the planet is about to be incinerated with climate change.” Hundreds of demonstrators were in London this weekend as part of the Extinction Rebellion protest over climate change. The Metropolitan police said 106 people had been arrested on Friday, bringing the total number of arrests to 682 since the action started on Monday. Emma Thompson, who joined the climate action protest, told activists her generation had failed young people."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCOP 19 in Warsaw is fast approaching and part of the ritual is the ringing of climate disaster alarms, much like churches ring their church bells on Christmas Eve.
The Die Welt article here tries to explain to readers why the climate catastrophe is still approaching even if temperatures haven’t risen in 15 years. The German daily tries to give the impression that it has the explanation for the temperature stagnation, but later in the article we see that it concedes it’s pretty much all speculation.
Die Welt writes that the high temperatures are hiding in the ocean depths and that it’s only a question of time before they reappear in the atmosphere with a vengeance. The German daily quotes alarmist scientists who claim that skeptics are “misinterpreting the data” when they insist the warming has stopped.
So where has the heat gone? Die Welt quotes Stefan Rahmstorf and a TV weatherman to explain it:
In the oceans. The world’s oceans are the biggest heat storages. When vertical currents such as those of the recent years provide for a colder sea surface, the oceans are able to take up more heat. […] ‘The greenhouse effect has not let up; it’s just that there is now more heat in the deep ocean and less at the surface,’ says climate scientist Rahmstorf.”
German TV weatherman Sven Plöger adds:
“The southern oceans are able to absorb an unbelievable amount of energy and thus act as a buffer.”
So the mystery is solved, Die Welt tries to have us believe. Well, not really because Die Welt then concedes that the explanations are only “plausible” at best.

Later in the article Die Welt does call the stagnation “baffling” and even offers other explanations for the warming stop that it calls “plausible”, like Chinese aerosols possibly dimming the atmosphere. Obviously their use of the world “plausible” implies that the ocean and aerosol explanations are not much more than guesses as to what is happening. This is hardly what anyone would call settled science.
Peeved Rahmstorf: skeptics have scored success
And Die Welt is forced to admit:
The fact is also: The projections from scientists have failed to forecast the stop in the temperature rise.”
Die Welt adds that warmists like Rahmstorf are highly irritated by the mileage skeptics have derived from the warming stop:
Scientist Rahmstorf is peeved by the headlines made by skeptics over the past months over the supposed pause in climate change. Those who put too much emphasis on the phenomenon are confusing ‘the noise of natural variations with the signal of global warming’.”
Rahmstorf adds that this has been “a success scored by the skeptics who are trying to seed doubt over global warming using arguments that aren’t really serious.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Aphan posted a comment providing a link to the website of one of the passengers, Janet Rice, an Australian Green politician, who was along on the trip. In it she describes the events of December 23 that led to a delay in the departure of the vessel, and thus causing it to lose the race against the invading sea ice.
Here’s an excerpt from the day’s entry (my emphasis):
The first drama of the day was the sinking – or almost! – of one of the Argos. The Argos are designed to be amphibious – just. They were launched today off the ship – and two of the three made it safely being towed by a zodiac the 50 metres or so to shore. The third was towed too fast it seems – and water came over the bonnet / bow, flooding both the engine and the vehicle itself. Ben tried in vain to bail out with a spade and luckily they made it to shore before the vehicle sunk entirely. Ben ended up rather wet too, but similarly to Mary, not submerged enough for the lifejacket to come into play. Sadly Argo engines don’t take too kindly to being submerged… the ships engineers are still working on it and not very optimistic about its prospects.
The third drama of the day is the one which is still unfolding. Because of the Argo mishap we got off late, and had one less vehicle to ferry people to and fro.I’m told the Captain was becoming rather definite late in the afternoon that we needed to get everyone back on board ASAP because of the coming weather and the ice closing in. As I write we are continuing to make extremely slow progress through what looks like a winter alpine snow field – it’s yet another surreal part of this journey that we are in a ship trying to barge our way through here! I’m sure the Captain would have been much happier if we had got away a few hours earlier. Maybe we would have made it through the worst before it consolidated as much as it has with the very cold south- easterly winds blowing the ice away from the coast, around and behind us as well as ahead.
We’ll see where we are in the morning – it may be a very white Christmas Eve!
PS. 9.30am 24/12. We have moved less than a kilometre over night, and are now stationary in a sea of ice. The word is that we are not stuck, merely waiting for a weather change. It seems to me that we are having the quintessential Antarctic experience.J Stay tuned.”
Clearly the captain of the ship had gotten antsy and wanted to leave hours sooner. But the passengers’ escapades and dithering likely became the decisive screw-up that led to them getting trapped in ice for 10 days and turning the expedition into a debacle for the world to see.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German language Voice of Russia here wrote yesterday that US scientists had recorded, by satellite, a new all-time record low of -91.2°C in Antarctica. The reading was taken at the Japanese research station Dome Fuji, 3786 meters above sea level in 2004. The old record was -89.2 set in 1983.
Where’s the warming!
“NSIDC prepared to make public”

The English-language Russian RT News here writes about the new all-time record low for the planet Earth as well, but states that it is also being disputed by one Russian scientist. The RT (my emphasis):
American researchers from the US National Snow and Ice Data  Centre (NSIDC) prepare to make public satellite temperature measurements data which maintains that a record temperature of -91.2°C was registered in Antarctica on August 3, 2004, near the  Japanese Dome Fuji station, situated on the Valkyrie Dome in the heart of the White Continent.”
According to the RT article, the NSIDC will present the report for the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in San Francisco. The report states that the “winters of 1997, 2001, 2003, and 2004 showed several temperature minima below -90°C.”
As mentioned, the record is being challenged by at least one scientist. The head of the Russian Antarctic Expedition’s logistics center Vyacheslav Martyanov disputes the readings, and told RIA Novosti that: “It is incorrect to declare a temperature record based on satellite data,” adding:
Air temperature is measured according to standards, at the height of 2 meters above the ground, like they do at meteorological observing stations, therefore recognizing a  temperature measured by remote sensing is unrealistic.”

Whether the new temperature record gets officially recognized or not is not sure at this point. But one thing is clear: Things aren’t warming up at all in Antarctica!

"The release of methane and carbon dioxide from thawing permafrost will accelerate global warming and add up to $70tn (£54tn) to the world’s climate bill, according to the most advanced study yet of the economic consequences of a melting Arctic. If countries fail to improve on their Paris agreement commitments, this feedback mechanism, combined with a loss of heat-deflecting white ice, will cause a near 5% amplification of global warming and its associated costs, says the paper, which was published on Tuesday in Nature Communications.  The authors say their study is the first to calculate the economic impact of permafrost melt and reduced albedo – a measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed – based on the most advanced computer models of what is likely to happen in the Arctic as temperatures rise. It shows how destabilised natural systems will worsen the problem caused by man-made emissions, making it more difficult and expensive to solve. They assessed known stocks of frozen organic matter in the ground up to 3 metres deep at multiple points across the Arctic. These were run through the world’s most advanced simulation software in the US and at the UK Met Office to predict how much gas will be released at different levels of warming. Even with supercomputers, the number crunching took weeks because the vast geography and complex climate interactions of the Arctic throw up multiple variables. The researchers then applied previous economic impact models to assess the likely costs. Permafrost melt is the main concern. Greenhouse gases – which are released when organic matter that had been frozen below the soil for centuries thaws and rots - have already begun to escape at the current level of 1 degrees Celsius of global heating. So far the impact is small. Ten gigatonnes of carbon have been released from the permafrost but this source of emissions will grow rapidly once temperatures rise beyond 1.5C. On the current trajectory of at least 3C of warming by the end of the century, melting permafrost is expected to discharge up to 280 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide and 3 gigatonnes of methane, which has a climate effect that is 10 to 20 times stronger than CO2. This would increase the global climate-driven impacts by by $70tn between now and 2300. This is 10 times higher than the projected benefits from a melting Arctic, such as easier navigation for ships and access to minerals, says the paper. It would also add to global inequality because most of the economic burden – equivalent to almost the entire world’s current annual GDP – is likely to be borne by countries in warmer poorer regions such as India and Africa, which are most vulnerable to a rise in temperatures. “It’s disheartening that we have this in front of us,” said Dmitry Yumashev of Lancaster University. “Even at 1.5C to 2C, there are impacts and costs due to thawing permafrost. But they are considerably lower for these scenarios compared to business as usual. We have the technology and policy instruments to limit the warming but we are not moving fast enough.” The new projections contained a modicum of good news because the impact of land permafrost melt was at the lower range of what had been feared. Previous estimates suggested these Arctic tipping points could add more than 10% to climate costs. Some feared the methane alone could prove catastrophic but the new figures show CO2 remains the greatest concern. “We still have a time bomb, but it may not be as large as previously believed,” said Yumashev. But he warned against complacency because even at the low end the damages are huge, the study has a considerable degree of uncertainty and the costs of several other potential tipping points have yet to be calculated."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCold is gripping globally, and not only in the US or Antarctica.
Hat-tip: Jurian Sterk at Facebook.
The French language www.hebdometeo.com here reports that in Alberta: “Temperatures Saturday in the Canadian prairies were glacial and that many cold records fell.”
The report writes that Edmonton bottomed out at -39°C thus smashing the old record of -37°C set in 2009, also a time of supposedly intense global warming.
No wonder the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) feels so desperate to roll out once again its bogus model claims that all the cold is due to Arctic warming!
At Brooks, Alberta the mercury fell to -42.2 °C. The old record was -38.3°C set in 1977. With the wind chill factored in, the temperature felt like -52°C, the hebdometeo site writes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeet deepsea diver Gustavo. Gustavo is a a 3-ton elephant seal that scientists at Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute have put into service to collect ocean data. Some elephant seal bulls were tagged with state-of-the-art satellite transmitters at the Dallmann Laboratory on King George Island, Antarctica. Read about it here:  Alfred Wegener Institute.The scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association furnished some elephant seals with transmitters that operate using the satellite-aided ARGOS location system. Here’s how it works:
During the annual migrations to their oceanic feeding grounds elephant seals cover thousands of kilometres. They dive down to depths of over 2000 metres and remain under water for periods of over an hour. When a seal with a transmitter dives, it collects data – even under the ice – and then appears on the surface again to breathe after some time. While it breathes fresh air, the recorded data package is sent to a satellite that passes on the signals received.
The elephant seals will gather and transmit data during the Antarctic winter, a time when ships are not able to perform this job because of too much sea ice.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen it comes to Christmas, you have to hand it to the Germans. No one celebrates it like they do.
Many of the old Christmas traditions we so very much cherish today originate in Germany. Here’s a video of Christmas market activity. (Don’t worry, it’s not superimposed with “Last Christmas” by Wham).

Perhaps a few of the ex-British forces stationed near Osnabruck will relate to the images. The footage was taken at the downtown Osnabruck Christmas market, which is only a short drive away from my house. The singing, of course is in German.
It is easy to get sidetracked by all the commerce and kitsch. One could easily argue that it is the pursuit of the things that we were taught would make us happy is in fact precisely what makes many among us miserable.
Have a nice 2nd Advent!

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a worthwhile piece by David Deming: http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/05/the_problems_with_al_gore.html
The ancient Greeks encouraged free thought, debate and critical analysis.  Pupils were encouraged to criticise their teachers.  Today we know that in science scepticism is the heart of progress; without it everything stops. The objective of science is not to prove existing theories, but to disprove them.
But in Al Gore’s world, things are just the opposite. Gore refuses to debate and continuously ridicules and demonises his critics. His approach: science is established by brute authority. Those who disagree with his view are not invited in discussion, but are marginalised and cast out. Only one dogma is tolerated.

AGW is probably the only scientific hypothesis that ever started with a consensus. In real science, that’s not how it works. This hypothesis is a dud.
In his piece, Deming writes in the end:
Gore and Obama have joined an elite group that includes Portuguese physician Egas Moniz.  In 1949, Moniz was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine for devising an innovative procedure known as the frontal lobotomy.  It seems fitting that Gore and Obama are grouped with Moniz, since their apparent goal is to lobotomize human civilization.
I don’t know about human civilisation, but they are certainly trying to lobotomise critics, dissenters and the scientific approach.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWell at least President Barack Obama is reaching his climate protection targets by cutting CO2 emissions like he promised he would. The USA’s CO2 emissions fell a whopping 7% last year.
http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2010/05/us-carbon-dioxide-emissions-fell-record-7-last-year/1
While part of the reductions came from energy conservation and more efficient technology, a big part came from the nasty economic slowdown.
Heck, at the current rate the USA will be practically carbon-free by 2020! Not everybody thinks there’s been an economic price and pain. Take Joe Romm for example. The USA Today writes:

Romm says the CO2 decrease, larger than previously expected by the EIA, shows that such reductions are possible without harming the U.S. economy.

Say what! 10% of the workforce is idle and 20% is under-employed. Just how stupid can one possibly be?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIce breakers getting trapped in near record high sea ice around Antarctica, Arctic sea ice seeing a whopping 50% gain last summer, record killer cold and snow gripping Canada and the USA, rare snowfalls in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The string of cold weather events just doesn’t end. And all this in a non-La Nina year.
So it comes as little surprise when we are told that global temperatures haven’t risen in close to two decades and that they have been trending downwards over the last 8 years or so.
Despite the mild weather that Europe has been experiencing over the last 5 weeks, the overall temperature trend here speaks a very different story.
German weather site www.wetter.net here reports that 2013 in Germany was the second coldest year in a decade.

Figure 1: Germany’s annual mean temperature since 2003. 2013 was the second coldest. The 10-year trend is clear: Germany is cooling.

What’s more, wetter.net writes:
Based on the last 25 years, 2013 was the fourth coldest. If we look at the average temperatures for the last 25 years, we see that they have pretty much remained constant.”
But Germany is not alone in seeing global warming gone AWOL. Benny Peiser’s GWPF site here writes that the same thing is being observed in Great Britain.

"The siege of the Berta Cáceres started started shortly after noon when police in high-vis jackets surrounded the bright pink boat in Oxford Circus, central London, with two cordons and then steadily peeled off the Extinction Rebellion activists stuck to it. Officers with angle grinders cut through the bars below the hull of the vessel, named after the murdered Honduran environmental activist, which protesters had chained and glued themselves to. Five hours later, however, the tables had turned as hundreds of activist reinforcements swarmed into side roads and blocked the end of Regent Street. The police were surrounded. As officers attached the Berta Cáceres to a lorry, the crowd chanted: “We have more boats.” By 7pm police had managed to move the boat just two streets away, only to find themselves pinned in by more rows of demonstrators singing the Beatles’ All You Need Is Love. After much obstruction the vessel was eventually driven away up Regent Street followed by jogging uniformed officers. Welcome to the fifth day of the Extinction Rebellion, the escalating but still methodically polite campaign of disruption that has turned several of central London’s best-known locations into a giant game of territorial to-and-fro. Despite more than 100 arrests on Friday, taking the total to 682 by early evening, the demonstration which has blocked four major London landmarks looked set to continue beyond the weekend, with organisers preparing to extend their disruption on Monday to “picnics on the motorway.” The activists reported an influx of supporters as the Easter holiday, balmy weather and gestures of support from school strike leader Greta Thunberg and the actor Emma Thompson injected new momentum into the weeklong climate protest. As on previous days, the mood was largely respectful on both sides, but video later emerged of activists being dragged roughly across the concrete near Regent Street. Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist and founder of the school strikes for climate movement, will visit parliament on Monday and Tuesday and said she was also keen to join the campaigners on the streets.  The Metropolitan police has admitted that it is overstretched and officers said additional forces were called in from Wales and other regions to prevent Heathrow from becoming a target, but fears proved exaggerated. A group of 15 youth activists staged a two-hour peaceful protest at a road junction close to the airport. At the biggest of the camps at Marble Arch, organisers said they had had about 300 signups in the afternoon alone, with dozens of people volunteering to work as brochure distributors. Wolfgang Wopperer-Beholz, who manned the sign-up desk, said there had been a marked increase compared with the previous day. “Earlier, the people who put their names on the list were already knowledgeable. Now we are seeing more people who don’t know so much, but are pretty enthusiastic.” He said many had mentioned the David Attenborough documentary on climate change that had aired on the BBC on Thursday night. Induction sessions at a tent in Parliament Square were so packed that the attendees spilled outside. “It’s growing at an amazing rate. I think the Attenborough documentary lit a fire in people’s bellies,” said one of the activists, who gave only the name Archer. “They are not just the usual dirty hippies either. There are doctors, architects, and the ethnic diversity is getting wider.” “I’ve campaigned on this for 30 years with very little effect. It’s only with Extinction Rebellion that I have a sense that we are getting somewhere,” said Bing Jones, a retired doctor from Sheffield, who was arrested and placed in a police cell in Belgravia on Thursday night. “When I was released, there was a volunteer waiting for me outside with a Mars bar and big smile. He had signed up that day, been trained, and then sat outside the police station for four hours until I came out. This is a wonderful, strange movement and new people continue to come along.” Among the newcomers on Friday was actor Sonera Angel, who was waving a yellow banner marked with the Extinction Rebellion symbol near the police perimeter at Oxford Circus. She said she had come by train with a big group from Southend. She planned to return over the weekend and persuade more of her friends to join. “There is no excuse now it is a holiday,” she said. “Climate change is such a huge issue and governments all over the world are doing almost nothing about it.” Thompson also joined the Oxford Circus camp on Friday morning as activists read “poems to the Earth”. Later the actor gave a speech from the Berta Cáceres. Thompson said her generation had failed young people: “We have seriously failed them and our planet is in serious trouble. We have much, much less time than we thought. I have seen the evidence for myself and I really care about my children and grandchildren enough to want to be here today to stand with the next generation.” Organisers say the protests will continue for another week, bolstered by Thunberg, who will arrive in the UK on Sunday as part of a European tour that has included a meeting with Pope Francis and an excoriating address at the European parliament. Thunberg, whose strike sparked a global movement of more than a million students in less than a year, was also one of the signatories to the declaration that launched Extinction Rebellion in October. She had previously arranged to be in London after Easter to speak in parliament to party leaders and other MPs, meet fellow student activists and talk at a public event co-hosted by the Guardian. “I would love to participate in their protests while in London if there is time and if they are still protesting,” Thunberg said. “I think it’s one of the most important and hopeful movements of our time. Civil disobedience is necessary to create attention to the ongoing climate and ecological crisis.” Activists and politicians say she and other young campaigners had a key role to play. “She is abso-bloody-lutely important. I thank her from my heart,” said Ronan McNern, a spokesman for the group. “It’s not Extinction Rebellion that people should watch out for. It’s the school strike for climate, it’s the youth. This is their moment.” The climate campaigners have also been boosted by a host of prominent supporters from the science and academic communities and the entertainment world. In an open letter on Friday, the former Nasa scientist James Hansen spelled out the growing dangers of climate change and noted that he too has conducted “highly respectful acts of nonviolent civil disobedience – on occasion leading even to my arrest”. Linguist and activist Noam Chomsky is among those who have sent a statement of support. “It is impossible to exaggerate the awesome nature of the challenge we face: to determine, within the next few years, whether organised human society can survive in anything like its present form,” he said. “The activists of Extinction Rebellion are leading the way in confronting this immense challenge, with courage and integrity, an achievement of historic significance that must be amplified with urgency.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s citizens are less willing than ever to accept higher costs for green electricity. Enough is enough, they are now saying.
WDR German public television has a report at its website here on the results of an opinion survey conducted by polling institute Infratest dimap to find out if the public is willing to pay more for green electricity.
54% answered “no”.
That’s 6% more than a year earlier. The results are sobering when one considers how Germans pride themselves as being among the greenest people in the world. Only 41% said they would accept paying more. 3% said they were willing to pay more, but only if the price increase was kept under control.
In 2012 a total of 48% answered “no”.
Not surprisingly the willingness depended on income. 56% of the people with a higher net income said they would accept paying more. However, low income citizens were much less ready to accept higher prices for green electricity: 59% said they were not ready to pay more. What about people earning middle incomes? The ZDF-commissioned survey showed that these people reject green energy even more than the poorer ones: 62% said they would not accept higher prices.
Some years ago, Germans as a whole were convinced that something had to be done to “rescue the climate” and were much more open to paying higher prices for electricity. However the rapid increase in electricity prices over the last years, and hence correspondingly greater pain, has led the public to rethink. Also 5 consecutive unexpectedly harsh winters and the fact that the globe isn’t warming anymore also has had an impact.
As a whole German acceptance of renewable energy is waning rapidly. This also shows that Germans are less alarmed about the threats of climate change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScience journalist Axel Bojanowski of Spiegel comments on winter storm “Xaver” that pounded the north German coast yesterday, and on North Sea storms in general.

No frequency increase in North Sea storms in 150 years. Photo by a U.S. Army helicopter, Netherlands flood 1953. Public domain photo.
So are North Sea storms getting worse? Bojanowski (my emphasis):
Measurements of air pressure and wind since the middle of the 19th century show no increase in storms in the North Sea. The region over the last years has even been low with respect to wind. Although the year-to-year fluctuations are high, a trend in storm frequency is not detectable by scientists.”
The high frequency, Bojanowski writes, is only found in model projections. He writes:
For the future, climate models foresee a light increase in winter storms over the course of the century. The calculations, however, are in dispute.”
But don’t take the word of a Speigel science journalist. Also read what the German Weather Service says in my last post.

"Game of Thrones (Sky Atlantic/Now TV)Climate Change: The Facts BBC One | iPlayerEarth from Space BBC One | iPlayerBack to Life BBC Three/One | iPlayerTrust Me BBC One | iPlayerChimerica Channel 4 | All 4 So we have a new date for our diaries, to split the nation once more between those howling bereft anguish and those who wish it would all just go away: 20 May is now going to be Threxit day, the day Game of Thrones finally departs our screens.  Whether you’re a diehard fan or not, you can’t really deny that it has been part of our on-off national conversation for the last eight years or so, even more so than Harry Potter the previous decade; and, if you happen to live in Ulster, Iceland or Croatia, it will even have brought a grin to your local finances. It has made fantasy, that spoddiest of jester genres, acceptable (because it wasn’t really about that, ever, just power-politics limned in a simpler medieval brutality); shown that women can be powerful without somehow having to be hobbled with niceness: perhaps, above all, reclaimed television’s vital and urgent power, aided immensely by the franchised dreck of cinematic “blockbusters”, so spawning an exodus of screenwriting, directing, acting talent back to the living room. This final series opener thus had a lot to live up to. It disappointed some, with its perceived failure to move things significantly forward: personally, I was delighted, as, after a nearly two-year hiatus, it gave us all a chance to remind ourselves precisely where we were. At Winterfell was where we were, barnacled in rime or covered in furs, though there have to be new definitions of intensity of “cold” to fully convey Sansa’s pass-agg mien on having to welcome Daenerys. The Wall has been breached, a dragon has been recruited to the undead Walkers, and all is set for a quite stupendous battle, possibly episode four or so, to rival, in scope and quite possibly in actual budget, the Normandy invasion. In all this, it was a grand opener, shot through with dark humour and the occasional tendresse. It all got a little briefly Hollywood with the dragon-ride over Iceland’s striated mad beauties, and my knee jiggled in sympathy with Thrones purists who must have gag-reflexed when came a dragon-snort, half-love, half-jealousy, at Dany and Jon’s waterfall-clinch, but still… and Jon! Jon Snow had a happy episode! Not only did he get to ride a dragon, and find out he was not a “bastard” (in the proper sense of the word rather than simply someone who carves you up on the motorway); but, even better, he’s actually heir to the Iron Throne. Good episode for Jon. (If bad news for his putative love life, but then again, 20 May is coming, and if you can’t shag your aunt before you die… one thing that particularly separates this from Lord of the Rings is its insistence on twincest and the like). And for us. I particularly loved what was surely a back-reference to the one misstep the casting directors have made, shoehorning in Ed Sheeran at the height of his unaccountable fame just because he was (unaccountably) famous, to act very badly as a soldier. As Bronn gossips in his naked frolicking, after the war with Daenerys that “boy Eddie... the ginger... came back with his face burned off”. These casting supremos know how to retro-suckerpunch. More of Iceland, little of it good though, in a simply superb exposition of Climate Change: The Facts. My, after his brief and ongoing Netflix sojourn, Attenborough’s really been allowed to take off the gloves, hasn’t he? No wonder, after 30 years of his trying to tell us all of this, politely thirled both by his love of the BBC and their absurd insistence on “balance”. Yet balance was what the many sharp scientists, most of whom have led the way in this, attempted throughout to show in this one-off (in many senses). Their language was always couched with “coulds” and “all indicators suggests”, as they told a quite simple horror story of, essentially, how our last chance to combat global warming has had the legs cut from under it by the recent deforestation of a third of global woodland for palm-oil growth, and the near-certain climatic tipping points this is entirely likely to engender. It was left to David Attenborough to quietly expound on how that immensely careful use of language by the least alarmist of scientists has been the very thing that has allowed politicians, oil companies, climate-change deniers, a tissue-thin excuse to delay. This was immense, and I do rather wish he’d taken the gloves off 30 years back. We had (blessedly briefly) old footage of Lord Lawson of Winterfell, apparently only him, again and again, telling us essentially that even if the world did get warmer it was a good thing because, said this gentleman who used to keep his hands tight on our Treasury’s windpipe, it would mean fewer people dying of cold. There’s still time, was the message, in both this programme and in Earth from Space, something I’d thought might be a bit gimmicky but turned out to be cloyingly watchable. We watched, rapt, as cameras from space zoomed in on elephants, individual seals, hippo-paths; importantly, though, on the interconnectedness of tiny planetary currents, oceanic and other. As Chiwetel Ejiofor nicely noted in this first (of four) he voices, we thought we were going looking into space; we are ending up learning a now-crucial lot about our planet. He had nicely prosaic hints as to ways forward, to gainsay, for instance, the destruction of half the world’s wildlife in 80 years. Eat all the food we buy. Avoid air-freighted food. Avoid beef and sheep, because they fart. This is something we can do, now. Back to Life, set in Hythe with a fat sprinkling of Dungeness, has something of the same flavour of Don’t Forget the Driver, in what may be termed the new genre of sadcom, but a very different premise. Lass released from jail after 18 years, returning (against all our instincts) to pick up her pieces, locally, where everyone hates her and her own mother hides the knives. This six-parter is, in places, bitter as nuclear wind, in places life-affirmingly warm and funny, and Daisy Haggard knows, very much, what she’s doing, holding a vial of smelling salts up to our own lazy censoriousness with wit and style and melancholy, and expect awards. Hard to get, yet, where the second series of Trust Me is going, with its crippled soldier-veteran in a Glasgow hospital where threat lurks, especially at night, with every pair of scissors, every abandoned nurse-station, as we thrust power ever further into beeping machines and hence hugely enable one dodgy human’s intervention. So far, so very tense, for the first of four, and I for one Trust It, even if you might never trust late-night wards again. In Chimerica, Lucy Kirkwood’s so far splendid adaptation of her own play, we get a killer line at the start of the first (of four) which sums up much of what will follow. “She [a protesting woman] wants to know what happens after you get a dream of democracy,” asks a translator, for a photographer in Tiananmen Square, 1989. “We know what China is dreaming of. What is America dreaming of?” The gung-ho snapper moves on from Pentax to digital Canon, and moves on from global fame, having snapped the man who stood against the tanks in the square, to ignominy. He adulterates a picture in Syria, today, for greater impact in a global half-hour news cycle, in a post-Trump, post-truth world. Obviously, it’s the very worst thing he could have done, braving the war zones but playing right into the prez’s tiny hands. The fallout, in the play, in the series, in real China, in real America, in real journalism, is enough to drive one to Westeros."

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday the online Daily Mail echos what NTZ wrote 5 days ago, and also brings in an expert to confirm exactly what I was suspecting: Prof Chris Turney may have been reckless in his planning for a major expedition. Although combining tourism and science on a cruise ship may seem like a creative idea on the surface, it is not a good idea in the world’s harshest environment.
The Daily Mail writes:
An experienced polar explorer has accused climate scientists who hired a ship now trapped in Antarctic ice of endangering passengers and crew – by carrying out the expedition ‘on the cheap’.”
Later adding:
Robert Headland, of Cambridge University’s Scott Polar Research Institute, blamed the team for not investing in a ship suitable to the ‘easily predictable’ sea ice.”
Mr Headland, who has completed successful missions to where the ship was going, said: ‘The expedition was hopelessly optimistic in trying to carry out this mission on the cheap and has needlessly taken many risks.”
Good to see the major media doing their job in digging into this debacle. And it looks some are even reading NoTricksZone once in awhile.
And now that an expert like Robert Headland is calling the expedition “needlessly risky”, Turney is finding himself standing on increasingly thin ice.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFritz Vahrenholt and Frank Bosse have released their November solar activity report. It follows in English.
===================================
The sun in November 2013: You’re going to have to add more antifreeze
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In November 2013 the sun showed signs of more activity as sunspot number (SSN) was 77.6. This solar cycle month (the 60th of the current cycle) was therefore “only” 32% below the level of a normally active sun. Just as a reminder: February 2013 was 66% below the mean value of all the previous observed cycles 1-23! Compared to the mean (blue) the current cycle (red) appears as follows:

Figure 1: Current cycle 24 (red) versus mean solar cycle (blue) and solar cycle 5 (gray).  
Since solar cycle 24 began in December 2008, we have been witnessing a much weaker than normal solar cycle. Temporary spikes like those of last month reaching mean value have been the exception rather than the norm. Thus we continue to be on a similar track as SC 5, which was the first of the Dalton Minimum just after 1800. If one accumulates the sunspot number anomalies of each cycle up to the current month 60, we get the following graphic:

 Figure 2: Accumulated sunspot anomaly for each cycle after 60 months.
One immediately sees the abrupt drop in solar cycle 23, which ended in April 2006. Already SC 23 was slightly below normal, and the current cycle has been the calmest since SC 7 in 1833.
What lies ahead?
We have already cited forecasts based on physical attributes where the behavior of the corona (a very warm zone above the visible surface of the sun) and the magnetic field strength about the sun spots suggest continued weakening activity for the next solar cycle (Livingston/Penn). We now cite a study by Salvador (2013) that attempts to reconstruct solar cycles using planetary tidal effects on the sun. Even though we view this approach with skepticism, an amazing level of congruence with observed data is achieved:

Figure 3: Source: study by Salvador (2013).

google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The red curve depicts the model and the blue curve shows the observed sunspot data since 1749. On this basis the author then makes a forecast where he takes the data starting in 1987 and calibrates his models using amplitudes and extends it into the future:

Figure 4. Source: Figure 7 of study by Salvador (2013).
Also in his model, SC 25 and 26 are projected to be very weak and in fact he forecasts a weak sun to persist until the end of the century. It is not our intention to forecast so far into the future, but little is expected to happen with our sun in the next 30 years the author of the article believes in addition to other authors. What impact will this have on the Earth?  Shouldn’t the drop in solar activity have and impact? What follows is a chart of the global wintertime temperature distribution comparing the values of the last 10 years to the 12 years that preceded them:

Figure 5. Source: GISS
The land-based temperatures in the winter between 30N and 60N have fallen. Especially the Eurasian region has been experiencing much colder winters since 2002. The datasets yield the following interesting results:

Figure 6.
Depicted by the red curve is the annual SSN anomaly since 2002 as to the first figure. Can the drop since 2003 indeed at least be partially because of the reduced solar activity?
There is plenty of literature available on this, and a possible relation is explained by Sarah Ineson (2012) in a presentation by the British Met Office. The reduced UV radiation of the sun at low activity has an impact on the stratosphere and this has an effect especially on the winter circulation down to the Earth’s surface.
What does this tell us?
The trend to colder winters here in Europe and elsewhere, all the way to China in the Far East and the east coast of the USA, has truly been robust over the last 10 years. From this we conclude that we hardly can anticipate warmer winters for the near future and that it may remain that way for a very long time should the solar relationship be confirmed. Therefore add more anti-freeze in the windscreen wiper reservoir of your car! Winter has arrived and likely it isn’t going to be a mild one!

"For decades, we have faced an incontrovertible truth: that human lifestyles are risking the future habitability of our planet. For decades, political leaders have invoked rousing rhetoric in the face of this challenge while failing to act to avert catastrophe. Climate change is an existential risk to the future and the window available to prevent disastrous overheating is closing rapidly. Only now, almost 30 years after the International Panel on Climate Change published its first report setting out the scientific evidence, is there any sense that something may be shifting in popular and political perceptions. Extinction Rebellion protesters have brought parts of central London to a standstill, their action coming in the wake of the school climate strikes, when more than 1.4 million young people took part globally. For his part, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warned the financial sector last week that it must take the threat seriously, framing the argument in terms that it understands best: that in a heated world there is a real risk to profit margins. These are different responses to the same hard facts. The 20 warmest years since records began occurred in the past 22 years and the IPCC estimates we are likely to reach 1.5C above temperatures in pre-industrial times as early as 2030 on current trends. If we are to have any chance of keeping global warming to well below 2C, as set out in the Paris agreement, the world needs to reach net zero-carbon emissions by the middle of this century. The UN secretary general has warned that we have one year to change course to avoid missing this target. The need for action is critical. The rate at which the world is warming is rapidly increasing and scientists fear we will soon reach a tipping point. One example would be the disappearance of Arctic sea ice in summer, an event that would impair Earth’s ability to reflect solar radiation and lead to even more warming and devastation. Global warming is already inflicting huge damage. We are seeing more extreme weather events – heatwaves, floods and droughts – with increasing cost to human, animal and plant life. Scientists believe 8% of the world’s species are at risk of extinction. A quarter of the world’s coral reefs have already died as a result of the warming of our oceans. It will be the world’s poorest nations that will bear the brunt of the devastation to come, even though they have the least responsibility – they have made a negligible contribution to historic emissions, and the poorest half of the world is responsible for just 10% of annual emissions. Yet the consequences will continue to fall on these underprivileged countries. However, there has been some progress. Carbon emissions are falling in many countries; in the UK, they have been cut to 19th-century levels. But these reductions have not come quickly enough and what has been achieved so far has been the gathering of the low-hanging fruit, such as closing coal-fired power stations, changes that have not required big lifestyle alterations. Since 2015 the British government has performed a series of dizzying U-turns on climate change policy, sacrificing commitments such as zero-carbon homes and investment in carbon capture storage on the altar of austerity. Now Brexit is distracting us even more from the impending crisis. As a result, the UK is on course to decisively miss its own legally binding emissions targets for 2027 and 2032. Internationally, the election of President Trump has seen the United States withdraw from the Paris agreement, and the election of rightwing populists such as Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil poses a further threat to global progress. The ratcheting up of the discourse reflects the ratcheting up of the stakes. Extinction Rebellion is a movement born of desperation, showcasing the determination of activists to use whatever peaceful tactics are necessary to get politicians to take the threat seriously. They enjoyed real success last week, forcing climate change into the headlines when it would otherwise have been ignored. But there are limits to the effectiveness of this approach. Limiting global warming requires widespread lifestyle change among the world’s richest populations. Proposals for a green new deal developed on both sides of the Atlantic illustrate how much government can do with political commitment. But action is far more likely if voters are applying pressure on government to take the radical action that will shift people’s lifestyles and behaviour – through measures such as green taxation, regulation or even rationing. So while a radical movement such as Extinction Rebellion can act as a much-needed catalyst to get people talking about climate change, the case for action will in the end need to be made in a much broader way that appeals to voters from across the political spectrum. There’s much to learn from the campaign for equal marriage in the US, which successfully won round conservative voters by framing the argument not primarily in the language of rights, but in values of love, commitment and family. This remains the missing link in avoiding catastrophic climate change. How to make people see that this is the most existential threat humankind has ever faced, yet without making them feel fatalistic about their lack of ability to influence events. If we fail to crack this conundrum, the future of our planet hangs in the balance."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Russia’s German edition of Ria Novosti online, a Russian WWF climate expert claims that the recent “climate anomaly” of winter weather and a hurricane strength storm occurring in southern France in late spring confirms the anthropogenic impact on global climate. http://de.rian.ru/science/20100505/126183713.html.
Ria Novosti interviewed WWF climate expert Alexei Kokorin, who says:
The situation in France fits right in with the theory of anthropogenic climate change. We are now able to observe marginal climate change. Temperature and precipitation fluctuations have increased 10-fold. In Russia the number of dangerous hydrometeorological events have increased 10-fold in the last 15 years.
Nothing you wouldn’t expect from an alarmist. But then he adds (original German):
Wir können in Zukunft mit einem etwas wärmeren und zugleich weitaus instabileren Klima, darunter mit Schneefällen im Mai und Juli, rechnen.
In English:
In the future we [Russians] can anticipate a somewhat warmer and much more unstable climate, including snowfalls in May and July.
Warmer and yet snowfalls in the summertime? You gotta be kidding.
But do expect the IPCC to cite them in its upcoming 5th assessment report. The chances of being cited are quite good – Alexei Kokorin is the director of the Russian WWF Climate Protection Program.  In the past the IPCC has had no qualms about citing such sources.

"This article is excerpted from a piece published by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation. The Guardian is partnering with CJR and the Nation on a 30 April conference aimed at reframing the way journalists cover climate change. More information about the conference, including a link to RSVP, is here. Last summer, during the deadliest wildfire season in California’s history, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes got into a revealing Twitter discussion about why US television doesn’t much cover climate change. Elon Green, an editor at Longform, had tweeted, “Sure would be nice if our news networks – the only outlets that can force change in this country – would cover it with commensurate urgency.” Hayes (who is an editor at large for the Nation) replied that his program had tried. Which was true: in 2016, All In With Chris Hayes spent an entire week highlighting the impact of climate change in the US as part of a look at the issues that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were ignoring. The problem, Hayes tweeted, was that “every single time we’ve covered [climate change] it’s been a palpable ratings killer. So the incentives are not great.”  The Twittersphere pounced. “TV used to be obligated to put on programming for the public good even if it didn’t get good ratings. What happened to that?” asked @JThomasAlbert. @GalJaya said, “Your ‘ratings killer’ argument against covering #climatechange is the reverse of that used during the 2016 primary when corporate media justified gifting Trump $5 billion in free air time because ‘it was good for ratings,’ with disastrous results for the nation.” When @mikebaird17 urged Hayes to invite Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University, one of the best climate science communicators around, on to his show, she tweeted that All In had canceled on her twice – once when “I was literally in the studio w[ith] the earpiece in my ear” – and so she wouldn’t waste any more time on it. “Wait, we did that?” Hayes tweeted back. “I’m very very sorry that happened.” This spring Hayes redeemed himself, airing perhaps the best coverage on American television yet of the Green New Deal. All In devoted its entire 29 March broadcast to analyzing the congressional resolution, co-sponsored by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, which outlines a plan to mobilize the United States to stave off climate disaster and, in the process, create millions of green jobs. In a shrewd answer to the ratings challenge, Hayes booked Ocasio-Cortez, the most charismatic US politician of the moment, for the entire hour. Yet at a time when civilization is accelerating toward disaster, climate silence continues to reign across the bulk of the US news media. Especially on television, where most Americans still get their news, the brutal demands of ratings and money work against adequate coverage of the biggest story of our time. Many newspapers, too, are failing the climate test. Last October, the scientists of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a landmark report, warning that humanity had a mere 12 years to radically slash greenhouse gas emissions or face a calamitous future in which hundreds of millions of people worldwide would go hungry or homeless or worse. Only 22 of the 50 biggest newspapers in the United States covered that report. Instead of sleepwalking us toward disaster, the US news media need to remember their Paul Revere responsibilities – to awaken, inform and rouse the people to action. To that end, the Nation and CJR are launching Covering Climate Change: A New Playbook for a 1.5-Degree World, a project aimed at dramatically improving US media coverage of the climate crisis. When the IPCC scientists issued their 12-year warning, they said that limiting temperature rise to 1.5C would require radically transforming energy, agriculture, transportation, construction and other core sectors of the global economy. Our project is grounded in the conviction that the news sector must be transformed just as radically. The project will launch on 30 April with a conference at the Columbia Journalism School – a working forum where journalists will gather to start charting a new course. We envision this event as the beginning of a conversation that America’s journalists and news organizations must have with one another, as well as with the public we are supposed to be serving, about how to cover this rapidly uncoiling emergency. Judging by the climate coverage to date, most of the US news media still don’t grasp the seriousness of this issue. There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change. That is not alarmism; it is scientific fact. We as a civilization urgently need to slow that train down and help as many people off the tracks as possible. It’s an enormous challenge, and if we don’t get it right, nothing else will matter. The US mainstream news media, unlike major news outlets in Europe and independent media in the US, have played a big part in getting it wrong for many years. It’s past time to make amends. If 1.5C is the new limit for a habitable planet, how can newsrooms tell that story in ways that will finally resonate with their audiences? And given journalism’s deeply troubled business model, how can such coverage be paid for? Some preliminary suggestions. (You can read this story in its entirety at Columbia Journalism Review or The Nation.) Don’t blame the audience, and listen to the kids. The onus is on news organizations to craft the story in ways that will demand the attention of readers and viewers. The specifics of how to do this will vary depending on whether a given outlet works in text, radio, TV or some other medium and whether it is commercially or publicly funded, but the core challenge is the same. A majority of Americans are interested in climate change and want to hear what can be done about it. This is especially true of the younger people that news organizations covet as an audience. Even most young Republicans want climate action. And no one is speaking with more clarity now than Greta Thunberg, Alexandria Villaseñor and the other teenagers who have rallied hundreds of thousands of people into the streets worldwide for the School Strike 4 Climate demonstrations. Establish a diverse climate desk, but don’t silo climate coverage. The climate story is too important and multidimensional for a news outlet not to have a designated team covering it. That team must have members who reflect the economic, racial and gender diversity of America; if not, the coverage will miss crucial aspects of the story and fail to connect with important audiences. At the same time, climate change is so far-reaching that connections should be made when reporting on nearly every topic. For example, an economics reporter could partner with a climate reporter to cover the case for a just transition: the need to help workers and communities that have long relied on fossil fuel, such as the coal regions of Appalachia, transition to a clean-energy economy, as the Green New Deal envisions. Learn the science. Many journalists have long had a bias toward the conceptual. But you can’t do justice to the climate crisis if you don’t understand the scientific facts, in particular how insanely late the hour is. At this point, anyone suggesting a leisurely approach to slashing emissions is not taking the science seriously. Make the time to get educated. Four recent books – McKibben’s Falter, Naomi Klein’s On Fire, David Wallace-Wells’s The Uninhabitable Earth, and Jeff Goodell’s The Water Will Come – are good places to start. Don’t internalize the spin. Not only do most Americans care about climate change, but an overwhelming majority support a Green New Deal – 81% of registered voters said so as of last December, according to Yale climate pollsters. Trump and Fox don’t like the Green New Deal? Fine. But journalists should report that the rest of America does. Likewise, they should not buy the argument that supporting a Green New Deal is a terrible political risk that will play into the hands of Trump and the GOP; nor should the media give credence to wild assertions about what a Green New Deal would do or cost. The data simply does not support such accusations. But breaking free from this ideological trap requires another step. Lose the Beltway mindset. It’s not just the Green New Deal that is popular with the broader public. Many of the subsidiary policies – such as Medicare for All and free daycare – are now supported by upwards of 70% of the American public, according to Pew and Reuters polls. Inside the Beltway, this fact is unknown or discounted; the assumption by journalists and the politicians they cover is that such policies are ultra-leftist political suicide. They think this because the Beltway worldview prioritizes transactional politics: what will Congress pass and the president sign into law? But what Congress and the White House do is often very different from what the American people favor, and the press should not confuse the two. Help the heartland. Some of the places being hit hardest by climate change, such as the midwestern states flooded this spring, have little access to real climate news; instead, the denial peddled by Fox News and Rush Limbaugh dominates. Iconic TV newsman Bill Moyers has an antidote: “Suppose you formed a consortium of media that could quickly act as a strike force to show how a disaster like this is related to climate change – not just for the general media, but for agricultural media, heartland radio stations, local television outlets. A huge teachable moment could be at hand if there were a small coordinating nerve center of journalists who could energize reporting, op-eds, interviews, and so on that connect the public to the causes and not just the consequences of events like this.” Moyers added that such a team should “always have on standby a pool of the most reputable scientists who, on camera and otherwise, can connect natural disasters to the latest and most credible scientific research”. Cover the solutions. There isn’t a more exciting time to be on the climate beat. That may sound strange, considering how much suffering lies in store from the impacts that are already locked in. But with the Green New Deal, the US government is now, for the first time, at least talking about a response that is commensurate with the scale and urgency of the problem. Reporters have a tendency to gravitate to the crime scene, to the tragedy. They have a harder time with the solutions to a problem; some even mistake it as fluff. Now, with climate change, the solution is a critical part of the story. Don’t be afraid to point fingers. As always, journalists should shun cheerleading, but neither should we be neutral. Defusing the climate crisis is in everyone’s interest, but some entities are resolutely opposed to doing what the science says is needed, starting with the president of the United States. The press has called out Trump on many fronts – for his lying, corruption and racism – but his deliberate worsening of the climate crisis has been little mentioned, though it is arguably the most consequential of his presidential actions. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has announced plans to keep producing large amounts of oil and gas through at least 2040; other companies have made similar declarations. If enacted, those plans guarantee catastrophe. Journalism has a responsibility to make that consequence clear to the public and to cover the companies, executives, and investors behind those plans accordingly. If American journalism doesn’t get the climate story right – and soon – no other story will matter. The news media’s past climate failures can be redeemed only by an immediate shift to more high-profile, inclusive and fearless coverage. Our #CoveringClimateNow project calls on all journalists and news outlets to join the conversation about how to make that happen. As the nation’s founders envisioned long ago, the role of a free press is to inform the people and hold the powerful accountable. These days, our collective survival demands nothing less."
"Many of the coastal sea defences erected after the 1953 flood that killed 307 people in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Lincolnshire are disintegrating through age, and need to be replaced. However, with a sea level rise of up to 1.15 metres, or possibly more, this century, and increasingly violent storms forecast, then simply rebuilding them or making them higher is too expensive to be a viable option. Since tourism and access to the sea are vital, and the benefits to birdlife and fish nurseries that the region’s marshes represent are valuable assets, then a different way has to be found.  Research has shown that a salt marsh just 40m wide can reduce the height of waves by 20%, and 80m wide to near zero. Academics from Cambridge (which, judging from a topographical map, might otherwise be needing a sea wall in the future), other experts from the region’s universities and conservation groups such as the National Trust that own a lot of the coast, are intent on expanding existing marshes.  Since it is the storm waves that demolish cliffs and even solid concrete walls, the plan is to retreat slightly inland and develop “soft defences” in front of valuable farmland and coastal settlements to prevent much larger swathes of East Anglia being swallowed by the sea.

By Ed Caryl
We have somewhat reliable global scale land surface and sea surface temperature measurements since about 1880. We have lower troposphere satellite temperature measurements since 1979. We have ice core CO2 measurements and real atmospheric CO2 measurements that overlap and agree at the overlap for this time span. There is general agreement that CO2 was not responsible for warming before World War II. Here is a plot of that history.

Figure 1 is a plot of the history of global temperature since 1880, along with the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The various cooling and warming periods are color coded.
Figure 1 plots the global temperature according to GISS. There are two warming periods, two cooling periods, and one flat trend period: the current pause. During this entire 133 year span, CO2 has been rising steadily, for the first half at about three parts per million per decade, and during the last half at about four times that, an average of about 13 ppm per decade. It is generally recognized that the cooling and warming from before 1880 to 1976, a century span, could not have been related to CO2. Yet it is claimed that the brief 20-year warming from 1977 to 1997 was completely due to man’s use of fossil fuel and the resulting 30 ppm CO2 increase and that somehow the 22 ppm increase from 1940 to 1976, and the additional 30 ppm increase since 1997, did nothing.
The 1977 to 1997 warming is also recorded in the satellite measurements, but has a lower amplitude than the surface measurements. The satellite measurement in the last 16 years indicates flat temperatures or even a slight cooling. The case for CO2 caused global warming is restricted to one 20-year period in the last 133 years. What about the 80 years of cooling or flat temperature response? What was responsible for that? There are other, much more logical explanations than the variance of CO2.
Here is another plot, like Figure 1, but proposing another cause for temperature fluctuations.

Figure 2 is a plot of the history of global temperature since 1880, along with the Atlantic Multi-decade oscillation (AMO) in black. The various cooling and warming epochs are color coded. 
Note that in Figure 2 the number of fine details that match between the AMO and year to year temperature variations. Note also that when the AMO declines the temperature declines, and when the AMO is increases the temperature increases. The AMO is a de-trended index based on sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic, so it will not show the rising temperature trend in global temperature as a whole. But it does reflect the cyclic nature of global temperatures. Also, because the AMO cycle is roughly 66 to 70 years, a down-turn in temperature is indicated for the next 35 or so years.
There is currently much discussion of the solar influence on temperature. We know that historically recognized minimums in solar activity have coincided with socially disruptive cooling, crop failures, famines, plagues and iced-over rivers and canals. The Maunder Minimum of the 17th century is the best known, but there have been others.

Figure 3 is a plot of reconstructed TSI data from Beryllium 10 isotope data from ice cores.


Figure 4 is a table of minimums and maximums with dates for beginning and end of each recognized event.
Next is a plot of temperature over that same period from the year 800. Note that the Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton Minimums together are responsible for the Little Ice Age from 1450 to 1850 with minor remissions. The Medieval and modern warming is due to solar activity.

Figure 5 from Moberg et al 2005, found here.
We can expand the solar influence on the most recent times to the same scale as Figure 1.

Figure 6 is a combination of (blue and red, left scale) the sunspot count with an 11-year moving average, and two TSI estimates based on Be10 studies (purple and black, right scale, source link in figure 3 title) and another study using sunspot and satellite radiance measurements (orange, right scale).
In Figure 6, the Gleisberg minimum is discernible at the turn of the 19th to 20th century, as is the unnamed drop in temperature in the 1960’s and 70’s. Solar activity and ocean cycles produce the warming and cooling periods seen in Figure 1 and 2. The “pause” since 1998 is due to reaching a peak in the AMO/PDO cycle and a reduction in solar radiance. Ocean cycles alone will force the next 30 years of cooling. As many others have repeatedly stated in this blog and elsewhere, this cooling could be extended and deepened by a new solar minimum. This will be called the Landscheidt or Eddy minimum.
Clearly ocean and sun drive temperature
CO2 has not been, and will not be, the driver of temperature. Clearly ocean and solar radiance cycles drive temperature, and then temperature (short term) and fossil carbon use (longer term) drives CO2.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Irish Examiner here reports that Robert Devoy, professor of physical geography at UCC, says the greater wind speeds and flooding in Ireland of the last few days are “what we would expect from a warming climate caused by the impact of humans”.
However, he cites no substantial data to support that. In fact global data on accumulated cyclone energy, hurricanes, droughts, tornadoes, etc. all show no trend, or in many cases even a decline. Yet Devoy claims:
We have had some exceptional events in recent years and these exceptional events are becoming more common.”
How Devoy can claim this is a mystery. Even the alarmist IPCC in its last fifth assessment report stated that there is no link between severe weather and humans.
Prof Devoy also says that “weather patterns had gone outside the natural pattern of weather events and this is a continuation of that” and that “the nature of these storms is changing.”
The nature of storms? What exactly? Prof. Devoy is hiding behind vague statements and doesn’t provide a single measure. He is just saying that storms are different. Scientifically his comments are a dustbin overflowing with rubbish.
He also claims sea level near Dublin is accelerating, claiming that “in the past decade, a regional rise of 2mm-3mm has been recorded by satellite stations and tidal gauges.”
We don’t know if Prof Devoy and the Irish Examiner are oblivious to history, or if they are maliciously trying to mislead the public. Why look only at the past decade? The available data for Dublin from the NOAA go back 80 years and shows very little overall sea level rise trend. Moreover, ten years is by far too short a time to infer a trend.

This leads us to wonder why Professor Devoy would make so many outlandish claims. We suppose it has something to do with money. The Irish Examiner quotes Devoy at the end of the article:
He called for further investment in weather monitoring in this country so that scientists can better chart patterns.”
I think the weather is monitored just fine in Ireland with all the satellite and weather station data constantly being collected. What we need are scientists who are not too lazy to go back more than 10 years.
UPDATE: Ed Caryl has provided a link with an updated chart, now posted above. It appears that Professor Devoy’s Dublin sudden sea level rise came in a single year: 2001. In 2001, the gauge changed hands. More research on this could be most interesting.

"Polly Higgins, one of the most inspiring figures in the green movement, has died aged 50. Higgins, a British barrister, led a decade-long campaign for “ecocide” to be recognised as a crime against humanity. She sold her house and gave up a high-paying job so she could dedicate herself to attempting to create a law that would make corporate executives and government ministers criminally liable for the damage they do to ecosystems.  Such a legal instrument could be a powerful tool for conservationists, climate campaigners and activists trying to stop air and water pollution, but earlier proposals for this to be included in the Rome statute on international crimes against humanity were dropped in 1996. Ten years ago Higgins set out to revive the idea. She wrote a book, Eradicating Ecocide, lobbied the United Nations law commission, organised mock trials and established a trust fund for “Earth protectors”. Although the law has yet to be recognised, momentum is growing as a result of the ongoing climate crisis and growing evidence that major companies lobbied against policies that could protect people from pollution and other environmental harm. On her organisation’s website, Higgins lamented the continued absence of a law that she believed would change the world. “There is a missing responsibility to protect … What is required is an expansion of our collective duty of care to protect the natural living world and all life. International ecocide crime is a law to protect the Earth.” Higgins grew up on the shores of Loch Lomond and childhood discussions with her meteorologist father and artist mother were often about green issues. According to an interview with the Scotsman, her parents were initially shocked that their daughter had entered the legal profession, but Higgins later said: “The Earth is in need of a good lawyer.” Several other legal organisations are now fighting for the environment in the courts, with occasional successes such as the Urgenda case in the Netherlands, in which a judge ruled that the government’s efforts to fight climate change were inadequate and emissions cuts must be stepped up. Campaigners say an ecocide law would take this and other campaigns to protect nature to new levels. The Guardian columnist George Monbiot wrote that it could make the difference between a habitable and uninhabitable world by shifting the balance of power and forcing executives to think twice about actions that might damage the planet. After discovering she had an aggressive form of cancer and had only weeks to live, Higgins told Monbiot that the work she pioneered would go on after her death. “My legal team will continue undeterred,” she said. “But there are millions who care so much and feel so powerless about the future, and I would love to see them begin to understand the power of this one, simple law to protect the Earth – to realise it’s possible, even straightforward. I wish I could live to see a million Earth protectors standing for it – because I believe they will.” On social media, tributes and condolence messages were sent by a wide range of groups and individuals, including philosophers, human rights campaigners, lawyers and Extinction Rebellion activists. The author and activist Naomi Klein tweeted: “She devoted her life to changing broken laws that have failed so miserably to protect the natural systems on which we all depend. Her work will live on.” Kate Raworth, a teacher at the Environmental Change Institute of Oxford University, said she was devastated by the loss of the brilliant, pioneering legal campaigner. “May bright young lawyers worldwide be inspired to continue her essential work,” she tweeted."
"The head of the Metropolitan police, Cressida Dick, has urged Extinction Rebellion activists to protest lawfully as officers continued a large-scale operation to clear environmental campaigners from sites at Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge in central London. With more than 1,500 officers on duty at the protests, Dick has asked demonstrators to move to an officially designated site in Marble Arch or go home. Later on Saturday, hundreds of police officers were clearing activists from a blockade on Waterloo Bridge, where protesters have been since the Extinction Rebellion disruption campaign started five days ago. The Press Association reported that by 6pm officers had removed six campaigners who had been chained and glued to the underside of a lorry on the bridge in an operation that took almost six hours. Quite the scene on Waterloo Bridge. Hundreds of police are here to clear the #extinctionrebellion protest camp. pic.twitter.com/7mCuOZnLs1 Earlier, crowds clapped and cheered as activists who had been chained to the road at Oxford Circus were lifted into police vans. Police drafted in 200 extra officers to deal with the protests, which began on Monday and have resulted in more than 750 arrests. Officers said they would try to clear Oxford Circus by the end of the Saturday. Speaking to Sky News, Cressida Dick said that “lots of people have had miserable disruption to their lives” because of the anti-climate change movement. “I’ve got one message for the protesters: please, go to Marble Arch where you can protest lawfully, stop your unlawful protests, and if you don’t want to go to Marble Arch then go home.” An Extinction Rebellion spokesman at Waterloo Bridge said there were more than 100 officers on the bridge, with 14 police vans and a large tow truck at its south end and more vans at the north. “It looks like they are making a concerted effort to clear the bridge,” the spokesman said. A video of police dragging demonstrators along the ground in an operation to remove a pink boat from Oxford Circus on Friday prompted concerns about police tactics against protesters, who have been polite and apologetic throughout. Officers used angle grinders to cut through the bars below the hull of the Berta Cáceres boat, named after the murdered Honduran environmental activist, to which protesters had chained and glued themselves. The intersection was calm on Saturday as bank holiday shoppers mingled with protesters, asking questions about the movement and its tactics. Of the 750 people arrested in connection with the campaign as of 4pm on Saturday, which has included protests at Marble Arch and Parliament Square, 28 have been charged. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The Met said most of the arrests had been for breaching section 14 orders, which are in place in all the protest areas except Marble Arch. The force announced that on Friday it had renewed the order requiring protesters to clear Waterloo Bridge for a further three days. On Saturday, police were accused of intimidating protesters, many of whom are young people, in an attempt to crush the movement. Mike Schwarz of Bindmans solicitors in London said he was concerned about elements of police conduct and tactics. Schwarz, who is representing a large number of protesters, told the Observer that officers appeared to be attempting to scare people at the demonstrations, many of whom faced being arrested for the first time. By Saturday afternoon, only 28 people had been charged with an offence out of 750 arrested by 4pm. “Police tactics, perhaps deliberately, run the risk of intimidating activists in the hope of subduing the protest,” Schwarz said. “Many of the arrests have been first-timers. The policing often appears disproportionate.” He added: “There is concern about police conduct at the stations. They have been detaining people for hours – why are they keeping them in cells for so long? What is behind this? It might be a lack of resources, a lack of coordination and, simply, a war of attrition, where they are desperate to get people off the sites.” Extinction Rebellion designated Oxford Circus a place to discuss the campaign with members of the public who have questions. On Saturday, bank holiday shoppers were keen to engage. Michelle, 30, and Lee, 31, from St Helens in Merseyside, were eager to speak to activists during an Easter break in London after watching the campaign unfold on TV during the week. “I agree with some of the points but I disagree with the methods,” Michelle said after a lengthy discussion with an activist, adding that the movement appeared quite London-centric. “It wouldn’t happen in St Helens,” added her partner. Milo, seven, was in Oxford Circus with his father and said he thought the protests were a good thing. #ExtinctionRebellion pic.twitter.com/pWgEpLQZaJ If climate change is not avoided, “it’s going to get so hot like Venus. Everyone is going to die and there’s going to be a total extinction. If the government listens, they might fly less planes and drive less cars,” he said. Nick, a 56-year-old civil servant who was chained to the road at Oxford Circus, said it was “an unusual way to spend his annual leave”. He said he was not happy to be there and he did not take the possibility of being arrested lightly “but I’m going to be here as long as it takes”. After actor Emma Thompson’s appearance at Oxford Circus on Friday, Olympic gold medalist Etienne Stott was among the latest celebrities to lend their support to the demonstrators. The London 2012 canoe slalom champion turned up at Waterloo Bridge after joining protests in Nottingham, and told the Press Association: “I joined the protests because I don’t think there is anything more meaningful that I could be doing in my life right now. “The climate emergency is just such a serious thing, and for me I’m willing to put in as much time and energy as I can spare and try and use everything I can to try and make the situation better.” The singer Charlotte Church tweeted her support saying that she would join the protesters in the future. @ExtinctionR I'll be with you for the next one. I wanted to watch for a while, sorry not super brave,  but having seen how peaceful,creative, purposeful and family friendly your protest was I will join you next time. Thank you for your giving. Xx Late on Saturday, just before midnight, there still appeared to be significant numbers of activists at three London sites – Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Parliament Square – despite the call from the Met chief to confine their demonstration to Marble Arch.  Thanks for the support @charlottechurch and by the way the Rebellion has not finished. Our Rebels in London are still rebelling for life. So please do go there if you can because it would be great to have you there and you do not have to get arrested if you do not want to. 🌴🌻🍄 https://t.co/QeIMY3yGna"
"Police have cleared the remaining Extinction Rebellion activists from Waterloo Bridge in London, despite earlier calls on social media for people that were willing to be arrested to “go there and save it”. The roads around Parliament Square were cleared of protesters earlier on Sunday, with the northbound carriageway of Waterloo Bridge reopened to traffic by the evening. On Sunday night, police continued their operations, moving to remove the last activists, who had glued themselves to the bridge and to each other. Officers had earlier warned people that remaining on the bridge was an “arrestable offence”, and requested that the activists move to Marble Arch, the designated protest area, where hundreds of activists remain. However, many demonstrators chose to stay at the Waterloo Bridge site, drumming, dancing and singing all along the bridge. At least six campaigners were chained to each other by their hands, with their arms covered with various substances to slow the process of removal by officers. Two men who had glued their hands to the lampposts on Waterloo Bridge were cut free by officers and arrested. The last protester on the bridge, a 70-year-old woman who did not wish to be named, told the Press Association that said she felt embarrassed to be the last one and was “trying to look dignified”. Having already been arrested at Oxford Circus “chasing after a pink yacht”, she said she would rather be arrested again than walk away, as per the requests of officers. Asked why it was important for her to join the movement, she said: “I have been a nurse and a childminder most of my life. The world we are leaving for the children and grandchildren is going to be horrendous and we let it happen. It happened on our watch. So we have to stand up and fight or lie down and fight.” The Metropolitan police has requested about 200 extra officers to help deal with the protests, in which 963 people have been arrested and 42 people, aged from 19 to 77, charged. Extinction Rebellion have said there will be a “people’s assembly” at Marble Arch on Monday afternoon to decide what will happen in the coming week, with the movement appearing split on what next steps to take in their campaign of non-violent civil disobedience. Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate campaigner, made a speech in solidarity with the protesters in Marble Arch. The Swedish student took aim at the “politicians and people in power” who had long been able to satisfy demands for action with “beautiful words and promises”, and declared that governments would no longer be able ignore the impending climate and ecological crisis. “I come from Sweden and back there it’s almost the same problem as here, as everywhere, that nothing is being done to stop an ecological crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises,” she said, after being greeted with loud cheers. “We are now facing an existential crisis, the climate crisis and ecological crisis which have never been treated as crises before. They have been ignored for decades and for way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. We will make sure that politicians will not get away with it for any longer.” Thunberg, who has been credited with inspiring a worldwide movement to reduce carbon emissions, said humanity was sitting at a crossroads. She told those gathered at Marble Arch that they had chosen which ecological path they wanted to take. She emphasised that they were now waiting for the rest of the world to follow their example. “We are the ones making a difference, we the people in this Extinction Rebellion and the children’s school strike for the climate,” she said. “It shouldn’t be like that, but since no one else is doing anything, we will have to do so.  “We will never stop fighting for this planet, for ourselves, our futures and for the futures of our children and grandchildren.” Later, Massive Attack played a concert for the crowds. Thunberg will meet MPs including the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, next week. She has been touring Europe throughout her Easter holidays, imploring leaders to take radical action before it is too late. Last week, she poured scorn on EU leaders for holding three emergency summits on Brexit and none on the threat posed by climate change, suggesting that it evidenced politicians’ disinterest in tackling climate change. Her speech was given a standing ovation. Thousands of Extinction Rebellion campaigners had blocked four areas in central London on Monday, but on Saturday police regained control of Oxford Circus."

This was the worst storm in 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, …well, make that 0.1 years.
Where I live the storm ended yesterday evening. One news media outlet (NDR radio) summed it nicely earlier this morning, saying that the storm “was worse than expected”, but then just two sentences later the report said “the damage was far less than expected”. This is like saying the day was hotter than they thought it would be, but that the thermometer rose less than expected.
All in all, Xaver was just a normal big North Sea storm of the type seen dozens of times already. If the hype served a purpose, it was that people were extra careful and so the loss of life was practically near zero.
 
20:45:
Where I live the wind has died down considerably. I went for a walk and there really wasn’t that much wind at all. Maybe it’s just a calm spell. The evening news have hyped it up as much as they could and seem to be hoping for a storm surge to flood Hamburg early in the morning. No deaths to report yet. Overall, it’s just another typical winter storm.
Latest wind gusts (km/hr) so far at some locations:
– Where I live: 78
– Helgoland (North Sea island): 128
– Sylt (North Sea island): 128
– Emden: 92
– Hamburg: 89
– Bremen: 89
– Rostock: 83

Some exaggerations going on in the media. For example, the northern port city of Kiel was reported (by Bild) to have seen a wind gust of 137 kph. but the weather station shows only 76 kph!
Winds appear to have peaked. In places like Hamburg and Bremen they are nowhere near reaching the forecast highs of up to 140 km/hr. Good news: so far no reported deaths, and only two injured. And no mention that the storm is caused by “climate change”.  Obviously the PIK has not issued any statements to the press up to now.

Meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann reports gusts of 154 km/hr in Helgoland, but he doesn’t expect any record wind speeds to be recorded. Matters not much better in the UK: www.bbc.co.uk/weather.
Already lots of media hyping it up as if Xaver were the storm of the century. But Kachelmann tweets: “And just for the record: Xaver is not and never will be the worst storm in decades.”
Top wind gusts (km /hr) so far at some locations:
Where I live: 85
Helgoland (North Sea island): 154
Sylt (North Sea island): 130
Emden: 81
Hamburg: 85

Rostock: 74
Keep in mind these are wind gusts, and not sustained wind speeds.
 
14:00
This morning at 8:30 am all was calm. But by mid morning the winds started acting up by mid morning. Now we are getting gusts over 70 km/hr and mixture of rain and ice.
The peak of the storm is expected to hit Hamburg by 4 pm. So far no reports of deaths or injuries. Also no comments from the PIK house of horrors or from Mojib Latif.
Top wind gusts so far:

Sylt (North Sea island): 116 km/hr
Emden: 77 km/hr
Hamburg: 80 km/hr
Bremen: 40 km/hr
Rostock: 65 km/hr
Expect the numbers to go up in the next hours.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo. Don’t get all your hopes up, all you conspiracy people out there. This is nothing really big and probably just has to do with how the mysterious inner machinery of Google works. I have absolutely no idea about how it works. To me it is just an amazing piece of machinery.
We know Wiki is infamous for its gatekeeping of climate content. But can we trust Google to deliver fair and balanced information searches? I bring this up because on the 31st of May I wrote a harmless blurb about Naomi Oreskes Naomi Oreskes Denial of Nonconsensus. After I posted it, I googled “Naomi Oreskes Denial” and my post appeared on page 1 at position 5 or 6, meaning anyone googling those words would have found it easily – right there on the first page. I remember feeling quite pleased about it.
But if I had been Ms Oreskes, I probably would not have been too happy about that. After all, in her world, there’s nothing but consensus out there, and so we can’t have any dissent, now can we?
A day later on June 1st I googled it again, and this time I was relegated to page 2, position no. 17 – meaning at that point I had already been put on the Google conveyor belt to obscurity. Today, 5 days later, I googled “Naomi Oreskes Denial” again. This time Google had moved my post down to page 5 position 56, meaning most searchers probably would not find it. Moreover, clicking on the link they provide no longer takes you directly to the post itself, but to my homepage instead. This assures that over time the post eventually gets buried. Naomi Oreskes’s illusion of consensus thus stays undisturbed.
I don’t know if other bloggers have had similar experiences. If so, it could be interesting to hear about them. There are lots of experiments we could try, like applying various inputs and to see what outputs are produced.
Try googling Googlegate! and see what happens.
As this is a harmless post, and I think Google may leave it at the top of their search results. Right Google?
Update: Many have already written about Googlegate. This is interesting: nationalpost lawrence-solomon

Share this...FacebookTwitterLe Monde here has an article which in large part re-iterates what NYT journalist Andrew Revkin wrote 3 days ago. The selfish, adolescent follies of the Turney expedition are seriously disrupting the supply of serious scientific operations in the Antarctic. A number of scientists worldwide have not found Turney’s charade amusing at all.
The piece is titled: “Scientists angered by cruise trapped in Antarctica“.
After describing how the botched expedition and the ensuing helicopter rescue, Le Monde writes how the relief operations are now “endangering several major research programs being conducted on different scientific bases of the sixth continent.” There’s only a 3-month window available for supply ships to make vital deliveries. Time is of the essence when it comes to logistics in Antarctica.
On the Turney expedition, Le Monde quotes Yves Frenot, the French Director of the Polar Institute Paul Emile Victor (IPEV):
It is a tourist pseudo-scientific expedition. It’s a little ‘cruise fun’.”
Glaciologist Jérôme Chappellaz of the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l’Environnement, who is still at the Casey Antarctic base, said:
The expedition was presented as being scientific, but there are tourists on board who paid to go on a trip.”
Because of the distress call coming from the Turney’s chartered expedition vessel Akademik Shokalskiy, Le Monde writes: “Vital supplies comprising hundreds of tons of food, fuel and equipment could not be fully discharged from the Aurora Australis, which was requisitioned in emergency.”

The supply disruption is not the only thing that irked scientists on other Antarctic bases in need of vitally important supplies, but they later had to watch booze-cruise, spring break like going-ons onboard the ice-bound Akademik Shokalskiy. Le Monde quotes Mr. Chappellaz:
At Casey, when the colleagues learned the ‘Australis’ had been requisitioned, there was a little panic. What was most shocking was the manner in which the members on the Shokalskiy expedition communicated: on screens we saw them partying, singing, etc. – without at any time seeming to ask what they were putting in peril.”
Le Monde also quotes glaciologist Joe McConnell (Australian Antarctic Division) in the New York Times, who stated the rescue operations will also likely cause considerable disruptions for French and Chinese programs because their vessels had also also been diverted.
Le Monde writes that the cost of the Chinese and Australian ice breakers are close to $80,000 per day – each! And that doesn’t include the crew! Right now the Chinese Xue Long is trapped in ice and no one can say how long before it will get out.
M. Chappellaz vents:
It is not normal that this expedition, which uses science as a pretext for adventure-tourism, is jeopardizing multi-annual research programs.”

Finally Le Monde raises concerns that the pictures of a stranded “climate science vessel” trapped in deep ice may be leaving a long lasting false message on the subject of global warming in the minds of the worldwide public.
Finally, perhaps these two reports from the New York Times and Le Monde provide hope in that in the future they will start to distinguish between the sophomoric alarmist climate scientists who want to change the world in a rush, and those that are truly serious about doing real science.

"It’s the climate policy debate, so veering into Numptyville is par for the course, but I confess we are there earlier than even I expected. For the past few days of the election campaign, we have been having a conversation about the use of international permits – if you can call what’s been happening a conversation. It’s been more like a series of unconnected statements. A bout of incoherent shouting in a wardrobe.  In the interests of preserving sanity, let’s try and tether the debate to some basic facts and concepts. Labor has proposed using international permits as part of its climate policy measures to allow high-emitting businesses to reduce their pollution at least cost. Sticking with basic facts, using international permits to lower the costs associated with reducing pollution was something the Coalition said it was prepared do. Yes, that’s right. This government. The one that’s still in power. That happened in 2017, when it reviewed its climate policies. In December 2017, the government’s policy was to “support, in principle, the use of international units”. If you are curious enough to click through to that source document, let me save you five minutes. Look on page eight. So stay with me. The government that flagged using international permits, with a final decision about the timing and scope of use to be taken in 2020, is the same government that is now trying to sell the voters (and media outlets gullible enough to swallow and amplify the latest most lurid conspiracy about “carbon credits for Kazakhstan”) a big bucket of bollocks. The official line now is the use of international permits will cost an absolute motser, and end heavy industry in this country. Just while we are back in the vault, the same 2017 climate policy review also suggested the government would pursue a new light vehicle fuel efficiency standard to reduce transport emissions – another position the government now disavows because it wants to pretend that Bill Shorten has a secret plan to confiscate your ute. I mean seriously, this is pathetic. How cynical can you get? For people who have no idea about permits, why we are talking about them, what they are, why they are even remotely relevant, allow me to assist. If you want to reduce pollution there are a couple of ways to do it. One is high-cost. The other is least-cost. If you want to force down domestic emissions at any cost, you don’t use policy tools such as permits. You just set strict rules, and insist that heavy emitters reduce their pollution. Doing that might mean some firms go out of business, but that doesn’t matter to you if your objective is reducing pollution at any cost, because the science tells you there is an urgent problem to address. If you don’t want to do that, if you want to reduce pollution at least cost, then policy tools such as permits enter the mix. Labor’s proposal is an emissions reduction target of 45% for heavy polluters, and it has flagged allowing businesses to buy permits to help them meet their liabilities. Put at its simplest, having access to permits means businesses can buy emissions reduction occurring elsewhere. Having to buy permits imposes a cost on the business – but that’s the point. If the objective is to reduce pollution, there is a price associated with doing it. The only question is whether the price is high or lower. There is no free lunch. A point worth noting while we are on costs. The government has in recent years passed the costs of emissions reduction onto taxpayers rather than polluters. That’s what the emissions reduction fund is. It’s a pot of taxpayer money that pays for emissions reduction. So you are paying for emissions reduction now. You just don’t know it, because nobody sends you a detailed set of accounts. Back to our free lunch. Scott Morrison in the shadow of an election sent a number of public signals to try to reassure voters that the Coalition was taking climate change seriously. But the fact is the Coalition has retreated to the Tony Abbott position. That’s what the confected moral panic about international permits and ute confiscation tells us. We are back to the Abbott position. Back to hyperbole and wrecking in the hope that governing by graphic novel can win you an election. There are legitimate questions about the use of permits. The first is: should any government be allowing them in the mix when the science suggests the need to reduce pollution is urgent? The second is: are the permits junk? The third (which links to the first) is: how much usage should you permit? The fourth concerns the relative costs associated with using them versus not using them. It’s completely reasonable to ask Labor questions about the costs associated with its climate policies, just as it’s reasonable to ask the Morrison government about the cost of six years of inaction, which is this government’s legacy. But while it’s fine to ask questions, this conversation also has to touch reality, and ensuing reporting and analysis has to cut through the spin. By shouting about the dangers to the economy of businesses being forced to buy permits to reduce their carbon liabilities, the Coalition is drawing a bright red line that should not be missed. The government is saying it doesn’t support emissions reduction if that imposes a cost on businesses. The government is saying that emissions reduction that imposes a cost on anyone apart from you, the voter (because you are already paying), should not happen. Just give yourself a minute to absorb that position, and line it up against what the climate science tells us needs to happen. It’s an extraordinary thing to say in an election season where Australian voters are deeply worried about climate change."
"Canadians on Prince Edward Island are preparing to vote on Tuesday in a regional election that could lead to a Green party forming a government for the first time in the country’s history. The party leader, Peter Bevan-Baker is a Scotland-born dentist who has transformed a routine election into a closely watched race as he seeks to upend expectation and precedent on 23 April.  The bucolic island – Canada’s smallest province – is best known internationally as the home of LM Montgomery’s classic children’s novel Anne of Green Gables. But it also remains a region heavily reliant on fishing and farming – industries that are increasingly precarious as the area grapples with the effects of climate change. Bevan-Baker’s potential win also underscores the unpredictability and diversity of Canadian politics. Last week, voters soundly rejected a progressive government that promised to tackle climate change in the heartlands of Canada’s oil industry. For generations, the 153,000 residents of Prince Edward Island have experienced a see-saw of political consistency, with the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives alternating power with remarkable predictability. But this belies an exciting history of Canadians firsts: Prince Edward Island elected the first non-European premier (Joseph Ghiz), the first elected female premier (Catherine Callbeck) and the first openly gay leader (incumbent premier Wade MacLauchlan). “Could we become the first province to elect the Green party? It’s possible,” said Paul MacNeill, publisher and political commentator on the island. No Green party in Canada has ever formed a provincial or national government. A win by Bevan-Baker would upend precedent, but even a minority government would be a first in the province since the 1800s. While the province’s economy is roaring, the public appears to have grown weary of what would amount to four consecutive terms of Liberal government if premier MacLauchlan is re-elected on Tuesday (though it would only be his second term). Bevan-Baker’s candidacy, however, promises to upset the status quo in a region known for its political moderation. “He is fiscally conservative. He’s socially responsible and he’s environmentally aware,” said MacNeill. “Between the lilt of his voice and his policies – which are middle of the road for the most part – he’s won a lot of converts.” And Bevan-Baker has been astute at reading the electorate. “They’ve been presenting themselves less as a party with an activist agenda on environmental issues and more as a party that will pay attention and is capable and interested in listening to the people,” said Don Desserud, a professor of political science at the University of Prince Edward Island. In a province heavily reliant on agriculture, courting the rural areas, especially given the declining prosperity of family farms, is key to any electoral breakthrough. “What Bevan Baker has done, is reformulated [the Greens’] message to say that they want to work with farmers, not against [them]. They want to help people. They want to support them,” said Desserud. The result is policy proposals from the Greens that dive deep into pesticide and chemical fertiliser rules, but one that also emphasises individual responsibility as opposed to government regulation. But a Green government also holds a certain poignancy for islanders on the front line of climate change: each day, the Atlantic Ocean eats away at its famed red cliffs and sections are expected to soon disappear beneath rising sea levels. “Living on an island, you start to see the effects of climate change in a tangible way, especially as a farming and fishing community,” said Colin Buchanan, a musician in the province’s capital Charlottetown, who plans to once again vote Green. While Canada has experimented with Green politicians in the past – most recently with Mike Schreiner, a small business owner in Guelph, Ontario, who won 45% of the vote in the province’s recent election – the country has been wary to fully embrace the party as a viable option in forming government. But the electoral strategy of the party in PEI might also portend a shift in thinking about how to court a wary electorate. “What the Green party has had to do is to basically rebrand themselves … as a far more comprehensive party,” said Desserud, likening its strategy to that of European Green parties. The Greens have enjoyed a surprisingly robust lead over the other two parties throughout the campaign, even in conservative rural areas, but recent polling suggests the election has tightened into a three-way race. The Progressive Conservative party leader and former journalist, Dennis King, is well-liked and seen as a moderate voice – and has slowly chipped away at Bevan-Baker’s outsized lead. But the campaign, which has been cordial and friendly, has also been beset by tragedy: on Friday, the Green candidate and local teacher Josh Underhay and his young son died in a canoeing accident, a shocking blow to the tight-knit community. “Josh brought humour, enthusiasm and boundless energy to every situation,” said Bevan-Baker in a statement the next day, announcing all campaign activities would be suspended over the weekend, with other parties also following suit. In the last election, Bevan-Baker’s 2015 seat was the lone Green representation in the province’s legislative assembly, capping 10 previously unsuccessful attempts at winning a seat in Canadian politics. Hanna Bell brought the party’s seat count to two, following a 2017 byelection win. But politics is a private matter for many and most residents are tight-lipped about their choice at the ballot box, making any predictions difficult. “Islanders are a lot more more traditional than the numbers likely show,” he said. “Maybe I’ll be wrong. I hope I am.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran journalist Ulli Kulke of the German blog Die Welt has a report claiming that how sea levels are not rising anywhere near as fast as climate science alarmists are claiming.
First Kulke reminds readers that measuring sea level is no easy task because, depending on the location, sea levels can vary by several decimeters – even up to a meter. Much of the science relies on complex statistical computations and the results depend on the methods used.
Kulke writes:
A scientific study by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has closely examined data from the measurement stations located mainly at the coasts and reached the result that sea level rise calculations were exaggerated upwards. In the study Michael Beenstock and colleagues reached the result that sea level rise on a global average is only 1 millimeter and that by the end of the century it will rise only 10 centimeters; only 1/3 of the stations showed a detectable rise, 61% showed no movement and 4% showed a drop.”
Overall 1 mm/year is about 67% less than what Jason TOPEX satellite altimetry is showing (3 mm). If anything, Beenstock’s result indicate a sea level rise slowdown.

Beenstock is not the only scientist who has found sea level rise is much slower than believed. Kulke writes that other peer-reviewed studies reach similar conclusions. For example Nicola Scafetta of Duke University (see full paper here) shows that sea level is subject to 60-year cycles and concludes that the human impact on sea level is too small and is statistically insignificant.
Unfortunately these finding were not available in time to be included in the last IPCC assessment report AR5. Kulke writes that this was also “the case for other studies which recently showed that Co2’s effect on the global climate is present, but is however greatly exaggerated“.
Kulke cites another study that shows that the extraction of groundwater has caused close to half of the sea level rise of the last years. Kulke concludes that there’s no indication that sea level is rising faster because of man-made CO2 and that we are facing the fall of civilization, even if “scientists like Stefan Rahmstorf tirelessly paint pictures of man-made apocalypses on the wall“.
The studies cited here tell us one thing: Whoever tells us that there is a consensus among scientists that climate change is happening faster and faster, is just plain wrong.”

"Over the past few days, I have watched members of the Extinction Rebellion movement block bridges, disrupt public transport and lock themselves to lorries. I have been moved by their bravery and inspired by their message, but puzzled by their strategy. On the face of it, the rebels have been effective. They have disrupted major cities, gained publicity and built bonds of solidarity. But are they achieving their aim of building a more sustainable world? According to Stanford University’s Doug McAdam, the climate change movement has historically been a failure when compared with other movements. Climate activists have struggled to engage politicians, been unable to build influential organisations, and failed to connect with the wider public. The Extinction Rebellion may mark a turning point. The rebels have injected a sense of urgency and emotion back into the issue of climate change, but creating meaningful and long-lasting change requires more. A movement must reach out beyond true believers and connect with a wider base of potential supporters – wherever they might be found on the political spectrum.  Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam Climate activists talk about saving the natural environment from “harm”, “caring” for the planet and working towards climate “justice”. Such language appeals to the left but antagonises the right. Researchers have found that conservatives heed messages about climate change when they are couched in values they hold dear – that means talking about saving the climate as obeying authority, preserving the purity of nature or defending your country. A recent study published in the journal Nature: Climate Change found that “interventions that increase angry opposition to action on climate change are especially problematic”. The only sound way forward was to “transform intergroup relations”. That meant being able to reach out beyond one’s political tribe and draw in other groups. You do that through their values, their language and their rituals. Extinction Rebellion’s call for “ecological justice” will appeal to people on the left, but it will miss out those in the centre and alienate folks on the right. If the rebels want to reach out, they could instead talk about “preserving the purity of nature” or “saving our national natural heritage”. Their tactics are also likely to push away many potential supporters. Acts of civil disobedience such as occupying bridges, guerrilla gardening and protest puppetry may appeal to seasoned activists, but are a turnoff for thousands of potential supporters who might walk past such occupations. If the rebels want to reach out, they should use social rituals which other groups are familiar with – instead of glueing themselves to DLR trains, they might hold tea parties at local fetes. The identity offered by the Extinction Rebellion movement will resonate with would-be rebels, but the majority of people who could potentially be won over to their cause don’t see themselves as “rebels”. Instead they identify as parents, workers, neighbours, members of ethnic or religious groups and many other things. To effectively reach out, the climate change movement needs to connect with these identities. After all, one of the main reasons people change their minds is when they have an extended conversation with someone who is like them but who has changed an opinion. But perhaps the Extinction Rebels do not want to reach out. Their avowed aim is to encourage 3.5% of population to undertake system change. If the Extinction Rebels continue to focus on attracting a relatively small group of activists they will open up a space for a mass movement which can appeal across political boundaries. If such a mass movement does indeed come about, the Extinction Rebels are likely to provide an important service. This will be due to what’s called the radical flank effect. This is when more extreme groups make us aware of the problem, in turn forcing the authorities to work with more moderate movements to create the solutions. • André Spicer is professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City, University of London"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAdd another to the list of absurd things claimed to be caused by global warming: Vessels getting trapped in unexpected sea ice!
This morning Switzerland’s online flagship daily NZZ here has a report on yesterday’s rescue of the Professor Chris Turney’s ill-fated Antarctic expedition. Once again we see naughty climatologist kids hiding behind mother media’s dress for protection.

Alvin Stone, media manager of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition and ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science blames global warming for vessel getting trapped in thick summertime sea ice. Photo: ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science.
Like many major western media outlets, the NZZ is well known for its biased, faith-based position when it comes to reporting on the man-made climate warming issue, often coming to the rescue of climate scientists whenever they find themselves in a jam. Turney’s expedition is no exception.
The article, written by Heidi Gmür, goes out of the way to defend Turney’s botched junket expedition, claiming that “passengers and crew on the ship were never in any immediate danger.”
The NZZ writes that it inquired directly with Alvin Stone, Media and Communications Manager at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, University of New South Wales, to obtain more details about the expedition. According to Stone, except for the minor inconvenience of getting trapped in sea ice for nine days, the expedition was a success. The NZZ writes:
…the surprising turn of events that the expedition had taken didn’t hinder the scientists in finishing their work: ‘Fortunately the scientific measurements had been completed only hours before the vessel got stuck in ice’.”
The NZZ then looks at the massive internet and blog criticism that the debacle unleashed, characterizing it as “furious remarks and commentary from those who question climate warming“. The NZZ goes on to defend Turney’s expedition against the irony that his vessel got stuck in summertime sea ice and that the event starkly illustrates the myth of a warming Antarctic. The NZZ writes (my emphasis):

Wrongfully so, Alvin Stone claimed upon inquiry on Thursday. Moreover, indications are that it is precisely climate warming that led to the vessel’s awkward predicament. This is the ice in which the Shokalskiy got caught, so-called fast ice which had broken off from the continent years earlier, said Stone; moreover measurements show that there has been a decrease of precisely this kind of fast ice in the Antarctic – this in contrast to so-called sea ice that is created by the freezing of water around the continent.”
Blame all the thick vessel-trapping sea ice on climate warming. Can you believe it?
It’s also unclear whether the NZZ is telling readers untruths or if it is reporting out of plain ignorance. As ice on the continent grows, so would the rate of calving due to pressure.
Again we are being asked to accept that increased sea ice is a sign of climate warming, and the same goes for a decrease. This is not science – rather it very much appears as creative rationalization by those desperately clinging to doctrine.
The NZZ then informs that Turney suspects that the situation in the Commonwealth Bay, where the Shokalskiy got stuck, “has changed dynamically as three years earlier a spectacular collision between an ice berg with the Mertz Glacier took place.”
Now we see Turney is blaming his vessel getting stuck on climate warming. It couldn’t possibly get more desperate than that, nor more embarrassing for the institution of academics. I wonder if he intends to sue the fossil fuel industry for the millions in damages incurred by the expedition so far.
In reaction to the NZZ article, a vast majority of readers leaving comment are responding with outrage. Climate science crazy train has gone off the rails.
Finlly the NZZ writes that vessel owner will have to bear the costs of the rescue, citing international maritime law. The owner is reported to be the Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological Research Institute of Russia. That will be interesting to watch, especially given the latest revelations discussed here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf the notion “the science is settled” isn’t dead by now, then it just got a few more 30D spikes pounded into its coffin. Make no mistake about it: THERE IS NO CONSENSUS.
Der Spiegel’s Axel Bojanowski has just published online a 7-part piece on the climate war between scientists.  http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,688175-7,00.html
I don’t have much time today, got some appointents and I have to take the bread home too. Here’s the general gist of it.
Part 1:  Bojanowski lays out the battlefield and describes how climate scientists got tangled up in conflict.
Part 2: Most scientists are somewhere in between the extreme views. There’s a lot of uncertainty concerning the consequences of AGW. Big Industry launched a sceptic campaign in the 1980s and 1990s.
Part 3: Climate scientists countered, and fiddled with activist environmental groups. Both pressured industry and politicians. Many German scientists fell in line with environmental groups. The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research PIK and the Max Planck Institute drew up position papers together with the WWF.
Part 4: The battle in the media. US media was balanced and alllowed Big Oil funded sceptic views to proliferate. Klaus Hasselmann blames the media for over-dramatizing climate scenarios. Sceptic scientists in Germany became marginalised. Media outlets reporting sceptic views came under fire from scientists and activists.

Part 5: Fighting in the trenches. Alarmist scientists were reluctant to reveal their work, fearing it would only be attacked. Their studies had great ranges of uncertainty, and this made it easy for sceptics to take them apart. Then Mann  put out the hockey stick curve, which turned out to be flawed. Briffa put out his curve in 1999, but warned of uncertainty, and wrote that the MWP was probably as warm as today. Mann’s stick was featured in TAR 2001, Btriffa’s curve not. Concerning hiding data sociologists believe that the damage is done. Without transparency, science is not credible.
Part 6: E-mails show Mann and Jones had too much influence on the journals, and acted as gatekeepers. Mann denies it, saying the journal editors decide the peer-reviewers. Conflicts in science are not unusual, but in climate science it has reached an extreme.
Part 7: Climate science is so politicised that it is now difficult to conduct. Mistakes were made in placing too much emphasis on consensus. Silvio Funtowicz sums it up: “Scientists who promise simple answers are best ignored”.
—————-
I wish I had more time to go into it more deeply – but I don’t right now. Hope to write more about this later.
Update: I made a small boo boo I think; the last sentence should read:
Sociologist Peter Weingart (and not Silvio Funtowicz!)  sums it up: “Scientists who promise simple answers are best ignored”.

"Australians want environmental action. As Katharine Murphy explained a few weeks back, “private polling conducted for the environment movement and for the major parties suggests community concern about climate change is currently sitting at levels not seen since the federal election cycle in 2007”.  A survey commissioned by the Australia Institute showed the majority of voters wanted to mobilise on climate “like they mobilised everyone during the world wars”. That result was consistent around Australia, with 57% of Queenslanders and 60% of Victorians agreeing that the country faced an emergency. The ABC Vote Compass found the environment ranked as the most important issue by 29% of respondents, up from 9% in 2016. Why, then, aren’t we seeing the parties in a bidding war to address such concerns? We know that if focus groups returned equivalent anxieties about refugees, the campaign would devolve into a contest to formulate new techniques for border cruelty. We’ve all seen that movie before. In 2013, Tony Abbott made the three-word slogan “stop the boats” central to his bid for election. Kevin Rudd desperately sought to counter by introducing the grotesque PNG solution, which incarcerated new boat arrivals on Manus Island and prohibited refugees from ever settling in Australia. He described it, correctly, as “a very hardline decision” – and yet at the time only 14% of Australians had nominated asylum seekers as one of the three most important issues determining their vote. If that tiny proportion could radically alter refugee policy at the election, why hasn’t the support of 53% of voters for a WWII-style climate mobilisation dramatically reshaped the 2019 contest? As we head to the polls, neither major party is promising anything like the “emergency action” the majority of Australians wants. The Coalition shows more enthusiasm for ridiculous fulminations against electric cars than any serious attempt to address global warming. As for Labor, Shorten’s policies represent a significant step back from the (inadequate) measures previously proposed by Gillard and Rudd. Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, Shane Wright rightly calls the ALP platform “as much an effort to neutralise the political attack as to find ways to truly reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions”. The reluctance of politicians to propose real environmental action might seem bizarre, given a context where that action would be not only right but also popular. But the comparison with refugees illustrates the peculiar dynamic of climate politics. Perversely, asylum seekers became such a preoccupation for both parties because, in one sense, border security was never a significant issue in Australia. Jordan houses nearly three million refugees; Pakistan, 1.4 million. Precisely because the refugee numbers arriving in this country were, in relative terms, utterly minuscule, governments could deliver “solutions” (albeit at great financial cost and with tremendous cruelty). Addressing the environmental crisis isn’t as easy as beating up on defenceless asylum seekers. A meaningful response entails challenging powerful vested interests. In particular, you can’t decarbonise an economy without defeating the corporations whose business practices depend on the despoliation of the planet. A recent study noted that just a hundred companies were responsible for more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. But those companies include some of the most significant corporate entities in the world – and mainstream politicians regard going toe to toe with multinational capital as “courageous” in the Humphrey Appleby sense of the word. To put it another way, in our system, the wishes of the voters don’t necessarily prevail. Think of the war in Afghanistan and how it dragged on and on, even though, for years, every survey showed most Australians wanted the troops brought home. What mattered then was not popular opinion but the elite consensus in support of the war. The same might be said about climate. Ordinary people want radical policies but corporate Australia doesn‘t. In Britain, hundreds of environmental protesters have been arrested for acts of civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion. “We are facing an unprecedented global emergency,” ER’s manifesto reads. “Life on Earth is in crisis: scientists agree we have entered a period of abrupt climate breakdown, and we are in the midst of a mass extinction of our own making.” The group calls for governments to declare a “climate and ecological emergency”. But it also demands a “citizen’s assembly”, on the basis that professional politicians have proved themselves incapable of addressing the crisis. Let’s say it again: Australians want environmental action. We can’t afford more delays. .The majority of carbon emissions from fossil fuels have entered the atmosphere in the last 25 to 30 years – that is, during the period in which global warming was understood and governments were supposedly fighting it. Extinction Rebellion’s now an international movement, with an Australian group signing up those prepared to embrace civil disobedience, up to and including being arrested. It’s election season, the one period in which politicians supposedly listen, and there’s still no sign of the climate message getting through. We desperately need a people’s movement. As Tim Winton wrote in the Guardian on the weekend, “Enough cowardice. Enough bullshit. Time for action.” Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist "
"Once, a night in with David Attenborough promised the TV equivalent of a warm blanket. It was a chance to watch spectacular creatures revelling in the beauty of their natural habitats, as the man with a voice as soothing as ice-cream described what we could see, from the violent to the serene. Those days are gone. Attenborough’s recent move to Netflix, for Our Planet, was deceptive: a seemingly gorgeous nature documentary that doubled up as animal kingdom snuff movies in which the beauty of those natural habitats was revealed as a crumbling paradise, ruined by people and particularly by greed. One of the main points of praise for Our Planet, which was well received, suggested that Attenborough was no longer tiptoeing around the issue of climate change, the implication being that he had done so before. You sense that Our Planet was unfortunately timed for the BBC. In Climate Change: The Facts, the gloves are now not so much off as thrown to the floor in a certain rage. It’s right there in the title, bold and stark. This hour-long documentary, part of the Our Planet Matters season, is wide-ranging yet concise, easy to understand, not blighted by the ego of, say, An Inconvenient Truth, and it is designed to do for climate change denial what 2017’s Blue Planet did for single-use plastic.  That’s not to say it should be Attenborough’s responsibility to get the wider public to pay attention, nor that it is down to the BBC. It isn’t. But Climate Change: The Facts is a rousing call to arms. It is an alarm clock set at a horrifying volume. The first 40 minutes are given over to what Attenborough calls, without hyperbole, “our greatest threat in thousands of years”. Expert after expert explains the consequences of rising CO2 levels, on the ice caps, on coastal regions, on weather and wildlife and society itself. The most powerful moments are in footage shot not by expert crews who have spent years on location, but on shaky cameras, capturing the very moment at which the reality of our warming planet struck the person holding the phone. In Cairns, Australia, flying foxes are unable to survive the extreme temperatures; rescuers survey the terrible massacre, and we learn that while 350 were saved, 11,000 died. A man and his son talk through their escape from raging wildfires, over the film they took while attempting to drive through a cavern of blazing red trees. These are horror movies playing out in miniature. It is difficult to watch even five minutes of this and remain somehow neutral, or unconvinced. Yet as I kept on, scribbling down an increasingly grim list of statistics, most of which I knew, vaguely, though compiled like this they finally sound as dreadful as they truly are – 20 of the warmest years on record happened in the last 22 years; Greenland’s ice sheet is melting five times faster than it was 25 years ago – I started to wonder about responsibility, and if and where it would be placed. This would be a toothless film, in the end, if it were hamstrung by political neutrality, and if its inevitable “it’s not too late” message rested solely on individuals and what relatively little tweaks we might make as consumers. What about corporations? What about governments? Then, at that exact moment, having played the despair through to its crescendo, the experts served up unvarnished honesty. They lined up to lay out the facts, plain and simple. Fossil fuel companies are the most profitable businesses man has ever known, and they engage in PR offensives, using the same consultants as tobacco companies, and the resulting uncertainty and denial, designed to safeguard profits, has narrowed our window for action. It is unforgivable. I find it hard to believe that anyone, regardless of political affiliation, can watch footage of Trump calling climate change “a hoax ... a money-making industry” and not be left winded by such staggering ignorance or astonishing deceit, though it is, more likely, more bleakly, a catastrophic combination of the two. At least Nigel Lawson only appears here in archive footage, and his argument sounds limp, to put it kindly. Climate Change: The Facts should not have to change minds, but perhaps it will change them anyway, or at least make this seem as pressing as it needs to be. With the Extinction Rebellion protests across London this week, disrupting day-to-day business, and this, on primetime BBC One, maybe the message will filter through. At the very least, it should incite indignation that more was not done, sooner, and then urgency and a decision to both change and push for change at a much higher level. Because there is, for a brief moment, just possibly, still time."
"Sajid Javid has called on police to use the “full force of the law” against Extinction Rebellion protesters causing disruption in London to draw attention to the issue of climate change. The home secretary, who is positioning himself for a run at the Conservative party leadership, made a series of tweets condemning “any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law”. He called on the police to “take a firm stance” against protesters who were “significantly disrupting the lives of others”. “Over recent days, commuters trying to earn a living have been unable to travel to work and businesses have been disrupted,” he said, following a meeting with Met police chiefs. “Emergency vehicles have faced difficulties navigating the road networks and the demonstrations have put added pressure on police officers whose job it is to solve crimes and protect the public. “Let me be clear: I totally condemn any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law. They have no right to cause misery for the millions of people who are trying to lead their daily lives. Unlawful behaviour will not be tolerated.” Hundreds have been arrested and more than 1,000 officers deployed to police the protests, which entered their fourth day on Thursday. Scotland Yard took the rare step of releasing a detailed statement setting out the difficulties they have faced keeping control of the protests, while avoiding infringing on the activists’ rights to demonstrate. They said demonstrators’ tactic of lying down meant four officers were needed to make an arrest but said there was no legal justification for more draconian tactics, such as kettling and mass-arresting groups, because the demonstrations were peaceful. Politicians have struggled to respond to the protests, as they are keen to head off complaints that not enough is being done to tackle climate change at the same time as taking a tough stance against disruption to commuters. Javid and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, have come under pressure from the rightwing press in recent days to take a more outspoken stance against any protesters disrupting public transport or acting illegally. In a letter to the home secretary, Khan suggested that cuts to funding were restricting the ability of the Metropolitan police to cope with the activists. “The Met’s ability to police protests without impacting on core policing priorities – such as tackling knife crime – has been made significantly harder by the huge cuts to government police funding,” he said. Citing £850m of cuts to the force since 2010, he added: “Whether to tackle violent crime, or police protests, our brave police officers deserve the resources they need to keep us safe.” He highlighted the increasing cost of policing a growing number of protests in London, and said he was working with the Met to consider claiming for a special grant to help with costs for the current demonstrations. He has said on Twitter that the world is “facing a climate emergency” and that he “fully supports the right of protesters to protest on this vital issue”, while urging organisers to “work with police to ensure their demonstrations are peaceful and lawful and that disruption is kept to a minimum”. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, said: “We’ve got the message,” after some activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to a garden fence at the home of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Claire Perry, the energy and climate change minister, also said that she “got the science, motivation and passion driving climate emergency protests” but could not see that “disrupting one of world’s busiest transport systems … blocking emergency routes and making life difficult for so many is going to build consensus and support for the changes we need”."
"Janet Laurence is wearing a living plant in a glass vial around her neck. The bright pop of green stands out against her flowing white dress. It’s as if she’s just stepped out of one of her own artworks – perhaps the one in which endangered rainforest plants are grown in beakers of laboratory glass, with lines of transparent tubing connecting the plants’ roots. “All my life I’ve been very empathetic with other species,” she says. “I have incredibly vivid memories of always being very caring of things in nature, of plants and other animals.”  Meeting Laurence feels startlingly serendipitous. The Australian artist’s work has been exhibited in Paris, London, Berlin and is held by museums the world over. Her career spans more than three decades, yet the concerns at the centre of her art have never been more urgent – climate change, environmental destruction, humanity’s failure to adequately reassess its relationship with nature. Laurence’s art feels like a project that’s more important than ever, especially for those of us who have desperately tried to make sense of the catastrophe we’re facing – extreme weather events becoming alarmingly more frequent, pollution infiltrating the deepest oceans and highest mountains, governmental failure to address any of it – and fretted about how to reconcile that with our daily lives. But her work hasn’t always been well received. “When I first started making art and wanting to work with nature, I was really criticised a lot for it,” she tells Guardian Australia. “In the feminist era I was told, you shouldn’t work with nature.” To do so would be to reiterate reductive ideas about women as nurturers – as opposed to men, who were, well, everything else. “It was very odd.” After Nature, now showing at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art, is the first major survey of Laurence’s work. The title, a reference to the nature writer WG Sebald’s prose poem of the same name, evokes both the idea of a time post-nature, and an homage to it – threads that Laurence’s work deals with simultaneously. While she sees herself as part of the fight against the destruction of the natural world, she’s equally concerned with our ability to transcend the very concept – to do away with the artificial separation between humanity and the rest of the living earth. The installation of endangered rainforest plants, Cellular Gardens (where breathing begins), forms part of the retrospective. In a room nearby is Deep Breathing: Resuscitation for the Reef: coral and fish skeletons are tagged, wrapped in brightly coloured thread, sewn into translucent pouches and held in glass vials inside stacked perspex boxes, while footage of the living – for now – Great Barrier Reef is projected onto the surrounding walls. It was Laurence’s – and Australia’s – contribution to the Artists 4 Paris Climate Exhibition that was held alongside the 2015 climate change conference. In the Theatre of Trees, a new installation created for MCA, a flowing fabric structure of concentric rings, like the growth rings of a tree, fills the centre of the room. Walking through it in the dappled, moving light, you can hear birds, the breeze, leaves falling. Outside the tree in the corners of the room are three smaller installations: Knowledge, Wonder and Desire. The first is a partly interactive reading room full of works that Laurence says have inspired her. (She cites the writing of Luce Irigaray, Deborah Bird Rose, Judith Wright as influences; she singles out Amitav Ghosh’s “beautifully explicit” book The Great Derangement in particular.) The second is a herbarium; the third an “elixir lab” in which audiences can book tasting sessions to sample liquid infusions of different Australian trees: ginger, a native mint, Davidson plum, lemon myrtle and pine pollen. Laurence’s work is, before everything, very beautiful. The beauty of it is partly to entice an audience. “I am very aware in my practice of creating an attraction to enter a space,” she says. “I want you to linger.” This aesthetic is tightly coupled with politics; hers is an activist practice. Yet her work feels less like a polemic than a way of angling the light to catch the filmy webs that connect, say, the breath of a sleeping tiger to human vulnerability; blood vessels to the seedling of an endangered plant; and things as disparate as a taxidermied owl, a fallen tree, test tubes and bandages. If all this seems to border on the mystical, that’s not entirely an accident. In the 90s, Laurence’s work focused on alchemy and the transformation of matter; over the last decade, she has interrogated the potential of medicinal and psychotropic plants as a way to overturn archaic modes of understanding the world. We’re so accustomed to associating nature with the unknowable, the “other”; to thinking about civilisation and the natural world as two opposing concepts, rather than interconnecting parts of the same whole. That division, Laurence says, has been “culturally enforced and religiously enforced for so long, it’s the biggest obstacle we have”. “We have to get back in touch with nature in order to care for it. We’ll all be lost if we don’t do that,” she says. “There’s an amazing groundswell of activity happening, of caring for the planet happening, but how can we deal with this enormous global capitalist force that’s still so powerful? And it’s almost incomprehensible how it’s still so powerful. So I do believe it’s going to take probably something almost disastrous to break that.” It would be easy to give in to despair in the face of that, but Laurence says her resilience comes, in part, from her art. “Because I’m involved in what I think of as an activist practice and because by acting we get hope, I don’t feel overwhelmed by those forces myself,” she says. “But I know they’re there.” There is an inspiring honesty about the blur between Laurence’s work and how she tries to live her life. During our conversation, she tells me that she gardens a piece of public land on Sydney Harbour. It now includes two enormous bay trees that began life in a hospital for native plants she created for the 2010 Sydney biennale, called Waiting: A Medicinal Garden for Ailing Plants, full of damaged or impaired seedlings and saplings covered in bandages and gauze. The plants that died were preserved and used as part of a subsequent artwork; those that survived, she planted. “I want to bring you into an intimacy with nature. I feel the most important thing we have to do today on the planet is care for it and recognise our interconnection with it. And of course, what are we fighting against? We know the weight of our civilisation.” • Janet Laurence: After Nature is showing at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, until 10 June"
"It is the near future. You wake in a house warmed by a heat pump that extracts energy from deep below the ground and delivers it to your home. (Your gas boiler was outlawed years ago.) You rise and make yourself a cup of tea – from water boiled on a hydrogen-burning kitchen stove. Then you head to work – in a robot-driven electric car directed by central control network to avoid traffic jams. At midday, you pause for lunch: a sandwich made of meat grown in a laboratory. At the end of the day, you are taken home by a robot car – through countryside festooned with solar panels and turbines. Welcome to carbon-free Britain, a nation stripped of its petrol cars, diesel trucks and trains, gas heating, methane-belching cows, and jumbo jets. The UK of tomorrow is a zero-emissions haven. Or at least that is the dream, one that is now being pursued with passion by growing numbers of UK citizens. Indignant at the lack of political effort being made to curtail global warming, they have responded with mounting outrage which last week reached a peak during Extinction Rebellion’s protests in London. Creating a zero-emission society in the UK has become a major cause and it will receive further serious promotion next week when the government’s climate change committee publishes its report on how, and when, Britain can achieve this status and play a proper part in the battle against global warming. It will be hard work, as the committee will make clear. Last year 6.8 tonnes of greenhouse gases were emitted into the atmosphere per head of population in the UK. To decarbonise the nation, that figure will have to be reduced to zero. The crucial question is: when? Just how quickly can we eliminate our carbon emissions? Extinction Rebellion protesters are clear. They want the UK to be decarbonised by 2025. That will mean massive curtailment of travel by car or plane, major changes in food production – steaks would become culinary treats of the past – and the construction of swathes of wind and solar plants. But given that we face disastrous climatic change, only massive, widespread, rapid interventions can now save us from a fiery global fate, they say. Many experts disagree, however. They argue that such an imminent target is completely impractical. “Yes, you could decarbonise Britain by 2025 but the cost of implementing such vast changes at that speed would be massive and hugely unpopular,” says Lord Turner, former chairman of the climate change committee. Most expect the climate change committee will plump for 2050 as Britain’s ideal decarbonisation date. “2050 is do-able and desirable and would have an insignificant overall cost to the economy,” states Turner, who is now chairman of the Energy Transitions Commission. According to this scenario, developed nations, including Britain, would aim to achieve zero-emissions status by 2050 and then use the decarbonising technologies they have developed to achieve this goal – hydrogen plants, carbon dioxide storage vaults and advanced renewable generators – to help developing nations halt their greenhouse gas emissions by 2060. We would then have a reasonable chance of restricting global warming to less than 2C and so avoid the worst effects of climate change: unprecedented storms, melting ice caps, disappearing coral reefs, rising sea levels and drowned cities. But just how straightforward will it be to create a zero-emissions society? How easily will we be able to kick the carbon habit? At first glance, the evidence looks encouraging. Britain has already embarked on a path of carbon emissions reduction for its power generation industry. Fossil fuel plants have been closed and wind farms have been built in their place. And the change has already been reflected in Britain’s power statistics. In 2013, 62.5% of UK electricity was generated by oil, coal and gas stations, while renewable provided only 14.5%. In 2018, the figure for oil, coal and gas had been reduced to 44% while renewables were generating 31.7%. It is a distinct improvement – though we have yet to be given a date when engineers expect the last UK fossil-fuelled power plant to produce its final watts of electricity and to emit its last puffs of carbon dioxide. “Decarbonising UK power production is going well,” says George Day, head of policy for the technology and innovation centre Energy Systems Catapult. “There is a clear path forward.” But as he points out, there are many other sources of carbon dioxide in the UK. “The next big challenge will be heating. Gas boilers are major carbon emitters and dealing with them is going to be very difficult.” According to Day, about 90% of British people have gas boilers in their homes, most having been fitted relatively recently – over the past 20 to 30 years or so. “And we have really come to love them,” he states. “You get hot water and heating at a flick of a switch, after all. And that is a problem, he argues. “Dislodging that incumbent technology in a way that is socially acceptable is going to be really hard. Indeed it is probably the toughest challenge we face in decarbonising Britain because you are talking about homes where people are used to making their own decisions.” A solution would be to price gas out of common use, by putting increasingly heavy carbon taxes on household supplies so people can no longer afford them and are forced to change heating systems. But that would only lead to widespread protests, says Day. “Just look at the gilets jaunes,” he points out. Instead, ways will have to be found to entice householders – not compel them – to move away from gas heating to alternatives such as electric heating, heat pumps and hydrogen-burning radiators. “They will have to see it as a better alternative to gas heating,” says Day. “It will be a big task but I believe it can be done.” Time will be a key consideration. At present around 20,000 homes a year are being converted into low-carbon housing units. “However if we are serious about reaching zero emissions by 2050 then we are going to move with a lot more urgency,” adds Day. “By 2025, we will have to be converting around a million houses a year.” Nor is household heating the only headache facing the decarbonisation of the UK. Steel-making, cement manufacture, shipping, aviation and trucking also pose problems. Consider cement. It is the basic ingredient of concrete, the second most consumed substance in the world – behind water. Around 10 million tonnes of cement are used every year in a host of construction projects across the UK, from homes to new underground lines. (Hundreds of thousand of tonnes are being used to build the access shafts, underground stations, and tunnels for Crossrail, for example.) Cement manufacture requires heat which could be supplied using electricity generated by renewables. But a major problem remains: making cement involves breaking down limestone to obtain calcium oxide and that process releases carbon dioxide in significant amounts. It is estimated that cement manufacture is responsible for about 8% of current global emissions. Nor is it obvious how to find ways to eradicate them completely. Then there are farms and planes. “In the case of aviation, you might use batteries and hydrogen to power relatively small aircraft for short distances: a 100-seater for a flight of an hour or so,” says Turner. “But for a jumbo across the Atlantic you will still need fuels with the energy density of heavy liquid hydrocarbons.” As for agriculture, it is estimated that around 6 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are emitted from farms around the world. Major reductions could be achieved through improved management practices, say researchers. Nevertheless eating the meat of belching cows, no matter how tasty is the resulting steak, undoubtedly has a major impact on emission levels. Changes in the British diet will be needed. In the end, it will simply not be possible to reduce Britain’s fossil-fuel emissions to zero, say scientists. To compensate, we will have to take carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere. “That is the logical, inevitable consequence of trying to achieve zero net emissions in this country,” argues Corinne Le Quéré, of the University of East Anglia. “If you are looking for any net zero target then you have to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.” This can be done in three ways: naturally, by planting trees and shrubs that absorb carbon dioxide. Or artificially – on a larger scale – the gas can be removed as it is produced at a factory or power station that burns trees for energy. Or it can be removed by huge numbers of man-made air filters, known as direct air capture. The carbon dioxide can be liquefied and stored underground in underground caverns, or old, depleted gas fields under the North Sea. This is known as carbon capture utilisation and underground storage (CCUS). “In the end, your choice of replanting or of building underground storage facilities depends on how much carbon you will need to remove,” says Le Quéré. “Most calculations suggest Britain will need to take quite a lot of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to keep its net emissions at zero.” That arithmetic clearly implies that Britain will need to build a number of CCUS plants, a point backed by Charlotte Morgan, who chaired a recent task force that urged the construction of several carbon storage facilities in the UK. Each of these would be able to hold millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide. “These could create an enormous industry for Britain,” says Morgan, who envisages the creation of five industrial clusters – in Humberside, Merseyside, South Wales, central Scotland and Teeside – where CCUS facilities could be built and attract industries from around the world. “However, if we want to these up and running by the end of the next decade, we need to act quickly.” This need for speed is shared by many other parts of the zero-emissions programme, as we have seen. It may seem odd given it is unlikely it will reach its conclusion for another three decades. Nevertheless, scientists are adamant that even if choose 2050 for our decarbonisation date, we need to act now. This urgency of the task is emphasized by Joeri Rogelj at Imperial College London. “If the world limits emissions of carbon dioxide to no more than 420 billion tonnes this century, we will have a two in three chance of keeping global warming down to around 1.5C. “However, if we go above to 580 billion tonnes then our chances will be reduced to 50-50. The problem is that in 2017 alone, a total of 42 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide was emitted in a single year. By that calculation, we clearly do not have a lot of time to waste.”"
"On Monday morning a strange sight appeared, edging its way through the buses, taxis and shoppers on Oxford Street in London. A bright pink boat, named Berta Cáceres after the murdered Honduran environmental activist, was being pulled carefully through the traffic, eventually coming to a halt in the middle of one of London’s busiest thoroughfares.  Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam Bemused onlookers watched as activists secured “Berta” to the road, while others glued themselves to its garish hull. And with this act of flamboyant defiance, Extinction Rebellion’s climate protests had begun. In the five days that followed, thousand of people, from pensioners to young parents with toddlers, scientists to city workers, teenagers to teachers, have occupied four landmarks in the capital, defying repeated police attempts to remove them and causing widespread disruption. Smaller disruptive events have taken place across the UK and in 33 other countries. By late Friday evening police were saying that 682 people had been arrested in London. Three supporters who glued themselves to a train on Wednesday have been imprisoned. That same day four more attached themselves to the fence outside Jeremy Corbyn’s house, declaring the Labour leader “the best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the unfolding climate crisis. And on Friday about 20 young protesters, all born after 1990, unfurled a banner on a road outside Heathrow airport, asking: “Are we the the last generation?” But perhaps the protesters’ biggest achievement is that millions of people have heard their message that the world is in a spiralling climate emergency that demands transformative change to avoid catastrophe. Through hundreds of articles, editorials, and radio and TV interviews, including some hostile critiques of its tactics, Extinction Rebellion’s message has gone mainstream. “It’s been a resounding success,” said one of the group’s organisers, Howard Rees, surveying the scene on Waterloo Bridge on Thursday afternoon. “What are we on? Day four? We are holding all the sites, we are attracting loads of new members, everybody’s having a great time, there’s a party atmosphere everywhere … the police are generally positive and friendly towards us and agree with what we’re doing. And we are getting our message out there. It couldn’t be going better, really.” The four occupied sites, Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square, were all blockaded in quick succession on Monday morning, bringing widespread disruption to central London. And although activists gathering in the sunshine on Waterloo Bridge had no idea how long they would be there – or what the police reaction would be – there was a jubilant atmosphere as they swarmed on to the road. “I am so worried about what’s happening to the planet,” said Laura Sorensen, a retired teacher from Somerset. “We are on a knife-edge now and I felt strongly that I needed to get out and show myself, rather than just talk about it in the pub.” A little further along Waterloo Bridge was Josiah Finegan, a 22-year-old who had never been on a protest before. “I am freaking out about the climate, to be honest,” he said. “There have been so many warnings from scientists about what we are facing, it is quite shocking.” Before going to join the protest, Finegan added: “I have no idea what to expect or what might happen … I just heard about it and felt I had to come.” Police mingled with protesters, chatting and watching as flowers, trees in large tubs, a mini skate ramp and even a lorry were dragged into place on the normally traffic-choked bridge. Looking on, one senior officer said the police response would be proportionate. “These people are explicitly peaceful, they have liaised closely with us over their plans and have a legitimate cause. We all have a limit on what we think is the right level of action to take but I think everyone is worried about climate change.” Over the ensuing days, the success, tactics and sheer determination of the demonstrations took many by surprise, even though they had been more than a year in the planning. The strategy of peaceful mass disruption was tested in a much smaller series of protests over air pollution last year, with activists blocking busy junctions for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. The group hopes such protests act in two ways: they put economic pressure on the government by disrupting the infrastructure, and they force people to confront the reality of the climate emergency by interrupting their daily lives. Once they had honed the process, organisers spent months holding public meetings around the country. Thousands of people gathered in libraries and meeting halls, cafes and universities, pubs and churches to hear dire warnings about the consequences of the climate emergency and what they could do about it, with hundreds signing up to take part in larger-scale rebellions and be arrested. Speaking to the Guardian after a meeting last summer, Roger Hallam, one of the key figures behind this week’s protests, said: “It feels like we are tapping into something very powerful in terms of the frustration and urgency many people are feeling as the evidence mounts of the scale of the climate emergency we are facing.” Ten months later, it seems he was right. The group’s success this week has not come without internal tensions, exacerbated by the non-hierarchical structure of the group. The decision to block trains, and potentially tubes, was hotly debated long into the night on Tuesday. A similar discussion took place over the plan to hit Heathrow. And as the week has gone on, and the attention of the world’s media has slowly turned to the protests, the pressure on the volunteers trying to organise and control it has only increased. “The phones never stop ringing, we have press inquiries round the clock from media around the world … it wasn’t like this at my old job,” said one of Extinction Rebellion’s young media team, who took a break from her career to volunteer a few months ago. “But this has been one of the most exhausting, exhilarating weeks of my life.” Extinction Rebellion says thousands of people are signing up every day. The group’s rise to prominence has come amid mounting evidence of climate breakdown, from floods to heatwaves, melting ice sheets to poor harvests. Its message about the scale of the climate crisis has resonated because it is backed up with science. On Thursday night David Attenborough presented a primetime documentary on the BBC, Climate Change: The Facts, supporting Extinction Rebellion’s central claim that the world is in a climate emergency. Earlier in the week, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and must take urgent steps to reform. As the sun goes down on Waterloo Bridge on Thursday night, Finegan is dancing and laughing with a group of 20 or so people of all ages and backgrounds, accompanied by a collection of drummers and other musicians. “It’s been insane, amazing,” he says. “I have been worrying about this stuff so much but the last few days, well, I feel like this has changed everything.”"
"Governments will no longer be able ignore the impending climate and ecological crisis, Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist, has told Extinction Rebellion protesters gathered at Marble Arch in London. In a speech on Sunday night where she took aim at politicians who have for too long been able to satisfy demands for action with “beautiful words and promises”, the Swedish 16-year-old said humanity was sitting at a crossroads, but that those gathered had chosen which path they wish to take. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam “I come from Sweden and back there its almost the same problem as here, as everywhere, that nothing is being done to stop an ecological crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises,” she told the crowd. “We are now facing an existential crisis, the climate crisis and ecological crisis which have never been treated as crises before, they have been ignored for decades. “And for way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. We will make sure that politician’s will not get away with it for any longer.” Her speech came amid police efforts to forcibly clear Extinction Rebellion protesters from Waterloo Bridge as the group debated whether to continue its campaign of mass civil disobedience. Police said on Sunday night they had cleared all the protesters from Parliament Square. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the disruption was “counter-productive” to the cause of climate change and was stretching resources so much it could damage police’s ability to fight violent crime. Extinction Rebellion had earlier said it expected its supporters would be cleared out of the two sites occupied without permission as police prepared to evict them if they declined to leave voluntarily. Last week, the group gained global coverage for the disruption its tactics of civil disobedience caused in central London. On Sunday, the organisers said they intended to change tack and would offer to vacate some sites in exchange for the mayor acting on some of their demands. The Metropolitan police said they had made 963 arrests and charged 42 people. The force’s leader, Cressida Dick, said the group’s tactics, centred on peaceful direct action, had caused too much disruption. On Saturday, Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus were returned to normal use, after complaints from businesses about the blocking of some of the capital’s key arteries. On Sunday, activists rushed to Parliament Square, when police turned up in force to try to clear five roadblocks. Activists were using lock-on devices to hold the space, as well as gluing themselves to the ground and each other in order to slow down the police. Activists said there were three people locked on trees in the square with more ready to go up. They promised attempts to evict them would be “spectacular” and could take police all night. However, by Sunday evening the police said the square had been cleared. The stage-truck on Waterloo Bridge was finally removed by 5am on Sunday after police spent most of Saturday and well into the night removing protesters glued and locked on to it. Police spent hours using angle grinders to cut free the two protesters who had locked themselves down on the top of truck, before winching them down and carrying them into the back of waiting police vans. By Sunday night they were moving the activists to one side of the carriageway, and arresting those who are refusing to move. The Met has needed support from about 200 officers from other forces to deal with the protests, which have been peaceful. Khan said 9,000 officers had been involved in policing the protest so far. He said: “I share the passion about tackling climate change of those protesting, and support the democratic right to peaceful and lawful protest, but this is now taking a real toll on our city – our communities, businesses and police. This is counter-productive to the cause and our city.” The mayor added: “I remain in close contact with the Met commissioner, and agree that Londoners have suffered too much disruption and that the policing operation has been extremely challenging for our over-stretched and under-resourced police. “I’m extremely concerned about the impact the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime if they continue any longer. It simply isn’t right to put Londoners’ safety at risk like this.” The protest group said a phalanx of police vans were gathered around Waterloo Bridge on Sunday amid mounting expectation protesters would be forced out. Ronan McNern, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, said: “We think they want everything cleared by the end of the week. People are willing to be arrested. There is a deep sense we do not want to be attached to any single site. What this disruption is doing, we are the news now. It is making people talk in pubs and buses about Extinction Rebellion. It makes them think about their existence which is under threat.” Extinction Rebellion is discussing withdrawing from some sites in return for being allowed to remain in others and having its demands met. One manifesto from Farhana Yamin, an international environmental lawyer, advocated a “pause” in disruption next week to better project their demands and press for negotiations with government. She wrote: “Today marks a transition from week one, which focused on actions that were vision-holding but also caused mass ‘disruption’ across many dimensions (economic, cultural, emotional, social). Week two marks a new phase of rebellion focused on ‘negotiations’ where the focus will shift to our actual political demands.” She continued: “We want to show that XR [Extinction Rebellion] is a cohesive long-term, global force, not some flash in the pan.” Others in the group’s leadership were planning further disruption and a meeting this week will attempt to decide on the group’s strategy."
"I’ve been asking myself a question – and even posing it makes me queasy. Is it too late – are we beyond saving?  As a culture and a polity, when it comes to climate change, have we arrived at a point where we are now expected – even trained – to abandon hope and submit to the inevitable? OK, I guess that’s two questions. In good faith I can still say that the answer to the first is no. But I’d be a liar and a fool to give the same response to the second. No, it isn’t too late. But we’ve squandered decades of opportunities to mitigate and forestall impacts and we’re making a pig’s breakfast of responding to what is now a crisis. Even so, humans are not yet beyond saving themselves from the worst ravages of global warming. There’s fight in us yet, even if it’s a bit shapeless. The problem – and it’s an existential threat both profound and perverse – is that those who lead us and have power over our shared destiny are ignoring global warming to the point of criminal negligence. Worse than that, their policies, language, patronal obligations and acts of bad faith are poisoning us, training citizens to accept the prospect of inexorable loss, unstoppable chaos, certain doom. Business as usual is robbing people of hope, white-anting the promise of change. That’s not just delinquent, it’s unforgivable. Over the last 15 years in Australia our national governments have failed to respond effectively to the challenge of climate change, and for most of that time we actually gave ourselves the luxury of calling it a challenge. Now it’s more of a crisis. And it’s not as if our leaders are incapable of producing a timely response to a crisis. After all, in 2009 the government took bold steps to avoid an economic depression. And in the matter of refugees arriving by boat, governments still spend billions on emergency-level funding and infrastructure to meet what they view as a crisis of national security. But in the case of climate change there’s no equivalent sense of immediacy, no sense of priority commensurate with the dangers it poses to our future ability to feed ourselves, defend our largely coastal settlements, insure our homes, maintain national security and keep our children safe from harm. The message implicit in our governments’ refusal to act is that we should all just suck it up – as in “climate change is bullshit, and even if it’s not there’s nothing you can do about it”. Once internalised, this narrative is profoundly dangerous, not only for individuals, but for the entire community. It’s a licence for nihilism, a ticket to hell in a handbasket. And the cohort responsible for this mixture of denial and fatalism is far removed from the daily experience of the ordinary citizen, especially the youngest and poorest of us. They have become a threat to our shared future and we must hold them to account, immediately and without reservation. In the last 25 years I’ve observed a peculiar social phenomenon in individuals and communities that I mistakenly thought I understood because I was a child of the cold war. While working to help save ecosystems across Australia I’ve noticed a bruised attitude of beleaguerment in individuals and within groups that’s increasingly hard to ignore, a mounting grimness in the faces and language of people barely holding on in the face of steady, cumulative and unrelenting losses. They’re losing places, ecosystems, potential. It’s not restricted to activists; I see it in neighbourhoods and towns, I read it online, I get it in the mail. Ordinary folks – young and old – watching their waterways curdle, their soils blow away, their green spaces bulldozed, their fish gasping for air. Feeling wounded and betrayed, some are clinging to the last tendrils of hope, others are falling into despair. And that worries me. Ecological depletion is being experienced communally as a mounting loss of access and an erosion of possibility. In essence, a pruning back of future prospects. It’s expressed as grief, and the most palpable, widespread and immediate expression of it is now brewing over climate change. Beneath that grief there’s rage. I worry that this widely-shared grief and unfocussed rage may become the signal human disposition of our time, that the Anthropocene will be marked by fury and hopelessness. This frightens me just as much as the prospect of beachside properties falling into the sea, or even the death of our coral reefs. Acidifying cultures are as chaotic and dangerous as acidifying oceans. Younger people in particular have begun to feel abandoned by their leaders and elders. They suspect they’ll be left without food or ammunition to stage a fighting retreat in which every battle is a defeat foreseen and every bit of territory was surrendered in advance by politicians and CEOs who deserted them long ago to hide in their privileged bunkers and silos. So what hope for our kids? Why should we be surprised they’d walk out of school and march? Their futures are being traded away before their eyes. They see what many of their elders and betters refuse to acknowledge. That they’re being robbed. During the cold war many of us were gripped by dread – it was personal and communal – and in the books and films of the era our anxiety was palpable. We lived every day with the prospect of nuclear annihilation, and sometimes that possibility was clear, present and extremely proximate, a matter of hours and minutes when a possibility became an actual probability. And for some time now I’ve been trying to see our current crisis through that lived experience. Because we survived, didn’t we? The worst never happened. No one pressed the button. So, chances are, all will be well this time, too – right? But the reason humanity survived the cold war is because world leaders paid attention. They took emergent crises seriously. And in each instance of utmost danger, arguments of ideology and nationalism eventually fell away before the sacred importance of life itself. Beneath all the posturing there was, finally, a bedrock of humanity informing the technocrats and generals. Stepping back from the brink was expensive. Think what it cost in terms of pride, political prestige, assets, even territory. Consider the expenditure of ingenuity and infrastructure. And there’s our problem. Because in this country, when it comes to climate change, there’s no equivalent attention to the crisis. For some there’s no crisis at all. Our governments and corporations are ensnared in a feedback loop of “common sense” and mutual self-preservation that’s little more than a bespoke form of nihilism. Ideology, prestige, assets and territory are now tacitly understood to be worth more than all life, human or otherwise. And the four great capacities of humanity to solve a crisis – ingenuity, discipline, courage and sacrifice – these seem to be reserved for more important enterprises. The future, by all accounts, can wait. But the future is already with us. The button has been pushed – again and again. In 2011, along hundreds of kilometres of the West Australian coast, abalone crawled off the reefs to die in their untold thousands on the baking white beaches because of a 2-degree spike in sea temperature. A little further north at Shark Bay, the world’s largest seagrass meadows suffered a sudden mortality of 20%. In the Northern Territory two years later, mangrove forests died along a 1,000km stretch of coast. And the Great Barrier Reef experienced successive bleaching events so catastrophic they caused the nation’s most senior coral scientists to weep. Here’s the thing. To our current national government climate change is but a dry-lightning storm in a district unknown. For the denialists who control policy, the storm itself is an endlessly debatable phenomenon. And if the parish it’s lighting up really does exist, then it can safely be dismissed as remote and insignificant. But that district is real. Most of us know it as the immediate future. Some know it as the present. And it’s already burning. It’s peopled with folks who weep and seethe and dread what else may lie ahead. We can no longer wait patiently for our leaders to catch up. We cannot allow ourselves to be trained to accept hopelessness. Not by business, nor by governments. Both have subjected us to a steady diet of loss and depletion. It’s sapped us and left us mourning a future we can see fading before it even arrives. There’s no good reason to submit to this. No sane purpose in putting up with it. Because grief will paralyse us, and despair renders doom inevitable. We can afford neither. Australians can make a bad outcome inexorable by submitting to it meekly. Or we can fight for a viable future and meet this crisis shoulder to shoulder. I am of the passionate belief that we can and will. But to do this we’ll need to get our house in order – and fast. That means calling bullshit on what’s been happening in our name for the past 15 years. It’s time to make sharp demands of our representatives, time to remove those who refuse to act in our common interest, time to elect people with courage, ingenuity and discipline, people who’ll sacrifice pride, privilege and even perks for the sake of something sacred. Because there’s something bigger at stake here than culture wars and the mediocrity of so-called common-sense. It’s the soil under our feet, the water we drink, the air we breathe. Life. It’s worth the fight. But, by God, after decades of appeasement, defeatism and denialism, it’s going to take a fight. Time’s short. So, let’s give our grief and fury some shape and purpose and reclaim our future together. Enough cowardice. Enough bullshit. Time for action.

“If you have 99 percent of doctors who tell you ‘you are sick’ and 1 percent that says ‘you’re fine,’ you probably want to hang out with, check it up with the 99. You know what I mean? The idea that we ignore that we are in some way involved in climate change is ridiculous. What’s the worst thing that happens? We clean up the earth a little bit?”
That’s the wrong question. The question Clooney needs to ask is:
If on one hand you have 99 quacks wearing lab coats pretending to be doctors and armed with phony charts, fudged data and scare stories, all of whom on the payroll of the pharmaceutical industry, asking you to pay $10,000 a year for a little snake oil or else you’ll die – and on the other hand you have a dozen of the most renowned doctors, among them Lindzen, Christy and Spence, saying the way you feel is normal and all part of life and it isn’t necessary to pay 10,000 a year, who are you going to listen to?
George Clooney is a Hollywood actor who parrots lines and only repeats things that have been written down for him. His highest educational achievement is nothing more than a high school diploma. Listening to Clooney on climate science would be as reckless as listening to John Wayne Gacey on responsible parenting.
Don’t expect Clooney to look at the data himself. He wouldn’t know where to begin.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA press release by the Max Planck Institute (MPI) describes how a recent study shows that people are not very willing to make sacrifices if the benefits follow only much later in the future. That’s no surprise.
Immediate rewards make our brains rejoice and when such a reward beckons we’re happy to behave cooperatively. But if achieving a common goal won’t be rewarded until a few weeks have gone by, we are rather less euphoric and less cooperative. And if, instead of money, we’re offered the prospect of a benefit for future generations, our enthusiasm for fair play wanes still further.
Climate change is the largest public goods game that has ever been played and the whole of humanity are its players. The problem is that while we are now making the payments, the fruits of our efforts will only be enjoyed very much later and they will be shared among the whole of humanity. We ourselves or our children will thus benefit only very slightly from any restrictions we place on our lives today and our motivation actually to do something is correspondingly low.
You can read the entire Max Planck Institute press release here.
What’s remarkable about the study is that it accepts, as proven fact, that the climate will be much worse in the future – although we know 98% of the climate models have completely overstated the warming for the last 15 years.
Just imagine what the results of the study would have been had the test subjects been shown the models’ true performance beforehand. Why sacrifice when you know there isn’t going to be any benefit at all, ever?
And why inflict pain on yourself when you know the politicians, elitists and scientists will simply continue jetting around and living high on the hog while letting the poor taxpaying masses make all the sacrifice?
What do the study’s results imply?

The MPI press release writes:
‘The result of our experiment paints a gloomy picture of the future;’ summarizes Milinski. ‘We were unfortunately able to confirm Schelling’s prediction – it’s a disaster.'”
Yes, it’s a disaster: people aren’t going to sacrifice and embrace Spartan green living.
As a solution, the MPI proposes providing “short term benefits” to make going green more attractive. But how? Very disappointingly, the only short-term benefit the MPI is able to come up with is the benefit of “exporting technology”. But that won’t work because only a very few people would benefit quickly from exporting green technology (and my how they’ve benefitted so far!), and the rest of us would have to, well, keep sacrificing.
Only option left: force people to sacrifice
It seems the only option left, the MPI implies, is to force the necessary sacrifices onto the citizens, i.e. to ram it down their throats. Wouldn’t that be the ultimate demonstration of power?
Politicians and activist scientists have already convinced many among us to open up wide and to let the big pill gun into their mouths. All that’s left to do now is to force it down with one mighty thrust.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier this year the media were overflowing with reports about how a “super El Niño” was shaping up and that it could be a powerful one, so powerful in fact that it would make 2015 “very likely to become the hottest year on record by far.” Read for example posts by noted climate end-of-world theorists/cheerleaders Joe Romm, Andrew Freedman, Stefan Rahmstorf, Live Science…
Today German blog site Die kalte Sonn here brings us up to speed on the “super El Niño” topic. To sum it up, once again predictions by leading “experts” have turned out to be completely wrong. Call it climate false-alarmism.
=============================
Australian Meteorological Institute sees little chance of an El Nino in 2014
By Frank Bosse
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In mid May we reported here on developments in the tropical Pacific and directed attention to a possible El Niño, but left out the use of vocabulary such as “wreak”, “catastrophe” and “chaos”. But other German media outlets didn’t hold back:
Focus 24 February 2014: Global climate problem: Floods, hurricanes, droughts– this is what El Niño has done
FAZ am 12 May 2014: Warming and weather chaos: “El Niño” is taking off
Neue Zürcher Zeitung: «El Niño» could lead to chaos

And also one or the other followers of alarmism were hoping the heat from the ocean would finally end the observed global temperature stagnation.
Already in early June 2014 we warned here at our blog that the probability of an El Niño was less than what the models had been projecting. On 29 July 2014 the Australian Meteorological Institute announced at their website that the probability of an El Nino developing in the near future was greatly reduced:
EL NINO INDICATORS EASE
Despite the tropical Pacific Ocean being primed for an El Niño during much of the first half of 2014, the atmosphere above has largely failed to respond, and hence the ocean and atmosphere have not reinforced each other. As a result, some cooling has now taken place in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, with most of the key NINO regions returning to neutral values. While the chance of an El Niño in 2014 has clearly eased, warmer-than-average waters persist in parts of the tropical Pacific, and the (slight) majority of climate models suggest El Niño remains likely for spring. Hence the establishment of El Niño before year’s end cannot be ruled out. If an El Niño were to occur, it is increasingly unlikely to be a strong event. Given the current observations and the climate model outlooks, the Bureau’s ENSO Tracker has shifted to El Niño WATCH status. This means the chance of El Niño developing in 2014 is approximately 50%, which remains significant at double the normal likelihood of an event. El Niño is often associated with wide scale below-average rainfall over southern and eastern inland areas of Australia and above-average daytime temperatures over southern Australia. Similar impacts prior to the event becoming fully established regularly occur. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) index has been below −0.4 °C (the negative IOD threshold) since mid-June, but needs to remain negative into August to be considered an event. Model outlooks suggest this negative IOD is likely to be short lived, and return to neutral by spring. A negative IOD pattern typically brings wetter winter and spring conditions to inland and southern Australia.
The “missing heat” (as the temperatures have stood still since the start of our new millennium and thus are no longer in harmony with the pretty models…) now also appears nowhere to be found in the water. Keep searching!

"Youth activists have taken the Extinction Rebellion protests to Heathrow on the fifth day of action, demonstrating beside the main roundabout on the road to the airport. The activists, all born after 1990, unfurled a banner asking: “Are we the the last generation?” as dozens of police prevented them from blocking the road.  The protesters said they were risking arrest to highlight the dangers of climate change. “To everyone reading about this, I’m here because I love you and fear for your future and my future,” said Oscar Idle, 17, from Bristol. “It’s that love and that fear that gives me courage.” About 20 protesters were moved on to the pavement by police at one of the road entrances to the airport. Protesters stood by the tunnel that leads to terminals two and three, but all roads around the roundabout were open and there was no disruption to motor traffic as the group remained surrounded by police. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam About 25 police, some of them reportedly brought in from Cardiff and other regions, repeatedly warned the teenage protesters they could be arrested if they did not move on, but four of the activists refused to budge for more than an hour. The representatives of Extinction Rebellion Youth, which operates with some autonomy from the wider organisation, said they never planned to disrupt flights, though they had planned to block traffic intermittently. Several among the group chanted “People power” and: “We are the youth and we’re doing what’s right. We are the youth and we are fighting for our lives.” Some were in tears but held their ground. They said they were crying as much because of the climate crisis as the stress of the standoff. “We are consistently being punched in the face by the truth, but nobody is doing anything,” said Savannah Lovelock, a 19-year-old student from the University of Falmouth. “I just want to go home. But we have no choice. If other people stood up for the next generation, we wouldn’t have to.” “I shouldn’t be here, I should be revising for my end-of-year exams,” said Talia Woodin, 19, who is at Goldsmiths. “But I have to be here. What good is a degree if there is a possibility that there is no future?” “We know the risks and they are worth taking. I’m incredibly proud to be here with the others,” said Samar, 14. “We’re facing a complete disaster and I refuse to stand by and watch this happen without doing something.” At about 10am, the four activists moved on, holding hands with their arms raised. The action came as the number of arrests from Extinction Rebellion’s week of protest passed the 500 mark. Despite the detentions, activists have held roadblocks at four locations in central London since Monday and expect more to join them on Friday, the start of the Easter weekend holiday. They believe the BBC programme Climate Change: the Facts, which aired on Thursday night, will strengthen their cause. “The David Attenborough documentary will have a huge impact,” predicted Ronan McNern, a spokesman for Extinction Rebellion. He said the group’s disruptions over the past six months were shifting the debate. “We are creating conversations. For the first time people are talking at the breakfast table, in pubs and on the tube about the climate crisis. That’s what this is all about.” They have been boosted by wide media coverage and endorsements from prominent figures in the science community and entertainment world. In an open letter on Friday, the former Nasa scientist James Hansen spelled out the growing dangers of climate change and noted that he too has conducted “highly respectful acts of nonviolent civil disobedience – on occasion leading even to my arrest”. The latest high-profile supporter is the actor Emma Thompson, who joined the Oxford Circus camp on Friday morning. Hundreds of people sat in the street and listened to poetry readings. When dozens of police officers moved in to try to disperse them, Thompson – who was on top of a boat in the middle of the junction – joked: “I want to remind the police that Nanny McPhee is up here, and I have my stick with me.”  The home secretary, Sajid Javid – considered a contender in the Conservative party’s leadership race – called for police to use “the full force of the law” against the demonstrators. On Thursday night the Metropolitan police said they had cancelled leave for some officers over Easter. “This is putting a strain on the Met and we have now asked officers on the boroughs to work 12-hour shifts; we have cancelled rest days and our violent crime taskforce have had their leave cancelled,” the force said in a statement. The linguist and activist Noam Chomsky is among those who have sent a statement of support. “It is impossible to exaggerate the awesome nature of the challenge we face: to determine, within the next few years, whether organised human society can survive in anything like its present form,” he said. “The activists of Extinction Rebellion are leading the way in confronting this immense challenge, with courage and integrity, an achievement of historic significance that must be amplified with urgency.”"
"Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old founder of the school strikes for action against climate change, has said she hopes to join the Extinction Rebellion protests when she visits London next week. The Swedish activist will also take the campaign to the UK parliament, where she will speak to dozens of MPs including the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove. Her arrival on Sunday coincides with a surge of concern about the climate. On Thursday the BBC screened a documentary about the crisis, narrated by David Attenborough. In recent days, the governor of the Bank of England, groups of scientists and members of the clergy have added their voices to the call for more ambitious cuts to emissions. Thousands of Extinction Rebellion campaigners have blocked four areas in central London since the start of the week, and youth activists are staging a demonstration at Heathrow on Friday. Police have made more than 500 arrests but organisers have vowed to continue for another week. There have also been demonstrations by the group in New York, Paris, The Hague and dozens of other cities. Thunberg, whose strike sparked a global movement of more than a million students in less than a year, was also one of the signatories of the declaration that launched Extinction Rebellion in October. She had previously arranged to be in London after Easter to speak in parliament at the invitation of Lucas, meet student activists in the UK and to talk at a public event co-hosted by the Guardian. Before her visit, she said she was keen to join the campaigners on the streets. “I would love to participate in their protests while in London if there is time and if they are still protesting. I think it’s one of the most important and hopeful movements of our time. Civil disobedience is necessary to create attention to the ongoing climate and ecological crisis.” Extinction Rebellion plans to ramp up its protest over the weekend, when it hopes more people will join because of the bank holiday and the warmer weather. More actions, including a picnic on a motorway, are planned for Monday, Earth Day. Organisers say the protests will continue for another week, bolstered by Thunberg’s support. “She is abso-bloody-lutely important. I thank her from my heart,” said Ronan McNern, a spokesman for the group. “It’s not Extinction Rebellion that people should watch out for. It’s the School Strike 4 Climate, it’s the youth. This is their moment.” Thunberg has become a global figurehead for the climate movement in the past year. During her Easter holidays, she has been on a European speaking tour and has, so far, met Pope Francis and addressed the European parliament. MEPs gave her speech, which harangued them for spending too long on Brexit and not enough time on climate, a standing ovation. In the UK parliament next week, she will meet the Speaker of the House of Commons and talk to several dozen MPs.  “Greta is coming to the UK at a time of unprecedented public awareness and action around climate change – and will deliver a powerful message to politicians that they cannot ignore either the rising seas or the rising citizens’ movements demanding action,” said Lucas. “It’s especially significant given the divisiveness around Brexit and how vital it is that we put aside any political or other differences we might have to respond to the climate emergency. “All the main opposition parties have agreed to sit down and listen to her and the UK climate strikers she has inspired, and I think this could be a defining moment for how the UK responds to the climate and wider environmental crises.”"

Life is beginning to lose all meaning and purpose for some, as their religion collapses. For the AGW alarmists, it was so good despising and feeling superior to all the unenlightened flat-earthers and the rest of the planet-destroying humanity, and punishing them for their behaviour.
Sadly, the infliction of punishment is one primary element that makes the AGW religion so attractive for some, especially its leaders. In this religion it’s actually a virtue to seek ways to punish and control people instead of loving them. Those who join it are promised rescue, esteem and acceptance.

Inflicting punishment is a position of power. And when it comes to inflicting punishment, there’s an eerie thing about how people just queue up to do it – especially if there’s a social mechanism in place to reward it. Psychological experiments have confirmed this time and again, just as a recent French experiment on inflicting torture on pleading victims shows:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHRq7oMnZQ
http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1972981,00.html
In the experiment, those who inflicted the punishment eventually came back to their senses and were later horrified to see how they had been duped into taking it to such extremes. They even had to be psychologically debriefed.

"Because I am concerned about inequality and about the environment, I am usually classed as a progressive, a liberal. But it seems to me that what I care most about is preserving a world that bears some resemblance to the past: a world with some ice at the top and bottom and the odd coral reef in between; a world where people are connected to the past and future (and to one another) instead of turned into obsolete software. And those seem to me profoundly conservative positions. Meanwhile, oil companies and tech barons strike me as deeply radical, willing to alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere, eager to confer immortality.  There is a native conservatism in human beings that resists such efforts, a visceral sense of what’s right or dangerous, rash or proper. You needn’t understand every nuance of germline engineering or the carbon cycle to understand why monkeying around on this scale might be a bad idea. And indeed, polling suggests that most people instinctively oppose, say, living forever or designing babies, just as they want government action to stabilise the climate. Luckily, we have two relatively new inventions that could prove decisive to solving global warming before it destroys the planet. One is the solar panel, and the other is the nonviolent movement. Obviously, they are not the same sort of inventions: the solar panel (and its cousins, the wind turbine and the lithium-ion battery) is hardware, while the ability to organise en masse for change is more akin to software. Indeed, even to call nonviolent campaigning a “technology” will strike some as odd. Each is still in its infancy; we deploy them, but fairly blindly, finding out by trial and error their best uses. Both come with inherent limits: neither is as decisive or as immediately powerful as, say, a nuclear weapon or a coal-fired power plant. But both are transformative nonetheless – and, crucially, the power they wield is human in scale. Before we can best employ these technologies, we need to address the two most insidious ideas deployed in defence of the status quo. The first is that there is no need for mass resistance because each of us should choose for ourselves the future we want. The second is that there is no possibility of resistance because the die is already cast. Choice is the mantra that unites people of many political persuasions. Conservatives say, “you’re not the boss of me”, when it comes to paying taxes; liberals say it when the topic is marijuana. The easiest, laziest way to dispense with a controversy is to say: “Do what you want; don’t tell me what to do.”  If “let anyone do what they want” is a flawed argument, then “no one can stop them anyway” is an infuriating one. Insisting that some horror is inevitable no matter what you do is the response of those who don’t want to be bothered trying to stop it, and I’ve heard it too often to take it entirely seriously. I remember, for instance, when investigative reporters proved that Exxon had known all about global warming and had covered up that knowledge. Plenty of people on the professionally jaded left told me, in one form or another, “of course they did”, or “all corporations lie”, or “nothing will ever happen to them anyway”. This kind of knowing cynicism is a gift to the Exxons of the world. Happily, far more people reacted with usefully naive outrage: before too long, people were comparing the oil giants with the tobacco companies, and some of the biggest cities in the US were suing them for damages. We don’t know yet precisely how it will end, only that giving them a pass because of their power makes no sense. Innovation doesn’t scare me. I think that if we back off the most crazed frontiers of technology, we can still figure out how to keep humans healthy, safe, productive – and human. Not everyone agrees. Some harbour a deep pessimism about human nature which I confess, as an American in the age of Donald Trump, occasionally seems sound. Of all the arguments for unhindered technological growth, the single saddest (in the sense that it just gives up on human beings) comes from the Oxford don Julian Savulescu. In essence he contends that, left to themselves, democracies can’t solve climate change, “for in order to do so a majority of their voters must support the adoption of substantial restrictions on their excessively consumerist lifestyle, and there is no indication they would be willing to make such sacrifices”. Also, our ingrained suspicion of outsiders keeps us from working together globally. And so, faced with the need to move quickly, we should “morally bio-enhance” our children or, more likely, use genetic engineering, so they will cooperate.  This is roughly akin to “geoengineering the atmosphere” to prevent climate change – some people, having given up on taming the fossil-fuel companies, want to instead pump the atmosphere full of sulphur to block incoming solar radiation. Both cases are based on the premise that we humans won’t rise to the occasion. I hope Savulescu seriously underestimates the power of both technology and democracy – of the solar panel and of nonviolence. I believe we have the means at hand to solve our problems short of turning our children into saintly robots – which, in any event, wouldn’t do a thing to solve climate change, given that by the time these morally improved youths had grown into positions of power, the damage would long since have been done. And I’m convinced Savulescu is wrong about people’s selfishness presenting the main obstacle to solving climate change: around the world, polling shows that people are not just highly concerned about global warming, but also willing to pay a price to solve it. Americans, for instance, said in 2017 that they were willing to see their energy bills rise 15% and have the money spent on clean energy programmes – that’s about in line with the size of the carbon taxes that national groups have been campaigning for. The reason we don’t have a solution to climate change has less to do with the greed of the great, unengineered unwashed than with the greed of the almost unbelievably small percentage of people at the top of the energy heap. That is to say, the Koch brothers and the Exxon execs have never been willing to take a 15% slice off their profits, not when they could spend a much smaller share of their winnings corrupting the political debate with rolls of cash. If you wanted to “morally enhance” anyone, that’s where you’d start – if there are Grinches in need of hearts, it’s pretty obvious who should be at the front of the line. But let’s not win that way. Let’s operate on the assumption that human beings are not grossly defective. That we’re capable of acting together to do remarkable things. • Bill McKibben is an environmentalist, author and journalist This is an edited extract from Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? by Bill McKibben (Headline)"

Share this...FacebookTwitterJournal Nature can no longer be bothered to check facts anymore. Bad enough that they rarely subject global warming climate papers to real, rigorous peer-review, and so now even the most obvious rubbish gets by.
In a Nature comment, Professor Turney seems to be responding in part to harsh articles published by Cambridge University News and the The Mail on Sunday. Both these media outlets cited veteran polar explorer Robert Headland, who said “an ice-strengthened ship was totally unsuitable for the area where Turney conducted his expedition“.
Headland also accused Turney of carrying out the expedition “on the cheap” and that he had “needlessly taken many risks“.
In Turney’s Nature reaction to all the criticism, This was no pleasure cruise, Turney writes the following (my emphasis):
For the past six weeks on board the Russian icebreaker MV Akademik Shokalskiy, my colleague Chris Fogwill and I have led a team of scientists, science communicators and volunteers on a voyage from the New Zealand subantarctic islands to the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.”
Turney claims that the ship is an icebreaker when clearly it is not. That’s a falsehood, if not an outright lie. The fact is that the Akademik Shokalskiy is simply reinforced for travel in icy areas and has only the lowly UL rating, meaning it is suitable for “independent navigation in the Arctic in summer and autumn in light ice conditions and in the non-arctic freezing seas all the year round“, see www.globalsecurity.org.
In the Nature comment Turney also writes:

That is the reality of polar science. It is difficult. Almost every season, ships get caught in sea ice, teams lose communications and planes are sometimes tragically lost.”
All the more reason for taking a real icebreaker – which he didn’t. Gee, the whole time I thought it was an icebreaker!
Turney is proving to be a basket-case
The Turney story is becoming ever more comical. What we have here is a humiliated scientist who wants everyone to believe the Antarctic is melting away, yet claims he went down there in what he thinks is an ice breaker to break through ice; says he knew that conditions there were treacherous, yet took his family and tourists along anyway; says that conditions there are unpredictable, but claims that the sea ice and wind unpredictability caught him by surprise; says the expedition was no pleasure cruise, yet had a fully-stocked bar and we saw pictures of partying almost daily.
Even funnier is that Turney is now trying to fool himself and others into believing that he has done the whole world a huge favor in that he created a “remarkable rekindling of public interest in science and exploration” and that he will wow the world with “the quality of the research“.
After this fiasco (even Andy Revkin of the New York Times calls it just that) it’s clear that Turney is someone who is incapable of acknowledging errors. Worse, and even scarier, he and Nature seem to be telling us that he deserves a medal for what he has done.

"Scotland Yard has defended its response to the rolling protests in London that have caused disruption to millions and pushed climate change towards the top of the national news agenda. The Metropolitan police has come under increasing pressure to crack down on the Extinction Rebellion demonstrators who have blocked transport networks in the capital in recent days; not least from the home secretary, Sajid Javid, who has urged officers to “take a firm stance”.  On Thursday, the force said the demonstrations were proving such a drain on resources that police were having to release under investigation many of those arrested, even if that meant they simply returned to the protest sites, while Easter leave was being cancelled for officers who were being asked to work 12-hour shifts. Scotland Yard took the rare step of releasing a detailed statement setting out the difficulties they have faced keeping control of the protests, while avoiding infringing on the activists’ rights to demonstrate. It came on the same day as the protesters said their next target would be the UK’s largest airport – Heathrow. Police said the demonstrators’ tactic of lying down meant four officers were needed to make an arrest and said there was no legal justification for more draconian measures, such as kettling and mass-arresting groups, because the demonstrations were peaceful. “Those arrested are then taken into custody which again means our officers are off the streets temporarily while that process takes place,” the statement said. Police added: “We have been asked why we are not using tactics such as containment, physically and forcibly stopping the protesters from moving around. The simple answer is we have no legal basis to do so. These are peaceful protesters; while disruptive, their actions are not violent towards police, themselves or other members of the public. “We are looking at other tactics, such as tighter police cordons, but again that is resource-intensive in terms of officer numbers and, more often than not, it just shifts the protesters to another location nearby and does not assist in reopening roads.” Police said that, by Thursday night, more than 500 people had been arrested in connection with the protests; primarily on suspicion of minor offences. Ten of those have been charged with breaching section 14 of the Public Order Act, under which police can impose conditions on public assemblies to prevent serious disruption, and obstruction of the highway. Police added: “It is better for us to keep our resources and custody capacity moving and flexible than leave protesters sitting in cells for up to 12 hours before going to court for what, although highly disruptive, are lower level offences. “So, everyone else arrested has been released under investigation and will be brought back to be formally interviewed and charged as appropriate in due course. We are aware that means some protesters immediately return to the area to resume their activities; those people will be arrested again.” Scotland Yard warned the protesters they face a “robust response” if they target Heathrow on Friday. The force said it has “strong plans” in place, while the airport said it is “working with the authorities” to address the issue. Earlier on Thursday, Javid held talks with the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick. He said: “Everyone has the right to protest peacefully … But people do not have the right to break the law.” Javid added: “Let me be clear: I totally condemn any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law ... I expect the police to take a firm stance and use the full force of the law.” The Met said it considered London’s Marble Arch a legal protest site but that three others – affected areas Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge – were not and that conditions prohibiting demonstrations there had been extended until Sunday, Saturday and Friday, respectively."

The conference will feature a number of let’s-save-the-planet workshops. Click list of workshops.
One workshop that caught our attention is How to professionally deal with climate scepticism. Or simply put: Journalism for Dummkopfs. The panelists are Bob Ward and Ms Denial of Nonconsensus herself, Naomi Oreskes. The workshop’s objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.
That’s right, journalists are being encouraged to throw investigative reporting and balance overboard, i.e. to take up the role of propaganda outlet for press releases put out by the Climate Science Politburo. The panelists go on to warn:

Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics at the expense of the basis of life.
Yes, the alarmist zealots think the very basis of life hinges on this.
A few journalists in Germany have actually practiced journalism on the issue of climate science recently, and this has infuriated the Established Climate “Science” Community. They too are threatened with the Big Cutoff. You see, although journalists have the competence to report critically on “rudimentary” issues like economics, finance, politics, law,  civics and so on, climate science is far too complex with too much at stake to leave in their hands.
Not only are the alarmist zealots calling for a suspension of democracy, claiming casus belli, but now they’re also demanding that journalists abandon journalism altogether. What gate-name ought I assign to this one? Dummkopf Journalism-gate?

Share this...FacebookTwitterYet another vessel has been trapped by global warming sea ice! The Xue Long icebreaker has sent out a distress call.
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has released another press release:
Aurora Australis on standby as a precautionary measure 
Xue Long notified AMSA at 1pm AEDT this afternoon it has concerns about their ability to move through heavy ice in the area. The Aurora Australis has been placed on standby by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s (AMSA) Rescue Coordination Centre Australia (RCC Australia) to remain in open water in the area as a precautionary measure. The Xue Long has advised RCC Australia that it will attempt to manoeuvre through the ice when tidal conditions are most suitable during the early hours of 4 January 2014.
There is no immediate danger to personnel on board the Xue Long.”
Prof Turney tweets he is gutted by the news. I guess he can’t believe that climate warming could trap so many ships in sea ice. His communication manager just announced that all the new sea ice is caused by global warming, see my last post.

"Your coverage of the Extinction Rebellion protest has been exemplary. In line with their demand to “tell the truth”, perhaps headlines about climate change affecting us right now could take a less celebratory tone (Temperature records tumble as UK basks in Easter sunshine, 22 April).Caroline BettertonChichester, West Sussex • I cannot top Emily Maitlis’s claim that she once spotted Bill Clinton reading the Kama Sutra in a hotel bookshop (Report, 19 April). Some years ago I saw the then archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, browsing the bestseller table in our local Waterstones in Canterbury. Like Emily, I couldn’t resist looking to see what he was reading; I was rather surprised and amused that it was Fifty Shades of Grey.Colleen HowardCanterbury, Kent  • We have heard about cwningen and coinín, the Welsh and Irish words for rabbit (Letters, passim), but there has been no mention of the English coney, in common until the 18th century and still used, I believe, in some English dialects.Robert ProctorNottingham • Noting the perceived novel solution to the political problems of Ukraine (Actor Zelenskiy turns fiction into fact with landslide win in Ukraine election, 22 April), and our own relative chaos with Brexit, it is such a pity that Paul Eddington is no longer with us. His wisdom as the PM, Jim Hacker, would surely have served us well.Hugh MortimerDeal, Kent • Please can we have Sidse Babett Knudsen, who played Birgitte Nyborg in Borgen, as PM?

"I hope Extinction Rebellion pushes climate chaos to the top of the political agenda, but Ben Smoke is right that glorifying arrest won’t advance the climate cause (Journal, 16 April). As well as diverting effort into battles with the criminal justice system, it distracts from thousands of ways to decarbonise the economy: pension funds, insurance companies and banks control $400tn in assets, making decisions daily about where to invest, as well as influencing company boards, as Larry Elliott points out (Threadneedle Street’s timely warning for banks and insurers to take climate change seriously, 16 April). Local authorities shape our environment (and own £400bn in assets), and soon voters will decide who should run them. Every employer, school and household can make decisions that turn away from chaos.  The suffragettes’ battle for the vote is celebrated as a great victory for direct action, but 100 years later the struggle for women’s equality is still being waged within countless institutions. Creating lasting change takes political skill, as well as passion and persistence. For democracies to solve difficult problems like climate change and inequality, schools need to teach practical politics as a basic skill.Titus AlexanderAuthor of Practical Politics: Lessons in Power and Democracy; convener, Democracy Matters • I agree with Ben Smoke that it’s important not to fetishise the number of arrests in relation to current protests. Extinction Rebellion places too much emphasis on number of arrests. Think the government will negotiate on matters of substance? Think again. I speak as one taking part in the actions this week. The urgency is real, and people need to know the truth. But it will take profound public pressure on other parts of our system that hold us in stasis – vested interests, fossil fuel companies particularly, MPs and ministers, the media, finance, and local government. We need to listen to our allies and work with them, community groups and NGOs particularly. Extinction Rebellion’s sophistication around direct action will need to be matched by effective political strategy to achieve the kind of changes needed.Gill WestcottCheriton Bishop, Exeter • Thirty years ago I was chair of the Green party’s media committee. Caroline Lucas was the party’s press officer. We were working on the 1989 European election campaign – the one where the Greens won 15% of the vote but no seats (no PR then). Two days ago, I visited three of the four Extinction Rebellion sites and talked to activists. They were deeply impressive, committed people – non-violent, refusing to blame and shame, empathic, compassionate and universalist (Climate protesters target transport and Corbyn, as disruption hits traders, 18 April). Everything the Green party said 30 years ago is coming to pass. The planet can’t wait much longer. I commend the bravery, passion and wit of Extinction rebels. Recognised routes of influencing events have failed. Non-violent direct action led to the birth of civil rights for all in the US. Maybe it can lead to a Green New Deal here. This may be our last chance.Lyn DadeTwickenham, Middlesex • I read the article by Mark Carney, François Villeroy de Galhau and Frank Elderson of the Network for Greening the Financial System (Global finance must go green if we are to fight climate change, 17 April) on the way to an investor meeting, which I had to cancel due to the Extinction Rebellion protests at Oxford Circus. I’m raising investment for a reusable plastic-free biodegradable and compostable paint tin, to stop plastic single-use items ending up in landfill or the ocean in their hundreds of millions. I don’t disagree with the aims of the protest, but targeting all the business community is not right. Some of us get it and are doing something about it; please, activists, focus your protests on those who aren’t.Kim ThongerFinedon, Northamptonshire • The letter about HS2 from Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram (19 April), mayors of Manchester and Liverpool, might be persuasive if it were not written while Extinction Rebellion takes action against climate catastrophe and David Attenborough delivers his powerful piece on BBC One. The mayors’ letter is peppered with words and phrases that mean growth: economic potential, released capacity and, of course, the yearned-for “powerhouse”. But what the young people of Extinction Rebellion are saying is: how can you offer us a future based on growth? What is the point of releasing capacity if we run out of the planet’s fundamental resources: water, clean air, space to live that will not be flooded with seawater, soil in which food can grow? What we need is a plan – a transport plan, an everything plan – that considers every single aspect in relation to the threat to these resources.Alison LeonardHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire Tall glass buildings have a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing (Global finance must go green if we are to fight climate change, Journal, 17 April). They produce more CO2 per metre squared in construction and operation for every higher floor they support. Their huge energy demand spikes at the hottest/coldest times of day/year, driving grids to the brink of collapse. In future extreme heatwaves, like that of 2003, they can cause power outages across whole regions and resulting citizen deaths. They increase pedestrian discomfort, even killing people with the superwinds created around their structures. When they burn catastrophically, people above the fire may not survive. They reflect heat on to adjacent buildings, driving up their energy consumption and discomfort in those opposite. They shade whole urban areas from winter sun and the ability to generate solar energy in their shadow. They can destroy the mental peace of neighbourhoods by their overbearing dominance of the skyline, like the Walkie Talkie in London. Who will pay to demolish them when they catastrophically fail, like Grenfell Tower did? Yet planners ignore such risks and fall over themselves to give permission for the next one. Norman Foster’s Tulip is the latest unnecessary London ego trip. The Tulip is indeed a huge (light) bulb heating up the sky and driving climate change. Bankers must take the responsible step of de-risking cities by never again financing these structures that should now be seen as gigantic climate risks.Susan RoafOxford In a week when Brexit for once did not lead the headlines, it is the world’s most critical problem that has come back to the fore – the dire concerns over climate change. Mark Carney’s warning to financial regulators, banks and insurers around the world to “raise the bar” can’t come soon enough. The Extinction Rebellion movement has very much focused attention this week on climate change, and whatever their methods, it is really important we focus public policy on this massive threat to our long-term wellbeing. Councils are fully aware of their important responsibility in this as local leaders, and the raft of climate emergency resolutions, coupled with developing programmes of radical action, is our contribution to dealing with this existential threat. It is about time the financiers picked up the baton, as the major societal change required to come anywhere close to dealing with this challenge needs both lots of money and the transformation of economies to work. So I encourage this sector to work more effectively with government at all levels and stop investing in high-carbon fossil fuels, but also in nuclear power, which is just too slow to realise and too expensive to deal with the urgency of the climate crisis. Billions, if not trillions, needs to be invested now in low-carbon energy, storage, efficiency, transport and heating solutions. Politicians can only do so much. Extinction Rebellion is right in that we should have been taking much more urgent action over the past 40 years, and as policymakers we should accept that common failure. Now is the time for rapid change so that all our grandchildren and future generations can have a real chance of a decent life. To the financial sector, I urge them to get on with supporting us in that endeavour.Councillor David BlackburnChair of UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities steering committee The article by Clive Lewis MP was excellent (Labour’s message to UK’s young climate strikers, theguardian.com, 12 April). But Labour’s ambition for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century is not fast enough. We will be committed to at least 2C warming by then due to CO2’s long lifecycle. The scientists who publish the IPCC report have been clear – we have 12 years to transform our power infrastructure. That transformation will cost $45tn according to the International Energy Agency. Your article on Mark Carney’s warning to the financial sector cites a figure of $20tn for assets at risk due to climate change. There are only three choices regarding who will pay these gigantic bills: governments, consumers or shareholders. Only the government has the balance sheet, the borrowing capacity and the timeframe to mothball fossil fuel-driven power plants and build new renewable energy assets. As Gordon Brown taught the world in the 2008 financial meltdown, if you want to move fast, nationalise. The only practical way to turbocharge the energy transition is to nationalise the power sector, allowing existing shareholders an exit or opportunity to swap their shares into a renewable sector de-risked by government involvement. In simple terms, a government exists to do what citizens cannot do for themselves. The ability to mobilise resources in the face of an external threat led the UK to its “finest hour”, as Churchill observed. The first paper connecting CO2 and the greenhouse effect came out in the 1970s. Nearly 50 years later the nations of the world have failed to rein in the pollutants responsible for global warming. The next generation are demanding a response to the climate crisis and those with the experience to legislate, to finance and to procure must advance bold measures such as nationalisation to deliver a better future.John CurtisDirector, Ventnor Botanic Garden Regarding Andre Spicer’s article about Extinction Rebellion (The Extinction Rebels have got their tactics badly wrong. Here’s why, theguardian.com, 19 April), semantics are important on the left/right political axis, but what’s more important is the plurality of messaging. Extinction Rebellion cannot be all things to all people. In the wake of the current protests and David Attenborough’s Climate Change – The Facts programme, it’s now the job of other voices across the political and cultural spectrum to sound the clarion of change in language their respective demographics will understand. Extinction Rebellion and Attenborough’s team have opened the door to making that possible. Those of us in the media, the arts and beyond have a duty to get on with it.Blake WellstedLondon Sajid Javid referred to protesters “disrupting the lives of others” (Report, 19 April). Presumably far better to leave it until their lives are disrupted by rising sea levels, ferocious storms, flood, drought, crop failure, starvation, mass migration and extinction of much of the life of the biosphere. Any politician with the intelligence, or care for humanity, to see beyond the next election would be in Westminster right now urgently working out how to save the world from approaching catastrophe – but maybe that’s somewhere on the list, after the next-but-one Brexit extension.Hilary LangFrome, Somerset • Thank you for the ideas to mitigate climate change (Team green: firms and nations with a conscience, 19 April). We are just now setting up Whaley Bridge as a Transition Town, and the article has given us ideas for our projects around attitude change, and action.Lorrie Marchington and Ann SheehyWhaley Bridge, Derbyshire • Just been watching footage of the Extinction Rebellion demo in London. In the words of Jon Snow, “I’ve never seen so many white people in one place.” Could it be that the organisation is institutionally racist?Andy BrownDerby • Has anyone totted up the extra pollution on London streets emanating from traffic jams caused by Extinction Rebellion protests?Colin BakerLondon • I assume that Extinction Rebellion members all have a green energy supplier, like some of the rest of us.Jean CorstonLabour, House of Lords"

Share this...FacebookTwitterBlogging never ceases to amaze me. I started this blog simply as a daily journal of thoughts, which others could read if they cared to. Just for fun. So I am a bit surprised, and of course delighted, when a syndicated columnist like Cal Thomas at the Washington Examiner makes use of my stuff.
I was just checking out Marc Morano’s  Climate Depot and happened to run across Cal’s piece there.
Cal Thomas, an evil conservative, quotes (using my exact words in bold, but I don’t have anything against that):

The German online news magazine Focus recently carried a story, “Warm Times Will Soon Be Over!” Commenting on the “new NASA high temperature record,” which may be set, the magazine blames it on El Nino.
Meteorologists, like Joe D’Aleo of the Weather Channel, are publicly distancing themselves from the false doctrine of global warming. D’Aleo says, “We’ll have La Nina conditions before the summer is over, and it will intensify further through the fall and winter. Thus we’ll have cooler temperatures for the next couple of years.”
These are the exact words, which I translated from the original German, I used in my post here.
My 6th grade English teacher, Mrs. Emma Brown at the Barton Academy, would be proud, I think. The best I could do in her class was a C+.
Just yesterday I wrote that I’d continue to focus on writing about stories that readers might otherwise not hear about. Well, I think it’s safe to say that at least some of us now have heard about the FOCUS story.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online FOCUS news magazine has a short article on the results of a climate survey conducted by the ISOE – Institute for Social-Ecological Research of people in the German financial capital of Frankfurt.
The institute surveyed 1000 people on climate and facets of their day-to-day lifestyles like mobility and eating. Although 90% said the climate issue is important – the concern pretty much stops there. FOCUS gives the results:
Only one in five persons behave in an exemplary manner when it comes to climate protection. Another 40% have a lifestyle that is at least in parts climate friendly. Every third person held the opinion that the risks of climate have been portrayed as exaggerated.”
That “one third” is certainly a a figure that is much higher than say 5 years ago.
Another way of looking at it: 73% of the people surveyed in Frankfurt aren’t really up to changing their lives that much to protect the climate. That means they’ll accept minor policy changes, but nothing major that would disrupt their comfortable lives. It also suggests that all the hyping and exaggerating hurt the cause more than it helped.
The overall tone that I gather from the FOCUS piece is one of disappointment over the fact more people aren’t willing to do more. In the press release, project leader Immanuel Stieß said that “there’s still plenty of room for more climate protection commitment.”

"Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist, has given her support for a general strike for the climate, saying the student movement she inspired needs more support from older generations to ensure politicians keep their promises under the Paris agreement. Speaking at a public event in London as Extinction Rebellion protests continued in the capital, the initiator of the school strike for climate movement was typically frank about the scale of the problem the world faces and the impact her campaign has made. “People are slowly becoming more aware, but emissions continue to rise. We can’t focus on small things. Basically, nothing has changed,” she said. At several points, she stressed the need for the protests to spread. “This is not just young people being sick of politicians. It’s an existential crisis,” Thunberg said. “It is something that will affect the future of our civilisation. It’s not just a movement. It’s a crisis and we must take action accordingly.” In a question and answer session, Franny Armstrong, the director of the climate documentary The Age of Stupid, asked whether it was time for a general strike. “Yes,” replied Thunberg in unison with the other members of the panel. Traditional unions have so far been wary of joining the strikes. Although workers’ federations in Italy made Thunberg an honorary member, most others have given either tepid support or none due to concerns about the possible impact on jobs. But there is growing support in the UK, the US and other countries for a Green New Deal that would increase spending on renewable energy. The talk took place on Earth Day, after a week of protests by Extinction Rebellion activists pushed the climate crisis on to news broadcasts and newspaper front pages. Police have arrested more than 1,000 demonstrators at Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge, but hundreds remain camped in Marble Arch, where Thunberg spoke on Sunday. “I support Extinction Rebellion. What they are doing is good. Civil disobedience is important to show this is an emergency. We need to do everything we can to put pressure on the people in power,” she told the audience on Monday, prompting cheers and applause. “Why study for a future that is being taken from us? Why study for facts when facts don’t matter in this society? It’s empowering to know I am doing something, I am taking a stand, I am disrupting.” The interest in the event was so intense that a long line of supporters stretched along Euston Road waiting for the doors to open at Friends House. Most guests appeared to be fellow school strikers. A handful wore shirts or headbands printed with the Extinction Rebellion symbol. But the audience included all age groups, and just about every major environment organisation associated itself with the talk, which was hosted by the Quakers and co-organised by Guardian Events. When Thunberg appeared on stage, she was greeted with thunderous applause. Armstrong said: “I’ve been to dozens of talks here over the years, but I’ve never seen anything like this. It’s the first time I have seen a standing ovation even before the event starts. She’s a rock star.” In the past week, Thunberg has met Pope Francis in the Vatican and addressed members of the European parliament. On Tuesday, she will visit the Houses of Parliament, meet the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, and take part in an event with the leaders of all the main parties except Theresa May. She told the audience she had been taken by surprise at the swift spread of a movement that began less than a year ago, when she went on strike alone outside the Swedish parliament. “It is hard to understand what is happening during the last months. It has all happened so fast. I don’t have time to think it through,” she said. Veteran observers of the British parliament said she has helped push the climate issue higher up the UK political agenda than at any time since the 2008 Climate Change Act. Green party officials said they hoped the meeting on Tuesday could spur a new phase of cross-party collaboration on climate change, including monthly meetings, wider public consultations and an agreement that party manifestos should be vetted by an independent body such as the Committee on Climate Change to assess whether they are in line with the Paris agreement. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said the current wave of climate action on the streets and the school strikes gave her hope. “There is more political leadership there and here than I have seen in Westminster. It feels like a turning point in the history of how we defend our planet,” she said. “Young people are calling out against a system that is sadly broken … We are going to change the definition of what is politically possible so that it is what is scientifically necessary.” The discussion ranged from veganism and avoiding flying to political change throughout society. Thunberg said everything was necessary, though she put the focus on challenging the companies and governments that are responsible for the bulk of emissions. How to deal with with people in power was a frequent subject of questions to the panel. Thunberg said her autism helped her filter out much of the greenwashing. “We are more likely to see through lies. We don’t follow the stream. You can’t be a little bit sustainable – either you are sustainable or you are not,” she said. There were occasional moments of levity. At one point, Thunberg was asked how she dealt with climate deniers. “I don’t,” she replied. Thunberg’s earlier point was reiterated by Anna Taylor from the UK Student Climate Network. “We are not going to be satisfied by politicians saying ‘we support you’ and then walking away,” she said. “We won’t be satisfied until they meet our demands and act. That’s why simply taking a selfie or posting support on Twitter isn’t enough. That’s why we have to keep striking.” For all the talk of politics and protest, however, some of the most poignant and pertinent questions came from the youngest children. One asked: “If pollution continues, how much time have we got left?” Another wanted to know: “Can we achieve our goal in the time we have?” Thunberg, in response, was reassuring but measured: “Of course we can, it’s physically possible, the scientists say. It’s up to us. If we do this now then of course we will. But if we don’t, we might not do it. But yes, definitely we can.”"

Climate activists fret that there are too many cars in Russia. Photo: Taiga Forest, Siberia; author: sashapo, Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.
The online Klimaretter (Climate Rescuers) here has a piece by Angelina Davydova on Russia’s rapidly expanding automobile culture and CO2 emissions.
After the Soviet Union imploded along with its Communist mismanaged, dilapidated industry in 1990, Russia’s CO2 emissions plummeted 29%. Throughout the nineties Russia suffered from economic malaise. Finally, during the 2000s, things began to turn around and today more and more Russians are getting to know for the first what prosperity is.
Davydova writes, citing a recent study released by the Russian Industry and Commerce Associations and the Brussels-based Climate Change Global Services (CCGS), that Russians are driving more automobiles than ever before, and that CO2 emissions have increased 4.5% in both 2010 and 2011. More and more Russians are buying their own car. In the last ten years the number of cars has risen 83 percent.
These statistics cannot be interpreted as anything else but as signs of real progress in prosperity and improving life for Russians. Although there is still a ways to go, most people view this as welcome news. Yet, for those who hate prosperity, it’s abhorring news. So it is for the granola eaters at Klimaretter.
Klimaretter frets that too many Russians are driving cars nowadays. Davydova writes:
Greenhouse gas emissions from the Russian transportation sector increased 150% from 2001 to 2011. There’s no end in sight for this trend. Just last year alone from 2010 to 2011 CO2 emissions in this sector increased by more than a third. In 2011 there were 36.5 million private automobiles registered in Russia. Therefore, however, automobile ownership is still below that of Germany where approx. 43 million cars are on the road. Statistically, while in Germany every second person has a car, in Russia every fourth person has one.”

Imagine that. Per capita Russians have the gall of driving half the number of cars that Germans do: Thirty six million cars in a country that is almost 50 times the size of Germany! And what’s worse and even more disturbing? Klimaretter writes:
Also the average CO2 emissions per vehicle is higher than in the previous years.”
Mend your ways or “feel the consequences of climate change”
The folks at the alarmist blogsite aren’t happy about the development taking place in Russia. At the end of her article Davydova warns of serious climatic consequences should Russians fail to mend their evil ways:
Russia would be wise to be more active in climate protection efforts. The country is going to seriously feel the consequences of climate change: According to a study by the Moscow University for Economics, the climate-related damages could be 150 – 500 million euros annually in just a few years.”
How these people can be taken seriously truly boggles even a half-witted mind. Climate kooks believe every climate catastrophe scenario that gets released, no matter how absurd it may be. Klimaretter continues:
Also in agriculture the consequences are clearly visible: Between 2010 and 2012 harvests in Russia have dropped by one quarter to one third due to droughts.”
And all because Russians are now driving half as many cars Germans in a country that is almost 50 times the size?
I bet Russian car drivers really get scared when someone tells them about all the serious climate “consequences” that supposedly result from sparse car-driving in a vast country. I’m sure they’re going to ditch their cars and all run back to the horse-and-buggy days – a time when Russian climate was balmy and fruitful.
PS: Car density in Germany is about 120 vehicles per sq km while in Russia it’s barely over 2.

"An ambitious experiment deep in the Amazon rainforest aims to find out how the ecosystem is likely to respond to rising levels of carbon dioxide. In 2000 a research team at the UK’s Hadley Centre forecast that a combination of reduced rainfall and higher temperatures caused by global warming could decimate the Amazon by the end of the century. But the following decade another Hadley Centre team concluded that this scenario was unlikely. The contrary verdict was based largely on the researchers’ belief that extra carbon dioxide in the air would protect trees against the increasingly harsh conditions. The revised prediction did not reassure David Lapola, a Brazilian biologist who is running the new experiment. “Who knows,” he said. “Hypotheses are all we have now.” Lapola said nobody had tested the impact of increased carbon dioxide on trees in the Amazon. That is what he and an international team of scientists at a site 35 miles north of Manaus now intend to do. As Lapola spoke, a pair of construction workers in heavy boots paraded by carrying a large, flat, octagonal aluminium frame. Nearby, several more workers were putting the finishing touches to an open-topped greenhouse made of flexible window panels and more aluminium.  The structure was being put up around several spindly saplings, taking care to avoid trampling the soil. When all of Lapola’s chambers have been installed – eight altogether, scattered around an area of jungle twice the size of a football field – computer-controlled nozzles will spray carbon dioxide into four of them, boosting the concentration inside their walls to 50% higher than outside. The other four chambers will be controls and receive no extra CO2. Unless the growth in CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels around the world slows down, these raised levels of CO2 in the air will be normal by about 2050. Scientists have previously exposed saplings and full-grown trees from temperate forests, such as sweet gum and pine trees, to extra CO2. One experiment in the 1990s tested the effect of extra CO2 on the understory trees of a Panama jungle. The conclusion so far from scores of such experiments on how dozens of species in various places fare in CO2-enhanced air is: it depends. Since carbon extracted from carbon dioxide is the essential building block of plants, it makes sense that more CO2 in the air should help plants grow better. But sometimes other factors such as lack of critical nutrients prevent plants from taking advantage of extra CO2. Scientists do not yet know enough about how such limiting factors work to predict how a diverse natural forest such as the Amazon will behave in the air of the future. The question matters not just because the fate of this jungle’s assorted flora and fauna could be at stake. The Amazon stores a vast amount of CO2 in its tree trunks which, if the forest declines, will be released into the air, accelerating global warming. That would cause damage all around the world. Lapola’s chamber research will be the first time Amazon trees are tested with extra CO2 in otherwise almost-natural conditions. After it’s done, the scientists want to build a larger experiment that bathes a plot as big as a baseball diamond in CO2-enhanced air all the way from the ground to the lofty treetops. This could reveal whether mature trees behave differently to young ones. The chambers are expected to be ready in late April, at which point the experiment will begin. “I’ll probably be here,” said Lapola, a professor at the University of Campinas in São Paulo, who estimated he has visited the site 50 times already. “It’s hard to stay away.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s an interesting story brought to my attention by Readers Edition: http://www.readers-edition.de/2010/04/30/mein-klimagerechtes-leben/. German ZDF television, Germany’s version of the Beeb, shows its viewers how to live if you want to reach Salvation. It’s in German but you can read this post and then easily follow the clip.
Bathing Belgian in rainwater
The ZDF clip starts with a Belgian man using a fitness bike to power his laptop. He buys only second-hand clothes, bathes in rainwater – fish and meat of course are taboo. He cooks using only low energy methods; that is he removes the pot from the stove as soon as it starts to boil and places it inside an insulated box which he covers with his second-hand rags. The trapped heat does the rest. In all he cut his energy consumption by 70%. Not only does he save a lot of CO2, he also saves a lot of money – so much in fact that he has been able to buy a new shiny piano!  (Just don’t ask how the piano is manufactured or shipped).
This is the way we wash our clothes, wash our clothes…  The one-year no-consumption experiment in New York City
Scene change over to New York, the capital of consumption, epicentre of trash production. Meet Colin Beavan, whose website http://noimpactman.typepad.com/ tells you how you too can be an “extraordinary person”. He conducted an experiment: one year without consumption. See how he and his family do not take the elevator, preferring to climb 22 flights of stairs. They neither use a car nor the subway, preferring to risk their daughter’s life on bikes. They do not produce any trash. They have their own compost in their appartment (Wow! imagine if we all had composts in our homes). And take a look at their leg-powered washing machine.
Beavan says: We have to consume way way less

So why does Colin put him and his family through all the trouble? He says he wants to find out what’s possible. How much can we refrain from in modern living? Beavan wants radical change. He says it’s not about changing your consumption habits, it’s about consuming “way way less”. The first step in the one-year no-consumption project was to throw out all those energy guzzling applicance and all the chemical products, and to impose an absolute halt on shopping. That’s right – no shopping for one year.
Beavan the ecostar
His wife Michelle is an editor for Businessweek and admits she was a typical consumer (er, sinner), who just couldn’t live without the modern vice called consumerism. But it’s Beavan’s project and the family decided to go along cold turkey. They kicked off the project by throwing a “lights-out” party and using candles for illumination. Beavan, the no-impact man, has since become an eco-star. His message: “Everybody can and must do something”.  My question is: Why “must”?
No toilet paper
Colin’s family did not even use an air conditioner during New York’s hot sticky summer and no refrigerator. They didn’t even use toilet paper – it’s waste of resources!  Some of Michelle’s BusinessWeek colleagues refused to shake her hand. Hot water? Didn’t mention it. Beavan did have second thoughts during the one-year ordeal. Yet he looked at the bright side, like better nutrition and more time with the family. Many habits have remained since the one-year experiment ended. For example he now uses canning jars as glasses. Ironically he says pessimism is the obstacle to change. That’s funny, aren’t the tree-huggers the ones always telling us a Climate Armegeddon is coming? How does one develop his brand of optimism?
Buy Beavan’s DVD, today!
By the way you can purchase Beavan’s story on a plastic DVD.  http://www.noimpactdoc.com/index_m.php.  Just don’t ask how the DVDs are recorded, manufactured, shipped, played or disposed of.  In fact, don’t bloody ask how German ZDF produced and aired it’s stupid report on Beavan, Ms BusinessWeek and Mr Secondhand Rags.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe French website Contrepoints (Counterpoints) has an excellent general summary on how the Turney Expedition course of events unfolded in an article titled: Akademik Shokalskiy: the time to ask questions. Turney really does appear to be in a lot of hot water.
Contrepoints introduction starts:
Persuaded to have nothing to worry about from ice in the Antarctic, an expedition of climatologists wound up getting caught in 5 meters of sea ice. The Akademik Shokalskiy passengers are safe and sound, now come to the questions.”
Vessel was low budget, inadequate
Contrepoints starts by questioning the adequacy of the vessel chosen for the expedition, citing the harshness of the environment that would be entered. It is turning out that Commonwealth Bay is indeed notorious for ice blockage and that cruise companies generally avoid the area. The list of sunken shipwrecks littering the ocean floor is growing. Contrepoints presents examples that include the Explorer in 2007 and Brazilian ship Endless Sea in 2012:
Also, it seems the decision to charter a vessel of the type that is the Akademik Shokalskiy can be explained in large part by budgetary reasons, but also by the certainty of the organizers that there would be nothing to worry about from icebergs because of climate warming.”
Far more sea ice “than expected”
Contrepoints then informs its readers that in fact it has gotten colder in the Antarctic over the past years and presents a sea ice chart which shows near record high sea ice extents. This all raises questions on what the expedition organizers were thinking back in November, before starting the jouney, a time when sea ice charts were showing 1 million sq km more ice than normal, Contrepoints reminds us.
Tourism disguised as science
Contrepoints then questions the wisdom of bringing on tourists and family members onto the expedition.
Under these conditions, and based on the synopsis of the expedition, as well as the accounts of a more than festive ambiance on board, one is entitled to wonder about the real scientific character of this adventure.”
“An obvious amateurism…obstinacy and naivety”
When comparing Turney’s expedition to other scientific expeditions, like those of Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute with its Polarstern ice-breaker, the qualitive differences are nothing short of glaring. Contrepoints writes that Turney’s expedition, when you boil it down, was “an obvious amateurism“. The French site writes that the answer to the questionas to why the ship got caught in ice “lies probably not in an error by the captain but in the obstinacy and naivety of expedition leader Chris Turney.”

Knew well in advance a storm was approaching
Contrepoints, citing the blog of onboard tourist and Australian Green politician Janet Rice, describes how passengers bungled about with an Argo craft, causing an hours-long delay in the departure of the boat as a storm rolled in. The storm it turns out, was not something unpredictable, but had actually been forecast already on December 22. Rice writes in the first sentence of her blog on December 22:
There’s a blizzard on the way apparently!”
Even more damning, Contrepoints writes:
While Mawson found the bay completely free of ice 100 years earlier, his successor Chris Turney found himself nose to nose with an immense floe of ice that covered the bay and forced his ship to stop close to 70 km from where Mawson had set foot on land. This was already on 19/20 Decembre according to the entries made by Turney at his blog.”
Fault of amateurism
Contrepoints concludes the description of the debacle with:
Finally, what had to happen happened and the next day on December 24: The ice finally trapped the Akademik Shokalskiy. In short, contrary to what Turney claims, the misadventure experienced by his team is more the fault of amateurism than of having no luck.”
Contrepoints then concludes the piece by describing how the Turney’s botched expedition is now adversely impacting the other scientific operations taking place in Antarctica, as logistics are now seriously in disarray.
After publishing my blog article Expedition on the cheap here some five days ago, one global warming activist reader reacted with a knee-jerk claiming I didn’t know what I was talking about. Today we now see stories appearing every day, confirming precisely what I brought up. Goes to show who really doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
Who approved the expedition in the first place? 
There are other important questions, as not all the blame can be put on Turney or the vessel’s captain. This was a huge expedition, and so various authorizations, approvals and permits had to have been necessary. Who signed them? Who was too incompetent to see that it wasn’t up to standard and that Turney was an amateur?

"This afternoon an international sensation is taking to the stage in central London. She’s young, admired around the world and her name is Greta Thunberg. She’s a 16-year-old climate hero and I couldn’t be more proud to be co-hosting her visit. Greta’s rise to fame has been vertiginous. Last year she skipped school and sat in front of the Swedish parliament in protest against inaction on climate change – and now she is one of the figureheads of a school climate strike movement that has swept the globe, which more than a million young people taking to the streets last month to demand that world leaders step up to this monumental challenge. The success of the strike is not incidental. Every red light is flashing on the Earth’s dashboard. The 20 warmest years on record all happened in the last 22 years. Nature and wildlife populations are at crisis levels across the world. Wildfires and droughts are becoming increasingly common – with people in the global south already dying from the effects of climate change which were mostly caused by countries in the north. Here in the UK, communities are under serious threat from flooding, sea level rises, extreme heat and more. Of course Greta had to act. And of course thousands followed her. In the UK, Extinction Rebellion is also making waves. By putting their bodies on the line in protest against climate change, its members aren’t just creating headlines, they are showing moral courage at a time when too many politicians are taking us backwards. Greta arrives today in a country that talks the talk on climate, but simply won’t walk the walk. Not only are the government cheerleaders for dirty fossil fuels like fracking, but they’ve cut support for renewables like wind and solar. When we look back at this moment in a generation’s time, the real criminals won’t be seen as those blockading bridges – it will be those who understood the science of climate change, yet consistently blocked action to prevent its worst effects. Yet despite government intransigence, there are real grounds for hope. We have the means to start to tackle this crisis – from renewable energy to clean and sustainable public transport. It is cheap and it is here; we just need to the political will to scale it up and roll it out, the first steps towards utterly transforming the global economy. And we need to take every step together, in a new, genuinely inclusive politics. There is hope in a generation of people who are demanding from their leaders not just what seems politically possible but what is scientifically necessary to prevent total climate breakdown. That generation builds on longstanding struggles, particularly from environmental defenders who have risked – and given – their lives defending their land, water and rights against the power of fossil fuel firms who have stopped at nothing in their pursuit of the bottom line. So when Greta takes to the stage today, she will see in front of her hundreds of people of her age who aren’t afraid to take a stand, and she will stand on the shoulders of the many environmental defenders who have stood before her. Make no mistake, the climate movement has broken into the mainstream – and it is here to stay. Our task now is to meet every promise by a politician with a demand to go further, to scale up our ambition as those at the top seek to appease us with warm words and rousing rhetoric. We must be deadly serious about getting the work done to avoid the worst of this climate catastrophe. If we don’t rise to this task,and don’t rise to it now, then we condemn Greta’s generation, and generations to follow, to a future framed by wildfire and drought – it’s as simple as that. • Caroline Lucas is MP for Brighton Pavilion"

Share this...FacebookTwitter“It was just a photo of Antarctica that we happened to have around and we were in a hurry.” This is surely the kind of answer you would get if you asked the climate propaganda-meisters at the AP and The Weather Channel about their choice of photo for their latest story.
Hat-tip: Reader ES.

They’ll insist that the photo used to illustrate the story of record cold in the Antarctic was just something random they had given little thought about and that they were in a hurry. What a joke…these guys and gals think they are soooooo clever. Boy, they sure almost fooled us.
Anyone with just an inkling of experience in journalism knows that words and picture are carefully chosen to effectively communicate a message. So you have to wonder why Borenstein or The Weather Channel used a photo of melting ice to illustrate the headline story of Antarctica setting a record cold temperature of -135.8°F. Hey, why not use a parched-land photo to illustrate the next flood story…or overweight people to depict starvation in Africa!
The answer is clear. Science journalist Seth Borenstein and the Weather Channel are infamous for their alarmist positions on global warming and have long been known for their glaring bias when reporting on the issue. It was hard enough for them to have to print words on the record cold temperatures, and so by golly they weren’t about to depict it with a photo. That would be asking too much. No, better to use the “1000 words” to stealthfully tell the other story – the one that contradicts Antarctic reality…and make damn sure that picture gets placed right smack at the top of the story, immediately after the headline, where no one can miss it.
With a little luck, the melting ice photo will be just enough to distract readers from what’s really going on.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen it comes to the climate debate, everyone knows that it really all boils down to how much is man’s impact. It has nothing to do with whether climate is changing or not. It always has.
The core question is how accurate are the climate models and are they really accurate enough to use for policymaking?
Skeptics have long argued that the models use a climate sensitivity for a doubling of Co2 that is much too high…even preposterously high. The alarmists, on the other hand, insist that it isn’t, and that the models are pretty much on target. Now that climate models have been making predictions for well over 15 years, we now have enough data to make a preliminary call.
If the models are right, then the observed temperature should be following the trend predicted of the ensemble of models. But if the two trends are diverging, then the models are inaccurate and should be revamped. C3 Headlines here has posted a chart comparing observed (blue) to model trend (red):

 Chart comparing model projections to observed temperature. The last few months have shown a record divergence. Chart: C3 Headlines.
As the above chart shows, the divergence between modeled temperature and observed is setting new records with every passing month. The divergence for the 36-month moving average is now at about 0.35°C, already an embarrassment for the climate modellers.

Even more stunning, the rate of divergence using the second order fitted trends shows that the models are performing even far worse than we thought. Rather than depicting a steady divergence, the curves show that the divergence is actually accelerating!
The following shows what the divergence will look like in about 10 years time should the current observed trend continue, i.e. a slight warming:

Extrapolating about 10 years out. By 2025, the divergence will be 0.6°C (and even more if the earth cools, which many scientists are projecting).
What does this all mean? Should the trend continue over the next decade or so, the error will be greater with each passing year, and it won’t be long before it’s glaring. Even the trickiest graphic layouts and chart manipulations soon will not be able to hide the gaping difference.
So even if the current decade manages to be a little warmer than the last, the model error will still be sticking out more than ever.
Time is truly on the side of the skeptics. For the alarmists, it is running out – fast!

"Day four of Extinction Rebellion, which has been a phenomenal success, as climate protesters occupy four pressure points in Britain’s congested capital. Everything has conspired to maximise attention for their climate cause, with the news unnaturally quiet in this pause in Brexit hostilities.  Compared to Brexit rage and fury, climate protesters are the soul of peace and goodwill, their pink boat welcoming Oxford Street shoppers, who mainly stop to talk. The surprisingly few police are friendly, with the 400 arrests curiously voluntary, people well-warned in advance so those who can’t be arrested step back. Is it true the police cuts have left too little capacity to arrest everyone? Two officers laugh: “You might say that, we couldn’t possibly comment”. The sun shines on them as Waterloo Bridge is magically transformed into the Boris Johnson £53m garden bridge that never was, with a long line of trees in big pots down the middle and rows of flowers. The calm of the carless river crossing is a good advertisement for how cities might be. “Come and join us, take time off work,” Gail Bradbrook, one of the organisers, exhorted Today programme listeners this morning. She’s right. All who can should be there. Those in tree-hugging outfits and carnival costumes may attract the cameras – but gathered here are all ages and occupations. The school strikes, started by the remarkable Greta Thunberg, caught the imagination around the world, just as this protest is echoed in 80 cities, from India to the US. Challenged by Nick Robinson for the nuisance caused, Bradbrook said “It gets you on the Today programme” – and that’s the blunt truth. By another stroke of protesters’ luck, tonight David Attenborough delivers his most devastating warning yet in BBC One’s Climate Change: The Facts. In the past the BBC has been criticised for avoiding climate controversy in its phenomenally successful, world bestselling Attenborough nature franchise. No longer. Possibly spurred on by Netflix poaching Attenborough for its more polemical series, the gloves are off. “If we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies,” he says. The 92-year-old naturalist speaks with resounding authority, as scientists lay out the undeniable evidence of what 1C extra heat has done already, and what risks becoming unstoppable. Among horrifying footage of wildfires, ice cliffs crumbling into the sea and permafrost melting to release methane many times more damaging than CO2, come eye-watering particulars: one foot of Louisiana is being lost every 45 minutes to rising sea levels. “It’s hard to exaggerate the peril we are in,” he says. But as ever, how do we turn the Attenborough evidence and public protest into politics? We have been here before in 2006 when Gordon Brown brought over Al Gore to show his equally devastating film, An Inconvenient Truth. I thought then this might be a political tipping point. At least now the UK climate deniers are trounced: the BBC rightly refuses them airtime. But guiltily, I am well aware that every day we obsess in the media about other things is another day lost to the monumental, all-consuming threat to the planet and humanity. Greta Thunberg tells us to stop “talking about taxes or Brexit” and focus on the survival of life on earth. It’s almost too big to think about. Or there is nothing new to say. The left/right divide has been a disaster: even if the respectable right no longer seriously denies climate change, it balks at solutions that look collectivist and socialist. Indeed, the need to take climate action, the need for state investment in a green new deal, gives new impetus to socialist thinking – an all-too-convenient excuse, the right suspects. Inequality blocks every remedy: how do you make everyone cut down on fossil fuels without helping the poor in cold homes and old cars, and giving aid to poorer countries in order to redistribute the pain? If the US, China, India or anywhere else isn’t doing enough, why should we? Reasons why politicians do too little are legion. As Larry Elliot writes today, it helps that Mark Carney of the Bank of England is warning of catastrophic financial consequences. Will he follow that through in everything the bank does? Extinction Rebellion wants net zero carbon emissions by 2025: existing targets are being badly missed. Protesters point to fracking, new coal mines, new incinerators and a Heathrow extension as perverse government polices. The government’s effective ban on land-based wind power just as it became profitable, to appease shire voters, was shocking. So was the sudden withdrawal of solar subsidies and the feed-in tariff, just as that industry was taking off, causing an immediate loss of 12,000 solar jobs. The government has asked the independent Committee on Climate Change to review its targets, results to be published shortly. What’s needed is a translation of fear into acceptable politics: the protesters are wise to demand a citizens’ assembly to examine all the evidence and gain public consent for what needs to be done outside the left-right battle-lines of conventional politics. The government should seize on that. Let’s hope the protest ends as elegantly as it has been conducted. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"
