"There was less ice in the Arctic this winter than in any other winter during the satellite era, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists said on Tuesday. The announcement was consistent with previous predictions that the Arctic would have entirely ice-free summers by 2040, they said in a briefing to the media on the state of climate trends in the north pole.  The consequences of such a small quantity of Arctic ice are major and far-reaching. After undergoing a period of colder temperatures and slower ice retreat between 2007 and 2012, the Arctic is returning to a warm period with the overall trend over the decades continuing to show temperatures getting hotter and ice melting faster. This year, full ice coverage – the point at which the ice reaches its peak and then starts melting – was reached on 25 February, more than two weeks before the expected date of mid-March, said Jeff Key at NOAA’s Satellite and Information Service’s center for satellite applications and research. This means ice started to melt earlier and faster than in previous years. Ed Farley, a scientist with NOAA’s Alaska fisheries science center, said that studies over the last 15 years showed that ice melting faster year-on-year led to a drastic loss in the fat contained in zooplankton – a fish food crucial for the entire area’s ecosystem. “We all know that we are what we eat,” Farley said, echoing lines more commonly heard on reality television show The Biggest Loser. But his words were not aimed at educating teenagers on the virtues of broccoli and blueberries, or at educating adults in getting into shape beyond the treadmill. In the Arctic, fat content – the higher the better – contained in zooplankton has serious, knock-on effects that determine living creatures’ ability to make it through the winter. Zooplankton feeds the area’s fish, which in turn feed the area’s seals, which in turn feed the area’s polar bears. Eating high-fat foods is crucial forthose species to allow them to fatten up and survive harsh winter months. Changing temperatures in the sea may also severely affect access to high-fat foods in the Arctic’s ecosystem, Farley said. The Arctic cod, which outweighs its Arctic fish brother the Saffron cod in fat content by 2.7 times, thrives in a sea that is 7C, gets smaller past such a temperature, and risks not surviving at all beyond 10C. With sea temperatures set to be between 10 and 13C by the end of this century, the Arctic cod might not make it – at all. And while the saffron cod, which likes warmer seas, would survive this temperature change, seals would have to eat saffron cod at 2.7 times the rate they eat the Arctic cod to get the same amount of fat for the winter – a tough challenge, to say the least. Changes in ice levels and temperature will probably have other, broader effects too. For many businesses, a changing Arctic is good news, not bad. New shipping routes will be created, with routes able to run undisrupted through the summer by the time post-2040 predicted ice-free summers hit, said Jeff Key at NOAA’s Satellite and Information Service’s center for satellite applications and research. Two such routes have already been created. No ice also means oil and gas exploration teams will have a much easier time, both in terms of access and period spent exploring, Farley said. But for people – as well as animals – on the ground, the potential effects are troubling. The effect of ships moving through the northern area of the globe at a much greater rate will be undoubtedly disruptive for sea life. There is currently no infrastructure in place to handle accidents along shipping routes, Farley said, including oil spills. For indigenous subsistence harvest communities in Alaska that rely on the availability of seals and whales, that will mean a way of life, and – even more simply – meals on the line. In 2009, the US Department of Commerce approved a plan to ban commercial fishing in the United States Arctic waters to be enforced until more information could be obtained to support sustainable fisheries management. Key stressed the importance of satellite-acquired data watching the Arctic, and the need for international cooperation: “What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic.” Understanding weather patterns in the Arctic means being able to predict weather patterns, including hurricanes, in other parts of the world."
"When did the climate change campaign start for you? I think it was a fairly gradual process. It wasn’t something I connected with when I was younger. Maybe it was some sort of lack of empathy, but I wasn’t able to relate to it. And then round about 16 or 17, I not only started travelling more, getting more of an appreciation for nature, I also simultaneously started learning more about the science around climate change. And the combination of falling in love with nature, with the realisation that there was a genuine threat to the natural world as we know it, kind of worked together. It went from being an issue that I wasn’t really that engaged with at all, to being probably the one I thought was the most important to try and address in some way – and continue to think is the most important.  Why your initial “lack of empathy” on the subject? For me, at least, the human issues were much easier to empathise with. You see a starving kid, or hear about a real tangible pain that an animal is feeling – that was much easier to relate to. Whereas nature is more anonymous. The idea of climate change is a bit more broad and subtle.  I also grew up in London. And growing up in a city I don’t think I respected nature enough. And I don’t think I respected how interdependent we are with nature. I think I took it for granted, that the world would always be providing for us. When I started to question that – that we could really fuck this up, not just for the planet, but for ourselves – I started to take it a lot more seriously. What were the first steps you took? The more obvious, superficial steps. Turning off lights. Taking public transport. Thinking about how often you fly. Those sorts of things. Which are important. But I think over time I became more interested in what I see as the bigger impact business has; and the impact that the systems we’ve created have; and that actually, probably, what vegetables you eat and where they’ve been flown in from might be cumulatively more impactful than where you go on holiday. So over time I geared myself more towards business and the impact that it has on the global climate. Did it lead, later, to uncomfortable professional situations? As a model you must have worked for businesses that contribute to the problem. Yes. Certainly I’ve been in conflict. And definitely complicit in these problems. Not just working in fashion, or modelling, or advertising – but that’s a pretty blatant part of it. But also as a consumer and as somebody who exercises a certain type of lifestyle. I think at both ends of the spectrum I felt complicit and therefore question not only my personal but also my professional life choices. What kind of professional changes? Moving more towards working with businesses that I think are being more conscious in the way they operate. And coming it at the perspective that, you know, if you want to redecorate a room, you’re better off going in and repainting it than throwing paint-bombs from the outside. Nice analogy. So you’d use a modelling gig, for instance, as an opportunity to speak to and try to influence a CEO? I’ve done very little modelling for quite a long time; I’ve kind of moved away from that world. But where I have worked in that space, in probably the last five years, I’ve tried to only work with companies that I think are doing what’s responsible. The Body Shop, for example. I’ve worked with Marks & Spencer on its Plan A … All of these companies you could probably critique, but you could also applaud for the attempt, for the effort, they put in to trying to do business better. I think it would be naive and stupid for me to pretend that things are perfect. But I don’t think that should demoralise anyone in the intention or effort to make things better. One of the reasons you’ve modelled less, in recent years, is that you’ve been founding companies yourself, right? Yes. One looking at the rubber trade in the Amazon, and how we can drive a stronger world rubber trade that incentivises local farmers to protect the rainforest. I have a company called The North Circular, where we get grandmas in the UK to hand-knit goods from local, natural materials. Companies that I’ve been directly involved with, or other people’s companies that I’ve advertised for, have a similar thread of thought through them. Which is: can you talk to consumers and help them understand the impact of the production chain? There’s a version of production that can be really positive and empowering; that can help communities financially, or be environmentally responsible. And I’m a big believer in championing that mode of business. Rather than seeing it as black or white, good or bad, business-is-terrible or not. Is there one aspect of climate change you find most distressing? It’s hard to reduce it like that. Generally speaking, people are so short-sighted. Whether it’s businesses making short-term decisions about profit margins. or politicians wanting to get elected or consumers not thinking about their kids or their grandkids. I would say it’s that short-term and very economically driven thinking that is creating a lot of problems. When you drill down into most environmental problems, economics is usually behind it. That’s probably what bothers me the most. It feels sad. Decisions made for money over more long-term thinking. Ever had an argument with a climate-change denier? I had the pleasure of sitting opposite Nigel Farage at a dinner. I managed to avoid the conversation about immigration with him; I knew we wouldn’t agree. But then he started talking about the climate, and we ended up arguing. It makes me so angry that people in power, or potential power, can very conveniently ignore what most scientists now agree on. Who won, you or Nigel? He ended up leaving. I had a couple of people applaud me. I don’t think I convinced him of my logic, though."
"As the row over the green levies added to energy bills was building towards its climax a couple of years ago – with David Cameron reportedly ordering aides to “get rid of all the green crap” to lower prices – social scientist Nick Pidgeon was touring the UK. From Merthyr Tydfil to Glasgow and from London to Cumbria, Pidgeon’s workshops with members of the public wrestled with solving the triple challenge of keeping the lights on, energy bills affordable and global warming under control. To Pidgeon’s surprise, people attending the workshops overwhelmingly backed a transformation based on renewable energy, energy efficiency and cutting fossil fuel use. “They said why on earth are we not doing this already?” said Pidgeon, a professor of environmental psychology at Cardiff University, who also tested nationwide opinions via polling. “When the complex problems were explained, people had a vision of the future that was clearly more ambitious than any of the political parties. They believed that fossil fuels were old-fashioned and finite and had all these other [pollution and security] problems associated with them. They felt there is no future for their kids if we are stuck with fossil fuels.” The 2013 “green crap” row, which resulted in £50 being knocked off bills, commanded the political spotlight for a while, having been electrified by Ed Miliband’s popular pledge to freeze energy bills. But it was a “phoney war”, according to Matthew Spencer, director of the influential Green Alliance thinktank, as the levies set to be added to future bills to drive the green transformation remain firmly on an upward curve and are expected to more than double to £187 a year by 2020 (though the overall bill may fall if energy efficiency measures bite). “Whoever wins the election, the costs of the low-carbon transition will rise sharply over the parliament and this will need to be carefully managed if that programme is to succeed,” said Jimmy Aldridge, at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank. The impact of the government’s choice will stretch even further than 2020, according to Pidgeon: “Energy is the biggest infrastructure challenge we face. Decisions taken in the next parliament will affect people for the next 50 years.” In Germany’s 2013 general election, those decisions were second only to the eurozone crisis as an issue. In the UK, the environment lags behind the perennial big hitters of the NHS, economy and immigration in issue tracking polls by Ipsos Mori and YouGov. However, it ranks alongside tax, the EU and crime and, although the three main parties have jointly pledged to tackle climate change to protect the UK’s national and economic security, the party manifestos have less in common in 2015 than in 2010. The starkest change has been in the Conservative position. In 2006, the high point of environmental concerns in recent decades, Cameron went to the Arctic and hugged a husky. The “vote blue, go green” message was a key part of the Tory brand decontamination strategy and featured prominently in the 2010 manifesto.  But within 18 months of the election, the green drive was dead, with George Osborne saying: “We’re not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business.” The energy minister, Greg Barker, was forced to argue at the time that the party was acting green, if no longer talking green: “We are all trousers and no mouth.” But by their final party conference, Tory ministers had nothing new to say about the environment or energy at all. The 2015 manifesto has only one significant new energy policy: a ban on new subsidies for onshore wind farms and a veto for local communities. This was immediately dismissed as “bad news for British billpayers” by former “big six” energy boss Ian Marchant, as more expensive green energy would be needed instead to meet the UK’s legal carbon reduction targets. “I suspect [the wind farm policy] is targeted at local constituencies where there is a particular local issue,” said Anthony Wells at YouGov, as the overwhelming majority of the UK public supports wind farms. Tom Burke, a former special adviser to three Tory environment secretaries and head of Friends of the Earth, said of the “ridiculous” anti-wind farm policy: “It may be tactical, but you want your prime minister to be delivering a safe climate for 60 million Britons, not giving a sop to 20 marginal constituencies.” Burke also accused the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, of “abuse of power”, having pulled in and rejected dozens of local wind farm planning applications.  The Lib Dems, while once again placing the environment on their manifesto front page, have undergone a full U-turn on nuclear power. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, who once said that “in addition to posing safety and environmental risks, nuclear power will only be possible with vast taxpayer subsidies or a rigged market”, now backs nuclear as needed to tackle climate change. Pidgeon said this attitude of “reluctant acceptance” prevails among much of the public. The Lib Dems ran energy and climate change policy in the last parliament – though Osborne frequently intervened – and now point to a tripling of renewable energy. But, having started from a very low base, the UK still ranks near the bottom of the 28 EU nations, with only Luxembourg and Malta producing less green energy in the latest statistics. Similarly, millions of homes benefited from energy efficiency improvements in the last parliament, but the UK still has some of the highest energy bills and rates of fuel poverty among comparable EU states. Lib Dem efforts to use regulations to improve the UK’s cold and leaky homes were repeatedly blocked or weakened by the Conservatives, even when successfully piloted by Tory councils. Labour argues that coalition rows have undermined the huge investment needed to transform the energy system: Davey once had to take legal advice about the contradictory anti-wind farm statements of his then junior minister John Hayes, a Tory. The Labour manifesto is therefore heavy on energy promises, including 5m home retrofits to increase efficiency and making electricity virtually zero-carbon by 2030. On fracking, one the most high-profile green issues, only the Green party is opposed among the parties standing across the UK. But the fact that 161 Labour and 149 Lib Dem parliamentary candidates openly oppose their parties’ support indicates that the shale gas row is far from over, as does the fracking moratorium imposed in Scotland by the SNP. Robert Ede, an energy and environment expert at the Whitehouse Consultancy, thinks fracking could be put on hold by a Labour party seeking to form government with SNP and Green help. “A moratorium on shale would seem a likely concession,” he said. Also offering a distinctive manifesto is Ukip, which dismisses the notion of man-made climate change and wants to “rejuvenate the coal industry”. However, fewer than 10% of the UK public thinks global warming is not happening or is entirely natural. Yet, even the relatively low level of climate scepticism in the UK is higher than in most of the world and higher than a decade ago. The decline of environmental concern from its husky heyday may be reversing, according to Pidgeon. He pointed to the only event in the past five years to send the environment soaring up the issue tracker polls: the widespread floods of early 2014, which followed the wettest winter for 250 years.  In YouGov’s fortnightly poll, the sight of large parts of England under water pushed the environment up from 9% to 23%. “There are times when issues like environment can shoot up the agenda,” said Wells. “There is potential there, but no politician has really made use of that.” The following YouGov poll saw the environment fall to 13%. Labour criticised the coalition for cutting spending on flood defences and climate change adaptation but has not committed to spend more in these areas. In the countryside, party differences are clear. Labour has committed to ending the badger cull, a top-five issue in constituents’ complaints to their MPs. The Conservatives promise a free vote to end the ban on hunting with dogs. The Tory manifesto’s other pledges on protecting the natural world, including large reserves to protect the seas, gained praise from Spencer: “It could be a way to redeem themselves as conservationists. It could be the start of the Conservative party rediscovering its mojo on the natural environment.” Spencer said the environment was important to voters, even if it was in the second rank of issues in tracking polls. “What you get from opinion polls is what is urgent, not what is important,” he said. “People are sophisticated: they expect governments to be responsible. They expect politics to be thinking and planning for the country’s long-term security as they do with defence, which like environment doesn’t come up as an urgent concern in polls.” Matthew Evans at Ipsos Mori agreed: “When we ask specifically about environment, there are high levels of concern and it has risen again recently.” “There is nothing wrong with the British people on the environment – they just haven’t had much of a political offer to buy,” said Burke. “But it’s not an issue that shifts votes – yet.” Conservatives The Tories claim to have led the greenest government ever and promise to push for global agreement on tackling climate change. However, many Conservative MPs have long been opposed to the sight of wind turbines in their constituencies, so it is little surprise to see a cap on onshore wind farms to prevent their spread. The party has also promised a large expansion of marine reserve areas around UK foreign territories. For its rural heartland there is a free vote promised on whether to reinstate hunting with dogs, while on transport the party has promised the biggest investment in rail since Victorian times and for “almost every” car and van to be a zero-emission vehicle by 2050. Ian Marchant, chairman of Infinis Energy, on behalf of the British Wind industry association, criticised the planned cap on onshore wind farms, saying they were the cheapest large-scale renewable energy generation source in the UK,. He added: “This would artificially protect more expensive technologies and the big six energy companies from much-needed competition.” Greens As expected, climate change is at the centre of all Green policies, with proposals for a rapid transition to a zero-carbon, sustainable economy. The party has pledged an outright ban on fracking and a phasing out of coal-power stations. When it comes to public transport, the Greens want to renationalise the railways and cut fares by 10%. Unsurprisingly, Friends of the Earth is full of praise for the manifesto, saying it “stands out from the others as a plan not just to do the right things on the environment but to stop doing the wrong things as well. It commits to end the age of fossil fuels in the way necessary for our generation to avert runaway climate change.” Labour Labour has pledged to double the number of green jobs by 2025, supported by what it says are ambitious carbon reduction targets, including the decarbonisation of the UK’s energy supply by 2030. The party is also promising a robust regulatory regime for shale and more certainty on tax rates for offshore oil and gas. It plans an energy security board to deliver an energy mix including renewables, nuclear, green gas, carbon capture and storage, and clean coal. One of Ed Miliband’s best-known policies is the freeze on energy bills until 2017. In response, Matthew Farrow, executive director of the Environmental Industries Commission, said: “It is heartening that Labour recognise the potential of the green economy and the importance of using government policy to create a stable investment framework. The strategy needs to cover the full range of environmental business, including for example air pollution control and contaminated land remediation, and should include joint work with the green business sector to identify and access the enormous export opportunities.” Lib Dems The Liberal Democrats say they want to build on their environmental record in government and promise to have green commitments on the table from the first day of the next parliament. The party’s proposals include net greenhouse gas emissions to be zero by 2050 and no unabated coal power generation after 2025, with 250,000 new green jobs by 2020. It has also promised to cut council tax for green homes by at least £100 a year for 10 years. The proposals on energy and nature protection were welcomed by Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, who said they “would be a huge win for the environment”. However, he added: “Now we need to know where the red lines are in any negotiations with potential coalition partners and how high up the priority list environmental improvement is for the Lib Dems.” SNP The Scottish National party wants the UK government to adopt Scotland’s carbon reduction targets and has pledged to maintain its support for a moratorium on fracking. The party also wants to maximise support for offshore wind and to support community energy generation, as well as backing community heating schemes. Its manifesto’s pledges to Scotland’s rural communities include the promise to improve transport links across the north, along with a cut in fuel tax of 10p a gallon.  Ukip Central to Ukip’s manifesto is the pledge for the UK to leave the EU, dropping many of its environmental regulations, including emissions trading. It also plans to repeal the 2008 Climate Change Act, which sets legally binding carbon budgets, and to promote fracking and rejuvenate the coal industry. On transport, Nigel Farage’s main pledge is to scrap HS2. For the fishing industry, Ukip wants to reform regulations to enforce “no take” zones and end “destructive industrial fishing practices”. Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green party, called the party’s environmental policies “an insult to the many people across the globe already suffering the effects of climate change”. She added: “Their environmental policies, just like their attitudes to immigration, are nothing short of dangerous.” Fiona Harvey "
"What is your greatest fear for the future of our planet? My fear is that we simply can’t overcome our own hardwiring to understand that this is truly the greatest risk that we are facing.  What do you want to see coming out of the Paris summit?  Very clear signs of leadership. Are you concerned about the fact the US is one of the world’s biggest emitters? The US is still a huge emitter but the international conversation is really, really critical because we have all of these challenges, whether it is the big emitters like China or the fact that developing nations are being so hard hit by extreme weather events. You can’t just focus on your home country any more as an organisation like ours. It is critical to make this issue vocal and personal for people because it does feel so distant in space and time. One of the things that we saw with local TV was that climate change was never being mentioned; our goal is really to integrate that conversation. Would you like to see the US take stronger action on climate change? I really want my home country to be seen as a leader in this. We are seeing signs of our president really wanting to make this a priority issue. It’s proving to be a challenge because our Congress is very polarised but there are some policies in place that are moving us forward in the right direction. What’s the hot topic at the moment? We are seeing a very old narrative play out in the media, which is that you cannot attribute any individual [weather] event to climate change because the weather is chaotic. The science has really moved forward from there. We can now definitively show that certain extreme events would have been virtually impossible without climate change. What about California’s drought? There are two components to drought – precipitation and heat. In the case of precipitation it is not clear that climate change is playing a large role in the rainfall but we know that climate change is increasing this heat and the heat drives greater evaporation – it dries things out. So what we as a scientific community would say is that climate change is certainly worsening the California drought. Is it too late to reverse climate change? I don’t think it is too late. It can be really overwhelming for people, so there is this feeling of: “Oh my God, this is way too hard – we should have done this 20 years ago.” The bottom line is we need to get started immediately. Mitigation is critical but as we move forward adaptation and building more resilient communities are critical as well. Is the fracking fuel boom delaying action? We can’t be distracted by the short-term opportunities that come up. At the same time, we need to focus on alternatives. I think that is a very tricky part when something fairly quick and easy comes up – you just can’t let it take you off the greater goal of reducing emissions overall. Are there politicians you feel should be taking a stronger lead? I think Australia has a lot of work to do. It is by far one of the most vulnerable [countries] when it comes to the impacts of climate change in terms of things like heat impact, wildfires, drought and I know that within Australia the scientific community is working very, very hard for folks to understand that vulnerability.Once again leadership is so critical Is geoengineering a good idea? I have been deeply concerned about geoengineering. I think it is really not the right approach to take. There are two types of geoengineering: carbon capture and storage (CCS) of CO2 and solar radiation management (SRM). SRM involves injecting sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight back to space. Let’s be clear that SRM does nothing to reduce carbon dioxide – treating the symptom (warming) and not the disease (CO2 emissions). By leaving the CO2 in the climate system, SRM completely overlooks the crisis of ocean acidification. In addition, research suggests that injecting sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere will not just cool the Earth but will also result in shifts in the tropical and mid-latitude rain belts. While CCS is more benign, it too could have profound impacts on the hydrological cycle. Should we scrap the 2C target? Targets are useful – they help focus us. Are they perfect? No. [The target] is meant to be useful and I think that is the way we should view it. The impacts of climate change can be tough to see because the main culprit – carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels – is invisible. Translating the problem into a temperature threshold of “dangerous human interference” helps make it more tangible for policymakers. You worked on the Years of Living Dangerously TV series with the likes of Matt Damon and Jessica Alba. Why? We had a team of scientists working together with folks who cared passionately about telling human stories. That series is really this byproduct of these two groups of people coming together saying we really need to connect with people on this issue and make it personal and show people a way forward. For me it was really important to do that series and once and for all tell this story in a more human way. We are actually working on season two now. Was there one experience that woke you up to danger of climate change? I started out as an oceanographer. When I look at the changes that are happening in the ocean, that is one part that just really hits me. The ocean is 70% of the [world’s] surface and we know that 93% of the heat is going into our oceans. The oceans have this really long memory because the circulation at the deeper levels [takes] thousands of years. And here we are impacting this really deep, old, old system. You can’t undo that quickly. The irony of global warming is if we wait to see the full-fledged impact it is going to be too late to fix it. What would you say to a climate change sceptic? What’s the harm in shifting towards a greater reliance on renewable energy, diversifying the energy portfolio, valuing sustainability and valuing a longer timescale of thinking? What’s the downside of doing that?"

"In the Observer Tech Monthly  climate change special, people were asked: “Which of the following should take the most responsibility for tackling global warming?” Surely, both the 45% who answered “governments” and the 13% who answered “households/individuals” are simply wrong. Only international agencies, including the UN, EU, G7, G20, IMF and the World Bank can take action at appropriate levels. We, including governments, should try to ensure that these institutions use power in the interests of the many and the environment, not the few, rich, individuals and corporations.  Many households and individuals already try to reduce personal carbon footprints, and this will continue. Worldwide, though, those who can’t afford to run a car, cook food or heat their homes adequately contribute more to reducing humanity’s collective footprint. Through the renewables levy in electricity bills, even those in fuel poverty contribute to the profits of multinational energy companies, whether or not those produce clean energy.  A recession helps lower emissions, yet governments still seek and applaud growth, however achieved. Governments cannot also act together to take the truly radical steps needed. Jan Dubé Peebles I was amazed to see that we have an influential paper noticeably missing out any reference to population in the climate change equation. Our growing population drives consumerism. Meanwhile, the population of the world continues to creep up. In the UK, an estimated 1,000 births daily; worldwide, an estimated 10,000 births an hour. World population is projected to be eight billion by 2025, and that is a conservative estimate. Family planning is the most cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions. £4 spent on contraception equals 1 tonne of carbon saved, as opposed to £35 spent on solar energy, for example. We can practice all the accepted methods to reduce carbon emissions, but a growing population will counteract all our efforts. Our world population is responsible for increasing environmental degradation and is hastening CO2 emissions, the results of which will lead to runaway climate change, increasing poverty and famine. Sheena Howarth Worcester I am really puzzled as to how you can run a major feature on climate change without a single reference to population growth. Agriculture is one of the biggest users of fossil fuel, and the necessity of feeding an ever-growing population means greater dependency on oil: it also means that more and more forests will be cleared, since we are already using practically all of the easily cultivable ground on the planet. The erosion of topsoil, rising sea levels, drought and more extreme weather all show how population levels and climate impinge on one another. Are we afraid to discuss this? I’m more afraid of the consequences of not discussing it. Paul Ehrlich quotes one demographer as saying: “We will never reach a population of 10 billion: either because we do something about it, or because we don’t.” Roger Plenty Stroud, Gloucs The nuclear industry must be patting itself on its radioactive back in response to your Tech Monthly chart, purporting to show that 91% of us would “prefer” to use energy “from less carbon-intensive sources (eg wind, hydroelectric, solar, nuclear)”. These four energy sources, bracketed together by your innocuous-looking parentheses, are presented as environmentally equivalent. How quickly have we forgotten Sellafield, Chernobyl, Fukushima? The undeniably urgent imperative to reduce carbon emissions should not blind us to the ever-present potential for catastrophe from nuclear power plant malfunctions. Your chart takes for granted what needs to be questioned and debated: namely, can we “solve” the carbon crisis at the cost of 24,000 years of pollution (the half-life of plutonium 239)?

"When you were a little kid and you imagined what a polar explorer might look like, it was probably men like Marc Cornelissen and Philip de Roo that you pictured; one short and stocky, with bright eyes and plenty of swagger; the other tall and slender with a boyish face.  You probably imagined men who were always smiling and full of energy, men who somehow seemed a little more alive than the rest of us. What you probably didn’t imagine is that the very sense of adventure that fills men like Marc and Philip with life can also, sometimes, be what takes life away from them. Nine years ago exactly I was in a tent on the Arctic ice sheet: one of six students taking part in the Ben and Jerry’s/WWF Climate Change College. The college involved several months of training in climate science and campaign strategies, followed by two weeks in Greenland to observe the effects of climate change first hand. It was a project that was only made possible because of the hard work of many people. Two of those people were Marc Cornelissen and Philip de Roo. When news came through last week that Marc and Philip were missing in the Arctic, presumed drowned during an expedition to collect data on the state of the ice, their former students started reaching out to each other. We have spent the last few days exchanging messages of grief and shock. Marc was an experienced Polar explorer, with an unwavering commitment to tackling climate change. His expertise was in gathering ice and snow samples that could be used to validate existing data, such as that gathered by ESA’s CryoSat. Philip was Marc’s wingman. He was only 21 when we first met him and had already completed three Polar expeditions. He had a love of wildlife and had volunteered extensively for WWF in his teens. It is hard to think of two more inspiring role models for us as young activists. Every day in Greenland there was work to be done. Marc was testing new pieces of tech equipment, and spent much of his time in the communications tent surrounded by satellite phones and computers. Philip joined us outside, digging and drilling into the ice to take samples for analysis. So it was in the evenings – sitting in the communal tent and sharing stories - that we really got to know them. Marc and Philip talked about the relationship you need to work together under tough conditions; the absolute trust you must have in each other. But they also talked about why they did it; why, even without the personal satisfaction that came from pushing themselves, they felt it was their responsibility to take part in the fight against climate change. Those evenings were a lot of fun. The two men epitomised the philosophy of working hard first and playing hard after. Philip liked to drink hot chocolate, with a good glug of whisky in it. Marc preferred red wine, which in Greenland usually had large chunks of ice floating in it. He often talked with immense pride about his daughter, back home in the Netherlands. As the sun dipped low in the sky, he would step out of the tent to smoke a cigar. He would stretch an arm out and gesture at the vast expanse of ice, glowing in the soft light. “Look at this,” he would say. “Does it get any better that this?” I cannot believe that they are gone. Like everyone who met Marc and Philip there are parts of them that will stay with me forever. I will remember their great big belly laughs, which came easily and often. I will remember their kindness and their enthusiasm. I will remember their framing of climate change as a justice issue. More than anything I will remember and do my very best to honour their commitment to the idea of collective action – their belief that we each have to strive for our best without ever forgetting that our personal efforts are only one small part of a large and powerful movement. The personal efforts of explorers like Marc and Philip were more than most of us can achieve. But they give us something to aspire to. The lives and work of these two men may have stopped, but the movement will go on."

"I read that every polar bear alive has mitochondrial DNAfrom a common mother, an Irish brown bear who onceroved out across the last ice age, and I am comforted.It has been a long hot morning with the children of the machine, their talk of memory, of buying it, of buying it cheap, but I,memory keeper by trade, scan time coded in the golden hive mindof eternity. I burn my books, I burn my whole archive:a blaze that sears, synapses flaring cell to cell where memory sleeps in the wax hexagonals of my doomed and melting comb.I see him loping towards me across the vast ice fieldto where I wait in the cave mouth, dreaming my cubs about the den,my honied ones, smelling of snow and sweet oblivion."
"What is your greatest fear for the future of our planet? My fear is that, although the solutions are out there to make a better future, if we carry on with business as usual we will run out of time and the point of no return will come.  Are we focusing too much on human impact?  Some of the arguments are certainly very human focused but to be pragmatic about it I think it is only when it is human focused that we get sufficient political will. It doesn’t really matter what the focus is if the outcome is right because that will help people, animals and the environment. Are you worried about what will happen to chimps and other primates? Yes, definitely. It is already apparent in some of the chimps’ more arid habitats. It is getting drier and hotter and that is going to affect food and water supplies. Is there scope for them to migrate or adapt? Some won’t be able to migrate anywhere – there won’t be anywhere to go. I think [climate change] is happening too quickly for evolutionary-type adaptations. Baboons and macaques are opportunists and they will do much better, but the apes really have very prescribed lives and it is much harder for them to adapt. You have said that tackling deforestation is a big issue – what should we be doing? If you are a poor community and you are relying on the forest to cut down trees to sell the timber or to clear for agriculture to feed your family, there has to be an alternative – you can’t just tell people they can’t use [the forest] anymore. The Redd-plus programme [reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation] that we worked with actually made a very big difference in the part of Tanzania where we work. The villagers got benefits and we trained them to be forest monitors. Which is more important, putting pressure on governments or empowering local communities? The second is more likely to be successful. All these climate conferences so far haven’t led to much political will at high levels. Even if one politician is pretty tough and makes strong emission capping regulations, if there is an election and he is gone somebody else can overturn them. And the big corporations, the vested interest groups, are so powerful and their links with governments are so strong that one gets a little jaded. You are going to the Paris summit this year. What would you like to see come out it? Strong agreement among the politicians and legislators to cap carbon emissions in a meaningful way. Are any politicians doing a good job? Or are they holding up progress? There are quite a lot in the US who are climate change deniers and ranting that it is nothing to do with us. We blame the politicians, but politicians in a democracy get elected, politicians want to be re-elected and I have known politicians who go into government with really good ethical standards about something like climate change but unless they have got at least 50% of the electorate supporting them if they make a tough regulation, they are not going to do it. So it needs a mandate from the community? It does. And here’s another hope for the future: I was part of the climate march in New York on the last UN peace day and the organisers expected about 100,000 people and in fact it was almost 400,000. All around me, particularly the younger people, they were all on their iPhones and iPads and tablets. They were all tweeting and twittering to their friends. And people were coming – they responded. So this is a huge new power that particularly the youth is on to. Is it important that celebrities get involved? Yes, if they are genuine. If they stand up and say you have all got to control your carbon emissions and then they go flying around in private jets for holidays it just makes them seem absurd. You are vegetarian – should we all go meat-free for the environment? I became vegetarian because of the horrendous cruelty. But now [I see] the impact on the environment – the huge areas of forest cut down to provide space to grow grain to feed the livestock or for grazing, the huge waste of water [in] turning vegetable protein into animal protein and then the CO2 emissions from the fossil fuel that is burned to support this vast agroindustry. And as an additional big problem for climate change, these creatures, particularly cows, produce methane gas and that is an even more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Was there one experience really that woke you up to the scale of climate change? Yes. It was standing with some Inuit elders in Greenland looking up at the icecap and they were saying when they were young the [ice] never melted even in the summer. It was early spring and the water was gushing down this ice cliff. The sound of the ice breaking off and the crashing, the thunderous crashing, it was absolutely shocking – then looking out at the sea and seeing all these icebergs and little pieces of ice bobbing about. I went directly from Greenland to Panama and again met indigenous elders whose people for as long as they could remember had been living on the offshore islands and they had made plans to bring them island by island on to the mainland because more and more of the islands were becoming uninhabitable [because of high tides]. So going directly from the speeding up of the melting of the ice to people who were being driven off [their land] – it was just a shock. Is that what it will take to change policy - a disaster closer to home, like the Florida floods? It will certainly make a much bigger impact on policy in the US if Florida floods as compared with Bangladesh. It is very sad, but true. What would you say to a climate change sceptic? I find it hard to believe that they really believe what they are saying. If they do really believe [it] then they clearly haven’t properly investigated the scientific reports, they clearly haven’t travelled around the world and seen what I have seen of ice melting and people forced to leave their island homes."
"In the distant past, temperatures were far warmer than even the most extreme warming scenarios predicted by the end of the century. Fifty million years ago, during the Eocene, it was on average 10C hotter than today. Forests stretched from pole to pole, the Arctic was inhabited by alligators and squirrel-like primates, and palm trees grew in what is now Alaska.   Unlike the current warming trend, though, most natural warm periods in the past developed over thousands, if not millions, of years. “It’s not how much the temperature has gone up – that’s only around 1C over the past 100 years,” says professor Adam Scaife of the Met Office. “What’s unprecedented is the rate of change.” When searching ancient climate records for parallels with the current situation, scientists point to the handful of instances where the Earth’s temperature shifted quickly because of surges in CO2 linked to volcanic activity. Such rapid warming events are often linked in the fossil record to mass extinctions. In common with naturally occurring sudden global temperature changes, scientists can explain the warming observed this century only by factoring in the large rise in CO2 emissions linked to human activity rather than volcanos. The sun is ultimately responsible for warming the Earth, so it seems reasonable that changes in solar activity would influence climate. But can changes observed in the sun explain global warming? Scientists don’t think so. The sun’s activity rises and falls roughly on an 11-year cycle, while temperatures have been rising steadily for a century. “If you just look at global average surface temperatures, there is a small effect that you can associate with solar energy,” says professor Jo Haigh, an atmospheric physicist at Imperial College London. “But it’s a very small signal that can’t possibly have done more than greenhouse gas.” During a complete solar cycle, the total energy output of the sun changes by about 0.1%, Haigh says, which, using a typical estimate for climate sensitivity, translates to a change in temperature on Earth of about 0.5C. This means that a dip in solar activity probably contributed in a small way to the slowing of global warming in the past decade. But only a more dramatic drop in solar output – a so-called “super-minimum” – would offset the underlying warming trend. “If the sun went into a state of very low activity, it’s possible, but unlikely,” says Haigh. “There’s no way of forecasting the sun so I wouldn’t hold your breath.” The world’s infrastructure, from energy to transport to the food we grow, was designed for today’s climate. However, projected changes to climate may be fortuitous for some. A 2014 study, by Public Health England, confirmed that the increase in rates of summer deaths would be more than cancelled out by the drop in winter deaths. David Spiegelhalter, professor of the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, points out: “This study got headlines by claiming that heat-related deaths in the UK were projected to more than double by 2050. However, closer examination of their results revealed that they estimated that the overall death rate due to extreme weather – both hot and cold – would go down in all age groups. It was only because of an ageing population that the overall number of deaths would go up.” A study published last year by the University of East Anglia predicted that global yields of wheat and soybeans would increase for the next 70 years under a “business as usual” scenario, in which carbon dioxide emissions rise rapidly. CO2 is central to the process of photosynthesis and in theory higher levels of CO2 can increase the efficiency by which plants convert sunlight to energy. However, this has to be balanced against the heat stress faced both by plants and agricultural workers.“I think that focusing only on the negative aspects of climate change can risk scientific credibility,” Spiegelhalter says. The floods that gripped Britain in the winter of 2013-14 led to a stronger public belief in human-induced climate change. The storms marked the wettest December to January period since 1876. But some years will always be hotter, wetter or stormier than others. “Asking whether a specific event is down to climate change is really tricky, but you can look at whether that type of event is more likely,” says Professor Adam Scaife. “It’s all about the risk of certain events changing. You can say that a specific type of event is more likely.” For temperature, this calculation is relatively straightforward. “As the climate warms, the range of daily temperatures shifts upwards and at the upper end starts to stretch out into unprecedented territory.” Other extremes are more complex to predict. As the air warms, it can hold more water vapour and this is expected to lead to more rain in some parts of the globe – including Britain. There is already a “hint of a signal” showing that extreme rainfall has increased in this country, although mean rainfall has not yet significantly shifted. Antarctic sea ice extended further than ever recorded during the last southern winter, according to satellite data. This could be taken to mean that Antarctic ice is in robust condition and may appear to confound the basic “warmer world, less ice” narrative. Scientists however say that the observations are less paradoxical than they seem. First, there are no good measurements for the thickness of Antarctic sea ice. “It might be decreasing in the Antarctic, we just don’t know,” says Andy Shepherd, professor of earth observation at the University of Leeds. Second, although the area of ice at the south pole has been growing, this has been a much smaller change than the shrinkage seen at the north pole. “It’s wrong, from a climate perspective, to take this binary view that they balance out,” Shepherd says. Finally, scientists believe that other factors, such as the hole in the ozone layer, which is linked to a cooling effect in the southern hemisphere, may have overshadowed the impact of global warming on the continent. As warming continues, the current growth in the extent of Antarctic ice could be reversed. Discussions about sea ice in the Arctic often confuse two different measures – extent and volume. The extent of ice, although a useful indicator of global temperatures, is also strongly influenced by wind and ocean currents, which alter how densely the ice is packed. “The volume of the ice is really the important number for an assessment of its health,” says Andy Shepherd. Often the two figures don’t match, he points out. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center recently declared this year’s winter maximum for sea ice in the Arctic to be lower than ever, but volume measurements were up on 2013. During the past five years, Arctic ice volume has been relatively stable, but this follows a 30-year downward trend in both volume and extent. “You wouldn’t ever take five years of measurement and say that is the climate signal,” says Shepherd. Scientists’ best projections suggest that any recovery in Arctic sea ice is probably temporary, but that there will be ice at the north pole for at least the next 20 to 30 years. Scientists disagree about how much warming there has been in the past century, how much there will be in the future and what the environmental impacts might be. The fundamental idea that the world is getting hotter due to human activity is not seriously disputed, however. “The basic physics that CO2 causes warming and that humans are responsible is incredibly well established,” according to Mark Maslin, professor of physical geography at University College London. “If you consider the five IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] reports, there’s never been science that’s been examined in so much detail.” A survey of the peer-reviewed literature shows that more than 97% of published work supports the idea that warming trends are linked to human activity. After investigating, scientists also found no evidence that papers with a sceptical slant were being systematically rejected by journals. The strength of the consensus appears not to have been conveyed to the public. In a 2014 survey by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, only one in nine people in Britain thought that almost all climate scientists believe that rising temperatures are primarily caused by burning fossil fuels. “No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change,” President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address in January. The claim is backed up by the IPCC’s 2014 climate impacts assessment, which suggests that a significantly warmer world would present major challenges in terms of health, the economy and food. There is no evidence that the spectre of extinction is looming, however. Even under apocalyptic changes that made parts of the globe uninhabitable, plenty of us would still survive. And we tick most of the boxes – geographical range, being able to survive in a variety of climates and sheer numbers – that predict the species that did well in previous mass extinction events. “We are the perfect weed,” says Maslin. “If you look at the things that have killed a lot of people like Spanish flu or wars, they barely register in the smooth upward population curve. It sounds awful, but it’s really hard to get rid of us.” Climate change might make people in the west poorer and cause increased misery to the very poorest in society, but it will probably take something else to wipe us out."

"Batteries that can store renewable energy for longer and at half the current cost have been hailed as an energy revolution that could transform Africa’s power supply.  Launched by California-based tech company Tesla, the battery can hold enough energy to power a home for up to five hours. Tesla boss Elon Musk said the company had Africa in mind when it developed the wall-mounted energy source. Just like the mobile phone allowed the continent to surge ahead in internet connectivity, so a battery pack that can power a home or business could allow Africans to leapfrog the limits of the grid.  The company has promised to release the technology into the public domain, encouraging others to develop their own models using the open source data. At $3,500 (£2,267) for the 10 kilowatt hours version or $3,000 for a 7KWh version it’s still relatively expensive, but within a few years the price is expected to drop as others develop their own models.  Africa is the world’s most energy-scarce continent. Sub-Saharan Africa has an installed capacity equivalent to that of Spain, and half of it is in South Africa alone. But perhaps more importantly, Africa could become the global centre for green energy. Thanks to the expansive Sahara desert, strong winds along its coasts and its flat, arid interior, and geothermal reserves all along the Rift Valley, the continent has the world’s highest reserves of renewable energy resources. Here are three ways the new battery could make an impact: The battery could allow millions to leapfrog from no electricity at all straight to renewables. Sub-Saharan Africa has more people living without access to electricity than any other region – more than 600 million people – nearly half of the global total. Although the continent is home to 13% of the world’s population, it accounts for only 4% of global energy demand. Worse still, the electricity available is erratic. Nigeria’s power is notoriously unreliable, but Ghana and South Africa have also been recently plunged into blackouts, mainly because of a lack of investment in the electricity grid.   With the Powerwall currently able to supply five hours of power, an enterprising African engineer could hook up several together, scaling up the battery’s capacity to provide continuous power to homes or commercial centres. The battery could also finally break Africa’s dependance on fuel guzzling generators. In 2012, the cost of fuel for backup generators used by businesses and households is estimated to have been at least $5bn. Nigeria is said to have the biggest concentration of generators per square kilometre in the world; the country accounts for almost three-quarters of electricity supply provided by back-up generators in Africa. Today, technology hubs are springing up all over Africa’s cities. There are currently at least 90 tech hubs across the continent. Kenya is planning to build a tech city – its “silicon savannah” – costing $14.5bn from scratch at Konza, 60km away from the capital in Nairobi. Ghana plans to build Hope City, a $10bn high-tech hub outside Accra, aiming to turn Ghana into a major tech player too. Meanwhile, companies like Facebook and Google have ambitious plans to deploy wireless internet across the globe using drones or hot-air balloons to carry the signal. But the combination of a solar panel battery and drone/balloon internet, it might only be a matter of time before the idea of a physical tech city itself becomes obsolete.  Using the new batteries, a tech hub – and workplaces in general – could become more mobile, springing up guerrilla-style anywhere in urban or rural Africa, like a flash mob for geeks.    With the possibility of being entirely off-grid, the home battery could finalise the disconnection of African everyday life from the happenings in the political sphere. Traditionally, the relationship between a government and its people is one of bartering political support for the provision of services, such as roads, schools, electricity, water and security.  But increasingly, African life today is characterised by an extensive retreat of the state from these functions. In Kenya, for example, the number of private primary schools rose nearly 1,000% in a decade, while the number of government primary schools grew just 40%. In Uganda, the percentage of university students attending private institutions jumped from 9% in 1999 to 74% in 2011. In South Africa, there are more private security guards than police and army combined. Nairobi city senator Mike Sonko even recently launched a personally funded fleet of ambulances, tow trucks, garbage collectors, water bowsers and fire brigades to respond to citizen emergencies. Already, studies show that the African middle class deliberately disengages from politics as a form of protest, particularly if the government is authoritarian or a quasi-democracy. The result – if the Tesla batteries take off, and Africa goes off-grid – could be less pressure on states to provide infrastructure and services to its people, widening the gap between governments and voters.

"The number of patents for renewable energy products filed worldwide has fallen by 42% over the last three years,which could suggest that global investment in green energy is stalling. Research from commercial law firm EMW shows that 20,655 green energy patents were filed globally in 2014, for solar power, wind energy, biofuels and waste-generated energy – down from 35,590 in 2012.  EMW said this sharp decline has been mainly caused by oversupply in the solar panel market, with Chinese mass production hitting profit margins of other companies. Solar-related patents accounted for 65% of the total (13,551 patents) last year. This has been exacerbated by subsidy cuts for renewables in many countries, including the UK, as well as the dramatic fall in oil prices that has widened the price gap between low carbon and conventional energy. James Geary, head of EMW’s waste, renewables and energy team, warned this could well hamper efforts by governments around the world to meet their carbon reduction targets. Geary said: “These figures show that the boom in green energy innovation that we have witnessed in recent years has peaked for now, suggesting that investment in R&D is tailing off across the renewables sector. “In terms of solar energy, falling costs of solar panels fuelled by Chinese manufacturers flooding the market have hurt profitability, disincentivising costly research and development activity.” Geary added: “The net result is that, despite international efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and cut carbon emissions by focusing on renewables, the impetus to fund innovation in green energy has taken a knock.” In the UK, the current subsidy scheme, called renewable obligation, is being replaced by a new system, in which subsidies will be capped at £200m. Spain and Germany have also scaled back their renewable energy subsidies in the past few years."
"If information was all we needed, we’d have solved climate change by now. The scientific position has been clear for decades. Researchers have been waving a big red flag that has been impossible for our politicians to miss. Even Margaret Thatcher was giving speeches about global warming in 1988. So why have we made so little progress? Why do carbon emissions continue to rise seemingly inexorably? Information, it seems, is not enough. Journalists have transmitted the warnings of scientists, but they have sometime focussed too much on the mini-controversies and the unimportant disagreements and not enough on the big picture. That has often left readers confused.  As the Guardian’s editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger explained when he introduced the paper’s Keep it in the Ground project, journalism struggles with climate change. It may be the biggest issue of our generation but we feel individually powerless or that solutions lie somewhere in the future. As Rusbridger says, journalism is a “rear view mirror”: good at telling you what has happened but not so good at explaining what’s round the next bend. Climate change journalism can often also be full of institutional acronyms and difficult to digest science. The UNFCCC, Contracts for Difference, common but differentiated responsibilities and methane clathrates don’t say “read me” to most of us. What’s missing for the reader is often an emotional or aesthetic connection. That is where this comes in. Alan Rusbridger asked me to curate a series of 20 poems that respond to the topic of climate change. The brief was to reach parts of the Guardian readers’ hearts and minds that the reporting, investigations, videos, podcasts and the rest had failed to reach. The result is a series of new work from a variety of poets commissioned specially for the Keep it in the Ground project. The authors include Paul Muldoon, Michael Longley and Gillian Clarke and the poets have interpreted the work in many different ways. Jackie Kay writes from the heart of a general election in Planet Farage; Simon Armitage imagines the last snowman; Alice Oswald strikes a note of heart-stopping grief. I hope that these poems will connect with people in surprising and different ways and, in the process, help them in some small way perhaps to see our world differently."

"Global average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached a new record high in March 2015, soaring to surpass 400 parts per million, scientists revealed on Wednesday.  The news came as a reminder that the international community has failed to come up with meaningful solutions to reverse the trend in greenhouse gas emissions that are a direct cause of global warming.  “I, and many other scientists, we are beginning to get worried. Because we see efforts that are not strong enough. We do not see the political will or the leadership to address this issue,” said James Butler, director of the global monitoring division at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The average in atmosphere carbon dioxide concentration observed in March has not been seen by scientists since NOAA monitoring started in 1957. And scientific evidence suggests that these levels have been unseen for the entire history of human civilization as we know it. Babylonian, Chinese and western civilizations were able to develop during a time of climate stability marked by carbon dioxide concentration levels of 270 to 280 parts per million, Butler said. With the dawn of the industrial age, carbon dioxide concentration levels in the atmosphere began to climb, going from 280 parts per million in 1800 to 290 parts per million in 1900. In the last century alone, the rise in concentration is one that would normally be expected to happen over the course of 10,000 or 20,000 years, Butler said – definitely not 100. This March, the International Energy Agency reported that greenhouse gas emissions had plateaued over the last two years, stopping an upward trend. Emissions may have stagnated, but the degree of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere – a direct cause for global warming – is continuing to rise. “Once you get carbon dioxide up in the atmosphere, it’s very difficult to make it go away,” Butler said. Current global emissions would have to be reduced by a momentous 80% in order to stop carbon dioxide concentration in its upward trend. Even if emissions came to a halt altogether, it would likely take hundreds, if not thousands, of years for concentration levels to come back down to desirable rates. Still, tools are in place for governments and industries to turn their backs on fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, the burning of which is causing the emissions, Butler said. Relying on a combination of alternative sources of power would stop emissions in their tracks, Butler said, citing geothermal, hydropower, agropower, wind energy and even controversial nuclear power as potential alternatives. The main obstacle to this end so far seems to be a lack of mass mobilization. “We put a man on the moon in nine years and we could hardly fly a rocket before that,” Butler said, referring to America’s successful Apollo 11 mission in 1969. “With the right kind of political will, there’s a lot that could get done.”"

"In the past, companies that dominate the global coffee business have managed their supply risk by diversifying their suppliers. Now a quarter of production in Brazil, the largest producer of high-quality Arabica coffee, is under direct threat from climate change, and rising temperatures are expected to undermine the commercial viability of Arabica coffee in many of the world’s coffee-growing regions.  In the next two decades, this systemic failure across many regions will require companies to radically change their production models and sourcing relationships. Yes, the price of your favourite coffee will increase due to climate change, but there is hope that the risks involved will change the entire industry for the better.  The global coffee market is dominated by a few large multinationals: Nestlé, Mondelēz International and DE Master Blenders 1753. And it is rapidly integrating: the latter two have just received conditional approval from the European Commission to create the world’s largest coffee business. The 10 biggest coffee roasters process almost 40% of all the coffee consumed worldwide, with leading companies including Smucker’s, Strauss, Starbucks and Tchibo. Certification standards have done much to encourage consumers to support fairer trade and forest protection. However, the Coffee Barometer 2014 is already recognising that these initiatives may struggle in a world where climate change directly uproots smallholder farmers. No fewer than 15 global companies must now consider how the global market will respond to the threat of climate change with a more transformative business strategy for sustainability. The picture looks bleak for the world’s favourite, higher quality Arabica coffee, which makes up 70% of the 1.6bn cups consumed every day. Grown in tropical regions at a higher altitude, it is especially sensitive to a changing climate. Rising temperatures and long cycles of drought interrupted by shorter, excessive bouts of rainfall increase the occurrence of pests and disease, seriously threatening Arabica coffee.  In the Tanzanian highlands, yields have fallen by 46% over the past 50 years. This is mirrored by the other Arabica-growing nations including Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia and Kenya. Meanwhile the global demand for coffee continues unabated, growing at 2.1% annually according to the International Coffee Organization. Arabica crops will need to move 300 to 500 metres further above sea level in order to survive, according to a new new study by the Colombia-based International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). This may be feasible for producers in Ethiopia and Kenya, but will be difficult for market leaders like Brazil.  Robusta, on the other hand, is a higher-yield but lower-quality coffee variety used for instant coffee, and is able to withstand higher temperatures. A switch to Robusta is often discussed as an adaptation strategy, bringing countries like Vietnam (the biggest producer) and Indonesia increasingly into the limelight. But there’s a catch. Coffee aside, producing countries face multiple other pressures on their land, as is shown in the Earth Security Index 2015. Deforestation, land tenure conflicts, food security and water scarcity are increasingly interconnected. These pressures will constrain land expansion for coffee production, requiring business risk management responses to think about alternatives in advance. The feasibility of a large-scale conversion to irrigated coffee production is an unlikely option for these countries. For example, Indonesia’s nature reserves and indigenous communities occupy elevated land and are a limiting factor to Indonesia’s coffee growing area. Land conflicts in Indonesia are a defining feature of agriculture sectors. Poor track record on land tenure, deforestation and corruption in its highly decentralised government system are more likely to increase land conflicts in global coffee supply chains, like those plaguing the palm oil and timber industries in the region. The CIAT study that mapped the suitability of Arabica coffee to adapt to climate change concludes that in order to thrive, coffee plantations will need to be protected by shade trees to keep them cool. Shade-grown coffee is not new, it’s how Arabica coffee was produced before the 1970s – before an input-intensive, mono-crop model took over and allowed global production to scale. Today, the intensive model is more vulnerable to climate change, soil erosion and pest and plant diseases. Shade-grown coffee is cultivated below the canopy of the trees, integrated into the complex biodiversity of the landscape. The forest-like structure of a coffee plantation has dozens of plant and hundreds of animal species interacting to create a richer, more adaptive environment. Potential pest insects are kept in check by their predators, and coffee beans can grow in a shaded, cooler environment. Farmers retain the income spent on chemical pesticides and fertilisers, minimising run-off pollution to water sources. The benefits may be apparent, but a 2014 study revealed that despite a growing penetration in the US as a specialty coffee, shade-grown coffee had shrunk 20% since 1996 as a proportion of global coffee production. The fastest growth in the industry has instead been driven through more intensive models.  Starbucks, for example, appears to have discontinued its organic shade-grown Mexican coffee sourced from farmers in Chiapas’s El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve. In the UK, Percol’s Organic Rainforest Arabica coffee has been sold in Tesco and Waitrose, but is currently unavailable in stores. A few other specialty brands are available online, but not in supermarkets. Climate change will force the sustainable business debate to go back to the basics of coffee production models. However, some regions will find it difficult to adapt. According to Peter Laderach, a co-author of the CIAT report, Brazil’s highly mechanised, commercial coffee production is not suitable for intercropping with trees. Business entrepreneurs must challenge conventional thinking. New entrepreneurial models in South America, such as Guayaki, are producing traditional ‘mate’ tea-leaves by regenerating native forest. The model is working. It shows that it is possible to create a consumer-facing brand built around the attributes of an ecosystem regeneration business model. In those regions that are unable to adapt, however, farmers will either turn to other crops or migrate to already overcrowded cities, transferring the supply risks back to global companies. An adjustment in the global market is inevitable. However, the hope is that the greater risks looming on the coffee industry will unlock a future where ecosystem service innovation and resilience become the only option for a truly sustainable business model for coffee production.

"Federal cabinet is set to agree to a compromise deal on the renewable energy target on Thursday, paving the way for a bipartisan agreement to break the investment drought caused by a year-long political deadlock. But long months of political haggling and the reduced quantity of renewable energy required under the compromise policy mean its biggest beneficiary is likely to be windfarms – which are bitterly opposed by some Coalition MPs and which treasurer Joe Hockey once said he found “utterly offensive”.  The RET – which currently requires 41,000 gigawatt hours of energy to be delivered from renewable sources by 2020 – has been in limbo since the government commissioned self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton to undertake a review in February last year. It recommended the target be slashed, but after fierce industry and community criticism, cabinet asked the environment minister, Greg Hunt, and the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, to try to reach a bipartisan agreement with Labor to allow continued investment without fear of policy change. Labor and the renewables industry insisted the target had to be in the mid-to-high 30,000GWh. When the government refused to budge from about 26,000GWh last year, Labor walked out of the talks. In recent months the Coalition raised its “bottom line to 32,000GWh and Labor reduced its demand to 33,500GWh. Last week Labor gave more ground and agreed to 33,000GWh. Liberal backbenchers such as Dan Tehan and Sarah Henderson, who want the concessions in the agreement for the renewable and aluminium industries in their regional Victorian seats, urged the government to strike the deal. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Kate Carnell also backed the compromise. Macfarlane, who had been holding out against any increase in the government’s position because he was worried the industry did not have the capacity to build so much renewable power in the timeframe (which would trigger a “penalty” payment on electricity retailers), is understood to be ready to agree. This means cabinet is likely to tick off the deal on Thursday. The industry insists there are no barriers to building the required amount of renewable energy providers. It is understood Coalition and Labor ministers are likely to meet on Friday to ink the agreement, which will have to be legislated. Much of the original hostility towards the RET within the Coalition was actually directed at the wind industry, but because stalled wind projects are ready to proceed they are almost certain to use up almost all the remaining RET target. This has left the solar industry angry. Big solar projects are unlikely to benefit because the target will have already been taken up by wind power, and some in the government are also concerned that the policy won’t encourage multiple renewable technologies."
"France’s ambassador has called on Australia to join the effort to avoid dangerous climate change, saying his country’s leaders had repeatedly raised the issue with the prime minister, Tony Abbott. Christophe Lecourtier said he was optimistic Australia would make a positive contribution before December’s talks in Paris on emissions reduction goals beyond 2020.  “We remember tough discussions in Brisbane at the G20 and then we had a state visit to Sydney and Canberra; the issue was raised and discussed quite frankly,” he said. “We had the feeling the Australian government is working on the issue. There is momentum, even here, and I hope [Australia] will join the club, join the coalition of countries.” The UN’s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, also speaking at a Carbon Market Institute summit in Melbourne, said she was “counting on Australian leadership” at the Paris talks, but it still had “homework” to do. Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations framework convention on climate change, said it was “critical to get our act together as quickly as possible”. “Australia prides itself on leadership on many fields, not just cricket, and this cannot be an exception,” Figueres said at a speech at the Melbourne cricket ground, where she expressed surprise that the fabled stadium’s grass was being warmed by heaters. “I’m counting on Australian leadership,” she said. “I can’t tell you how important it is to hear an important voice from Australia in a very, very critical group of countries.  “You represent a huge potential to lead the world into a very healthy economic diversification path. You haven’t figured out how to do that yet but that, my friends, is your homework.” The Australian government is due to announce its post-2020 emissions reduction target in July, having waited for major emitters such as the US to do so first.  Australia’s target is a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020, based on 2000 levels. The level of Australia’s ambition has been questioned at home and abroad. Countries including China and Brazil have queried how the Coalition’s Direct Action policy will achieve the 5% reduction, and the Climate Change Authority has recommended Australia’s “inadequate” target be raised to a 19% cut, with a 30% reduction in emissions by 2025. Figueres, who was criticised by Abbott in 2013 when she highlighted science linking rising temperatures and bushfires, has met state and territory leaders in Australia and has stressed there was “no space” for new coal developments if a global goal of a 2C limit on warming was to be achieved. The UN climate chief said China’s pledge to reduce its use of coal after 2020 was an “amazing commitment” which was sensible because “they have this habit in China of wanting to actually breathe air into their lungs”. Figueres said it was important to maintain an “open mind” over the different methods to reduce emissions. There was little point dwelling on the demise of Australia’s carbon pricing system, which was scrapped by the Coalition last year.  The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the replacement Direct Action plan, which bought 47m tonnes of carbon abatement in its first action, had proved a “stunning” success and would be Australia’s emissions policy for the next 50 years. “Leading is achieving and doing what you say,” he said. “Australia has achieved its Kyoto targets, we have done extraordinary things in terms of emissions intensity. Some of the critics, for political reasons, will airbrush those facts. “Paris will succeed where Copenhagen failed. We will make a very significant and constructive contribution to a post-2020 agreement. We will not rest until such an agreement is secured. The world cannot, and I believe won’t have, another failure like Copenhagen.” Hunt rejected suggestions that Australia was not committed to the 2C warming limit, given that the government’s energy policy is based upon a fossil fuel-dominated scenario that would lead to the world warming by 4C. “The commitment [to the 2C limit] is absolute; the policy is crystal clear,” Hunt said. “It’s irresponsible for critics to take scenario planning and say it’s a policy objective.” Mary Bruce Warlick, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for the US government’s bureau of energy resources, used the Melbourne summit to call for a global phase-out of fossil-fuel subsidies. “We have to stop government money going to non-renewable energy, such as coal and oil,” she said. “The US has been driving efforts to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies, which the International Energy Agency estimated at $548bn in 2013. “Clean energy is one of the greatest economic opportunities of all time. We are working with other countries to stop global financial institutions financing dirty power stations.” Warlick said an estimated $17t would be invested globally in clean energy between now and 2035."

"A research centre linked to controversial Danish academic Bjørn Lomborg was earmarked for the University of Western Australia through a “corrupt” process initiated by the prime minister’s office, parliament has been told.  The university backed out of the proposal, which was to have been funded by the federal government, after protests by staff and students. The West Australian Labor MP Alannah MacTiernan said on Tuesday that science has been the big loser under the Abbott government. She said it was curious that the government had found $4m for the Australian Consensus Centre, a think tank which had at its heart a commitment to cherry-pick the scientific evidence which argued against urgent action on climate change. MacTiernan said the education minister Christopher Pyne says the decision to fund the centre at UWA followed a proposal put forward by the university and Lomborg, but vice-chancellor Paul Johnson said the proposal was not initiated by the university. The proposal arose out of discussions between Lomborg and the government, MacTiernan said. “It seems the offer came directly from the prime minister’s office and came to UWA only after the Australian Catholic University had rejected it,” she said.  “Extraordinarily, this special research initiative didn’t come through the Australian Research Council or any peer review.” It was a “corrupt process”, she said."

"The Amundsen sea sector in west Antarctica is almost as big as France. Six glaciers drain into it and one of the largest of these is the Pine Island glacier, a 30-kilometre-wide estuary of ice that is more than 500km in length. Stand on it, on a clear day, and swaths of glittering ice stretch off to the horizon in every direction. This is one of the world’s greatest bodies of fresh water, a vast frozen reservoir weighing more than 300tn tonnes. With that sort of resource, you could solve a great many of the planet’s freshwater problems.  But the Pine Island glacier is ailing. It is melting and losing, annually, an incredible 46bn tonnes of ice. Each year, more and more of the glacier slips down to the ocean where it forms a vast sheet of shelf ice that spreads over the sea and eventually disappears. And the loss of this ice shelf is of crucial importance, for without it there is nothing to shore up the glacier on land, a problem that now affects many other glaciers on the continent. Think of the Antarctic as a large dollop of trifle set in a pastry case. Take away the case – its ice shelf – and there is nothing to stop the trifle from slowly spreading out all over the place. And that, unfortunately, is just what is happening in many other areas of the Antarctic. As their “pastry cases” of shelf ice dissipate, so glaciers are spilling, like trifle, into the sea – and at increasing speed. The Pine Island glacier just happens to be the most extreme example of this alarming phenomenon. But why? What processes are driving the loss of shelf ice across the south pole? Given the fact that melting Antarctic ice would trigger sea-level rises round the globe, these questions are some of the most important affecting climate change policy today and are being tackled, directly, by scientists working for Britain’s iSTAR programme. Funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, the £7.4m project has involved scientists spending the past two Antarctic summers living on the Pine Island glacier, a region of stunning beauty – and hostility. “It is certainly a very special place, though in one sense it is like every other spot on Earth,” says glacier expert Andy Smith, from the British Antarctic Survey. “It has its good days and it has its bad days. It is just that when it is a bad day it is usually absolutely awful.” On occasion, winds can quickly whip up to speeds of 130kph or more and when that happens snow is thrown all over the place as high-velocity fine spray. “You cannot see a foot in front of you,” says Smith, the science programme manager of iSTAR. “You have to be incredibly careful where you go. As soon as we realise a gale is coming, we rig up rope lines so people follow them and move around safely.” In general, though, there is no option for members of the expedition but to bunker down until these winds have passed. “We slept in two-man mountain tents at night but we also had one big function room, which we called the caboose but which was really a storage container that had been brought on to the glacier on skis,” recalls Smith. “That is where we had our kitchen where we could get hot food and get dry.” And that, he says, is the real secret of living in the Antarctic. “You have to have some sanctuary where you can get some comfort. You cannot survive without it in the long run.” However, it should be noted that the caboose was not fitted with showers and bathrooms. “For that kind of trip – and yes it lasted three months – you just have to go grubby,” adds Smith. Now the scientists of the iSTAR project are completing their work, a programme that had an initial two-year period when equipment was flown on to the glacier and assembled there. This was followed by a second period when Smith and his fellow researchers spent two three-month bouts of work during the Antarctic summer taking measurements of the ice below their feet. Two tracked vehicles carried the scientists along the tributaries of the Pine Island glacier so they could extract ice cores from various depths. In this way, they were able to obtain a continuous record of snowfall and its density on the glacier. “We have gathered all our data over the past two years and now we have taken it off to our offices and will be analysing on our computers for the next few months,” says Smith. “The results should be ready for publication in about a year.” The resulting papers should provide a new understanding of the shelf ice of the Pine Island glacier and of the general impact that melting ice shelves are likely to have on the planet. “What we have found is that the ocean is getting underneath the shelf ice at Pine Island and that the sea water is clearly getting warmer,” Smith says. “It is melting the ice from below and at a rate that is increasing over the years.” In addition, other researchers have noted that winds are becoming more intense in the Antarctic. These are now churning up the warmer water round the coast of Antarctica and are driving it into the ice. Again, the effect is to melt the ice and break it up, destabilising the glaciers above. These combined factors have produced dramatic changes: ice loss at the Pine Island glacier has increased by more than 50% in recent years, with the result that the glacier is beginning to roll down at a faster and faster rate into the ocean. “In the past, ice that melted in the sea is balanced by new ice that formed, from fallen snow, at the top of the glacier, high on the Antarctic plateau,” says Smith. “But now it is becoming noticeable that the glacier is out of balance. More ice is being lost at the bottom than can be replaced at the top and this is causing the glacier to slide faster and faster into the sea. The Pine Island glacier is being eaten from the base, by warming waters.” But what is really extraordinary is the global impact of this melting ice. As a result of the colossal influx of meltwater from the Pine Island glacier, about 1.5mm is being added to global sea levels every decade. “Of all the glaciers in the world, none of them are losing more ice than the Pine Island and none of them are contributing more to sea level rises,” adds Smith. It is a sobering thought. The worrying example of Pine Island suggests there could be enough loss of shelf ice in the Antarctic to produce several metres of sea rise over the next few decades, while if all the ice on Antarctica and Greenland were to turn to water, Earth’s oceans would rise by a catastrophic 60 metres or more, drowning most of the world’s major cities. Fortunately, there is little prospect of such a continent-wide melting and consequent inundation occurring – at least not this century. But with coastal communities the world over already experiencing unprecedented flooding, that’s cold comfort indeed."
"Since the turn of the century, the Earth’s climate has continued to accumulate heat at a rate equivalent to more than 4 atomic bomb detonations per second. During that time, the warming rate of the Earth’s surface temperatures (which represent about 1–2% of the overall warming of the Earth’s climate) has slowed somewhat. That surface warming slowdown has been inaccurately named ‘the pause,’ and has been the basis of arguments that we needn’t worry about climate change. In reality, there’s no statistical evidence that we’ve deviated from the long-term surface warming trend observed over the past 40–50 years. Stefan Rahmstorf, who has researched recent global surface temperature changes, told me,  There is no change in the global warming trend. We’re just looking at random variability around a steady warming trend. And this random variability has been there all along, it’s not a recent change. There’s also no evidence that our expectations of future global warming are inaccurate. For example, a paper published in Nature Climate Change last week by a team from the University of New South Wales led by Matthew England showed that climate models that accurately captured the surface warming slowdown (dark red & blue in the figure below) project essentially the same amount of warming by the end of the century as those that didn’t (lighter red & blue). There’s also been substantial climate research examining the causes behind the short-term surface warming slowdown. Essentially it boils down to a combination of natural variability storing more heat in the deep oceans, and an increase in volcanic activity combined with a decrease in solar activity. These are all temporary effects that won’t last. In fact, we may already be at the cusp of an acceleration in surface warming, with 2014 being a record-hot year and 2015 on pace to break the record yet again. However, contrarians have pounced on the slowdown to support the case for climate inaction. For example, Christopher Monckton, Willie Soon, David Legates, and William Briggs published a paper in a Chinese journal Science Bulletin using an “irreducibly simple climate model” to claim that “combustion of all recoverable fossil fuels will cause < 2.2 K global warming to equilibrium.” If that were true, we could continue burning fossil fuels with little concern about dangerous climate consequences. Their argument was based on the false premise that climate models have badly overestimated global warming by failing to reproduce the surface warming slowdown. However, Science Bulletin has accepted a paper detailing the errors in Monckton et al. authored by myself, John Abraham, and our colleagues. We identified a litany of mistakes in their paper, including an exaggeration of the discrepancy between model projections and recent temperature observations; a subject detailed in my recently-published book and our Denial101x course. Monckton et al. then created a model based on how electronic circuits are designed, rather than on the physics and chemistry of the Earth’s climate. They effectively used circular logic, showing that the climate is insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect by using a model that assumed the climate is insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect. As my colleagues and I show in our paper, mainstream climate models reproduce observed temperature changes much more accurately than the Monckton et al. model. Similarly, in her recent testimony before the US House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology, contrarian climate scientist Judith Curry cited the “hiatus in global warming since 1998” and claimed “climate models predict much more warming than has been observed in the early 21st century” to cast doubt on human-caused global warming and associated threats and policy solutions.  As climate scientist Michael Mann and I recently wrote, the ‘pause’ has become more of a political issue than a scientific one. All evidence indicates that the causes of the surface warming slowdown are temporary, that the Earth is still accumulating heat at an exceptionally rapid rate, and that surface warming will soon accelerate. Although they don’t yet capture short-term variability accurately, we have no reason to doubt climate models’ long-term global warming projections, which are dominated by the growing global energy imbalance caused by the increasing greenhouse effect. Arguments against the need to take immediate action to curb global warming are unsound, both scientifically and from a risk management perspective. There’s always a chance that future climate change won’t be as bad as experts currently think, but there’s also a chance it will be worse than expected.  If we fail to minimize the risks associated with future climate change impacts, especially given the scientifically flimsy arguments against taking action, future generations won’t praise us for our rosy optimism."
"Christine Milne was a secondary school teacher in the early 1980s when the proposal to dam the Franklin River in Tasmania spurred her to change tack and become an environmental activist. A born and bred Tasmanian, and self-confessed “farm girl”, Milne was instrumental in the ultimately successful blockade of the dam, though the protest saw her jailed for three days. “I thought, if that’s the worst they can do to you in Tasmania, then I’m up for it. From that time on there was no looking back for me as an activist,” Milne told the Monthly in 2008. A few years after her brief imprisonment, Milne became the face of the opposition to a new pulp mill being built in her hometown of Wesley Vale in north-western Tasmania. She had led an alliance of concerned community members to contest the pulp mill, and public outcry over the proposal ultimately led its foreign backers to cancel construction. The pulp mill and dam became a major political issues for Tasmania, and prompted federal discussion. Milne was elected to the Tasmanian parliament in 1989, off the back of her successful conservation campaigns. The Greens held five seats in the state parliament after the 1989 election, giving them the balance of power and thrusting environmental issues into the spotlight. Milne became leader of the Tasmanian Greens in 1993 when the founder of the party, Bob Brown, left state politics to pursue a federal Senate seat. She presided over a loose alliance between Labor and the Greens in the state, and pursued a number of social reforms, including gay rights, gun control and an apology to the stolen generations of Indigenous Australians. Milne told Guardian Australia earlier this year of her joy in being able to take part in the movement to end Tasmania’s draconian anti-homosexuality laws. She continued to push for gay rights, most notably same-sex marriage, at a federal level after winning a Senate seat in 2004.  But it was the party’s policies on climate change following the 2010 federal election, and after Milne took on the federal leadership in 2012, that caused the most contention. Milne won re-election to the Senate in 2010, when the Greens achieved a massive swing towards them. The party’s first elected House of Representatives MP, Adam Bandt, helped Labor deliver minority government. The party was criticised for shooting down the Rudd government’s emissions trading scheme and then going on to back then prime minister Julia Gillard’s carbon pricing scheme, after winning funding for renewables through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Climate Change Authority. Milne has vociferously rejected the lowering of the renewable energy target (RET), saying the target must remain high to end the dominance of fossil fuels. But perhaps her most contentious decision as leader has been to block the rise of the fuel excise, citing the party’s opposition to funnelling cash made from the measure to the building of new roads. “It is a difficult issue for us because we want to see people using less polluting fuels, but if we facilitate this we will see more and more money going into roads with more cars on them,” she said in June last year. Senior government ministers have called on the Greens to reconsider its position on raising the excise after hearing news of Milne’s departure on Wednesday. Milne cited family reasons, particularly the fact she is about to become a first-time grandmother, as her reasons for leaving politics."
"Record carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere were reported worldwide in March, in what scientists said marked a significant milestone for global warming. Figures released by the US science agency Noaa on Wednesday show that for the first time since records began, the parts per million (ppm) of CO2 in the atmosphere were over 400 globally for a month. The measure is the key indicator of the amount of planet-warming gases man is putting into the atmosphere at record rates, and the current concentrations are unprecedented in millions of years.  The new global record follows the breaking of the 400ppm CO2 threshold in some local areas in 2012 and 2013, and comes nearly three decades after what is considered the ‘safe’ level of 350ppm was passed. “Reaching 400ppm as a global average is a significant milestone,” said Pieter Tans, lead scientist on Noaa’s greenhouse gas network.  “This marks the fact that humans burning fossil fuels have caused global carbon dioxide concentrations to rise more than 120ppm since pre-industrial times,” added Tans. “Half of that rise has occurred since 1980.”  World leaders are due to meet in Paris for a UN climate summit later this year in an attempt to reach agreement on cutting countries’ carbon emissions to avoid dangerous global warming. Dr Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading told the Guardian: “This event is a milestone on a road to unprecedented climate change for the human race. The last time the Earth had this much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was more than a million years ago, when modern humans hadn’t even evolved yet.  “Reaching 400ppm doesn’t mean much in itself, but the steady increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases should serve as a stark reminder of the task facing politicians as they sit down in Paris later this year.” Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants stalled for the first time last year without the influence of a strict economic recession, according to the International Energy Agency, an influential thinktank.  Nick Nuttall, a spokesman for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which oversees the international climate negotiations, said: “These numbers underline the urgency of nations delivering a decisive new universal agreement in Paris in December – one that marks a serious and significant departure from the past. “The agreement and the decisions surrounding it needs to be a long term development plan providing the policies, pathways and finance for triggering a peaking of global emissions in 10 years’ time followed by a deep, decarbonisation of the global economy by the second half of the century.” But even if manmade emissions were dramatically cut much deeper than most countries are planning, the concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere would only stabilise, not fall, scientists said. James Butler, director of Noaa’s global monitoring division, said: “Elimination of about 80% of fossil fuel emissions would essentially stop the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but concentrations of carbon dioxide would not start decreasing until even further reductions are made and then it would only do so slowly.” Concentrations of CO2 were at 400.83ppm in March compared to 398.10ppm in March 2014, the preliminary Noaa data showed. They are are expected to stay above 400pm during May, when levels peak because of CO2 being taken up by plants growing in the northern hemisphere. Noaa used air samples taken from 40 sites worldwide, and analysed them at its centre in Boulder, Colorado. The agency added that the average growth rate in concentrations was 2.25ppm per year from 2012-2014, the highest ever recorded for three consecutive years."
"There is a shift underway in international climate policy. The top-down approach to mitigating climate change that has guided policy since 1992 is slowly being replaced by a bottom-up model. The focus is no longer on meeting a global climate stabilization target of 2°C, or on establishing a legally binding carbon budget. The negotiations on a global agreement to be concluded in Paris in December will instead focus on voluntary mitigation commitments. It is already clear that the aggregated contributions will be nowhere near adequate to maintain the 2°C target. This shift in public policy has consequences for the scientific community. Ideally, expert knowledge for policymakers has to meet two conflicting standards at once: it must be scientifically sound and politically viable. If expert advisers want to maintain their close working relationship with countries at the forefront of international climate policy, they will have to provide more pragmatic policy evaluations and recommendations. At the same time, advisers face a growing need to carefully consider the long-term consistency of their recommendations.   The two main camps of researchers providing expert advice on climate policy — natural scientists and economists — are being affected by this shift in rather different ways. For natural scientists, the situation looks relatively good. The basic concept of anthropogenic climate change is now generally accepted worldwide, despite the persistence of some denial in countries like the US, UK and Australia. For a while now, the central question in the global debate has not been whether climate change is happening, but how, to what extent, and at what rate. This might eventually lead to a depoliticisation of scientific research, which will allow scientific uncertainties to be discussed again in a more dispassionate way. But how will natural scientists react to the growing political pragmatism? If it becomes increasingly obvious that climate policy is not derived from a global stabilization target, scientists will be forced to choose between two equally inconvenient options. They could vigorously defend their original concept of planetary boundaries and global thresholds, which would be met with increasing dissatisfaction by politicians, policymakers, and public funding agencies. Or they could soften their stance on an exact threshold to ‘dangerous climate change’, perhaps by allowing for temporary temperature overshoot or even higher stabilization targets.  The situation is even more complicated for climate economists, whose importance has grown steadily since the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report in 2007. By developing models to calculate global emissions scenarios, economists have taken a position at the forefront of the climate debate. Correspondingly, during the work on IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, it was Working Group III (Mitigation) where governments’ line-by-line approval of the ‘Summary for Policymakers’ proved most contentious.  Climate economists are not only entrusted with the authority to say which measures should be taken to reach climate targets with minimized costs, but as global emissions continue to rise, policymakers confer to them the uncomfortable task of saying which international climate objectives are still feasible. A good example of the dilemma scientific policy advisers are facing is the concept of the emissions budget. The later the global emissions peak is reached, and the higher that peak is, the greater subsequent annual reduction rates will have to be in order to stay within the remaining budget. But what if policymakers do not comply? Again, advisers face two equally unappealing options. They can either become less policy-relevant or more pragmatic. Economists could stick to rigorous calculations and distance themselves from the policy process by declaring that it is no longer possible to stay within a 2°C compatible carbon budget. But since funding agencies continue to generously reward policy optimism, and since the global climate community still tends to believe that abandoning the 2°C target will lead to a sense of fatalism, climate economists have so far chosen a more pragmatic path. This has led to a paradoxical situation. With each year of increasing emissions, the assumptions economists make about the transformative capacity of the global economy look more optimistic — and less plausible.  The usual way in which climate economists have managed to get around make-or-break points for the 2°C target is by calculating in significant amounts of ‘negative emissions’ — the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere during the second half of this century. Most models assume this can be achieved using a combination of approaches known as BECCS: bioenergy (which would require 500 million hectares of land – 1.5 times the size of India) plus carbon capture and storage (CCS). This approach, which allows making up for missed emissions reductions at a later stage, underscores climate economists’ political acumen. In national political arenas it is common to factor in the option of debt when developing fiscal budgets. Negative emissions allow us to overshoot the carbon budget by establishing ‘carbon debt’, to be paid back later in the century – at least that is the hope. Unsurprisingly, policymakers show little inclination to discuss a potentially controversial technology that would require extra land use which equates to almost half of today’s arable land worldwide. Decision makers are delighted to hear that despite 25 years of dramatically increasing emissions the 2°C target is still theoretically within reach. But they ignore the fine print, and the IPCC makes it much too easy for them to do so given the enormous complexity of the issue — even in its summaries for policymakers. For the past two decades, there has been an increasing discrepancy between climate policy intentions and the reality of rising emissions. While some degree of nonchalance regarding inconsistencies in talk, decisions, and actions is part of everyday life for politicians and diplomats, this is an attitude that has put scientific policy advisers in a difficult position, and one that is creating a sense of growing unease among climate scientists.  Yet the central theme of the climate policy narrative—and the one currently upheld by mainstream scientific advisers — has remained the same: “Time is running out, but we can still make it if we start to act now”. This statement is incompatible with the principle of scientific consistency. When scientific policy advisers fall back on this mantra, they are reaffirming their established working relationship with climate policy pioneers like the EU. But in doing so, they are also effectively glossing over two decades of climate policy inaction. It is by no means the task of advisers to spread optimism about the future achievements of climate policy. Instead, they should critically analyze the risks and benefits of political efforts and contribute empirically sound – and sometimes unwelcome – perspectives to the climate policy discourse. For some time now, responsibility for successfully addressing the climate problem has rested in the hands of governments. Valuable scientific knowledge will remain an important factor going forward, but it will by no means be the decisive factor. To start taking effective action, politicians and policymakers already know more than enough.

"Climate change campaigners reacted with disappointment as Edinburgh University announced on Tuesday that it would not fully divest from fossil fuels. Students lay down in protest on the steps of the building where senior vice principal Professor Charlie Jeffery set out the unanimous decision by the university’s court.  Insisting that the university was committed to a change of investment policy, Jeffery said: “Our commitment is to engage before divestment, but the expectation is that we will bring about change by engagement.” Outlining what is essentially a company-by-company approach, Jeffery explained that the university would divest from companies involved in the extraction of coal and tar sands, only where feasible alternative sources of energy exist, and where companies do not invest in low carbon technologies. The university was unable to specify what percentage of its investments are in those companies specifically, although 8-9% are accounted for by companies involved in fossil fuels extraction more generally. Edinburgh’s endowment is worth £291m – the third biggest of any UK university, behind Oxford and Cambridge. Arguing that the university did not see its choice as “limited to no change or pulling out of all investment in the sector”, Jeffery said that the matter was “not a black and white issue of the world against fossil fuels companies”. He also confirmed that one of the reasons why the university did not choose full divestment was because it could represent an “undue incursion into academic freedom” in terms of research into geological and engineering issues involved in the exploration of fossil fuels. Kirsty Haigh, student campaigner with Edinburgh People & Planet, said that the university was ignoring staff and student support for divestment.   Haigh said: “Despite the university’s public consultation showing overwhelming support for fossil fuel divestment, the university has put money before climate science. Heads of the School of Engineering, in the pockets of the fossil fuel industry, have been scaremongering throughout the process. Departments funded by the industry were over-represented on the investment advisory committee, whilst some schools had no representation whatsoever.” However, Jeffery dismissed last year’s consultation process, saying it was “not a mandate”. WWF Scotland director Lang Banks insisted: “If it’s not prepared to divest yet, then it is vital that the university follow through on its promise to invest more in low-carbon technologies and become more engaged with those it invests in”. Friends of the Earth Scotland finance campaigner Ric Lander accused Edinburgh University of missing a clear opportuity to take a moral lead, adding: “The university appears content to have its money invested in the world’s most polluting companies including Shell, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. These companies are oil drilling in the Arctic and mining coal in virgin rainforest. Any investment policy which continues to allow investment in such irresponsible companies is not fit for purpose.” Dr Simon Lewis, reader in Global Change Science at UCL, told the Guardian that he was surprised at the “total lack of urgency” in Edinburgh’s proposals. “It doesn’t seem that Edinburgh University has provided any evidence that engagement is any better way to go than divestment. The question is why they think that a continuation of the current strategy is preferable. If they haven’t been trying to engage these companies over the past two decades then what have they been doing?”   Asked whether the university had been influenced by Glasgow University’s decision to divest from fossil fuels last November, Jeffery replied: “We quickly came to the conclusion that we would define the issue in our way. In a sense Glasgow’s decision was not something we were paying attention to because we were applying our own values and criteria.” Prof Paul Younger, Rankine chair of engineering and professor of energy engineering, University of Glasgow, said “Having been plunged involuntarily into the midst of the fossil fuel divestment debate when my own institution ploughed ahead with a simplistic commitment to divest from fossil fuels, as if all are equally damaging to the climate and as if simple alternatives exist for all their uses, it is refreshing to see the University of Edinburgh propose a policy that is consistent both with ethical principles and with what is technically feasible.” Author and founder of 350.0rg Bill McKibben described Edinburgh’s decision as sad, saying: “With time for action on climate change so short we need leaders, not laggards. But spirited campaigners will keep making the case, and the temperature will keep rising, and eventually this university will join so many others in doing the right thing.” "

May I shuffle forward and tell you the two minute life of rain Starting right now lips open and lidless-cold all-seeing gaze  When something not yet anything changes its mind like me And begins to fall In the small hours And the light is still a flying carpet Only a little white between worlds like an eye opening after an operation No turning backeach drop is a snap decision A suicide from the tower-block of heaven And for the next ten secondsThe rain stares at the ground Sees me stirring hereAs if sculpted in porridge Sees the garden in the green of its mind already drinking And the grass lengthening Stalls ... Maybe a thousand feet above meA kind of yellowness or levityLike those tiny alterations that brush the legs of swimmersLifts the rain a little to the left No more than a flash of free-willUntil the clouds close their options and the whole melancholy air surrenders to pure fear and ... falls And I who live in the basementone level down from the worldwith my eyes to the insects with my ears to the roots listening I feel them in my bones these dead straight linesComing closer and closer to my core This is the sound this is the very floorWhere Grief and his Wife are living looking up
"How universities invest their endowment funds is not normally headline news. But universities have found themselves in an unaccustomed spotlight over the last few months as student campaigners have called on them to withdraw their investments from companies involved in the extraction of fossil fuels. That spotlight can feel harsh when media debate takes an easy, black and white line: are they divesting, or are they not?  When we looked at this over the last few months at the University of Edinburgh we found it to be a little more complicated than that. Following a request by our students’ union leadership we convened a Fossil Fuels Review Group to look into the issue and make recommendations which the University this week accepted. We learnt from others’ experiences, making sure that perspectives from different sides of the debate were part of the group: the students union, specialists both in climate change and in the extraction of fossil fuels, experts in finance and investment. We also thought about how the University in all its activities – not just its investments – engaged both with climate change and its mitigation, and with the exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels.    There wasn’t much that was black and white beyond a fundamental agreement that human activity, and as a large part of that the burning of fossil fuels for energy, was driving climate change. But that was not all we considered about fossil fuels. We also asked about other uses of fossil fuels alongside energy generation, among them the production of fertilisers, plastics and steel. Energy, fertilisers, plastics and steel are basics of everyday life. So we asked whether feasible alternatives were available. The answer was yes for electricity generation, heating and short-distance travel, but no for pretty much everything else. And that ‘yes’ only fully applied in the developed world. In much of the developing world there are no currently feasible alternatives to fossil fuels that can ensure power for basic needs, such as heating, clean water and refrigeration. So one of our concerns was what many politely call ‘climate justice’ but can be put more bluntly as the easy privilege of the developed world in calling for an end to fossil fuel use after we have used them for centuries to ensure the supply of our basic needs and power our economic growth. Another was to focus on emissions. We made three points. First, different fossil fuels emit different levels of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Some do more damage to the environment than others. Second, new technologies, such as carbon capture and storage are designed to prevent those emissions from reaching the atmosphere – if we perfect these then we have the prospect of breaking the causal link between burning fossil fuels, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change. And third, there is an emissions ‘chain’. Burning fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases as a consequence of our demand for the energy they release so we can run industries, power lecture theatres or produce newspapers. Reducing that demand wherever it occurs reduces emissions. Another concern was to think of what the University does in its research and teaching. We want to help tackle major global challenges, including climate change. A large and growing part of our research and teaching portfolio is on climate change and its mitigation through behavioural change, renewable energy and carbon capture technologies. We also research and teach on fossil fuels, and students graduate to work in fossil fuel companies. Importantly, fossil fuel research and carbon capture research intersect, grounded in the same geological and engineering science. Not much black and white here. Drawing on these reflections we produced a set of recommendations which will now be taken forward. Two stand out. One is to withdraw investment from companies involved in coal and tar sands subject to two conditions. We will withdraw if the markets they serve have feasible alternative energy sources (which may not be the case in much of the developing world). And we will withdraw if they are not also investing in technologies that tackle their emissions. The second recommendation reaches beyond the fossil fuels sector and applies to any company we invest in. It is now increasingly common for companies to report their emissions, and investment products are emerging which focus on companies that are ‘best in class’ for emissions performance in their sector. We will require companies we invest in to disclose their emissions if they don’t already and to move up their sector league table. If change doesn’t happen we will look to take advantage of the new kinds of low-emissions investment product that have entered the market. It is easy to portray recommendations like these as adversarial, ‘us’ the investors versus ‘them’ the companies. We don’t see it like that. We will engage with companies to discuss and – we hope – bring about the changes we want. We will not withdraw investment without prior engagement. And we will continue to work with companies in the fossil fuels sector and beyond to develop the research programmes and through them the technology that limits emissions and opens up alternative energy sources in all parts of the world, not just the rich west. We know that not all will agree with our chosen way forward. But this is not an exercise in pleasing one constituency over another or grabbing headlines. It is about taking a measured, balanced approach to a complex, multi-layered issue, and coming up with a solution which most closely chimes with our values as a university.

"In a voicemail on Tuesday, Dutch researcher Marc Cornelissen, founder of Cold Facts, an organization supporting scientific research in polar regions, laughed at his predicament. He explained that unexpectedly warm weather had forced him and fellow explorer Philip de Roo to complete that afternoon’s skiing in the Canadian Arctic in their underwear.  “I’m glad you guys don’t have pictures of us on the ice,” he said with a chuckle. “But it was the only way to deal with the heat.”  The same heat had also contributed to melting the sea ice near Bathurst Island, the researchers’ ultimate destination. In his voicemail, Cornelissen said the pair might have to take a detour to the north as there seemed to be thin ice ahead of them.  That message turned out to be tragically prescient. The next day, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Resolute Bay received an emergency distress message from the team, approximately 200 km south of Bathurst Island. A pilot flying over the area spotted the pair’s equipment in an area with poor ice conditions and open water. Their sled dog was found sitting on the ice nearby.  No further traces of the explorers were found. On Friday, police called off the search. Collaborating with other scientists working in the region, the police are attempting to use any available information about the area, as well as recent satellite images from Nasa and the European Space Agency, to try to recover the bodies. So far, the mission has been hindered by the same poor ice conditions that apparently proved fatal for the Dutch explorers.  Cornelissen and de Roo departed Resolute Bay for Bathurst Island on 6 April as part of the Last Ice Survey expedition, with the goal of exploring and researching an area known as the Last Ice Area. Both were experienced polar explorers and researchers.  In addition to his work with Cold Facts, de Roo traveled to Antarctica in 2000 to conduct climate research on behalf of the World Wide Fund for Nature.  Climate and sea ice models have indicated that the region in the high Arctic of Canada and Greenland, where Cornelissen and de Roo were gathering data, will be the last stronghold of summer sea ice as the planet continues to warm.  “We think we see thin ice in front of us, which is quite interesting, and we’re going to research some of that if we can,” Cornelissen said in his last message.  Models have projected that summer sea ice will remain there through 2050. Ice researchers in the area hope to determine whether those predictions will bear out. Meanwhile, the World Wildlife Fund is spearheading an effort to launch a sea ice management program in the area to protect the ice for polar bears.  The type of thin ice Cornelissen and de Roo encountered could be an obstacle to that effort. According to Stephanie Pfirman, an environmental science professor at Barnard College, the latest research brief on the area indicates the region has “less and less of the thick, old ice that persisted from one year to the next. Because the ice is thinner, it is easier to melt all the way through, making it more vulnerable to future warming”. Canada’s Arctic ice has been melting at a rapid rate since 2005, according to a 2014 memo from the country’s environmental agency, Natural Resources Canada. The National Research Council presented a report earlier this month that backed up this research.  “The Arctic is warming faster than just about any place on Earth,” Pfirman said in a conference call about the report. “And the Arctic winters are much milder than they were in the past.” Cold Facts’ mission has been to gather data in the world’s polar regions to feed into various ongoing research projects, and information from this expedition would have contributed to the work of scientists studying the rapid melting of the Arctic. “We feed data into existing research activities and do not aspire to be a research program in itself,” the group’s website explains.   Sadly, gathering further data on the rapidly deteriorating Arctic seems to have cost de Roo and Cornelissen their lives.  Marielle Feenstra, a spokeswoman for Cold Facts, said the organization would keep the public informed on the progress of the recovery mission, and that it plans to continue the work Cornelissen and de Roo started.

"Next year, the International Union of Geological Sciences will report on the outcome of one of the biggest scientific debates of our time: whether the Earth has entered a new geological epoch. For the last 10,000 years – a period that has seen the birth and flourishing of human civilisation – we have been living through the Holocene epoch. But there is an emerging consensus that this epoch may now be over, superseded by a new age: the Anthropocene. The age of humans. The reason for this change is stark: our actions – colonialism, global trade, and coal – have had such a huge and decisive impact on the Earth that humans have become a geological force in their own right. But the destructive reality of this new epoch has only really hit home in the last half century. Since 1950 we have seen an unprecedented global rise in the human population, accelerating extinction and climate change, urbanisation and industrialisation and the development of novel materials from persistent organic pollutants to genetically engineered organisms. Extinction rates are currently running at between 100 and 1,000 times the natural level. Even nuclear bomb tests have left their radioactive traces in tree-rings.  Today, we humans are eating away at our own life support systems at an unprecedented rate. What’s more, we are living in turbulent political times across the globe. Politics is broken and business-as-usual is taking us in the wrong direction. But what can be done? Escaping old ideas, as Keynes said, is difficult. When ideas and concepts that benefit or represent one powerful group of people at the expense of the majority are universalised, they become the norms that shape our thinking: they become what’s ‘common sense’ and ‘natural’. We end up accepting a simplistic and beguiling mantra: more growth, more profits, more stuff. And, with it, the consequences: more climate change, more chaos, more extinction, more inequality. Create enough zeroes in the right places and you can make a desert and still call it progress. Meanwhile, the real stuff of life – the quality of the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe and the landscapes we live in – is often dismissed as the niche concerns of naïve and privileged idealists. This is where we are now. Such distorted priorities have led us directly to the current destructive system. But we are conscious agents of the current destruction, and in that consciousness lies hope for the future. We know the damage we are doing, and we know we should and can do things differently. The challenge is to agree on how to use our powers for the common good. We need a broad and deep change to the current economic and political paradigm. We need to challenge those old values and develop new ones more appropriate for living in the Anthropocene – values that support conscious, active stewardship in an interlinked world. This in turn will depend on the mobilisation and empowerment of people across the world. We need a society in which government is answerable to people and corporations are answerable to government. That society is not going to build itself from above. The Arab Spring and the Occupy movements may have faded after their huge initial impacts, but ‘we are the 99%’ has become a rallying cry on almost every continent. But why is social change fundamental to tackling issues, such as climate change? Climate change is not about diplomacy or energy or capital or economics. Climate change, like many other important issues, is about power. A new energy system means new power relations. The resources required to rapidly move away from fossil fuels and prepare for the coming heavy weather could pull huge swathes of humanity out of poverty, providing services now sorely lacking, from clean water to electricity, and with a political model that is more democratic and less centralised than the models of the past. This is a vision of the future that goes beyond just surviving or enduring climate change, beyond ‘mitigating’ and ‘adapting’ to it, in the grim language of the United Nations. It is a vision in which we collectively use the crisis to leap somewhere better than where we are right now. We know how we can prevent the worst of climate change, rejuvenate soils, protect fish stocks. We know how we can create a more just society, how to build a better education system, give people clean water, provide human rights for all. These are not mysteries. We have the technology and the ability and the knowledge. What we are lacking is the will to make real political and social change. The only thing that will instigate that change is if enough of us are willing and have the courage to act together to build a more sustainable world. We must create more visionary global institutions to tackle climate change and the wider environmental crisis. Only a global agreement that provides an effective mechanism for sharing the costs of reducing emissions fairly between the world’s countries – as well as cushioning the most vulnerable against the climate impacts that are already inevitable – will work. And that will only happen if we make it happen from the ground up. Our planet may be the only place in the universe where life exists. It is a precious thing, and it must be protected and nurtured, not torn apart for the short-term gain of a few. Humans are a force of nature, but we are a conscious force and we can use our power for good. We are not spectators, we are players, and we can shape the game, all of us together. It is time for all of us to see humanity for what it is: as a single species, interdependent on other species and the one, finite and beautiful planet we live on. • Read the full version of this manifesto"

"Julie Bishop has defended her appointment of the Danish climate contrarian Bjørn Lomborg to her foreign aid innovation group, saying she wants people who can “think outside the square” and challenge the status quo. The InnovationXchange was announced last month to harness “the expertise, creativity and networks of global leaders in business, civil society, philanthropy and academia, to drive innovation across Australia’s aid program”.  The foreign minister said Lomborg was just one of 14 eminent members on the international reference group. “I want people to think outside the square, I don’t want everybody to sit around and agree with each other,” she said. Last month the Guardian revealed Lomborg had been given $4m by the Abbott government to set up the Australian consensus centre at the University of Western Australia. But the decision was met by opposition from UWA academics, some of whom have demanded the university break its agreement with the government to establish the $13m centre.  Bishop said while she had not been involved in the decision to give money to Lomborg’s consensus centre, she thought it was a good idea. “You don’t want a groupthink approach,” she said. “Universities are incubators for ideas and challenging norms and challenging the status quo. So I think it sounds like a very good idea.” She said the InnovationXchange would consider “seemingly intractable aid problems” that have not been resolved in spite of billions of aid dollars.  “Bjørn Lomborg is an economist and he has written and spoken on numerous occasions internationally about the way to approach the delivery of foreign aid,” she said. “His name was suggested to me by a number of eminent people and I was delighted that he accepted. But he’s one of about 14 people who will be on a board and I want different ideas.” Bishop said although Australia had invested billions of dollars through the foreign aid budget in the region, the development indices in areas such as maternal health and infant mortality were going backwards. “We can’t continue to spend billions of dollars and get worse outcomes,” she said. “So I selected a group of people that I know challenge orthodoxy, challenge the status quo. Come up with different ideas.”"
"The Marshall Islands, the world’s third largest shipping registry,may stop registering oil rigs because of climate change, according to the Pacific nation’s foreign minister Tony de Brum. The minister has advocated on the international stage for the survival of his islands, which are already suffering the effects of global warming. But he admitted that the 183 drill ships and platforms that reportedly sail under the Marshallese ensign were an uncomfortable reality as one of the tiny nation’s major sources of income. “We are aware of oil companies financing platforms that are registered by our ship’s registry. We were very rudely awakened to this fact by the Deepwater Horizon issue in the Gulf [of Mexico] and in recent times by Greenpeace trying to mount our Marshallese registered platform,” he said.  In April, six activists climbed aboard a Shell operated rig bound for the Arctic to recommence the oil giant’s drilling programme in the far north. Greenpeace have called on the Marshall Islands to cease registering the vehicles of extraction. De Brum said that his government may consider rejecting oil rig registrations, but the act would be useless in isolation and would only damage a business worth $5m each year, 2.5% of the country’s GDP. “That may very well be a political decision made by our cabinet, that we will no longer register oil rigs. If that’s the case we want to make sure that they don’t just go register elsewhere and do the same thing. This exercise should have some positive result and the best way to do that is get everybody involved,” said De Brum. “While we are in agreement that there must be divestment, we have to take into account the dependence of the country on the amount we earn from our ship registry. And the fact that, if we drop a platform, it merely goes on to Panama or Nigeria and does the same thing.” On Monday, the US government decided to allow Shell’s Marshallese-registered oil rig to proceed with drilling in Arctic waters. De Brum said the decision was inconsistent with president Barack Obama’s proactive rhetoric on climate change. “It’s not easy when the United States is our main development partner and our closest ally and they are talking about keeping it [fossil fuels] in the ground and issuing permits for people to go dig it up,” he said. De Brum was in London on Wednesday to lobby the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to set carbon emissions targets for the shipping industry. He said an international agreement within the sector was the only way to control a massive source of greenhouse gases that remains exempt from mainstream climate talks and to coordinate flag states to block the registration of the most polluting vessels. Shipping causes about 3% of annual global emissions, roughly the same as aviation. Yet both sectors operate beyond the control or ambition of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the body that oversees international climate negotiations. The IMO predicts the sector’s emissions could grow by between 50% and 250% by 2050. De Brum said this was a major threat to the world’s climate targets. “People have criticised us for being a small country with a big mouth when it comes to climate change, but we are also the third-largest ship registry in the world, so we do have a mandate,” said De Brum, whose country looks set to become the second biggest registry when it overtakes Liberia in 2016. One in 10 vessels worldwide sail underneath the Marshallese flag. People used to say that the sun never set on the British empire, said de Brum, “but now we say the sun never sets on the Marshall Islands shipping registry.” De Brum’s call was backed by the EU on Wednesday, who have also argued for targets to be put in place for shipping emissions. But a source within the IMO told the Guardian that it was unlikely the organisation would act at all before the Paris climate conference in December – which will set the tone for global emissions reductions.  The IMO has been stalled over introducing a global measuring system for shipping emissions, so a target is likely to prove difficult. The IMO is dominated by industry – De Brum is the first minister of a state member to address the IMO’s environment committee – and each member commands one vote, meaning the size of the registry makes little difference in adopting new programmes. Looking to the UNFCCC meeting in Paris, De Brum said the most important “outcome of Paris for us is confidence that we will exist ... And existence for us right now is less than 2C [of global warming]. Everybody’s now beginning to talk about 3.5C or 4C, anything over 2C is finished for us. And it’s not finished at the turn of the century, its finished now. Because we are already displacing people due to climate change in the Marshalls, in Kiribati, in Tuvalu.” These atoll nations are exceptionally vulnerable to climate change. Their highest points are only a few metre above sea level, and inundations and large storms are becoming an increasing threat to their survival as viable, liveable countries. “Our development partners talk about installing warning systems for tidal waves and big storms. So the siren goes off and then what do you do? You grab your rosary and your surfboard. That’s what you do. Where are you going to run?,” he said."
"You may not realise it from the UK general election campaign, but this is a crucial year for the global battle against climate change. Governments are increasing their efforts to secure a new international agreement at the United Nations summit in Paris in December to avoid a dangerous rise in global average temperature. A strong treaty is still possible, but, while there is recognition that rising greenhouse gas levels are creating a problem, there is still not enough understanding of the scale of the action required, or the opportunities that a transition to a low-carbon economy offer for growth and poverty reduction. There is mounting evidence across the world of the growing impacts of climate change. Last year was the warmest on record globally, with 13 of the 14 hottest years now having occurred since 2000. And the period between January and March 2015 has been hotter than any other year.  In the UK, 2014 was our warmest year, with the eight warmest years all having taken place since the start of the new millennium. Because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water, we are also experiencing heavier rainfall. The winter of 2013-14, during which there was devastating flooding in many parts of the country, was the wettest we have ever seen. More frequent and severe extreme weather, rising sea levels and acidifying oceans are already posing threats to homes and businesses across the world, yet global average temperature has only risen by less than one centigrade degree. Over the next few decades, climate change will intensify further as the Earth’s atmosphere, land and oceans adjust gradually to current levels of greenhouse gases, and we will have to adapt. But the state of the climate in the second half of this century and beyond will depend on decisions we make this year. Delay and inaction on emissions will be dangerous. If we fail to put the world on a path towards low-carbon economic growth and development, the lives and livelihoods of billions of people will be at risk, as global temperature rises beyond anything the Earth has experienced over the past few million years. That is why governments agreed in 2010 in Cancún, Mexico, that global warming of more than two degrees would be unacceptably dangerous. This figure was chosen because research shows that if the climate warms by more than two degrees, it may unleash a series of unstoppable processes – such as the melting of polar ice sheets, the death of the Amazon rainforest and a release of carbon from global soils – that would lead to a further acceleration of warming. But so far, countries have not committed to the emissions reductions required to give a good chance of preventing temperatures from exceeding that limit. So during the past few years, governments have been engaged in detailed negotiations over a new agreement that can achieve that limit. Last December, in Lima, Peru, they reached a collective decision to put forward before the Paris meeting their pledges for action after 2020. So far, 35 countries have submitted so-called “intended nationally determined contributions”, including the 28 member states of the European Union and the US. In addition, China has pledged to slow the growth of its annual emissions to reach a peak no later than 2030. When the actions of China, the US and the EU are put together, and combined with assumptions about other countries’ plans, they suggest that the annual global output of greenhouse gases from human activities in 2030 should be much lower than would be the case under a scenario of unchecked emissions. But these pledges are still far above what would be consistent with an emissions pathway that would offer a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to no more than two centigrade degrees. This “gap” does not mean the Paris summit is already a failure. The commitments by China, the US and the EU can be delivered through their domestic policies, and legal and administrative structures. And there is a track record; they are likely to deliver on their commitments on emissions made in Cancún, Mexico in 2010. That is, their pledges are credible. However, the magnitude of the “gap” makes it obvious that the agreement in Paris must create an ongoing process through which countries will subsequently evaluate progress, learn from experience and increase the strength of their emissions cuts. The Paris agreement must also include other important features if it is to result in the successful management of the risks of climate change. In particular, it must embody support, including public and private funding, from the rich countries to help developing countries to build low-carbon economies, and to become more resilient to those impacts of climate change that cannot now be avoided. The strength of the commitments put forward by developing countries for Paris, and their willingness to ramp up ambition afterwards, will depend on the extent to which they are given financial and technological backing by the rich countries. Any commitments made in Paris must also take account of the important outcomes of the meeting in Addis Ababa in July on financial support for development of the world’s poorest countries, and of the UN general assembly in September where the millennium development goals will be succeeded by new sustainable development goals. Together, these events in Paris, Addis Ababa and New York in 2015 provide crucial opportunities to make decisive progress on the two biggest challenges facing humanity: overcoming poverty and managing climate change. Over the next 15 years, developing countries are expected to spend about two-thirds of the $90trn that the world will invest in infrastructure. If this locks in a dependence on fossil fuels and high-carbon growth, it will be impossible for the world to reach an emissions pathway consistent with avoiding dangerous climate change. Without sound economic policies, fossil fuels are badly underpriced. There are huge real costs, not reflected in the market, from burning fossil fuels because they create air pollution and climate change. There is growing recognition of the pernicious effects the consumption of fossil fuels creates through air pollution. As the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate pointed out last year, fine particles from burning coal and diesel are costing China the equivalent of more than 10% of its gross domestic product each year through premature deaths and ill health. And in Germany, the costs of air pollution are about 6% of annual GDP. Further, as countries pursue the goal of lower emissions, we are seeing extraordinary technical progress and learning about low-carbon technologies. This means that, as countries start to seize more of the substantial economic opportunities from progressing to cleaner and more efficient economies, they will be able to further reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. There are many signs that this is happening. China, for instance, cut its consumption of coal in 2014 while also substantially increasing its electricity generation from renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. And in the UK, we managed to reduce our annual emissions by an impressive 8.4% between 2013 and 2014 by using lower amounts of dirty energy, and without compromising economic growth. Globally, there are huge investments being made in alternatives to fossil fuels which should allow us to slow and reverse the growth in annual emissions. According to the international energy agency, more than a fifth of the world’s electricity is generated from renewable energy, and more than $250bn is being invested in these sources annually. While this provides some grounds for optimism, the road to Paris will still be challenging. The governments of some countries, such as Australia and Canada, appear to be gambling against the science. Developing countries remain deeply critical of the irresponsible behaviour of these and other rich countries that are shirking their responsibilities. They rightly insist that any agreement in Paris must be fair and equitable, and their willingness to commit to alternative low-carbon routes to economic growth will depend on support from the rich countries. So it is not yet certain that this year will provide the turning point in the worldwide battle against climate change, but the chances will be greater if the citizens of the UK and other countries put pressure on their governments to seek an ambitious international agreement. The public opinion survey conducted by Opinium/the Observer reveals that only 20% of the UK public think it is likely that the politicians and world leaders will agree a long-term plan that will keep global warming within acceptable levels. Such pessimism is understandable given the slow pace of progress, but we should beware of allowing it to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The same poll showed strong support for the UK’s landmark Climate Change Act and policies to cut our emissions, and all of the major political parties seeking votes in the general election have promised in their manifestos to continue efforts to curb greenhouse gases. If we lead by example, we will be able to seize the opportunities to create a stronger, cleaner and more efficient economy. We can take the opportunity to build cities that work and energy systems that are reliable and clean. We can show other countries the benefits of moving away from the destructive high-carbon path. And we will ensure that we leave a legacy to our children, grandchildren and future generations of a safer and more prosperous world. Nicholas Stern is chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and president of the British Academy. His new book, Why Are We Waiting? The Logic, Urgency and Promise of Tackling Climate Change, will be published by MIT Press on 15 May."

"Global food prices, which have been rising since 2012, may be ready for another hike.  In a report released Thursday, Ceres, a sustainable business consortium based in Boston, found that most food companies aren’t prepared to deal with the water risks that it expects will lead to higher water and food prices.   “We are coming to an end of cheap, plentiful water. Most of the food companies assume that water will remain cheap, and for investors that assumption is dangerous in terms of the companies’ long term profitability,” said Brooke Barton, the report’s co-author and director of the Ceres water program. “We feel that most companies are not addressing these risks adequately.” Water is a major ingredient in food, from bacon to pizza: growing crops and raising animals account for about 70% of the world’s water use, according to the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization. It takes 15,415 liters of water to produce a kilogram of beef, according to the Water Footprint Network, a Netherlands nonprofit that consults on water management and policy. A kilogram of pasta requires 1,850 liters of water. Moreover, one third of the food production takes place where water is becoming scarce, according to the World Resources Institute, a Washington DC research group that studies water, food and energy. Better water management plans by governments and businesses are needed, according to the Ceres report, which ranked 37 companies on their water management.  Scores were based on how the companies track water use and implement conservation plans – and whether their efforts include only their own operations or also their suppliers – as well as what companies are doing to reduce water pollution from fertilizer runoffs and other farming and production processes. Most of the companies scored poorly. On a scale of zero to 100, 31 companies ranked lower than 50. Kraft Foods Group, the maker of Cool Whip and Oscar Mayer sandwich meat, scored a mere six points. Tyson Foods, the company behind Jimmy Dean sausage and Sara Lee desserts, got eight. Constellation Brands, supplier of many happy hour staples such as Corona beer and Svedka vodka – and wine producers including Robert Mondavi Winery and Ravenswood – received 24.  The bottom three scorers were Monster Beverage with one point, Pinnacle Foods with one point and Pilgrim’s Pride with three points. Meanwhile, Unilever scored the highest at 70, followed by 67 for Coca-Cola, 64 for Nestle and 57 for General Mills. Ceres used publicly available data, such as corporate financial and sustainability reports, to make its assessments. Four of its member companies are ranked in the report: General Mills, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Brown Forman.  In many cases, companies included in the report aren’t tracking water use beyond their own operations, or aren’t tracking it well, according to Ceres. That’s a problem given that some of the top water uses come from their supply chains. Most companies also don’t have incentives in place – either internally or for their processors or farmers – for improving water conservation or reducing water pollution, the report said.  Kellogg’s chief sustainability officer, Diane Holdorf, praised the Ceres report for raising awareness about the challenges companies face and giving examples of practices worth emulating.  Kellogg, which scored 54, plans to do better, Holdorf said. The company’s 2014 sustainability report, issued last month, set new goals for 2020. The company is on track to meet its 2015 goal of reducing the amount of water it uses per metric ton of food produced by 15%-20% from 2005 levels.  The 2020 goals include working with farmers to use water and fertilizers more efficiently and protect their watersheds. In February, Kellogg announced several water conservation projects, including one slated to receive $10m in federal funding, on rice farms in Louisiana and wheat farms in Michigan. “Water is an important issue for us and for the food and beverage sector,” Holdorf said. “I think all of us have plenty of work to do.”  Drink and snack makers scored the best for their water risk management plans: they tend to have more recognizable brands and are under more pressure from their customers to be good environmental stewards, according to Ceres.  Some have already seen cuts in their sales and expansion plans because of dwindling or polluting water supplies, Barton noted.  Drought punctuated by a short period of intense rain in California contributed to a 28% profit decline in a carrot farming division of Campbell Soup Company during the last quarter of 2014. Last month, Coca-Cola abandoned a project to build a bottling plant in India after a battle from the local community over worries about depleting groundwater supplies.  Overall, packaged food and beverage companies fared better than meat and agricultural product companies such as Chiquita Brands, Archer Daniels Midland and Fresh Del Monte.  Jackie Anderson, an ADM spokeswoman, declined to comment on the Ceres assessment, which gives the company a score of 10. Most of the company’s processing plants that use high volumes of water are in regions where local water resources are not stressed, she said in an email, adding that ADM surpassed its goal of cutting water use 15% between 2008 and 2018 early, by the end of 2014. Meat producers face some of the highest water risk because meat production requires so much water. Among the six meat companies included in the report, Smithfield Foods received the highest score – and that’s a paltry 33.  Kathleen Kirkham, a spokeswoman for Smithfield, which makes bacon and sausages, emailed to say the company has already exceeded its 2015 goal of reducing water use by 10%, from 2008 levels, per 100 pounds of product produced, and plans to set new goals.   Tyson spokesman Dan Fogleman wrote that the report didn’t take into account some of the new technologies the company been using to conserve and reuse water, leading a 14.7% cut in the gallons of water used per pound of finished product “over the past several years”. He said the report also “mischaracterized” the company’s North American wastewater discharge as pollution. “The water we release back into the environment has been though a government-permitted treatment process,” he said.  Barton said she did consider the water saving technologies in her assessment, but Tyson lost points for not having a publicly stated water reduction goal. Ceres’s evaluation – which didn’t address the regulatory compliance of wastewater discharge – was based on the most recent public data reported to the US Environmental Protection Agency, according to which Tyson was responsible for the largest wastewater discharge in the US, she said. “Those discharges are permitted, but are still labeled by the US government as a form of pollution,” Barton said.  Some of the companies declined to comment on the report – such as Hormel Foods and Constellation Brands – or didn’t respond to requests for comments by press time, such as Dr Pepper Snapple Group.  Ceres also highlighted examples of strong water management policies. For example, Campbell Soup, Dean Foods, Molson Coors and Unilever offer executives financial incentives for achieving water management goals.  Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg, Nestle and Unilever have deadline-driven goals to expand sustainable water management practices, which range from planting cover crops to reduce water runoffs and soil erosion to capturing and storing rainfall, across the majority of their suppliers. The report also recommends several things the industry can do to improve.  While some companies require reporting from their suppliers, it’s not clear how they use the data to make better purchasing decisions or to help their suppliers improve. Creating new standards for reporting and data collection could help reduce the amount of time farmers and other suppliers need to spend filling out surveys – and could lead to industry-wide solutions.  Ceres recommends that companies work more closely with their suppliers, including farmers, to collect good data, secure water supplies and conserve more. Businesses should also support watershed protection and report water risks regularly to their board of directors and shareholders, the group claims.  Meanwhile, investors who want to include water risks in their financial analyses should demand more comprehensive water use reporting from their portfolio companies and make investment decisions accordingly, Ceres suggests. According to the report, they should consider three key factors: how much water is needed, how secure the water supply is, and how the management deal with water scarcity, pollution and other related risks.  “Right now, a lot of what we are producing is linked to the fact that water is free,” Barton said. “We will see a shift.” The water hub is funded by Grundfos.

"India’s prime minister has stressed his commitment to finding a global solution to climate change, but declined to reveal if his government was willing to specify an emissions peak this year. Speaking to Time magazine Modi said he was “acutely conscious and aware” of his responsibility to help guide the world towards a deal on curbing greenhouse gases in Paris this December.  “If there is one part of the world which can provide natural leadership on this particular cause, it is this part of the world,” he said. But he steered clear of answering whether his administration would consider placing a cap on the country’s emissions ahead of this year’s UN summit. India is the world’s fourth largest source of climate warming gases after China the US and EU. Its emissions are predicted to triple by 2030 if it maintains current levels of economic growth, and continues to rely heavily on coal-generated electricity. Modi stressed the country’s ambition in setting a goal of 175GW from renewable sources, 75GW from wind and the rest from solar. As of 2014 the country’s electricity generating capacity was 249GW, largely from coal power plants. “It is really an immense and huge initiative of my government,” he said. Mass transportation plans, the use of liquefied petroleum (LP) gas over firewood, LED lighting and his desire to clean up 2,500km of the River Ganges were all evidence of his respect for the environment, Modi said. He also returned to a familiar theme – the need for the international community to change its consumer-based lifestyle that was placing huge demand on raw materials and waste management. “I think the throw-away culture, the culture of disposables, causes a huge burden on the environment,” he said. “I think recycling, or the re-usage of the resources of the earth, is an important aspect which should be ingrained in our daily lifestyle.”"

"Sea ice around Antarctica is currently at record levels for May, part of a trend of increasing ice around the frozen continent making it harder to resupply and refuel research stations. More than 50 scientists are gathering in Hobart in Tasmania this week for a series of workshops on techniques to more accurately forecast sea ice levels in the polar region, aiming to save millions of dollars in shipping costs.  They will also hope to avoid a repeat of the problems suffered by the Akademik Shokalskiy, the research vessel caught in a sudden freeze in December 2013.  Rod Wooding, from the Australian Antarctic Division, said last year ships “couldn’t get anywhere near” the Australian research site, Mawson station, requiring a year’s worth of supplies and fuel to be flown in by helicopter. “[That] is inadequate for the long-term sustainability of the station,” Wooding said. “Other national programs have had similar problems, the French in particular, the Japanese also.” Scientists were initially puzzled by the increasing sea ice around the continent, which reached record levels in September 2014, but have concluded it is “very largely driven by changes in wind”, Tony Worby, the chief executive of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre said. “Those changes of wind are driven by the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere and the increasing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.” The El Nino phenomenon, too, “drives changes in pressure which drives changes in wind which drives changes in sea ice”, he said. Antarctica is also surrounded by ocean, leaving sea ice “completely free to expand however it wants to”, in contrast to the Arctic region, which is landlocked by Russia, Greenland and northern Canada. Australia is tendering to replace its icebreaking vessel, the 25-year-old Aurora Australis. Worby said more accurate forecasts would help to understand what level of “ice breaking capability” would be needed in the future. “It’s quite hard to forecast but whatever effort we put in to improving our ability to forecast sea ice will ultimately pay dividends in terms of savings for national programs,” he said. The workshops will continue until Wednesday."
"It’s the hottest trend in climate denial. Long gone are the days when people can publicly deny that the planet is warming or that humans are responsible without facing widespread mockery. Those who oppose taking serious action to curb global warming have mostly shifted to Stage 3 in the 5 stages of climate denial.  Each of the 5 stages shares one main characteristic – all can be used to argue against efforts and policies to slow global warming. If the planet isn’t warming, or if we’re not causing it, or if it’s not a problem, or if we can’t solve it, or if it’s too late, in each case there’s no reason to implement climate policies.  People who favor the status quo will often bounce back and forth between the various stages of climate denial. However, as Stages 1 and 2 have become increasingly untenable, Stage 3 has become more popular. As a result, so-called “Lukewarmers” have emerged. This group believes that the climate is relatively insensitive to the increasing greenhouse effect, and hence that climate change will proceed slowly enough as to not be a serious concern in the near future. This group has also become known as “Luckwarmers,” because they essentially want to gamble our future on the small chance that the best possible case scenario will come to fruition. It’s akin to rolling dice and betting all of our money that they’ll come up as snake eyes. For the Luckwarmer case to be true, first the climate sensitivity must be close to the lowest end of possible values. This requires rejecting the vast body of evidence suggesting that the climate is in reality quite sensitive to the increasing greenhouse effect. Second, even if the climate is relatively insensitive to the increasing greenhouse effect, the planet will nevertheless continue to warm if we continue to pump carbon pollution into the atmosphere. Thus the Luckwarmer case also generally depends on the impacts associated with that climate change being relatively benign. Contrarian climate scientist Judith Curry recently made this case in testimony to the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology: The concern about inaction comes from concern about passing the 2°C ‘danger’ threshold, possibly by mid-century. This concern relies on a very weak assessment that 2°C of warming is actually ‘dangerous’ and that we can believe the climate models (which seem to be running too hot). Former NASA climate scientist James Hansen recently outlined the scientific evidence behind why even 2°C warming is very dangerous for our long-term future. The most vulnerable developing nations agree. Scientific research seems to keep revealing more and more negative impacts associated with further global warming; most recently the likelihood that wheat yields will decrease in a hotter world as demand rises from a growing population. The claim about climate models running hot is a popular one among Luckwarmers, but observed temperatures are within the range of model simulations, and all signs point toward the reliability of long-term model projections. The Luckwarmer argument relies on both the climate sensitivity and climate change impacts being about as low as the scientific evidence suggests they could possibly be. But that requires rejecting all the evidence supporting the possibility of the worst case, or even the most likely case scenarios. Each of the dice could come up showing any number from 1 to 6. Betting that they’ll both come up showing 1 is a risky gamble. In The Observer, climate scientist Tamsin Edwards recently wrote, Call me naive – others have – but I choose to see the positive in this lukewarming of the debate. Widespread acceptance that humans do affect climate means we can focus on the genuine open questions in science and policy. On the one hand, it would be nice not to have to keep debunking myths about the reality of human-caused global warming. On the other hand, Stage 3 denial isn’t all that different from Stages 1 and 2. Ultimately they’re all based on denying some set of inconvenient scientific evidence, they’re all used to oppose policies to curb global warming, and people will bounce back and forth between the various stages of climate denial anyway. For example, President George W. Bush’s FEMA director, Michael Brown (of “Brownie, you’re doing a heck of a job” Hurricane Katrina infamy) recently voiced his Luckwarmer views on Twitter: @aseifter I am a denier. I deny that man is causing climate to an extent we need public policy to stop it. Man can't stop climate change This is a combination of Stage 2 and 3 denial, explicitly used to justify opposition to climate policies. The aforementioned Judith Curry has also bounced between Stages 2 and 3, recently voicing doubts about the undeniable physical reality that humans are responsible for the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, writing, ...the mass balance approach is naive zeroth order. “The mass balance approach” refers to the principle that when we burn fossil fuels and release carbon pollution, that carbon has to go somewhere (based on the fundamental principle of the conservation of mass). Professor Gavin Cawley explains the science nicely in the Denial101x course. Since the rate of buildup in the atmosphere is only about half as fast as the rate at which humans are producing carbon pollution, it’s undeniable that we’re causing the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Or at least it should be.   Other examples of Luckwarmers include Matt Ridley, Nic Lewis, and Bjorn Lomborg. The University of Western Australia has been caught up in a major Luckwarmer controversy, having taken federal funds to set up a center from which Lomborg was expected to argue that the government’s money would be better spent on issues other than curbing global warming. In a sign that even Stage 3 climate denial is starting to become untenable, the resulting uproar forced the university to cancel plans for the center. Matt Ridley and Nic Lewis are both contributors to the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). The GWPF advocates against most policies that would significantly cut carbon pollution and slow global warming. Matt Ridley often explicitly advocates for the continued heavy use of fossil fuels. Thus it’s hard to make a convincing case that the shift towards Stage 3 climate denial is a positive development. If anything it just gives arguments against climate policies undeserved credibility. For example, The Observer sub-headline read, There are climate change sceptics, mainstream scientists – and a significant group [Luckwarmers] in the middle. In reality it’s mainstream climate scientists who are in the middle, between contrarians/luckwarmers and doomsayers. The former believe the climate is so insensitive that we needn’t take action, while the latter believe it’s so sensitive that we’re already doomed to catastrophe. If Luckwarmers succeed in shifting the Overton Window in this fashion to make climate denial and arguments against climate policies even more mainstream, then the shift to Stage 3 climate denial may do much more harm than good."

"A YouGov poll published last week found that 40% of voters wanted to hear more about the environment. They also wanted to hear more about education, pensions, foreign affairs and Europe. They have been disappointed. It is too easy to blame this silence on the politicians. Political debate in Britain has largely been reduced to a hermetic conversation between party leaders no-one listens to anymore and editors who confuse news with entertainment. But environmentalists must also take some of the blame.  The environmental community in Britain is vast. It has 4.5 million members, 13% of the population. This is 10 times as many supporters as all the political parties combined, even counting the 100,000 members who have just signed up to the SNP and the Greens. Add the National Trust’s 4 million members and a quarter of Britain’s population belong to this community. But it has consistently punched below its weight. David Cameron promised the coalition would be ‘the greenest government ever’. He then went on to abolish key environmental institutions, significantly weaken the planning system, cut the budgets of environmental regulators, destabilise renewable energy, undermine the energy efficiency of our homes and slaughter badgers. All without paying any political price.  This level of support for the environment shows there is nothing wrong with the people of Britain. But there is something wrong with the way in which those of us privileged to lead this community have made our case. If the environment hasn’t featured in this election we must take some of the blame. We have been voluble and voluminous in arguing for the things we care about – biodiversity, carbon emissions, ecosystems, toxic chemicals. We have asked consumers, corporations and governments to do more to protect them. A lot of the time we have sounded as remote from the realities of everyday life as the politicians. It is now time for us to ask a different question. What can the environment do for Britain? We have to make our understanding of environmental realities work for Britain’s prosperity and security. We have to sound like we can connect that understanding to the world of rising bills and static wages; of over-stretched public services and declining industries; of falling confidence in government and growing insecurity of income, housing, savings. If the environmental community wants politicians to care more for the environment it must sound like it cares more for people. Environmentalists think longer and harder than most about the future. But if that thinking does not connect to the present it has little political traction. The NHS has been central to this election. People care deeply about its future and worry about whether Britain can continue to afford it. But they do not know that air pollution costs the NHS £15bn a year. This is more than obesity and alcoholism combined and enough to keep the NHS viable well into the future. Successive British governments have ignored European air quality regulations they have agreed to with impunity, so these costs are growing not falling. That’s our fault. Energy bills have become sufficiently important politically to generate headline-grabbing gimmicks across the political spectrum. But few voters are aware that insulating Britain’s homes properly would drive down those bills permanently, save the NHS the cost of cold homes, reduce the power of the energy companies and pay for itself in less than a decade. It would also create 100,000 jobs and lower carbon emissions. This is also our fault. I could go on. We need to be talking about making savings safe from a changing climate. Our economy will grow and become more competitive if it is resource-efficient and low carbon. Britain’s homes and businesses should have more control over their own energy security. Driving would be cheaper and cleaner for everyone if we accelerated the use of electric vehicles. The values that have motivated the British people to build a just and tolerant society are those which mobilised so many of them to join environmental organisations. If we are punching below our weight, which we are, it is because we are still asking people to do something for us instead of saying what we can do for them."
"Cultivation of the arabica coffee plant, staple of daily caffeine fixes and economic lifeline for millions of small farmers, is under threat from climate change as rising temperatures and new rainfall patterns limit the areas where it can be grown, researchers have warned. Arabica, which has long been prized for its delicate and aromatic flavour, accounts for 70% of the global coffee market share. But it is particularly sensitive to temperature increases, which reduce its growth, flowering and fruiting and make it more susceptible to coffee pests.   With global temperatures forecast to increase by 2C-2.5C over the next few decades, a report predicts that some of the major coffee producing countries will suffer serious losses, reducing supplies and driving up prices.  The joint study, published by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) under the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), models the global suitability of arabica cultivation to see how production will be affected in 2050. It predicts that Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia – which between them produce 65% of the global market share of arabica – will find themselves experiencing severe losses unless steps are taken to change the genetics of the crops as well as the manner and areas in which it is grown.  Dr Peter Läderach, a CCAFS climate change specialist and co-author of the report, said that although some countries would be able to mitigate the “massive impact” of climate change by simply moving their coffee to higher, cooler areas, it was not an option for everyone. “If you look at the countries that will lose out most, they’re countries like El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras, which have steep hills and volcanoes,” he said. “As you move up, there’s less and less area. But if you look at some South American or east African countries, you have plateaus and a lot of areas at higher altitudes, so they will lose much less.” Without new strategies, says the study, Brazil alone can expect its current arabica production to drop by 25% by 2050.  “In Brazil, they produce coffee on the plains and don’t have any mountains so they can’t move up,” said Läderach.  “What they would have to do is look for adaptation strategies. This study shows that we urgently need to start breeding new varieties and adapting growing practices, like putting in shade to decrease temperatures. But the problem in Brazil is it’s very mechanised and if you put trees there, they won’t be able to bring the machines in.” However, he said, even those countries with higher altitudes were likely to find themselves struggling to make up for lost land because the needs of coffee cultivation would have to be weighed up against the preservation of forests, nature reserves and national parks.  Although Indonesia, which is expected to see its arabica cultivation areas cut by up to 37%, could move production to higher areas, they tend to be home to indigenous communities and biodiverse environments. “If you don’t have good, rigorous laws in place, people are just going to start going up and chopping down the forest, which would then jeopardise all the downstream benefits that people receive, such as water and carbon sequestration,” said Läderach.  Coffee, the second-most traded commodity after oil, is grown by an estimated 25 million farmers in more than 60 tropical countries, making it a key source of revenue for many developing nations. Läderach said that failure to find new and better ways to grow arabica would have serious consequences for both humans and the environment. “If you look at Burundi or Uganda or Nicaragua, they depend very heavily on coffee, so they’d miss all that income for the development of their countries,” he said. “Environmentally, because it’s an agro-forestry system, it brings a lot of benefits like biodiversity and soil and water conservation, and erosion control.” Although developing hardier coffee strains, planting more shade and encouraging farmers to grow other crops would help compensate for the losses wrought by climate change, said Läderach, there were no quick or easy solutions. “Breeding new varieties takes years: coffee systems are not like arable crops, where this year you do beans and the next year you do cassava,” he said.  “It takes three to five years before you can even harvest coffee for the first time. It’s a long lead time, which is why we’re pointing out that it’s very crucial to start developing strategies now.” Läderach said the challenges ahead were so great that they demanded the combined efforts of farmers, scientists, governments and businesses. “Climate change is going to have a massive impact, so we need to emphasise that the sector – and everyone – has to work together, or everybody will lose out,” he said. There is, however another possibility: with Brazil and Central America forecast to suffer most keenly, arabica production could be shifted not upwards but further eastwards, to Africa, Asia and the Pacific. But while such a move could revolutionise the coffee industry, it is far from risk-free. Dr Tim Schilling, executive director of World Coffee Research, which is funded by the global coffee industry, has his doubts. “There’s competition for land among other cash crops in Indonesia and the Pacific, and it is unknown whether Africa could build the necessary capacity in terms of politics, business climate, supporting institutions and infrastructure,” he said. Schilling believes technology may yet be the best bet for coffee growers, suppliers and drinkers. “For me, it all says brace yourselves for higher prices. The only glimmer on the horizon is the ability to change the coffee plant so that it produces decent coffee and yields under a climate-constrained environment.”"
"The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has sold off investments in coal companies from its £16m endowment in a bid to rid itself of ties to firms that contribute most significantly to climate change. Campaigners say it is the first health research organisation in the world to do so. A spokesperson for the university told the Guardian on Wednesday: “The school’s investment committee has recently decided to disinvest from coal. We are continuing to review our other energy investments.”  The move means that the institution has removed its direct investments – but not commingled funds – from companies that make more than 10% of their revenue from coal, including the mining giant Rio Tinto. They have also committed not to invest in such companies in future. Martin McKee, professor of European public health at LSHTM, has backed divestment and called the university a “pioneer”. He said: “I am proud to be part of a university that is prepared to show leadership, whether with Ebola, global health, or in this case disinvestment in fossil fuels. I expect that many other universities and health research funders will soon follow, recognising the strong economic and moral arguments.”  In March, the Guardian launched a campaign calling on the world’s largest health funders – the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust – to divest from fossil fuels. More than 202,000 people from 170 countries around the world have signed the petition.  Alice Munro, a nurse studying public health at LSHTM has co-lead the campus divestment campaign at LSHTM since it launched last November. She said: “This is a good first step and indicates that the school agrees in principle that investing in fossil fuels is unethical and inconsistent with the values of an institution dedicated to promoting human health.” The Wellcome Trust, which has an endowment of more than £18bn, is one of the world’s largest funders of medical research. In 2014, a minimum of £450m was invested in fossil fuel companies including Shell, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and BP. The trust has so far rejected the call to divest. Its director, Jeremy Farrar, has argued that engagement with fossil fuel companies is more effective than divestment. “We use our access to company boards to press for more transparent and sustainable policies that support transition towards a low-carbon economy,” he wrote. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have more than $1.4bn (£1bn) invested in fossil fuel companies, according to a Guardian analysis of their most recent tax filings in 2013. A spokesman for Bill Gates said: “We respect the passion of advocates for action on climate change, and recognise that there are many views on how best to address it. Bill is privately investing considerable time and resources in the effort [to develop clean energy].” LSHTM is only the second health organisation in the UK and third in the world to have made a divestment decision regarding fossil fuels, according to global health campaigners at MedAct. In February a coalition of medical organisations published a report urging the health sector to divest from fossil fuels. It cited climate change as “the biggest global health threat of the 21st century” and asked health organisations including the Wellcome Trust to repeat the leadership they had shown on tobacco divestment. In June 2014, the British Medical Association – the representative body of doctors in the UK – voted in favour of divestment.  David McCoy, director of MedAct, one of the organisations that made up the coalition said: “This decision will hopefully encourage the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation to follow suit. Both Wellcome and Gates have been finding excuses to avoid taking the kind of radical action needed to avert the crisis of climate change, whilst the moral, financial and scientific case for divestment by health institutions is becoming harder and harder to dismiss.” LSHTM is the fourth university in the UK to have committed to some form of fossil fuel divestment, following Glasgow, Bedfordshire and Soas, University of London. Syracuse University is the largest in the world to have commited to full fossil fuel divestment, with Stanford divesting from coal. Campaigners at Edinburgh University are currently staging an occupation of the university’s management building after it rejected calls to divest on Tuesday. The decision sees them join a fast growing divestment campaign started by the global climate movement 350.org. In total, more than 220 institutions – from pension funds to faith organisations to foundations – have now made similar commitments.  In March the UN organisation responsible for co-ordinating a global climate change deal backed divestment saying it did so because “it sends a signal to companies, especially coal companies, that the age of ‘burn what you like, when you like’ cannot continue.”"
"The environment minister, Greg Hunt, has reassured the United Nations’ top climate negotiator that the Coalition’s existing policies will reduce greenhouse emissions from electricity generation and heavy industry, despite scepticism from local experts that this will occur. Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change, told Guardian Australia she had discussed Australia’s emission reduction policies with Hunt during her current Australian trip. They included the emissions reduction fund through which the government conducts “reverse auctions” to buy greenhouse gas abatement, and the “safeguards mechanism” which is supposed to prevent those reductions from being undone by increases in industrial emissions.   “I met with minister Hunt ... and I learned about the recent successful first reverse auction, and I learned that future reverse auctions will go into industrial sectors and the power sector,” she said. “... My understanding from speaking to the minister is also that the safeguards mechanism will also reduce industrial and power sector emissions. That is the purpose of it.” But most submissions on the government’s recent discussion paper setting out how the safeguards mechanism will work said it was unlikely to stop increased emissions from the power and industrial sectors. A Grattan Institute response published this week said: “The safeguard mechanism described in the consultation paper will not achieve its stated objective of ensuring that emissions reductions purchased through the Emissions Reduction Fund are not displaced by a significant rise in emissions elsewhere in the economy. This is because it is not designed to achieve this goal.  “Instead, the mechanism is designed to allow emissions baselines to be adjusted to accommodate most foreseeable activities that could give rise to an increase in emissions. As a result, its impact on reducing emissions is likely to be zero.”  The Climate Institute said the safeguards mechanism, as described, would not force big emitters to reduce their greenhouse pollution, and could mean high-carbon power stations increased their emissions substantially over the next five years. In its submission about the safeguards, the Australian Industry Group said that it “meets the government’s objective that the mechanism will not be a driver of abatement towards the 2020 target” and would need “substantial amendment” if it was ever to help reduce greenhouse emissions. The independent senator Nick Xenophon, who provided one of the six votes the government needed to get its Direct Action policy through the Senate in July last year, told Guardian Australia the proposed safeguards mechanism “neuters the whole purpose of Direct Action”. “There is no point in the government spending $2.55bn if there is no requirement to cap or reduce emissions from industry,” he said. Figueres was careful to emphasise that it was entirely up to the Australian government to decide what policies it used to reach its emission reduction target. In setting Australia’s post-2020 emissions reduction targets, the government has said it will take into account “the scope and nature of other countries’ targets – so that our target represents Australia’s fair share and does not put Australia at a competitive disadvantage to our key trading partners and the major economies”.  Guardian Australia understands it has commissioned modelling from the leading economist Warwick McKibbin to look at the impact of other countries’ emission reduction promises – for example reduction in coal exports – on Australia’s economy. Figueres said a declining global appetite for coal made it more important for Australia to look for diversified exports. Hunt has also been publicly talking up the idea that the safeguards mechanism will force emissions reductions in the longer term. In an interview last week he said “the safeguards mechanism is designed to have its real impact in the post-2020 period – and it’s flexible, it is designed and legislated so as it can be adjusted and it can be tightened in such a way so as to allow for progressive emissions reductions. “It is a two-part system. An emissions reduction fund … [and] secondly, we have the safeguards mechanism which allows us to work with individual firms on a budget which can be adjusted and progressively tightened throughout the 2020s through to 2030 and 2040 and 2050.” If the “baselines” over which companies cannot increase their emissions are progressively tightened, as Hunt suggests, the government’s policy allows the offending companies to make up for it by “purchasing credits created by other accredited emissions reduction projects”. This would effectively create a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme."

"19 months and counting Walking along the bank of the River Thames once, I saw some tourists gesturing at Hungerford bridge. “How far does that go?” asked one. “To the other side, I hope,” I mouthed to myself. Usually bridges do, with the exception of a few like Avignon’s, which it’s shocking to discover is little more than a masonry stump.   When there’s a gap, travellers have a problem. And, as we look to cross the bridge to a low carbon future with the UK general election upon us, the gaps in the main parties’ manifestos look enough to ditch us all into the turbulent waters of a warming world. Sometimes the election campaign has felt like a BBC Radio 4 game show in which contestants compete to go as long as possible without mentioning the environment. In a bid to bolster their economic and social policy credentials, even the Green party seems to have prioritised an anti-austerity message over talking about climate change. Carbon Brief, which tracks media coverage of climate science and energy policy, notes that Ed Miliband made just one passing reference to climate change when launching Labour’s manifesto, while David Cameron didn’t mention climate at all at the Conservative launch. He did however talk about North Sea energy. Eager to differentiate themselves in people’s thoughts about the coalition, the Liberal Democrats had far more green policy, but have struggled to get anyone to report it. The single overriding story about them has been their fall from political grace, and how badly they are likely to do in the election. Little else they say about policy as a result is considered newsworthy, unless it includes revealing coalition secrets. Another assessment by the Centre for Economic Performance(CEP) observes that the UK’s climate performance, while relatively good on paper if compared internationally, has in reality been flattered by the recession lowering energy demand. It also says the UK lags behind most other OECD countries in clean technology take-up and innovation. In February, the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat leaders pledged certain actions on climate change whatever the result of the election turned out to be. They included new UK emissions targets, work towards a binding global deal and an end to unabated coal power.  The CEP dismisses much of the pledges as “largely rhetoric, with limited focus on actionable policy commitments.” Where commitments exist, like Labour’s pledge to make the UK electricity supply low carbon by 2030, CEP say they are contradicted by other policies, like those on energy which emphasise cheap energy, and continuing exploitation of fossil fuels like North Sea oil. The Centre for Alternative Technology has done more work than anyone to visualise what it would take for life in the UK to be compatible with preventing dangerous climate change. Its Zero Carbon Britain reports are the boldest and most comprehensive attempts yet to identify the practical changes needed. Their assessment of the parties sees Conservative policies as a void, Labour full of self-defeating contradictions, Liberal Democrats lacking detail about how their ambitions would be met, Plaid Cymru lacking ambition, the SNP too in love with North Sea oil, Ukip on another planet, and only the Green’s proposals offering a strong possibility of delivering the internationally-agreed 2C limit on rising temperatures. If the old cliché is true about elections always being about “the economy, stupid”, the curious absence of the environment from the UK election debate is even stranger.  At the heart of the UK economy still sits the City of London, and it still sits dangerously on foundations of fossil fuels, not London clay. The inescapable logic that if we want to have a future most of them have to stay underground, has started shaking oil and coal companies. It is yet to shake politics. But where the economy goes politics surely follows.  While green issues and the climate have been lamentably absent from this election, I am going to make the prediction that they will dominate the next one. Exactly a week before the UK election a youth group in south London, made up mostly of 10- to 12-year-olds, staged their own mock election. They eschewed the existing parties, creating their own, with names like Modern Society, the Pedal Party Party (double party, more fun), Wee Care and the Elemental Party. Policies included: banning cars to make space for bicycles, greening cities, getting rid of polluting fossil fuels and having more renewable energy, building more homes, being nice to immigrants, free or cheap public transport and free education. They got my vote. OK, they also wanted more monkeys as pets and free sweets, but they are children. There is a potentially lethal gap in politics between what is necessary and what is deemed possible. The next generation are building bridges across that gap in their imaginations. Perhaps the most effective law the next government could pass would be to lower the voting age."
"What’s your greatest fear for the future of our planet? That the world is reaching the tipping point beyond which climate change may become irreversible. If this happens, we risk denying present and future generations the right to a healthy and sustainable planet – the whole of humanity stands to lose. On the other hand, climate change is an unprecedented opportunity for governments, investors, firms and citizens to work together to develop and deploy low-carbon technologies, which can sustain growth within our planetary boundaries. Shifting towards low-carbon energy systems can avert climate catastrophe while creating new opportunities for investment, growth and employment.  What would you like to see come out of the UN summit in Paris? Governments have to conclude a fair, universal and binding climate agreement, by which every country commits to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. We need equitable and effective policies, which ensure that the world’s richer countries support the aspirations of developing countries to follow a sustainable development path. For example, and as my fellow Elders and I have repeatedly stressed, a tax on carbon emissions can make an important contribution to the fight against global warming. Another key policy issue is clear and reliable climate finance: governments committed to mobilise $100bn a year by 2020 to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate change impacts and pursue green growth. The Paris summit must ensure that the promises are kept, because the only promises that matter are promises which are kept. Given that the Paris agreement will only come into force in 2020, we also have to make tangible progress on addressing climate change immediately and meeting adaptation needs. What would you say to a climate change sceptic? The world’s leading scientists, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have found that human-induced climate change is already causing serious harm on every continent. Moreover, the World Meteorological Organization pronounced 2014 as the warmest year on record. We seriously have to question the motivation of those people referred to as climate change sceptics, who are denying the evidence of human-caused climate change and preventing us from moving forward by spreading disinformation and supporting unchecked carbon pollution. What climate-change related experience left the greatest impression on you? Last September, the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-Moon, convened more than 120 world leaders in New York to prepare a global response to the worsening climate crisis. It left a particular impression on me that thousands of people were marching in New York and other cities across the globe to make their voices heard. The world witnessed possibly the largest ever demonstration on climate change in history. This showed that ordinary citizens, particularly young people, can catalyse positive change and make a difference. People sent a clear and unequivocal signal that failure to act will have consequences at the ballot box for politicians and for the bottom line of businesses. If leaders are unwilling to lead when leadership is required, people must. Should we be encouraged to reduce their meat consumption?  The global livestock industry is indeed a major threat to the climate as it represents 14.5% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. A growing population and a rapidly growing middle class are increasing pressure on the traditional protein sources, beef and poultry meat, making it more difficult to meet demand. We cannot continue the way we are producing and consuming meat. Obviously, this should not go as far as governments telling people what to eat. However, keeping meat consumption to levels recommended by health authorities would lower emissions and reduce heart disease, cancer, and other diseases. And of course there are alternative sources of protein. For example, raising insects as an animal protein source. Insects have a very good conversion rate from feed to meat. They make up part of the diet of two billion people and are commonly eaten in many parts of the world. Eating insects is good for the environment and balanced diets. What’s more important right now: reducing emissions or adapting to a new climate? We cannot allow ourselves to choose between climate change mitigation and adaptation. We simply need both. All countries stand to lose if we fail to achieve the international goal of restricting global warming to 2C degrees above pre-industrial levels, and take the right measures to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. At the same time we have to adapt to the severe impacts of climate change already underway. Should developing countries be encouraged to cut emissions? It is important that developed and developing countries cut emissions. However, fairness demands that richer countries and those with the highest emissions take the lead. They must provide adequate financial resources and technologies to poorer countries and help them to cut emissions and adapt to climate change. While the climate risks are so severe, it is easy to lose sight of the opportunities. The 2015 Africa Progress Panel Report will argue that the climate change imperative is an opportunity for Africa’s energy-poor countries to leapfrog straight to clean energy, avoiding decades of inefficient spending on polluting energy sources. Should mitigating climate change be a higher priority than other international goals such as defeating malaria? I have repeatedly stressed that climate change is a global and all-encompassing threat to life, to our water and food supplies, to our health, security, prosperity and stability. It should be given highest priority. This does not mean that we should ignore other key priorities for international development, including global health and access to education. However, what we need is a holistic approach that takes account of the impacts of climate change. The Millennium Development Goal 6, for example, focuses on reversing the incidence of malaria, but a warmer climate would alter the areas where mosquitos can breed, thus exposing new human populations to the disease. Kofi A. Annan is the founding chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation and also chairs The Elders and the Africa Progress Panel. Kofi Annan was the 7th Secretary-General of the United Nations. In 2001, he and the United Nations were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace."

"As I’ve previously noted, one of the most challenging problems in climate science deals with how to measure the Earth’s system. Whether ocean temperatures, atmospheric temperatures, sea level, ice extent or other characteristics, measurements have to be made with sufficient accuracy and geographical coverage so that we can calculate long-term trends. In some parts of the planet, the measurements are particularly daunting because of the ruggedness of the terrain and the hostility of the environment.  This brings us to a new study just published on Antarctic ice loss by Christopher Harig and Frederik Simons of Princeton. They work in the Princeton Polar Ice program. This study used satellite measurements to determine the rate of mass loss from this large ice sheet.   The ice sheet has two parts, a stable and large eastern part and a smaller and less stable western portion. The impact of climate change on these portions is different. The western part is losing mass at an increasing rate over the past years. In the east, however, the information is less clear. Increased precipitation (snowfall) is adding to the ice there, even while portions of the ice are warming. The satellite method that these authors used actually measures the gravitational pull of the ice on two orbiting satellites. The huge ice sheet has such a large mass that it attracts objects toward it. As the ice melts and flows into the oceans, the attraction decreases – it is this change that is measured. The satellites are part of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) project. In the past, the satellites could only be used to make gross measurements over large areas. Their ability to separate what is happening in different regions is very limited. For such local measurements, other techniques had to be used. The new paper provides an improvement to the resolution of GRACE. They find that the western part of Antarctica is losing mass at 121 billion tons (gigatons) a year. This rate has increased recently. In particular, in one region (the Amundsen Sea coast, the ice loss has doubled in the past six years). In the east, there is a small mass gain (approximately 30 gigatons a year). This mass gain partially offsets what is happening in the west but there is still a large loss of water to the sea each year.  I asked the lead author about this study and he told me,  It is very important that we continue long term monitoring of how mass changes in ice sheets. For West Antarctica in particular this is important because of how it is thought to be more unstable, where the feedbacks can cause more and more ice loss from the land over time. These strong regional accelerations that we see are very robustly measured and imply that Antarctica may become a major contributor to sea level rise in the near future. This increase in the mass loss rate, in ten years, accelerations like that show that things are beginning to change on human time scales. The conclusions of the authors fits well with a study that I published with Ted Scambos late last year. In that paper, we discussed the ice loss from Antarctica. Our particular focus was on the rising ocean levels. What we showed by reviewing the literature was that as Antarctica’s mass decreases, changes to the gravity field will actually cause sea level rise to be greater than expected in the Northern Hemisphere.  This is important for people who are trying to make long term plans of coastal vulnerability and infrastructure. Again, we see that our changing climate will force us to adapt. Improving our predictions of what the future world will look like can provide guidance for efficient and effective adaptation."

"It’s been a world superpower for most of the past century, but Russia still faces enormous sustainable development challenges – challenges that are compounded by economic sanctions that are sending its economy into recession territory.  The country’s infrastructure, building and manufacturing stock all suffer from extreme energy inefficiency: a recent World Bank study found that efficiency improvements in Russia could cut its energy consumption by 45%, an amount equal to France’s total annual energy consumption.  Income inequality is a similarly profound obstacle to progress in Russia, with some reports suggesting that Russia’s wealth gap is the worst in the world. In particular, a report from Credit Suisse found that just 110 Russian citizens hold 35% of the nation’s household wealth. Then there are Russia’s environmental problems: in the Russian Federation, fossil fuels are king. Not only do oil, gas and coal produce 90% of the country’s energy, they are also responsible for more than half of the federal government’s budget. Aside from hydroelectric and nuclear power, Russia’s non-fossil fuel energy resources are fledgling, almost to the point of nonexistence.  As global warming melts the world’s permafrost over the course of this century, up to two thirds of Russia’s gargantuan landmass may become swampland, further devastating infrastructure and livelihoods. The official Kremlin response to global warming he been less than encouraging: in the past, Vladimir Putin has said that “two or three degrees” of warming could be good for Russia because residents wouldn’t need to spend as much on fur coats. That philosophy can’t withstand the real-world effects of climate change in the country, perhaps most notably the incredible 2010 drought – which NASA scientist James Hansen and others have statistically linked to climate change in several studies – that decimated Russia’s wheat crop and sent global wheat prices soaring. But if Russia faces the same panoply of environmental challenges as the rest of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries – and the rest of the world – those challenges are being dwarfed by the country’s social and political challenges. Lately isolated from the West by economic sanctions in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the country’s government has responded by cracking down on foreign participation in domestic affairs. In 2012, the Russian government adopted a strict new Foreign Agents Law that requires politically active NGOs that receive international funding to register as foreign agents, which is, as Human Rights Watch explains, “a term generally understood in Russia to mean ‘traitor’ or ‘spy’”.  The definition of political activity has been so broadly applied that it includes policy advocacy aimed at addressing social and environmental woes. Several human rights and environmental groups face fines and criminal prosecution after being labeled as foreign agents in July. In its database, Radio Free Europe ­– which is compiling a comprehensive list of NGOs facing punishment as foreign agents in Russia – notes that, among many other groups, Transparency International Russia received a foreign agents warning in April stating that it “seeks to shape public opinion on state policies, particularly on law enforcement and the legislative process”.  In the past three years, the law has resulted in a crackdown on pro-democracy groups. Citations under the law have led the US Agency for International Development being expelled after 20 years of work in Russia. The country also has come under fire for its civil rights issues. It faced allegations of corruption around the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. It also became a battleground for gay rights during the games, with widespread boycotts, protests and demonstrations, after the country enacted an anti-gay law and Putin said gay people would not be harassed as long as they “leave children alone”. Those controversies compounded international objections that began after Russian punk band Pussy Riot was jailed for nearly two years for a musical protest at a cathedral in Moscow. In this political environment, the social and environmental may look bleak – and it’s long odds that anything will change dramatically very soon. But that’s not to say there isn’t any good news coming out of Russia. Despite the foreign agents law, the country is home to a broad network of environmental and social NGOs working locally and regionally, and winning some success.  In the wake of the Chernobyl meltdown in 1986, the country enshrined strong environmental protection principles in its constitution. The challenge, of course, is whether those protections will be enforced – a distant likelihood in a country that consistently ranks in the world’s bottom third on the Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, which measures perceptions of corruption in countries and territories by domestic and international observers. The industries where Russia depends on foreign markets for support appear to be furthest along the path of sustainability. Russia is home to some of the world’s most important fisheries, for instance, and the country’s fishing firms have made sustainability commitments. The walleye pollock fishery in the Sea of Okhotsk has earned the Marine Stewardship Council sustainability certification, and the cod fishery in the Barents Sea also serves as a model of international cooperation on sustainability. Forestry is another area where Russia is a world-leading power: the forests that cover 45% of Russian land account for 22% of the world’s forests. Although progress is slower on sustainable forestry than fishing, more than 33m hectares of Russian forests have already earned the Forestry Stewardship Council certification for responsible forest management, and environmental nonprofit World Wildlife Fund Russia is partnering with Russian forestry companies and multinationals, including TetraPak and Avon, to spread the adoption of FSC’s sustainable forestry management practices. Despite its isolation, Russia casts a big shadow across both Europe and Asia, not least because of its position at the center of the former Soviet Union. And while Ukraine stands most fully in Russia’s shadow – not only because of its ongoing geopolitical conflict with Russia, but also from the economic devastation that has resulted from that conflict – Ukraine is not alone in that shadow. The sanctions levied against Russia by the European Union, the US and others in the wake of the Ukraine crisis have affected countries farther afield as well. After all, Russia retaliated by levying its own sanctions, including a ban on food imports from EU members. This has eliminated about €320m ($358m) in produce sales from Poland to Russia, devastating Polish apple producers. Even as some European producers have been harmed by Russia’s sanction, some Russian producers have seen it as a great boon, even if sanctions in both directions have made the markets more volatile.  In Russia’s Far East, the nation is entangled with China, Mongolia and other Asian nations, especially in energy and fisheries projects. Ongoing sanctions from the West could end up strengthening ties between Russia and its Asian neighbors: last month, China and Russia announced the formation a $200m joint clean tech incubator. Although Russia’s transformation into a hub of clean energy innovation seems like a long shot, it also seems equally necessary. As its economy shrinks, a dramatic change of course may be the only move that will prevent Russia from a backward slide out of the realm of global economic powerhouses.

"The Democratic presidential primary race got its second major candidate last week, and its first true climate hawk: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, self-described democratic socialist. Sanders has one of the strongest climate change records in the Senate. In fact, according to rankings released last week by Climate Hawks Vote, a new Super Pac, Sanders was the No 1 climate leader in the Senate for the 113th Congress that ended in January. Climate Hawks Vote measures leadership, not just voting records, tabulating actions like bills introduced, speeches given, and so forth. In the 112th Congress, Sanders ranked third behind Sheldon Whitehouse, Senator for Rhode Island, and Jeff Merkley, Senator for Oregon. In the last Congress, he edged out Whitehouse by one point.  “Sanders is very much among the top leaders,” says RL Miller, founder of Climate Hawks Vote. “He has a record of really strong advocacy for solar in particular.” Miller notes that distributed solar, which enables everyone with a solar panel to create their own energy instead of relying on a monopolistic utility company, fits especially well with Sanders’ democratic socialist philosophy. It’s bad for corporations and good for regular folks who get to own the means of production. Here are some of the highlights from Sanders’ climate and clean energy record: So we know Sanders is dedicated to climate action and clean energy. Looking forward, though, it’s unclear how Sanders will differentiate his climate and energy proposals from Clinton’s. Clinton, like President Obama, firmly supports regulating carbon emissions domestically and getting strong international agreements to reduce emissions globally. While it is certainly true that Sanders has made more of an issue of his support for the same, it is not necessarily an issue on which Clinton needs to be pushed leftward. Many climate hawks love the fee-and-dividend approach that Sanders supports, but the truth is that no big climate-pricing bill will pass in the next few years, no matter who’s president, because the Republicans will continue to control the House for years to come. And Clinton already supports the kind of strong executive action that Obama is taking to curb CO2 emissions from power plants. One way Sanders could set himself apart as the greenest candidate would be to propose clamping down on domestic fossil fuel extraction, especially on federal lands and waters – something a president could move on without congressional approval. Sanders has not spoken up about the extraction issue in general, but he could call for a moratorium on fossil fuel leasing offshore or on federal land. That would please climate activists, who are already expressing concern that Clinton isn’t committed to keeping dirty fuel sources in the ground. “What we really need,” says Miller, “is someone to advocate for closing down the Powder River Basin” – an area in Montana and Wyoming that’s a huge source of coal mined from federal land – “but no one is really willing to come out and say that, so instead they come out for higher prices on coal leases. Sanders has not.” In an interview with The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent, Sanders called for a progressive climate agenda that includes a carbon tax and investments in renewables, energy efficiency, and alternative transportation – but he made no mention of restricting fossil fuel development. Here is what he offered: A tax on carbon; a massive investment in solar, wind, geothermal; it would be making sure that every home and building in this country is properly winterised; putting substantial money into rail, both passenger and cargo, so we can move towards breaking our dependency on automobiles. And leading other countries around the world. Bill McKibben, who founded 350.org and has led the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, says he is confident Sanders understands the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Sanders has opposed Keystone, while Clinton has avoided taking a position on it. “He’s been the most consistent and proactive voice in the entire Keystone fight,” writes McKibben in an email. “Everything that’s been needed – from speeches on the floor to legislation to demands that the State Department change its absurd review process – he and his staff have done immediately and with a high degree of professionalism. On climate stuff he’s been the most aggressive voice in the Senate, rivalled only by Sheldon Whitehouse. He understands it for the deep, simple problem it is: that we can’t keep burning this stuff.” (Full disclosure: McKibben is a member of Grist’s board of directors.) One area where Sanders indisputably differs from Clinton is trade. Clinton, like her husband and Obama, has been an ardent supporter of free trade agreements. Some environmentalists worry that these agreements – like NAFTA, CAFTA, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that is currently under consideration – give polluting companies too much power to undermine environmental regulations in signatory nations. As secretary of state, Clinton supported the TPP, although as a candidate her campaign advisers say she hasn’t made up her mind on it. Sanders is one of the most sceptical members of the Senate on trade agreements and he is currently helping to lead the charge against the TPP. To describe Sanders’ challenge against Clinton as uphill would be too generous. It’s more like climbing Mt Everest – without oxygen or a guide. But by bringing attention to some of these issues, he may raise awareness and draw Clinton out. Sanders’ office declined to comment for this story, citing an overwhelming number of interview requests following announcement of his candidacy. That speaks to the megaphone a presidential campaign can grant a candidate, especially in a nearly empty field. Sanders is sure to use it for worthy causes. Will keeping fossil fuels in the ground be one of them?"
"Record-breaking hot years in England have become at least 13 times more likely because of manmade climate change, scientists have discovered.  The new study suggests England faces a “significant and substantial increase” of years similar to 2014, which was the hottest on record worldwide and the warmest in England since records beganmore than three and a half centuries ago.  Dr Geert Jan van Oldenborgh from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, who co-authored the study, said climate change had become so influential on the world’s weather that its effects could be modelled at increasingly local levels. “Climate change has become so strong over the last 10 to 15 years that you can really sense it now on the local level. Fifteen years ago you could only really see it if you looked at the global mean temperature. And now any old thermometer can show you that the temperatures are increasing,” he said. The international team used computer models to compare years of natural variation with years with the current level of manmade warming. Lead author Dr Andrew King, from the University of Melbourne, said larger scale continental or global modelling tended to iron out regional variabilities. “As a result of this low variability, it is easier to spot anomalies. This is why larger regions tend to produce stronger attribution statements, so it is remarkable that we get such a clear anthropogenic influence on temperatures in a relatively small area across central England,” he said. Central England has the world’s longest running temperature record, dating back to 1659. Van Oldenborgh said the changes observed by weather watchers over the last 356 years matched closely with the findings of the models. He said the 13-fold increase was at the lowest end of predictions and the increase was realistically higher. The first quarter of this year has already been warm globally, smashing all previous records just months before governments meet in Paris at the end of the year for major UN climate summit. Van Oldenborgh said record hot years were not useful for indicating the effects of extreme weather under climate change - 2014 did not contain a single record hot month in England despite its overall record. But he said the study was a stepping stone towards being able to isolate the contribution of greenhouse gases to single events, such as the UK’s flooding two winters ago. “It’s good to show that the Earth is getting warmer. I don’t know if anybody was really impacted by an annual mean high temperature. The numbers here are so big that we think we can go from an annual mean to even smaller scale events, like heat waves and floods,” he said. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said the study provided further evidence that UK’s the weather had begun to respond to climate change in ways that were already affecting people’s lives, from their homes to their health. “As the atmosphere warms, it can hold more water, leading to heavier rainfall. Many people, particularly farmers and gardeners, are already observing these impacts, for instance, through spring arriving earlier, and a gradual shifts in the location of some plant and animal species. But climate change is also increasing the risk of flooding, both inland from rainfall and along our coasts due to sea level rise, and the risk of heatwaves,” he said. "

"Food wasted by consumers is an enormous economic problem and nations should ensure excess food is given to the hungry instead of being thrown away, agriculture ministers from the G20 said on Friday.  The two-day meeting in Istanbul has focused on problems of food security and nutrition, including the impact of climate change. A reduction in the amount of food wasted would improve food security, the ministers said in their final communique.  “We note with great concern the significant extent of food loss and waste ... and their negative consequences for food security, nutrition, use of natural resources and the environment,” the ministers said.  “We highlight this as a global problem of enormous economic, environmental and societal significance.“  An estimated 1.3bn tonnes of food, or roughly 30 percent of global production, is lost or wasted annually, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said last year.  UN agencies said this would easily feed the world’s 800 million hungry.  To fight the problem, countries need better estimates of the amount of food they waste, as well as the economic impact of food loss, the G20 ministers said."

"New Zealand is eyeing up international carbon markets to meet any climate commitments, the government revealed in a consultation this week. Slammed by Greens as “seriously flawed”, the document emphasised the costs of cutting greenhouse emissions at home.  It claimed for the same level of cost as the European Union’s 40% reduction from 1990 to 2030, New Zealand would allow emissions to grow 10-20%. “While we are committed to doing our fair share and taking responsibility for our emissions we face particular challenges, and setting an emissions reduction target will not be easy,” climate change minister Tim Groser wrote in the foreword. The average New Zealander emits 17 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, compared to a world average of 8 tonnes. Unusually for a developed country, half of New Zealand’s emissions are from agriculture, described as “our hardest problem to address”. Forests planted since 1990 have helped offset its emissions said the government, but much of this is expected to be harvested in the next 15 years, meaning it will lose a significant carbon sink. With 80% of electricity already generated by renewables, the report said there was “less room to reduce emissions in this area” than for other countries. It did identify opportunities to develop electric vehicles and biofuels; important for a sparsely populated country with high use of road transport. But ultimately it said “we are likely to need international carbon market access to help meet our target”. In the most controversial section, the government estimated the cost to households of emissions cuts between 5 and 40% by 2030 from a 1990 baseline. These ranged from NZ$1,270 to $1,800 a year in 2027, or 1-2% of the projected NZ$85,000 average income under business as usual. The focus on costs drew fierce criticism from Russel Norman, Green MP, who described the document as “unbalanced and inaccurate”. “Fighting climate change need not cost households,” he said. “The government is trying to make New Zealand pledging a decent target look expensive to suit its political goal of doing nothing. “The government has written a consultation document to suit its head-in-the-sand approach to protecting our economy and environment from the threat of climate change.” Lots of waffle about the costs of #climate action. Nothing about the (much higher) costs of inaction. http://t.co/4F7ybYt3E2 The Green Party is urging New Zealand to “at least” match the EU target of a 40% emissions cut by 2030. Norman cited the New Climate Economy report, written by leading economists and fronted by former Mexico president Felipe Calderon, which makes the case for green growth. It shows moving to a low carbon economy is “a major economic opportunity,” Norman said, while government “continues with its twentieth century mindset of seeing emission reductions as a cost”. The consultation will inform New Zealand’s draft national target it expects to submit to the UN “towards the middle of this year”. Together with other national plans, it will form the basis of a global climate deal countries hope to agree in Paris this December. The consultation indicates New Zealand will promote a role for carbon markets in the international agreement. New Zealand is largely relying on its emissions trading system to meet its existing goal of a 5% carbon cut by 2020. With emitters able to meet their obligations with cheap UN offsets, the carbon price has fallen to less than 5 cents a tonne. Advocates argue that links between the growing number of national and regional carbon markets can drive down the cost of climate action. But some countries are strongly opposed to any move that dilutes national responsibility and accountability for emissions cuts."

"Climate change campaigners have long liked to believe they are acting on the side of the angels. Now it seems the angels may be acting on the side of the climate change campaigners. The growing involvement of the world’s religious organisations in the fight to tame global warming, which will hit the poorest hardest, took a significant step forward on Friday when the Church of England for the first time decided that climate change was an ethical reason to dump some investments from its £9bn endowment. Earlier in the week, the Vatican called for a moral awakening on climate change, ahead of an encyclical from the pope, which is expected to be one of the most influential interventions in a year that ends with a crunch UN climate summit in Paris. With Methodists, Quakers, United Reformed Presbyterians and many other denominations across the UK and the world taking action on climate change by selling off their investments in coal, oil and gas, the question is how great an impact will the moral authority conferred by religious groups have? “In all the great social movements in history, a part of the church has always been at the forefront, such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu with apartheid, Baptist minister Martin Luther King with civil rights in the US, and William Wilberforce with slavery,” argues Christine Allen, Christian Aid’s director of policy and public affairs. “But there has always been a bit of the church at the back too – the church is broad. It takes a while to get to agreement, but when that happens things move very fast. We really are at that tipping point now.” Tutu, revered for his role in helping to defeat apartheid in South Africa, has already given his whole-hearted backing to fossil fuel divestment. “People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change,” he told the Guardian in 2014. The movement is growing rapidly, with more than 200 organisations already having divested, including cities, universities, charitable foundations and the Guardian Media Group, after the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign asked the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust medical charities to divest from fossil fuels. Oxford University is among many institutions set to make a decision in the coming months.  A series of analyses have shown that the world’s existing reserves of fossil fuels are several times greater than can be burned while keeping the temperature below the 2C safety limit agreed by the world’s governments. So proponents of divestment say it is wrong to invest in fossil fuel companies that still spend many billions a year looking for more coal, oil and gas. Furthermore, authorities such as the World Bank and Bank of England have warned that fossil fuel reserves will be left worthless if the action needed to cut carbon emissions kicks in.  Bill McKibben, an environmentalist and divestment campaigner, says: “The financial case for action is clear but churches are, or should be, specialists in identifying that other kind of risk, where human beings don’t pay enough attention to the poorest and most vulnerable among us. When the Church of England acts, or the pope speaks, it’s a potent reminder.” Ben Caldecott, director of the Stranded Assets programme at Oxford University, notes that the aim of the divestment campaigners is to bankrupt fossil fuel companies morally, not financially, and that religious groups have a special significance in creating this stigma.  “Faith groups remain influential in shaping societal norms and views of particular industries,” he says. “But even if this impact is limited in increasingly secular societies, it still provides succour to those within non-faith groups pushing for divestment. Either way, I think it increases the reputational risk for fossil fuel companies.” The financial argument for divestment appeals particularly to investors with long-term objectives, meaning faith groups are playing a significant role, says Mark Campanale, founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, which pioneered the financial analysis of the carbon bubble. “You could not get a group more long-term in their outlook – they have been around for millennia,” he says. Another feature of religious groups is their international reach, potentially helping to bridge the differences between nations that have dogged climate change negotiations to date. “Faith groups are transnational tribes and can bring different political forces together,” says Allen. There are many religious organisations with significant endowments now expressing anxiety about fossil fuel investments to their fund managers, which is making ripples in the fund management world, Campanale says.  “The fund managers are having to work out what to do and dig into the risks. One of the fundamental rules of investment management is you cannot ignore your clients, and when you get a significant client [like the Church of England] come along and express concern, you have to sit up and take notice, or when your three-year contract is up, you’ll be gone.” However, a frequent counter-argument to divestment is that it is better to remain invested and engage with a fossil fuel company to change its behaviour, and the Church of England’s divestment was not complete. It sold off £12m of highly polluting coal and tar sands investments, but retains about £100m in, for example, Shell. That has disappointed campaigners, who point out that part of Shell’s operations are in tar sands and exploiting the Arctic, both deemed incompatible with tackling climate change by scientists. Its new benchmark of accepting companies that derive less than 10% of revenue from thermal coal (used for generating electricity) still allows it to invest in firms with some of the largest coal reserves on the planet. Some observers among the faithful raise questions about the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who had a career in the oil industry before becoming a priest. “There is a sense of disappointment that Welby has not spoken out more,” said one, requesting anonymity. “But the pope and the Paris summit have forced his hand and he’s expected to speak publicly on this issue in the autumn.” The Rev Canon Giles Goddard, who is campaigning for full divestment from the Church of England, said this week’s steps were a symbolic beginning. He wants the church to use its influence in the wider world: “People do look to the Church of England for leadership on ethical investment, which is why we got into so much trouble over [our investments in pay-day lender] Wonga.” Cardinal Peter Turkson, who drafted the forthcoming papal encyclical, drew on the Bible for his message this week: “The lesson from the Garden of Eden still rings true today: pride, hubris, self-centredness are always perilous, indeed destructive. The very [fossil fuel] technology that has brought great reward is now poised to bring great ruin.”"
"Pope Francis has warned “the powerful of the Earth” they will answer to God if they fail to protect the environment to ensure the world can feed its population. “The planet has enough food for all, but it seems that there is a lack of willingness to share it with everyone,” Francis said at a mass to mark the opening of the general assembly of the Catholic charitable organisation Caritas.  “We must do what we can so that everyone has something to eat, but we must also remind the powerful of the Earth that God will call them to judgment one day and there it will be revealed if they really tried to provide food for Him in every person and if they did what they could to preserve the environment so that it could produce this food.” The striking comments from the Argentinian pontiff came ahead of the upcoming publication of a papal encyclical on the ethical aspects of environmental issues that is eagerly awaited by campaigners for action to address global warming. An encyclical is a statement of fundamental principles designed to guide Catholic teaching on a subject. It is issued in the form of a letter from the pope to bishops around the world. Campaigners on climate change believe that a signal from Francis that the church considers global warming a grave danger could influence the global discussion on the severity of the problem, what has caused it and what can be done. The pope is due to address the UN Special Summit on Sustainable Development in September and the international community will seek to reach a universal agreement on climate change at a summit in Paris in December. Climate change sceptics have warned Francis not to take sides in the debate but all the signs so far are that he sees the problem as man-made and as one which can be alleviated by political action. Caritas is a confederation of 165 Catholic charity and aid groups operating in 200 countries worldwide. It holds a general assembly once every four years. This year’s meeting, the first under Francis’s papacy, runs to Saturday. The archbishop of Manila, Luis Antonio Tagle, is tipped to take over from the Honduran cardinal Oscar Rodríguez Maradiaga as the organisation’s president, the latter cleric having served the maximum two terms."
" What is the purpose of a museum? Merely to transmit knowledge or to help shape the world for the common good? That is the crux of a live debate among museum professionals that burst into the open earlier this year. In an open letter that was picked up by news sites around the world (including the Guardian) dozens of top scientists, including several Nobel laureates and senior government officials, made a plea for science museums to cut all ties to the fossil fuel industry.  They wrote: When some of the biggest contributors to climate change and funders of misinformation on climate science sponsor exhibitions in museums of science and natural history, they undermine public confidence in the validity of the institutions responsible for transmitting scientific knowledge. This corporate philanthropy comes at too high a cost. The letter was coordinated by our organisation, The Natural History Museum (not the one in London but a US-based institution launched in 2014) and within days, more than 100 members of the scientific community reached out to add their support. Together with this growing list of signatories, we are asking museums of science and natural history to drop climate science deniers from their boards, cancel sponsorships from the fossil fuel industry, and divest financial portfolios from fossil fuels.  We believe that this stance flows directly from the American Alliance of Museums’ Code of Ethics, which states:  “It is incumbent on museums to be resources for humankind and in all their activities to foster an informed appreciation of the rich and diverse world we have inherited. It is also incumbent upon them to preserve that inheritance for posterity.” Many of our colleagues in the museum sector have noted that institutional policy protects sponsors from influencing either administration or programming. We are told that funding is only accepted on the condition that there are no strings attached. Strings, however, need not be visible to make an impact, and self-censorship – however invisible or unquantifiable – is a major factor in every institutional decision. Nobel laureate Eric Chivian recently put it this way: “It is just human nature not to bite the hand that feeds you.”  Sponsorships do have an effect at every level, and when a sponsor is known for his anti-science practices, that sponsor circumscribes the very horizon of the possible, not through coercion, but through the invisible threat of withdrawal. Imagine a major natural history museum that organizes an exhibition about the full range of causes and impacts of climate change, obstacles to action, and solutions/responses – one that directly and forcefully critiques the anti-science practices of its largest sponsor. That might be a corporation such as BP or a private benefactor such as David Koch, whose businesses are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and historical funders of groups that have fostered climate denial. Would this exhibition offer a scientifically accurate educational experience about anthropogenic climate change? Yes. Would it risk jeopardizing the museum’s relationship with its sponsor? We believe that it would. Is the risk worth taking? It is imperative. In a time of profound environmental disruption, it is not enough for museums to accept the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change. We need museums of science and natural history to take a stand, to call out the biggest polluters and obstructionists to action on climate change. Faced with pervasive attempts by the fossil fuel lobby to muzzle scientific research and spread disinformation, countless scientists have stood together to declare that the time for neutrality has long since passed. Museums, like scientists, have historically maintained a position characterized by museologist Robert Janes as authoritative neutrality. This widely held position affirms that “we must protect our neutrality, lest we fall prey to bias, trendiness or special interest groups.” But as Janes points out, as museums increasingly depend on private-sector sponsorship, their claims to neutrality take on an ideological bent. After all, what are corporations if not special interest groups? Neutrality is a political category, one that hides from view the alternatives against which it is defined. And the claim to authoritative neutrality is dangerous, precisely because it prevents institutions from seriously re-evaluating their roles in a time of climate crisis. At a time when powerful lobbies representing the interests of the fossil fuel industry seek not only to influence public policy but also buy the next election, we can only see neutrality as another word for resignation. And as the overwhelming majority of climate scientists predict, without taking action, there will be no future, let alone a future for museums. Museums of science and natural history are indispensable public spaces for the transmission of knowledge about the world we live in. They are among the most trusted sources of information. But when these institutions have significant ties to the world’s biggest polluters, or ignore the massive impact of the fossil fuel industry on the continuity of the earth’s many species, we are forced to question whose interests they serve. When museums cozy up to climate deniers and fossil fuel companies, they risk undermining the faith and trust they’ve earned through years of dedicated service. As sites that both represent and supply basic societal infrastructure, museums of science and natural history are not just necessary; they are worth fighting for. We are urging museums of science and natural history to rise to the challenges of the present. This means presenting exhibitions on climate change that address the role of the fossil fuel lobby and its climate-denial machine in the shaping of nature – exhibitions that take on anthropogenic climate change without excluding the vast asymmetries in the burden of responsibility and the burden of impact. If there is to be a future for museums, we need to do away with the false promise of authoritative neutrality. We need our museums to function as both educators and yes, as advocates for a sustainable and equitable future. Only then can we equip visitors with the stories and tools they need to truly understand the rapidly changing world, and to shape it for the common good for generations to come."

"Regardless of the surprise of the press gallery, anyone paying attention realised Christine Milne would have been thinking deeply about her future. With her first grandchild on the way, the planet’s future would also have been brought into a stark new light. Milne can be confident that she steered the Greens through a hugely difficult period, bringing a new strategic focus to campaigning and beautifully mentoring a new crop of advocates. But it is climate change which keeps her awake at night, and she has had to consider where she could most effectively focus her efforts in the critical years ahead.  Climate change defines Milne’s legacy, and points to what she will do next. But it also holds the central message for our politics from her departure. While I have the utmost respect for Richard Di Natale and his team, no matter how well the Greens advocate or negotiate, they are a small team up against a Coalition government antagonistic towards climate action, a Labor opposition which still fails to understand the depth of the crisis we face, and a media which struggles to grapple with climate policy. Who can blame her for concluding that Australian parliamentary politics is a poor place right now from which to work for radical climate change action?  Milne’s deep knowledge of (and passion for) climate science and policy is legendary in and around parliament. Less well known is her record on climate change over the last quarter century. In 1990, while a member of the Tasmanian Parliament, she was appointed alongside Joan Kirner and Rupert Hamer to Australia’s first Greenhouse Council. She moved to the international arena in 1998 and was elected to the Global Council of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2000. She was elected its vice president in 2004, the same year she was elected to the Senate. From all of these positions, Milne worked to build awareness and acknowledgement of climate change. More deeply, she challenged us to grapple with its deep ramifications for our economies, our politics and our lives. When I joined Milne’s staff in 2007, it was my privilege to work with her to bring that perspective to the Australian parliament and political debate. If you cast your mind back to 2007, you will probably recall the feeling of hope and opportunity. The IPCC and Al Gore had won the Nobel Peace Prize, John Howard was forced to propose an emissions trading scheme, and Kevin Rudd was sailing to power partly on a wave of support for ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. You might also recall how simplistic the debate was. It was opportunistic, symbolic politics – like so much of what Kevin Rudd stood for – without real change. Indeed, contemplating science-based cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, or a challenge to the dominance of coal powe,r could not have been further from the minds of the Coalition, Labor or our media. Milne’s role in bringing depth to the climate change debate through that period was vital to the tremendous election result for the Greens in 2010. She capitalised on that by proposing the Multi Party Climate Change Committee as a condition of supporting the Gillard government, insisting on experts sitting on the committee, and shepherding through it the best possible result that could have been achieved. She also used the process to increase the understanding of climate change in the community. While we have, of course, lost the carbon price, the Climate Change Authority and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation remain – and both are Milne’s hard-won achievements. More importantly, the idea that we cannot be serious about climate change without phasing out coal remains and is growing ever stronger. No future government will be able to get away with what Tony Abbott has done, and that is in no small part thanks to Milne’s efforts. I believe Milne will step back into the international arena and make waves in the years ahead. She leaves behind a domestic political scene far better for her service but still not ready to do what it takes to address climate change. Despite the leadership of Christine Milne, this is huge indictment on our politics that points to the need for very deep change indeed."

"“Now is the time to act on climate change.” Variations on this sentiment have been frequently repeated throughout the 21st century by all kinds of leaders: Ban Ki-Moon, UN secretary-general; Jorma Korhonen, director general of external economic relations for Finland’s foreign affairs ministry; Nasa climatologist James Hansen; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; environmental nonprofits, such as World Wildlife Fund for Nature; Jasmine Huggins, policy and advocacy officer for Haiti at hunger and poverty nonprofit Church World Service; and executives, such as Jean-Pascal Tricoire, CEO of Schneider Electric.  But the phrase has never been truer than it is right now: the longer we wait, the worse it will be. And while urgent action is needed across the world, particularly in the developed nations, the four largest developing economies – Brazil, Russia, India and China, collectively known as the BRICs – are critically important to the cause.  These four countries, with a combined population of 3 billion people and a GDP of $16tn, will have a huge direct impact on global emissions. Perhaps just as importantly, if they can get sustainable development right, they could pave the way for other developing countries to create economic opportunities without destroying the planet and oppressing workers and residents.  The routes the BRIC nations take will, for better or for worse, shape the path of sustainable development for the rest of the world. Clean energy or fossil fuels? Human rights or cheap labor? The decisions being made in the BRICs are top of mind for everyone reading the world’s economic and environmental tea leaves.  But what about the countries that sit in the shadow of the BRICs? Countries such as Colombia, Ukraine, Nepal, Indonesia and many others are on the path to becoming the next generation of economic powerhouses and sustainability leaders – or laggards. How are the BRICs’ practices and policies shaping, and shaped by, developments in neighboring countries as well as countries farther afield? For example, Brazil has invested in development projects in Guyana, Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and more. And while Brazil looms large in Latin America, it simultaneously lives in the shadow of China, its largest export partner. China’s current economic slowdown demonstrates the country’s impact on Brazil and other Latin American economies. It goes without saying that Russia heavily influences Ukraine, as evidenced by its annexation last year of the Crimean peninsula in a crisis that already has killed thousands. Sanctions from the European Union, the US and others have resulted in quid-pro-quo sanctions from Russia, including a ban on food imports from the EU.  In India, a desperate search for energy to meet rapidly growing demand is sending energy companies high into the Nepalese Himalayas to tap massive and undeveloped hydropower resources. Billion-dollar hydropower deals could bring prosperity to one of the world’s poorest countries, but hasty development could have wide ranging negative impacts on ecosystems and human rights. Meanwhile, the labor issues that China has long been known for – sweatshops, corruption, heedless pollution – are far from eliminated. But as China makes progress, improving regulations and worker livelihoods, these issues are rapidly spreading around the developing world, with factories in Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam and even Myanmar taking up the yoke.  This could spell trouble for global workers: Bangladesh, which captured global attention after the Rana Plaza disaster, was one of the first countries where manufacturers moved as Chinese costs rose.  These connections warrant exploration. Today, we’re launching a new series to examine how the BRICs – and the countries they influence – perceive and respond to their biggest sustainability challenges, such as energy, water, climate change and human rights.  We also will explore the role that business is playing in trying to solve these challenges. Whether it’s entrepreneurs seeking out new business ideas or industrial veterans undergoing sustainability epiphanies, what trends and innovations can serve as models for developed and developing countries alike?  Our coverage kicks off with primers on the state of sustainability in the BRICs, and the countries they influence:"
"The fossil fuel divestment movement just keeps on growing.  On Thursday, the Church of England announced it had sold £12m in two of the most polluting fossil fuels, tar sands oil and thermal coal.  Campaigners in the US are holding their breath for news of a divestment decision at Swarthmore College on Saturday. The meeting of the Board of Directors follows a student sit-in that lasted more than a month.  If the institution divests its $1.9bn (£1.2m) endowment from all fossil fuel companies, it will become the largest institution in the world to make the commitment. Swarthmore College, which was founded by a committee of Quakers, can also claim to be the birthplace of the divestment movement, as its campaign was the first to launch five years ago.  Back in the UK activists are celebrating the decision by Soas, University of London to divest from fossil fuels. The university is the first in the capital to make the commitment.  The fossil fuel industry is a bigger threat to health than tobacco, according to a group that represents 1 million medical students around the world. In an open letter to the Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation on Thursday, they write that investments in coal, gas and oil companies amount to a contravention of the solemn Hippocratic oath that doctors take before they start service.  The Wellcome book prize took place on Wednesday evening, with the award taken home by Marion Coutts for The Iceberg. After the ceremony she gave Keep it in the Ground her full backing, joining former poet laureate and chair of the panel Andrew Motion. “Really from a psychological point of view, climate change looks like the problem from hell”, says cognitive psychologist Daniel Kahneman in this week’s podcast. Episode six of the biggest story in the world asks: if we know that climate change is creating rising sea levels, food shortages and refugees, why do we find it so hard to care? You can download the podcast now. According to the Wellcome Trust, engagement with fossil fuel companies is a “more constructive and effective” way to combat climate change. They point to a recent shareholder resolution at BP, filed by a group of activists and investors. However, a series of Guardian interviews with activist shareholders suggests that all may not be as it seems.  The campaign hit headlines in India this week, with The Hindu publishing an interview with Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger. “I have had a feeling for a long time that this is an important story, if not the most important story of our lives” he told the national daily newspaper. We’d like to thank all the readers – from Hawaii to Ho Chi Minh city in Vietnam to the children of Mulgrave Primary School in London – who filmed messages asking Bill Gates to take a lead on climate change. It’s down to you that we were able to create this video showing the wealth of international support for the campaign. It was tweeted by activist Bianca Jagger and Finnegan Harries, creator of Jack’s Gap.  Does your love for Keep it in the Ground stretch to your wardrobe or morning brew? Then you’ll be pleased to know that you can now get your hands on campaign mugs and T-shirts, featuring artwork by Antony Gormley. On 26 May, Guardian Sustainable Business is hosting an event in London for Keep it in the Ground, with a panel that includes the economist Nick Stern, Alan Rusbridger and Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity. With all the available tickets taken in 24 hours, we’re moving to a bigger venue. Join our waiting list for our next release of tickets.  On 13 May, Guardian columnist and environmentalist George Monbiot will be talking in London to George Marshall, one of the world’s most eminent thinkers on climate change about why we are in denial and what we can do it about it. Tickets are available here.  Got an idea for the campaign? You can contact the team at keep.it@theguardian.com"
"A neurosurgeon who believes the human brain is too complex for anyone but God, an ophthalmologist who refuses to talk about the age of the Earth, and a Harvard-trained lawyer beloved by creationists are running for president of the United States, raising the prospect of an election without science.  Retired doctor Ben Carson joined senators Rand Paul (the ophthalmologist) and Ted Cruz (the Harvard alum) on the campaign trail on Monday, vying for the Republican nomination against each other and other confirmed and likely candidates including Senator Marco Rubio, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. But despite assorted elite educations and illustrious careers, none can apparently make up their minds about basics of modern science – that the Earth is about 4.5bn years old, that humans evolved from earlier primates over millions of years, and that people are making the world dangerously warm.  “I think on issues like climate change and evolution it ends up being a proxy for identity politics,” said Michael Halpern, a program manager for the nonprofit and nonpartisan Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). “You’re not actually talking about the science, you’re talking about values.” So far the candidates have mostly hemmed and hawed – save Carson, who outright rejected the theory of evolution when speaking to Faith & Liberty radio last year.  “Carbon dating, all these things,” he said “really doesn’t mean anything to a God who has the ability to create anything at any point in time. “Dealing with the complexity of the human brain,” Carson continued, “and somebody says that came from a slime pit full of promiscuous biochemicals? I don’t think so.” Curiously, Carson did not reject natural selection – the engine that drives evolution – saying he “totally believe[s]” that useful genetic traits are more often passed on than less useful traits. But he could not draw the connection between that process acting over millennia and the human eye: “Give me a break. According to their scheme – boom, it had to occur overnight.” Instead, he suggested an “intelligent creator” gave organisms the ability to adapt “so he doesn’t have to start over every 50 years creating all over again”.  Cruz – whose father has said evolution is a communist plot – has courted the creationist camp with only a dab more subtlety. While avoiding talk of his own beliefs, he announced his campaign at the evangelical Liberty University, which teaches creationism as science. Paul, Rubio and Walker have tried to duck the issue. In 2010 Paul refused to answer a Kentucky homeschool student’s question whether the Earth was only a few thousand years old, and in 2012 Rubio told GQ: “I’m not a scientist, man … I think parents should be able to teach their kids what their faith says, what science says.”  In February 2015, Walker earned the ridicule of his British hosts by dodging a question about evolution. Only Bush has said that he believes in evolution – way back in 2005. But he also said schools should sort out curriculums on their own. Because creationism and intelligent design cannot be tested and are not falsifiable, they do not meet the criteria of scientific theories. They might be valid topics for philosophy or religion classes, UCS argues, but when conflated with science make it harder for people to trust scientists.  “When other stories of creation are confused with evolution it muddies the waters,” Halpern said.  On climate change, the candidates fare little better – almost uniformly saying they are “skeptics” and that while global warming may be real it might not be our fault. Rubio accepts it but denies its origin; Bush, Paul and Cruz toe the skeptic line; Walker and Carson prefer to talk about regulations and resources. But Halpern suggested that the inch toward acceptance was progress: “Dodging questions about climate change is no longer an acceptable path forward, so Republicans and Democrats are shifting to talking about what to do about the impacts and away from the science itself.” More than the “values” issues of evolution and global warming, Halpern said, science might lose its say in government because of Congress, where a few candidates have shown their cards. Obscure bills such as the Secret Science Reform Act and Regulatory Accountability Act would undermine and handicap the ways federal agencies rely on science by forcing them to go through a glacial, bitter and mostly unproductive Congress. The secret science bill would require the EPA to release the data it uses to devise regulations – an aim seemingly inoffensive enough, except that the EPA often relies on confidential medical records whose release could land it in court. Other bills would require congressional approval for all new regulation, or give Congress the power to decide which scientists get to advise agencies.  The Obama administration has threatened to veto these bills, which fit the mold for bills that Paul, Cruz, Rubio, Walker and Carson have suggested they would sign. Each has consistently said they would shrink federal agencies and curtail regulations as president, and impose more rules on those agencies. “Wherever science threatens a vested interest, whether that be on greenhouse gas emissions or ideological issues like emergency contraception, you see an attempt to politicize science,” Halpern said. Only Nasa has escaped the direct ire of presidential candidates, as Cruz and Bush – both with major bases in their states – have lauded the space program. But Cruz has also harassed Nasa about its Earth and climate research, a sign of his greater interest in astronomical symbolism than science on planet Earth. The group Science Debate, noting that scientists weigh in on “economic, environmental, health, legal and moral implications”, plans to foist questions on the candidates in the coming months, in order to make them clarify their positions. Polls from last year back up the idea that some candidates are playing to their conservative base, if not their actual beliefs. Pew found that only about 43% of Republicans believe in evolution, compared with 60% of all American adults. Gallup found that 42% of Americans believe a deity created humans in their current form.
