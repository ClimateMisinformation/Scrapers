"You don’t have to travel to a balmy Pacific island to hear the anguish of people whose land and culture is under threat from climate change. In Virginia’s portion of the Chesapeake Bay, the idiosyncratic, and historic, community of Tangier Island is facing an uncertain future as the sea gnaws away at the land beneath them. A bird’s eye view of the island, just three miles long and one mile wide, would once have taken in a hook-shaped piece of land jutting out from the middle of the bay. The shape is more a teardrop these days, with erosion occurring at a bewildering rate. A new report by the US army corps of engineers, published in Scientific Reports, shows that just 33% of Tangier Island’s landmass in 1850 now remains. The main town of Tangier will be uninhabitable within 50 years if the current rate of sea level rise continues. The western portion of the island is crumbling into the sea like a wet cake. Around 14ft a year is lost to the sea. The eastern half is being eaten away too, albeit at a slower rate. The creeks that twist their way throughout the island are set to swell and break up the island into fragments, engineers warn. “The islands are shrinking and unless corrective action is taken they will be lost,” said David Schulte, author of the report. “The whole island won’t be underwater but it will turn into marshland. Tangier is only 1.2m above sea level now so a moderately severe sea level rise will put them in extreme jeopardy of storms and flooding. “Even under a low sea level rise they will have about a century. So far they’ve been pretty lucky with storms. They were spared the brunt of Hurricane Sandy. I don’t think it would’ve recovered from that. We’ll have to keep our fingers crossed on that score.” Schulte says Tangier is being swamped by a “perfect storm” that is pushing the sea level increase to almost double the global average of a 3.5mm rise each year. An unhappy confluence of changing Atlantic currents, glacial retreat and sinking soils due to groundwater extraction risks turning this slice of American heritage into washed-out husk. Tangier Island lies 12 miles from the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay and a mere 91 miles from Washington DC. Congressional delegations need not look far to witness the ravages of climate change. You don’t even need to be a scientist to see what’s happening on Tangier. Tangier Island was used as a summer camping spot for many years by the Pocomoke. The tribe’s arrowheads are still occasionally unearthed on the beach following a storm. Europeans, led by Captain John Smith, explored the island in 1608. It was settled John Crockett, still a common surname on the island, and his eight sons in 1686. Along with Crocketts, there are plenty of Pruitts and Parks on Tangier. These families’ link to the island stretch back hundreds of years and are found liberally etched on tombstones that adorn the front yards of many houses, due to a lack of space and fear that they would be washed away – most of Tangier Island lies just four feet above sea level. Living on Tangier Island, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is a little like stepping back in time. There is no reliable cellphone reception. The island is, officially, alcohol free. Most of the buildings were built before 1930. Doors are left unlocked. “It’s one of the last true colonial places left in the US,” said Renée Tyler, Tangier’s town manager. “It’s not like Williamsburg, which is all fancied up. We don’t have people bringing money here to fancy us up. We are a proud, hardworking community. There are strong morals and ethics. It’s a religious place.” Fishing has long provided the backbone, culturally and economically, for Tangier Island. Fishermen, or watermen as they are known now, haul out more Chesapeake Bay blue crab than any other community living on the water, despite having a population that has dropped from about 1,200 in 1900 to an estimated 475 today. These crabs are consumed with relish in the fine restaurants of Washington DC and along Maryland’s Eastern Shore in crab cakes or cooked whole and smashed with a mallet, but the market isn’t quite what it was. Locals bemoan new regulations that restrict catches in the prime months between May and September. Equipment costs have risen while crab incomes have flatlined. Tyler’s husband ran a crab operation before his boats and pots were broken by the fury of Hurricane Isabel in 2003. He went back to crabbing for a couple of years before leaving the island to find work on the tugboats that run the nearby shipping lanes, taking oil to refineries. “He wasn’t the only one,” Tyler said. “So many of them do that now. There aren’t many men on the island for two weeks of each month while they are on the tugboats. It’s an older community now. There isn’t much for younger people here.” Tyler speaks with a distinctive Tangier accent, a sort of unreconstructed dialect that has its roots in south-west England. Extra syllables are added to words, the word “tourist” (tourism has sadly dropped off in recent years) sounds a little like “terror royalist”. Saving this outpost will take time, and money. In 1990 a stone jetty was built by the airstrip to prevent it being eroded away. There are further plans for a new seawall around the harbour, which is being opened up to the elements by the disappearing land: “We even have waves in the creeks now, the boats aren’t safe even in a normal wind,” Tyler said. But more will be needed. The US army corps of engineers estimates it will take up to two years to protect the whole island by building sea walls, new wide beaches and creating a new system of dunes. Wetlands, which are declining in viability as seabird nesting sites, would be replenished by filtering small amounts of sand upon them, elevating them without smothering the vegetation. “It would cost around $20m to $30m,” Schulte said. “Hopefully Congress will look at this report and decide that this island is worth saving. A lot of people think sea level rise is something a long way off, but this is affecting people now.” For Tyler, and others born and raised on the island, fleeing isn’t an option, even if the long-term prospects are bleak. “We are feeling pretty desperate but people won’t be just giving up, we’ll fight to the end,” she said. “The only time I feel isolated here is when the bay freezes over. Other than that, the storms don’t really scare us, we just roll with it. Obviously if there’s a 200mph hurricane we’ll evacuate but people want to stay. You have to grow up here and live here to love it the way we do.”"

"Negotiators in Paris are within reach of a global agreement to curb greenhouse emissions to 2030 and beyond, with the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, saying the meeting was “extremely close to the finishing line” as he presented a draft text that cut through many key sticking points. After reading the draft and chairing a meeting of the so-called “umbrella group” of developed nations, the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said she thought the text was “about 80% there”.  “There’s a lot of work still to be done, particularly on the issue of climate finance and on the issue of the developing/developed country divide … but I remain hopeful that we will secure an agreement,” she said. Leading non-government observers agreed the talks were finally making headway. Jennifer Morgan, the global director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute, said there had been “very significant progress”. But Fabius said the negotiations would overrun by a day and finish on Saturday, according to a UN spokesman. UN climate talks are notorious for overrunning, with one meeting in Durban in 2011 rolling into the early hours of Sunday, and after talks through the early hours here in Paris, the hosts have admitted the summit will overrun.  The marathon talks have become an exercise in diplomatic attrition, with Fabius giving countries two hours to look at the latest draft before yet another less formal meeting – known as an indaba, a Zulu word for meeting – beginning at 11.30pm Paris time. He said this all-night session would be an “indaba of solutions” and negotiators would be given 30 to 45 minutes in a corner of the room to settle any impasse. It comes after negotiators met through Wednesday night in two indabas, allowing all countries to once again vent their concerns. “I hope I will present a final text tomorrow … it will allow us to complete the final lap,” Fabius said before the negotiating teams began poring over the text, in which the French had narrowed options and chosen compromise solutions. “We must do this and we can do this … I think, dear friends, that we will make it.” On Wednesday night, each indaba had seats for about 80 negotiators, with more crowding in at the back. One, chaired by Fabius, met until 5am on Thursday. A second, chaired by the Peruvian environment minister, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, met until 8am. According to veteran negotiators, the indabas had made sure every country felt their views had been heard. “They spend about 80% of their time repeating their previous positions, maybe 10% outlining new positions and only about 10% of the time compromising,” said a negotiator who took part in one of the meetings. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, turned up at the Fabius-chaired meeting at about 2am on Wednesday and had what observers described as an “animated” discussion with the US climate change envoy, Todd Stern, at the back of the room for about 20 minutes, possibly about separate informal talks on the issue of “loss and damage” – the idea that the agreement should recognise some countries will suffer irreparable harm from climate change. The US is insistent any words about loss and damage should not suggest liability or compensation or open any possibility of legal action against US companies. Australia was represented by officials on Wednesday night. Bishop was on call but spent the night hosting a dinner for Australian business and environmental leaders attending the conference. The French presidency and the experts from the UN then spent Thursday once again carefully paring back the many areas of disagreement to further distil the big political issues it is hoped will form the basis of the final trade-off deal. A group called Parisagreement.org has analysed this task by counting the numbers of brackets – indicating disagreement. When the Paris meeting began there were 1,609 sets of brackets. In the Wednesday night text there were 361. By Thursday night, it was down to 50. The key issues of dispute have been honed since the talks began 11 days ago: The draft text proposes a global stocktake in 2019 – before the new greenhouse gas reduction pledges covering the period between 2020 and 2030 begin, and then national reviews in 2020 for countries with a 2025 target and the option of reviews for those with a 2030 target. Australia has promised to cut emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. The deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute, Erwin Jackson, said the conference was “on the cusp of getting the best possible outcome … but some key political issues remain to be resolved”."

"Each time the Seychelles’ roving ambassador for climate change returns home to the islands, he notices new clumsy piles of rocks disfiguring the beaches. Local people are blowing up the mountains inland, using the rocks to protect the sand from being swept out to sea by storm surges. “I will be in New York three or four months, go home and see the beach and will ask people: ‘What happened?’”, said Ronald Jumeau, the ambassador for climate change who is based at the United Nations mission. “And they will say: ‘Well, we had a storm, and the storm surge swept away the beach, so we had to put rocks down to protect it.”  The half a degree difference between the aspirational target of 1.5C – included in the draft text with the internationally agreed goal of 2C – is critical for small, low-lying coastal states. Small island countries – like Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands – but also the Philippines have been pressing since the failed Copenhagen conference of 2009 for negotiations to adopt 1.5C as the goal of climate negotiations. According to climate science, the tougher standard would give those lands a better chance of surviving rising seas, which threaten to flood their cities and drown the crops, and fuel dangerous storm surges. Even with a 1.5C temperature limit, there are no guarantees. It is a question of odds. But before the Paris meeting the coalition of vulnerable countries took on a new slogan: “1.5 to stay alive.” That applies to the Seychelles, too. Nearly two-thirds of the 115-island country are uninhabited coral islands. “We would lose all of them, but that’s not the important part,” said Jumeau. “It’s not just a question of islands slipping under. People think it’s a very simple story, but we would become a failed state. Our economy would collapse,” he said. Jumeau, speaking just moments after the French hosts made a passionate plea to the climate meeting to seize the historic moment and sign the agreement, ticked off the dangers to Seychelles without drastic action. “About 80% of the population, 80% of economic activity is in the coastal area, which is flat. We would lose our airport, which is our number one industry, tourism. We would lose our fishing port, which is our number two industry. We would lose our capital. We would lose all our power stations. We would lose all our schools, which are on the coast. All of our hotels are on the coast,” he said. Yes, it was true that people would still have room to retreat inland. “What can we do sitting on mountains? We can’t feed ourselves.” Unlike rich countries, the Seychelles did not have the capacity to invest in the infrastructure that would give it a better chance against the seas. The country was already heavily in debt – and the costs of shoring up reefs as natural storm barriers, installing early storm warning systems and building evacuation shelters and sea walls would run into many billions. Then again, Jumeau argued, some of the world’s richest cities were also finding themselves in a similar predicament – and could benefit from the higher 1.5C goal the island states had demanded. “I live on Manhattan. Manhattan needs 1.5C. So does Miami and so does Shanghai,” he said."
"Manmade climate change was partly responsible for Storm Desmond’s torrential rain which devastated parts of Scotland, the Lake District and Northern Ireland, scientists have concluded. The researchers at Oxford University and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) calculated that climate change had made the flooding event 40% more likely, with the estimate of the increased likelihood ranging between 5% and 80%.  “The increase we found is small but robust,” said Dr Friederike Otto from the environmental change institute at Oxford University. “Ten years ago we could could never make a link to climate change with a specific weather event. Now we can do it in real time. A positive attribution for an extreme rainfall event like Desmond is still rare.” Storm Desmond dumped 341mm (13.4 in) of rain in Honister, Cumbria, within 24 hours. This may be verified as a national record when more data is received next month. More than 5,000 homes across the region were flooded and 60,000 were left without power. The team used the combined computing power of thousands of desktop machines in people’s homes around the world that have been grouped together by the weather@home project. . The team ran tens of thousands of simulations of the weather event either with or without climate change to work out how much more likely it was in a world with global warming. Three different methodologies led to roughly the same conclusion of a 40% increase in risk. The research, which has been submitted to a journal for publication next year but is not yet peer-reviewed, also showed that it is now more likely for such intense rainfall to occur again – closer to one in 70 years than one in 100 years. The analyses show that climate change has affected the risk of floods in northern England and southern Scotland, but the scientists cautioned that risk is also affected by exposure and vulnerability, such as the quality of flood defences. The analysis of a single extreme weather event was possible in Britain because of the existence of detailed climate models and regional maps, but it is still impossible to tell whether extreme weather events in most developing countries can be attributed to climate change. In the last month, more than 300 people died in Chennai, India, as a result of extreme rains and flooding."
"Compared with previous UN conferences, there seems to be a far greater sense of optimism at the Paris climate talks. Before the start of the negotiations more than 146 countries, representing 86% of global emissions, submitted their plans to cut them. Yet this was deemed not enough: it would have only, according to the UNFCCC , limit temperature rises to 2.7C by 2100 – not the 2C scientists consider to be the maximum the world can tolerate.  There is hope. Over the 25 years of global climate talks what has been striking is the level of action taken not by states, but by regions and cities. The UNDP estimates that local authorities are responsible for more than 70% of climate change reduction measures and up to 90% of climate change. For local leaders, better air quality, lower energy costs, improved transport systems and green growth makes political and economic sense. That’s why the European Committee of the Regions – whose 350 members are mayors and councillors from all 28 member states – is calling for better recognition from the UN of the work local authorities do to tackle climate change. Local authorities are well-placed to develop collaborations that are fundamental to tackling climate change. My city of Espoo in Finland has a new sustainable policy group, which gathers politicians and top civil servants to stir citizen engagement and develop partnerships with industries and universities. Bristol, meanwhile, has laid out plans to cut carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 through initiatives such as its green capital partnership, which brings together more than 800 businesses, community partners and charities. The British city, selected as European Green City 2015 for its efforts, expects to save £300m in energy bills and create more than 10,000 jobs. Many local and regional governments have invested in sustainable transport to dent carbon emissions. The Swedish city of Malmö is a leading example: its gas-electric hybrid buses are expected to reduce emissions by 40% at a cost of only €15m.  Another area where local government is leading the way is in divestment. Councils, including Oxford, Lancashire, and Strathclyde in the UK, are moving their pension pots away from fossil fuel projects to investments in clean energy. In Europe, local governments are clearly taking the lead on climate action. The Covenant of Mayors – which asks cities and regions to agree to meet and exceed the EU’s 20% CO2 reduction target by 2020 – has signed up more than 6,500 authorities, representing 200 million people.  But mitigation is only half the story: adapting and building resilience to climate change ultimately falls on the shoulders of local and regional authorities, which are on the frontline in dealing with natural disasters. From using the natural environment to protect against disasters to providing rapid response units, preparing for climate change is high on the agenda for many local authorities.  The EU’s Mayors Adapt initiative encourages cities and regions to share experiences, exploit EU funds, and address knowledge gaps in climate adaptation. And it recently merged with the Covenant of Mayors, when a new target of at least 40% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 was agreed for local governments around the world that want to take part. What is clear is that local ambition often overrides national targets on climate action. After 25 years of UN conferences, the initial Paris draft agreement explicitly referred to the role of local and regional governments as key players in tackling climate change, but this looks as if it has been watered down. Finding an answer to climate change is not possible by going alone. We need a global governance structure that further supports, engages and mobilises regional and local governments together with the national and international ones. We need a roadmap that is ambitious, binding and, crucially, based on shared responsibility and partnership. National governments cannot afford to ignore local authorities in our shared fight to end climate change.

"Governments have signalled an end to the fossil fuel era, committing for the first time to a universal agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to avoid the most dangerous effects of climate change. After 20 years of fraught meetings, including the past two weeks spent in an exhibition hall on the outskirts of Paris, negotiators from nearly 200 countries signed on to a legal agreement on Saturday evening that set ambitious goals to limit temperature rises and to hold governments to account for reaching those targets.  Government and business leaders said the agreement, which set a new goal to reach net zero emissions in the second half of the century, sent a powerful signal to global markets, hastening the transition away from fossil fuels and to a clean energy economy. The deal was carefully constructed to carry legal force but without requiring approval by the US Congress - which would have almost certainly rejected it. After last-minute delays, caused by typos, mistranslations and disagreements over a single verb in the highly complicated legal text, Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, brought down a special leaf-shaped gavel to adopt the agreement. The hall erupted in applause and cheers. “It is a small gavel but I think it can do a great job,” Fabius said. François Hollande, the French president, who had invested enormous capital and diplomatic effort in shepherding the agreement, said countries had a rare chance to make history. “We are at a decisive point in time,” he said. Fabius said: “It is my deep conviction that we have come up with an ambitious and balanced agreement. Today it is a moment of truth.” The agreement was equally a victory for the United Nations, which spent four years overcoming political inertia and the deep divisions between rich and poor countries, to put together the ambitious deal. “I used to say: we must, we can, we will,” Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who guided the talks, tweeted. “Today we can say we did.” The US president, Barack Obama, hailed the agreement as “a tribute to strong, principled American leadership” and a vital step in ensuring the future of the planet. “This agreement represents the best chance we have to save the one planet that we’ve got,” he said, but added that the deal “was not perfect. The problem’s not solved because of this accord.” Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU’s climate commissioner, said the agreement had re-affirmed confidence in the UN process. “This was the last chance [for the UN process],” he added, “and we have taken it.”  Al Gore, the former US vice-president who helped draft the 1997 Kyoto climate treaty, was in the hall. He appeared visibly moved when the agreement was gavelled in and said the accord would have a powerful effect on the economy. “This universal and ambitious agreement sends a clear signal to governments, businesses, and investors everywhere: the transformation of our global economy from one fuelled by dirty energy to one fuelled by sustainable economic growth is now firmly and inevitably underway,” Gore said in a statement. Six years after the chaotic ending of the Copenhagen climate summit, the agreement now known as the Paris Agreement for the first time commits rich countries, rising economies and some of the poorest countries to work together to curb emissions. Rich countries agreed to raise $100bn (£66bn) a year by 2020 to help poor countries transform their economies. The overall agreement is legally binding, but some elements – including the pledges to curb emissions by individual countries and the climate finance elements – are not. The deal was also hailed for delivering a clear message to business leaders. The International Investors Group on Climate Change, a network managing €13tn of assets, said the decision would help trigger a shift away from fossil fuels and encourage greater investments in renewable energy. “Investors across Europe will now have the confidence to do much more to address the risks arising from high carbon assets and to seek opportunities linked to the low carbon transition already transforming the world’s energy system and infrastructure,” the group said. Jennifer Morgan, of the environmental thinktank, the World Resources Institute, said the long term goal was “transformational” and “sends signals into the heart of the markets”. The deal set a high aspirational goal to limit warming below 2C and strive to keep temperatures at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a far more ambitious target than expected, and a key demand of vulnerable countries. It incorporates commitments from 187 countries to reduce emissions, which on their own would only hold warming to between 2.7C and 3C. But it sets out procedures for review at regular intervals to deepen emissions cuts, with countries aiming to peak global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, and then rapidly scale down in the second half of this century. Critics said the agreement would still condemn hundreds of million of people living in low-lying coastal areas and small islands, after US negotiators demanded the exclusion of language that could allow the agreement to be used to claim legal liability for climate change. But supporters said the negotiations took a significant step forward in getting countries to act together on a global challenge of immense complexity. Saturday’s agreement was the product of years of preparation, two weeks of intense negotiations, capped off by three sleepless nights, with Barack Obama and Hollande phoning other leaders to bring them on side with the deal. Accounts from behind the closed doors of negotiating session described tense exchanges between oil-producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, and a rapidly constituted US- and Europe-backed High Ambition Coalition, which kept up the pressure for a strong temperature goal and regular reviews of emission-cutting plans. #ParisAgreement is adopted in #Paris at #COP21! #GoCOP21 pic.twitter.com/9wCxyshWa7 The French hosts also won praise from negotiators for using a mixture of informal huddles, or indabas, and traditional shuttle diplomacy to bring the deal home.  The text commits countries to peak greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, and to seek a balance between human-caused emissions and removals by carbon sinks. “This means bringing down greenhouse gas emissions to net zero within a few decades,” said John Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and a climate adviser to the Vatican. But he added that countries would have to move aggressively, peaking before 2030 and eliminating emissions by 2050 through reforestation and technologies such as carbon capture and storage. For vulnerable countries, the high ambition of the 1.5C goal was offset by the weakening of the agreement when it came to dealing with irreparable damage of climate change.  “The idea of even discussing loss and damage now or in the future was off limits. The Americans told us it would kill the COP,” said Leisha Beardmore, the chief negotiator for the Seychelles. “They have always been telling us: ‘Don’t even say that’.” Even so, campaign groups were broadly positive about the outcome. Given intense pressure from oil-producing countries, negotiators managed to craft a text that was far more ambitious than expected. The universal nature of the agreement was a radical departure from the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement that drew sharp divisions between the obligations of wealthy and developing countries but ultimately failed to lower emissions. Unlike Kyoto, the agreement reached on Saturday depends on political will, with countries setting their own climate action plans. Rich countries promised that by 2025 they would set a new goal for climate finance “from a floor of $100bn per year”, the figure first pledged at the Copenhagen climate talks six years ago. However, the commitment was offered as a non-binding decision that accompanied the binding text. All the countries agreed on demands from the US and European Union for five-year reviews of their emissions reductions – an exercise that had been resisted by China."

"Not everyone is equal in their capacity to recover from flooding. Tenure, for example, is a particular problem: people who rent privately and struggle to get their landlords to fix even minor problems in their homes may be up against significant challenges in the face of natural disaster. Meanwhile housing associations and councils, already blasted by cuts, are likely to struggle to repair homes quickly with dwindling funds and mass staff layoffs. Many socially deprived areas are also in high-risk flood areas: charting the Indices of Multiple Deprivation against maps of flood risk shows a high correlation between poorer areas and those vulnerable to flooding, especially as a result of rainwater flooding. Currently national policy frameworks for flooding fail to take into account socio-economic vulnerabilities in planning for climate change and flooding, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation warns. The scenes from Cumbria’s flooded villages were harrowing enough. The mental toll of having your home flooded is huge, but even more so for those with existing mental health problems, disabilities and older members of the communities hit.  So what is the government planning to do to mitigate the effects of increased flooding risk? Make sure you’re sitting down for this part. Almost half of the areas fast-tracked for new housing development by George Osborne are on floodplains, a Greenpeace investigation has shown. Meanwhile the number of staff in the flood and coastal erosion risk management section of the Environment Agency, which advises councils on flood risk, fell by 230 in the past three years. The government response to floods and climate change is completely shambolic. After cutting flood defence and Environment Agency funding, failing to stop rural policies that sharply increase flood risk and deciding to build homes to temper the housing crisis in areas at high risk of flooding, is not so much ignoring the problem as inflaming it. Cuts have consequences, as food banks and homelessness rates show, and cuts that ignore climate change are a deliberate social injustice to the poorest and most vulnerable tenants and homeowners. To add insult to injury, Flood Re, the government scheme designed to mitigate high insurance costs for tenants and homeowners at risk of flooding, has been described as needlessly expensive and inadequate by policy experts working in climate change and social policy. Often a million pound farmhouse in the top band of council tax will benefit, while a flat above or adjoining a commercial property will not, as the lease is purchased for the whole building. Anyone with a cursory knowledge of household budgets will tell you that someone who can afford a five-bedroom home will be far more financially resilient in an emergency than someone renting a two-bed flat for them and their children. The scheme, repeatedly delayed and now to be launched in April 2016, is likely to be lucrative for insurers, but still costly for those hit. A householder in the cheapest two bands of council tax will pay no more than £210 for the flood aspect of their buildings insurance, and the government hopes the scheme will keep down reportedly large excesses – as high as £20,000 for some – but there’s nothing in writing to guarantee this. Even more worrying is the fact Flood Re is likely to only apply to the 1-2% of properties most at risk of flooding: climate change and increased risk of flooding nationwide means far more people are now vulnerable. The sight of David Cameron in wellies and a hard hat will have done little to cheer up Lancaster’s flood stricken residents (haven’t they suffered enough?) but it may be a sight we’ll have to get used to, thanks to idiotic fiscal policy decisions.

"Governments trying to reach a climate change agreement in Paris have drawn “extremely close to the finish line” but will overrun into Saturday, according to the French foreign minister. With an agreement in sight to keep temperature rises in check and avoid dangerous global warming, Laurent Fabius called for a second all-night session of negotiations to try to bring 20 years of rollercoaster diplomacy to a successful close. Late on Thursday night, Fabius said the talks would finish on Friday as planned. But as overnight negotiations ran on, he admitted they would finish on Saturday. “I will not present the text Friday evening, as I had thought, but Saturday morning,” he said. “There is still work to do. Things are going in the right direction.” The latest version of a draft text, a slightly condensed 27 pages, retained a key demand made by low-lying and vulnerable states: to limit warming to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels and to seek to keep it to no more than 1.5C above. But when it came to recognising irreversible effects, such as land loss and migration, the draft was a disappointment, campaign groups said. “The current options provide no hope for people who will suffer the impacts of climate change the hardest,” WWF said. Christiana Figueres, the United Nations climate chief, said she remained confident that negotiators were closing in on a fair and ambitious agreement, but there were still big gaps. “The political crunch issues, as expected in any negotiation, remain open,” she said. These included climate finance for developing countries, transparency, and the most divisive issue of all: how to share responsibility for climate change between developed and developing countries. Key players in the negotiations, such as Brazil, insist a strong and durable climate agreement remains within reach. Izabella Teixeira, Brazil’s environment minister, said countries had stumbled in translating political goodwill into the dry language of diplomatic agreements. But she said she was confident countries would eventually arrive at an agreement strong enough to avoid dangerous climate change. “The agreement is done at the political level,” she said. “Everyone knows: OK, we can do this. What is not done yet is the language: how we can translate this common understanding about the next steps, and the progress to a flexible and transparent process, from political language into agreement language. This is the challenge we have today.” The deal taking shape in Paris has yet to assume its final form, but it has already delivered an important symbolic victory to vulnerable countries by recognising the 1.5C target.  Though a long shot given that the world has already warmed nearly 1C, the target was a key demand ofthose countries that would be devastated under the 2C internationally agreed target. The Climate Vulnerable Forum, a bloc of vulnerable countries, said 113 countries now support the 1.5C goal including industrialised countries such as the US, Canada, France and Germany, as well as the Holy See. “Over the last few days what I have seen is that we are getting more support to have 1.5C reflected in the agreement,” said Thoriq Ibrahim, the Maldives environment minister. “The bigger countries had not thought about it earlier, but I think because all the small island states have been saying: ‘This is what is happening to us. Recently we have been getting into so many disasters’, I think that is one of the reasons bigger countries are looking at it.” He said he was upbeat about the prospects for a strong deal. As midnight approached, Fabius and other officials continued their intense shuttle diplomacy, meeting key representatives of countries individually and in small groups to try to bridge the gaps between the various negotiating blocs. Negotiators also met in small informal huddles, or “indabas” as they are known in the climate negotiations. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, also played a hands-on role, meeting his Indian, Brazilian and Malaysian counterparts to try to win them over to a deal.  “We feel very good about the conversation we’ve just had,” said Kerry. “We need to work on language, and that is what most of today and tonight will be.” However, countries still struggled to deal with the most vexing problem of the talks – acknowledging the vastly different economic histories of industrialised and developing countries and their respective responsibility for climate change. “If you can untie differentiation then the other things can fall into place,” said Elliot Diringer, who follows the talks for the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. There were also strong challenges in reaching an agreement that would satisfy rich countries’ demands for transparency about emissions cuts and financing, and developing countries’ need for finance to move to green energy and improve infrastructure. Finding the exact language to unknot those problems as well as satisfy lawyers working for 196 countries – each with different economies and exposures to climate change – would be another challenge. Last year’s meeting in Lima ran more than 36 hours over time – and negotiators were essentially working on a document intended mainly as a holding position. This time, negotiators are seeking a durable agreement that would start in 2020 and be reviewed at regular intervals to ensure countries were meeting their emissions-cutting goals into the middle of the century and beyond.

"The landmark Paris climate change deal will likely have little effect on the Australian share market, which will take its cues from a sliding iron ore price and an impending US interest rate decision. CommSec economist Savanth Sebastian expects the local market will remain under pressure on Monday due to falls among mining and energy stocks.  “It’s going to be a volatile week,” he said on Sunday. “The ongoing slide in the ore price is concerning for not just the energy sector but even financial institutions.” While the overall market struggles with cheaper ore, transport logistics companies and airlines will continue to benefit from plunging crude oil prices. And with the focus on overseas data, the historic climate change deal to curb emissions and limit global warming reached in Paris after two weeks of negotiations will have little impact on the local market, Sebastian said. “I think the more long-term themes are around the slowdown in China and also the volatility in US markets,” he said. US stocks closed sharply lower on Friday, with the S&P 500 ending its worst week since August, as falling oil prices compounded investor nervousness on expectations for the first US rate hike in nearly a decade. The US Federal Reserve’s rates decision in the middle of this week will be watched closely around the world. Given Australian shares have already experienced a fallback in the lead-up to Christmas, it could be a bumpy week ahead. “While the volumes may be light there’s certainly going to be a lot of volatility this week,” Sebastian said. But that could also lead to benefits for some. “Given the slide that we will see on Monday, we might see some bargain hunting towards the latter part of the week,” he said. After a day of consolidation on Friday, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index finished 8.2 points, or 0.16%, lower at 5,029.5 while the broader All Ordinaries index was down 8.9 points, or 0.17%, at 5,078.6. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, will release the mid-year budget review on Tuesday, with economists predicting a further deterioration in the budget deficit."

"Negotiators at the UN climate talks in Paris are now nearing the end of a fortnight of searching for a global deal on climate change. The mood is upbeat but there are still significant disagreements over some key issues. They came out in the publication on Wednesday of the draft negotiating text.  These are the six key road blocks that negotiators will have to move or get around if a deal is to be done:  The disagreement here is over what temperature rise (with a baseline of pre-industrial times) the politicians set as the goal for the world to stick to. Even fractions of a degree could make big differences in terms of the impacts from sea level rise and extreme weather the world is likely to see.  Small islands and low-lying states are at risk of disappearing under rising seas even at the currently agreed 2C temperature goal, and have long argued for tougher limits on warming. Last June, a group of more than 40 countries adopted the slogan “1.5 to stay alive”. They now have the support of more than 80 countries, including the US, Canada and Europe, who call themselves the “high ambition coalition”. But is 1.5C even possible given warming to date and that already built into the system? “The maths is simple,” according to Myles Allen, a climate scientist at Oxford. “Human-induced warming is already close to 1C, so to limit warming to 2C, CO2 emissions need to fall, on average, by 10% of today’s emission rate for every tenth of a degree of warming from now on. To limit warming to 1.5C, CO2 emissions need to fall, on average, by 20% for every tenth of a degree of warming. At the rate we’re warming at the moment, a tenth of a degree means five to 10 years. So 1.5 will be tough.”  That presents a serious problem for a diplomatic process that must be rooted in the science. Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University climate scientist and a longtime observer of the international climate negotiations, suggested 1.5C could remain as an aspirational goal, alongside 2C – but it would be problematic if it were the only goal. “If you put it as an agreed goal you would probably have a large fraction of the expert community saying you can’t do this and it’s very unlikely. The net effect of that is that it would undermine the credibility of the process because people would get the impression, rightly so, that diplomats are agreeing to things that are totally unrealistic just for the sake of producing an outcome and getting out of the room.” The draft released by the French hosts on Wednesday has three options: 1. below 2C, 2. well below 2C with efforts to reach 1.5C and 3. 1.5C. Getting to 1.5C or 2C requires achieving near zero greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of this century. Business leaders, some campaign groups and even the Pope have called on negotiators to adopt a decarbonisation goal as a way of translating temperature goals into more tangible targets for action. How and when are the big questions, and language is critical. Net zero means emissions can continue but must be balanced by negative emissions efforts such as tree planting or technologies to suck emission from the air. The draft released on Wednesday has two main options. Under option 1, the stronger option, countries aim to peak global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, with rich countries making deep emissions cuts by 2050 with an end goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Even here, there are divisions on the scale of cuts and the date for reaching net-zero, mid-century or end century. Under option 2, countries would commit only to a vague goal of reaching climate neutrality over the course of the century, with no specific targets or dates. Finance was the big issue leading into these negotiations. Developing countries need funding to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and build the infrastructure that will help protect their people from extreme weather and other climate impacts. Best estimates suggest it will cost trillions to transform the global economy. Rich countries committed to rounding up $100bn a year from private and public sources by 2020. Best estimates suggest the pot is currently only two-thirds full – and rising economies such as India and Brazil say the accounting is murky. Developing countries are demanding stronger guarantees rich countries will deliver on their pledges in 2020 and beyond – and that there will be more funds available to deal with the climate impacts they are already experiencing. To date, only about a quarter of climate funding has been directed towards dealing with those impacts, and countries say that is not a big enough fraction. The US doubled its climate aid to $860m on Wednesday. Developing countries will be looking to other developed countries to do more. Some low-lying and vulnerable countries are facing irreversible and permanent damage from climate change. Land loss could force millions to relocate. Those countries want the agreement to recognise those dangers, and offer some measure of protection. But the US is adamantly opposed to any language in the agreement about liability or compensation that could potentially expose US companies to the threat of law suits for causing climate change. “Loss and damage as an idea is meant to refer to the impacts of climate change that neither mitigation nor adaptation has been able to address and in so far as there is a focus on that kind of element, that is completely appropriate,” Todd Stern, the state department climate change envoy, said. “We don’t accept the idea of compensation and liability. We have never accepted and we are not going to accept it now.”  The choices before negotiators in the draft released on Wednesday range from burying any reference to loss and damage in a separate section of the text to setting up an entirely separate process to look at the problems of land loss and climate refugees. Governments at the Paris meeting have come out with lofty ambitions, unlike other climate talks, and there is a sense of momentum towards an agreement. But what about the follow-through? Industrial countries in particular are pushing hard for public reporting of all countries emissions reductions, a so-called “stocktaking”, which would subject climate laggards to public shaming. The US and other countries are pushing for an early stocktaking in 2018. Developing countries are trying to push back the first inventory to 2024. Then there is “ratcheting”. Developed countries are pushing for governments to put forward tougher emissions plans at five-year intervals, in order to take advantage of advances in clean energy technology, and improve the chances of getting to zero emissions in the middle of the century. India and other developing countries want to put off those ratchet meetings to once a decade or so. This is the biggest stumbling block because the question about differentiation is rooted in history, unlike other areas of talks which are about actions in the future. Who should bear responsibility for climate change – the countries that industrialised first and were responsible for historic emissions, or developing countries such as China, now the world’s biggest emitter? The bigger developing countries argue they did little or nothing to cause climate change but are being asked to trim their growth to reduce emissions. The US insists that the current structure of the agreement, which relies on voluntary pledges put forward by each country, acknowledges those differences in economic history. “This is all about differentiation,” John Kerry, the secretary of state, said. India which has played a strong leadership role in the developing country bloc in the Paris negotiations, said the new structure represents progress, but that rich countries should not be trying to re-write history. “Today the world is experiencing and many countries are suffering because of a temperature rise of 0.8C and that temperature rise has taken place because of historic emissions of 150 years so that can not be wished away,” Prakash Javadekar, India’s environment minister, said. “Historic emissions are responsible.”"
"The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has said the international climate talks that are edging towards a conclusion in Paris have been the most complicated and difficult negotiations he has ever been involved in. Ban said that differences still remain among the nearly 200 governments searching for a climate deal in Paris but he urged negotiators to set aside their national interests to reach a compromise.  “This is not a moment of talking about national perspectives. A good global solution will help good local solutions,” he said. “I am urging and appealing to all the state parties to take the final decision for humanity.” “I have been attending many difficult multilateral negotiations, but by any standard, this negotiation is most complicated, most difficult, but most important for humanity. We have just very limited hours remaining,” he added. Ban was speaking as a fortnight of negotiations near their end, with governments seeking a legally-binding deal on curbing carbon emissions beyond 2020, when current commitments end. Around 150 leaders including Barack Obama and Xi Jinping, of the world’s two biggest emitting countries, attended the summit at the start but have since made way to politicians and negotiators who kept talking through Wednesday and Thursday nights. “We are almost at the end of the road,” said Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister and president of the talks, who had stayed up into the early hours of Friday after a draft deal was published on Thursday night. He confirmed that a new draft text would be published on Saturday at 9am CET, rather than Friday evening as originally planned. The leading economist Lord Stern said that despite the delays, relations between governments were much better than at previous summits.  “The atmosphere between the parties has been the best that I have seen in the last 10 years of COPs [Conference of the Parties, the name of the major annual UN climate summit]. That’s founded on the recognition of the magnitude of the risks, and recognition of how we combine poverty reduction, development and climate responsibility: that’s been a key element in the spirit we’ve seen here.” Michael Jacobs, who was Gordon Brown’s climate adviser and now works for the New Climate Economy, said the biggest differences overnight were on transparency and finance. “But there is no reason to see why countries shouldn’t resolve those,” he said. “I don’t read anything into this extra delay.” Protests are planned across Paris on Saturday, with thousands of red tulips to be given out by civil groups to represent red lines they say should not be crossed, and a rally under the Eiffel Tower when a deal is reached. “There is still a lot of work ahead,” said Tasneem Essop, WWF’s head of delegation to the Paris talks."
"Westpac’s commitment to help limit global warming to less than 2C does not mean it is going to stop investing in coal projects soon.  Australia’s oldest bank has agreed to judge lending proposals according to how they conform to the UN’s climate change target of restricting global temperatures, but will not rule out investment in individual sectors. “It’s very hard to see how scientists could say one particular project could push us over two degrees,” Westpac’s chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, said at Friday’s annual general meeting in Sydney. “We believe in the science of climate change and we absolutely believe in trying to limit global warming to two degrees, that is a given ... [but] it’s very difficult for us to conceive of a situation where a scientist would say: ‘That particular project will take us over the edge.’ ” National Australia Bank has ruled out funding Adani’s controversial Carmichael coal mine in Queensland but Westpac said it would continue to judge each project on merit. “We will not be pulling out of coal or any industry per se,” Maxsted said. “We will be supportive of coal companies provided they fit into our criteria.” Questioned by shareholders, including Australian Geographic Society’s young conservationist of the year, Amelia Telford, Maxsted said coal companies needed to show they were taking steps to reduce their environmental impact to secure Westpac finance. The development of so-called clean coal technology, and a need to supply emerging economies, meant it was not practical to pull out of coal entirely, he said. Protesters were outside the meeting calling for the bank to rule out financing Adani’s Galilee basin coal projects. Westpac has the least exposure to fossil fuel projects of Australia’s big four banks. It has lent $5.9bn across 59 fossil fuel deals since 2008, compared with ANZ’s $12.6bn across 99 deals, figures compiled by the tracking body Market Forces show. Maxsted said 61% of Westpac’s energy lending went towards renewables but he would not give a timetable for a further move away from fossil fuel investments. The bank’s chief executive, Brian Hartzer, told the meeting that the bank fully backed the aim of the UN’s climate talks in Paris. Negotiators in Paris are thrashing out the final details of a global agreement that aims to cut emissions with the aim of limiting global warming to the UN’s 2010 target of 2C, or lower."
"Mere mention of the Paris climate talks is enough to make James Hansen grumpy. The former Nasa scientist, considered the father of global awareness of climate change, is a soft-spoken, almost diffident Iowan. But when he talks about the gathering of nearly 200 nations, his demeanour changes.  “It’s a fraud really, a fake,” he says, rubbing his head. “It’s just bullshit for them to say: ‘We’ll have a 2C warming target and then try to do a little better every five years.’ It’s just worthless words. There is no action, just promises. As long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest fuels out there, they will be continued to be burned.” The talks, intended to reach a new global deal on cutting carbon emissions beyond 2020, have spent much time and energy on two major issues: whether the world should aim to contain the temperature rise to 1.5C or 2C above preindustrial levels, and how much funding should be doled out by wealthy countries to developing nations that risk being swamped by rising seas and bashed by escalating extreme weather events. But, according to Hansen, the international jamboree is pointless unless greenhouse gas emissions are taxed across the board. He argues that only this will force down emissions quickly enough to avoid the worst ravages of climate change. Hansen, 74, has just returned from Paris where he again called for a price to be placed on each tonne of carbon from major emitters (he’s suggested a “fee” – because “taxes scare people off” – of $15 a tonne that would rise $10 a year and bring in $600bn in the US alone). There aren’t many takers, even among “big green” as Hansen labels environment groups. Hansen has been a nagging yet respected voice on climate change since he shot to prominence in the summer of 1988. The Nasa scientists, who had been analyzing changes in the Earth’s climate since the 1970s, told a congressional committee that something called the “greenhouse effect” where heat-trapped gases are released into the atmosphere was causing global warming with a 99% certainty. A New York Times report of the 1988 testimony includes the radical suggestion that there should be a “sharp reduction in the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide”, a plea familiar to those who have watched politicians who have traipsed up to the lectern or interviewer’s microphone in Paris over the past two weeks. After that, things started to get a little difficult for Hansen. He claims the White House altered subsequent testimony, given in 1989, and that Nasa appointed a media overseer who vetted what he said to the press. They held practice press conferences where any suggestion that fossil fuels be reduced was considered political and unscientific, and therefore should not be uttered. “Scientists are trained to be objective,” Hansen says. “I don’t think we should be prevented for talking about the the implications of science.” He retired from Nasa in 2013. “That was a source of friction. I held on longer than I wanted, by a year or two. I was in my 70s, it was time for someone else to take over. Now I feel a lot better.” From being possibly America’s most celebrated scientist, Hansen is now probably its most prominent climate activist. He’s been arrested several times in protests outside the White House over mining and the controversial Keystone pipeline extension. He is also an adjunct professor at Columbia University. When he’s in New York, he lives near the campus, surrounded by books piled on groaning shelves. Hansen’s not slowing down – he’s involved in a climate lobbying group and still undertakes the sort of scientific endeavor which helps maintain his gravitas. One particular paper, released in July, painted a particularly bleak future for just about anyone living near the coast. Hansen and 16 colleagues found that Earth’s huge ice sheets, such as those found in Greenland, are melting faster than expected, meaning that even the 2C warming limit is “highly dangerous”. The sea level could soon be up to five meters higher than it is today by the latter part of this century, unless greenhouse gases aren’t radically slashed, the paper states. This would inundate many of the world’s cities, including London, New York, Miami and Shanghai.  “More than half of the world’s cities of the world are at risk,” Hansen says. “If you talk to glaciologists privately they will tell you they are very concerned we are locking in much more significant sea level rises than the ice sheet models are telling us.  “The economic cost of a business as usual approach to emissions is incalculable. It will become questionable whether global governance will break down. You’re talking about hundreds of million of climate refugees from places such as Pakistan and China. We just can’t let that happen. Civilization was set up and developed with a stable, constant coastline.” The paper has yet to be fully peer reviewed and some of Hansen’s colleagues, including his protege at Nasa, Gavin Schmidt, have voiced their doubts whether sea level rise will be quite this bad, with the IPCC projecting up to a meter by 2100.  Brickbats are thrown in a bipartisan way. Hansen feels Obama, who has made climate change a legacy issue in his final year in office, has botched the opportunity to tackle the issue. “We all foolishly had such high hopes for Obama, to articulate things, to be like Roosevelt and have fireside chats to explain to the public why we need to have a rising fee on carbon in order to move to clean energy,” he says. “But he’s not particularly good at that. He didn’t make it a priority and now it’s too late for him.” Hansen is just as scathing of leading Republicans who have embraced climate science denialism to the chagrin of some party elders.  Leading presidential candidates Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson have all derided evidence that the world is warming due to human activity while Ted Cruz, another contender, has taken time out from his campaign to to sit on an inquiry into climate science that has heard testimony from a rightwing radio host who has no scientific background.  “It’s all embarrassing really,” Hansen says. “After a while you realise as a scientist that politicians don’t act rationally.  “Many of the conservatives know climate change is not a hoax. But those running for president are hamstrung by the fact they think they can’t get the nomination if they say this is an issue. They wouldn’t get money from the fossil fuel industry.” There is a positive note to end on, however. Global emissions have somewhat stalled and Hansen believes China, the world’s largest emitter, will now step up to provide the leadership lacking from the US. A submerged Fifth Avenue and deadly heatwaves aren’t an inevitability. “I think we will get there because China is rational,” Hansen says. “Their leaders are mostly trained in engineering and such things, they don’t deny climate change and they have a huge incentive, which is air pollution. It’s so bad in their cities they need to move to clean energies. They realise it’s not a hoax. But they will need co-operation.”"

"March of the Penguins director Luc Jacquet returns to the Antarctic with this awe-inspiring account of the life of Claude Lorius, the French glaciologist who predicted catastrophic climate change, and has now become “an old man sad to see that history has proved him right”. Using a wealth of footage dating back to Lorius’s first polar expedition in 1956-57 (“I shall be forever 23”), Jacquet assembles an extraordinarily engaging documentary that boasts spectacular vistas, breathtaking adventures, on-camera plane crashes and scientific revelations, fuelled by a heady mix of kerosene, whisky and vodka. Lorius is an inspirational figure, and there’s something of Moses in the aerial shots of the octogenarian surveying a receding icy ridge, or standing mournfully amid rising seas. Jacquet may not be one for understatement, but as Lorius’s hard-won data proves, now is not the time for equivocation. "

"As world leaders enter the home stretch of the Paris climate negotiations they should keep in mind a key measure of success in limiting carbon emissions: cheap oil. The lower the global price of oil, the more it stays in the ground – due to the brutal, if counterintuitive, logic of the petroleum marketplace.  Most of the easily extracted oil deposits are long gone. What’s left are high-cost, high-risk long shots such as the Alberta tar sands, deep-water reservoirs off Brazil, and drilling the high Arctic. Companies hoping to profit from the last dregs of the petroleum age need to convince their investors to part with massive amounts of capital in hopes of competitive returns often decades down the road. Billions have already fled the Alberta oil sands in the last year as the global price of oil collapsed from over $100 per barrel to below $40. Shell has just called a halt to its Carmon Creek project in Northern Alberta, writing off $2bn in booked assets and 418 million barrels of bitumen reserves. A barrel of bitumen will release about 480kg of carbon dioxide from extraction, refining, transport and combustion. This head office write-down means that 200m tonnes of carbon will not be released into the atmosphere. Two other tar sands projects were also shelved this year with reserves of about 3bn barrels. If these investments stay dead the world will avoid another 1.6tn tonnes of dangerous carbon emissions. Together the cancellation of these three projects alone amount to the equivalent of taking more than 14m cars off the road for the next 25 years. There a simple correlation between future emissions and the price of oil needed to make that profitable. Such a graph has been compiled by Carbon Tracker, a UK-based non-profit organisation set up to educate institutional investors on the increasing financial risks of the fossil fuel sector. Its message to investors is simple: the world must limit additional emissions to below 900 gigatons to avoid potentially catastrophic climate consequences – and 40% of this future carbon budget – about 360 gigatons – is projected to come from the oil sector. Anything more than that must stay in the ground – the so-called unburnable carbon. And what’s the price of oil that could save to world? Anything below $75 a barrel of Brent crude means that companies cannot profitably extract more than 360 gigatons of the world’s remaining reserves – no messy policy solutions required. Just last year the price of Brent crude was about $110 a barrel, a price that would gainfully produce about 500 gigatons of carbon emissions by 2050. Now it is less than $50, which would only produce 180 gigatons over the same period. If prices stay where they are, the world will avoid some 320bn tonnes of carbon emissions by 2050 in precluded production from uneconomic oil fields. To put this in perspective, that is 25 times larger than reductions the Kyoto protocol was supposed to achieve if it had worked (it didn’t), and 180 gigatons below the oil emissions limit scientists say we need to avoid a world with more than two degrees of warming. Economic turmoil aside, the global commodities market just served up massive progress on an issue in desperate need of some good news. Carbon Tracker recently revised its calculations to include the turmoil in the oil market, but the basic correlation is the same: lower fossil fuel prices devastate the economics of future extraction. Seen through this lens, a key measure of our success in controlling carbon emissions should be keeping commodity prices of fossil fuels low. And while the main driver of the current slump in prices is the current glut of supply, it’s important to realise that almost every policy intervention to avert climate disaster is directly or indirectly aimed at lowering the price or profitability of fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Efficiency and conservation incentives reduce demand, as do vehicle emission standards and investing in public transit. Carbon pricing means that fossil fuel companies can no longer use the atmosphere as a free dumping ground for CO2, so also lowering profitability. But doesn’t cheap gas mean that people just use more of it? Not really. While there is a weak economic link between declining prices and increasing consumption, key producers like Saudi Arabia are in fact fretting that slowing growth in Asian markets and already peaked demand in developed countries will lead to a long-term decline in the world’s appetite for oil. I dearly hope that world leaders can somehow negotiate transformative change. But perhaps the best they can do is nudge economic indicators like crude prices in the right direction and get out of the way. The unstoppable forces of the global marketplace will hopefully do the rest."
"Strongly held positions are frequently traded away or dropped by governments out of necessity in the last hours of international negotiations. But the removal of all reference to human rights in the final draft of the Paris climate agreement has dismayed leaders of nearly all the myriad civil society groups pressing for a strong outcome. According to observers, Britain, Norway, the US and a small group of developed countries actively blocked inclusion of any mention of human rights in the text in retaliation for developing countries’ refusal to give ground on a part of the text called “loss and damage”. This holds rich countries accountable for irreversible damage done by climate change.  Groups representing development, environment, young people, indigenous peoples, trade unions, women, and others, have all reacted angrily, calling the move “highly contentious” and “cynical” because it deliberately penalised the most vulnerable. “The loss of the human rights language from article 2 is extremely disappointing and follows the earlier loss of references to gender equality and just transition to a clean economy,” said Helen Szoke, Oxfam Australia’s executive director.  “It appears to be a cynical and manipulative negotiating ploy, designed only to leverage the political commitment the leaders of many developing countries have made to returning with provisions on ‘loss and damage’,” said one observer.  “Combating climate change and helping communities adapt is about protecting rights, of children, particularly the poorest and most disadvantaged, and other vulnerable groups, including migrants, indigenous peoples, and women,” said Joni Pegram, climate change policy advisor at Unicef UK. There were widely diverging views on how the deal was shaping up. Nicholas Stern, the British economist, has pressed strongly for governments to address climate change urgently.  “In [the draft text], we have sustainable development and poverty eradication, we have [the] right to development, we have electricity supply to those who haven’t got it. This is a story of a transition to a low carbon economy as part of a strong story of development. That seems to me to be a real advance in this COP, relative to those that have come before,” Lord Stern said. “This is about sustainable development and reduction of emissions, this is about overcoming poverty and reduction of emissions, and a clearer recognition that these things come together. In the past we’ve had a fake horse race between climate responsibility on the one hand and growth and poverty reduction on the other. One of the strong spirits of this COP is that this is now increasingly recognised as a false tension.” But other observers said that the latest text, which was released on Thursday night, appears to weaken provision for developing countries. “What we feared about the text has happened – it is an agreement that is good for the US and bad for the developing world. It says there should be a ‘shared effort’, which means both poor and wealthy countries are responsible for providing climate finance – this is totally a rewriting of the existing climate convention. This is indeed what the US and other developed countries have been pushing for for years,” said Meena Raman, from the Third World Network.  “President Obama promised to be both accountable and take responsibility for our roles in the current climate crisis. As the talks nearly come to a close, we can now see that this was not only empty rhetoric, but a great escape for polluters. The low expectations have been surpassed beyond belief – it does nothing to cut emissions or give hope to the poor and most vulnerable,” said Asad Rehman, spokesman for Friends of the Earth."

"Australia has belatedly joined a “coalition of ambition” in the Paris climate talks – a loose grouping of more than 100 developed and developing countries including the US, EU, Canada and Brazil – aimed at countering a push by China, India and Saudi Arabia to water down aspects of the climate pact as negotiations run overtime. Tony de Brum, foreign minister of the tiny Marshall Islands, and a founder of the new alliance, insisted Australia had not yet joined, and Australia was not represented at a press conference to announce new members – which also include Brazil, Switzerland, Iceland, the Philippines, the Seychelles, Luxembourg and Canada.  But Julie Bishop tweeted that Australia had joined the grouping in response to Twitter criticism.  De Brum later told the media, “we are delighted to learn of Australia’s interest and look forward to hearing what more they may be able to do to join our coalition of high ambition here in Paris.” He said all countries were “welcome to join” but needed to “bring your credentials with you.” Bishop downplayed the importance of the group. “This is not a negotiating coalition, this is a group of people who say we all share a view about an ambitious agreement – of course we do, we’ve said that from the outset ... we’re focusing on getting an agreement, not which groups we might be signing up to ... our priority is the text,” she told journalists. While not a permanent negotiating bloc, the coalition is acting as a significant counterweight in the Paris talks to the big developing countries, whose negotiators spent most of Thursday night in closed door meetings arguing for a watering down of parts of the draft text prepared by the French presidency and forcing the French to extend the talks into Saturday. While world leaders are no longer at the summit, the US president, Barack Obama, has also been trying to smooth the way for a deal by phone, calling the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. According to the White House read-out, the leaders “committed that their negotiating teams in Paris would continue to work closely together and with others to realise the vision of an ambitious climate agreement”. Bishop said she still “felt a strong level of optimism” and the most important thing about deal, if it is clinched, would be the “united global effort” of 183 countries all agreeing to reduce their emissions. Multiple sources said the Chinese negotiators in the second all-night “indaba” (a Zulu word for meeting) sought to dilute the agreement’s long-term goals and the proposed system to link country’s promises to reduce greenhouse emissions against a global “stocktake”. Saudi Arabia and India argued for changes that would even further weaken the deal. Chinese deputy foreign minister Lui Jianmin dismissed the “coalition of ambition” as a “performance” and said China was arguing against the proposed goal that parties aim for “greenhouse gas emission neutrality in the second half of the century” because the meaning of the phrase was unclear. “We heard of this so-called ambitious coalition only since a few days ago, of course it has had a high profile in the media, but we haven’t seen they have really acted for ambitious emissions commitments, so this is kind of performance by some members,” he said at a press conference. “It is wrong to say China is blocking the concept of climate neutrality, we raised a concern because this is a new concept, there is no definition – we don’t understand, if you don’t know the concept, why you would put it in a legally binding agreement,” he said. He also defended China’s position on another sticking point – the insistence by countries like the US and Australia that the Paris agreement should start the process of shifting all countries to a common system of reporting and reviewing emission reductions. The developing world wants to continue with the current two-tier system where obligations are born by rich countries. “It is not only China’s request, it is a request from all developing countries, you should not focus on this as China’s request,” he said.  “Our capacity and national conditions means still we shall have some difficulties ... so the process needs to be more about encouragement. We need to avoid any punitive or intrusive measures,”  He said the US secretary of state, John Kerry, had spoken of the “domestic difficulty” the US would have if national targets were part of the legally binding agreement in Paris. “I think all members would say for the Paris agreement we must have the United States on board as the largest developed world country in the world ... so for some issues, that should be considered in finding a solution acceptable to all,” he said. Kerry told journalists he was hoping the marathon negotiations would see contentious issues “melt away”. As negotiators tried to finalise the deal, leading scientists pointed out the disconnect between what negotiators were arguing about and what was actually needed to address global warming. Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research in Britain said the current text was “somewhere between dangerous and deadly” for the most vulnerable nations in the world. He said it was weaker than the deal that had come out of Copenhagen and “not consistent with the science.” After another day of private and small group meetings, the French will now produce yet another draft agreement – their third attempt at finding a compromise deal – on Saturday morning Paris time before the conference meets for what is supposed to be the final time. Greenpeace said Brazil’s decision to join the coalition of ambition “could change the whole dynamic in the last closing hours of this conference” because major developing countries had been missing from the alliance. Earlier in the conference, Bishop had smoothed over a spat with de Brum over her parliamentary mocking of claims by Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek that one of the Marshall Islands was already underwater. Plibersek had issued a transcript with the wrong name of the island she was referring to, but the island was under water."

"The best city stories we’ve collected this week include temporary public transport initiatives in Italian cities hoping to counter increasing air pollution, and the Japanese town on course to become the country’s first “zero-waste” community. We’d love to hear your responses to these stories: share your thoughts in the comments below.  Delhi is not the only city this week to respond to hazardous levels of air pollution with a transport initiative. As The Local Italy reports, Turin’s atmospheric pollution forecasts for the end of this week were set to reach dangerously toxic levels – so the city offered residents free bus and metro rides over Thursday and Friday in a bid to get people out of their cars and on to public transport.  Milan’s city government, also responding to predicted high levels of air pollution, made its public bike-sharing service free of charge today in order to encourage emission-free transport. But will these initiatives promote increased public transport use – and achieve cleaner air – in the long term? The Japanese town of Kamikatsu is hoping to become the country’s first “zero-waste” community by 2020 (they already recycle 80% of their rubbish and have 34 different categories of recycling). CityLab shares a video introducing us to the town and how its community participates in this initiative: there are no recycling lorries to help collect your waste, so each resident has to wash, sort and bring their rubbish to the recycling centre – before separating it into the 34 different bins ... We don’t tend to think of Las Vegas as the home of sustainable public transport – but as the Las Vegas Sun reports, in response to growing road congestion, the Regional Transportation Commission this week proposed a light-rail network for the city. If implemented, the system could reduce pressure on roads, although only in Las Vegas would a light rail network be presented as a “horizontal elevator”. This week architecture collective Assemble won the Turner Prize for their work in Liverpool, carefully restoring houses in the Granby Four Streets neighbourhood, Toxteth, into beautifully-designed homes for the local community. Despite the growing relationship between art and urban regeneration, a debate still raged about whether their work constitutes “art”. Whatever your view, it is heartening to see attention being given to a project which sustainably and collaboratively improves a city neighbourhood, helping to restore its former vibrancy without gentrifying. This video from Newsnight takes us inside the community of Granby Four Streets and the people whose lives the project has impacted. It’s got a pretty great soundtrack too:  We’re used to bizarre proposals for skyscrapers, but this new design put forward for “billionaires’ row” in New York City looks like it came straight out of a video game set in a fantasy universe. (It also looks a bit like a gothic totem pole.) The designs are simply proposals, but it would certainly be an interesting – and contentious – addition to the Manhattan skyline were the tower actually constructed.

"Governments may have signalled an end to the fossil fuel era, with massive consequences for industry, global security, financial markets and public health, Al Gore and other business leaders have said. “This universal and ambitious agreement sends a clear signal to governments, businesses, and investors everywhere: the transformation of our global economy from one fuelled by dirty energy to one fuelled by sustainable economic growth is now firmly and inevitably under way,” the former senator said in a statement.  “No agreement is perfect, and this one must be strengthened over time, but groups across every sector of society will now begin to reduce dangerous carbon pollution through the framework of this agreement,” said Gore. Gore was joined by Paul Polman, Unilever’s chief executive, who said investors would now have more confidence to address the risks of having fossil fuel assets on their books. “The consequences of this agreement go far beyond the actions of governments. They will be felt in banks, stock exchanges, boardrooms and research centres as the world absorbs the fact that it is embarking on an unprecedented project to decarbonise the global economy. “This realisation will unlock billions of dollars. It establishes a clear path to decarbonise the global economy within the lifetimes of many people alive today, reaping the benefits of cleaner air, greater security and avoiding the worst effects of climate change.” The International Investors Group on Climate Change, a network managing €13tn of assets, said the decision would “help trigger a shift away from fossil fuels and encourage greater investments in renewable energy”. Economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute, encouraged capital market leaders to act boldly. “Capital markets will be the main driver of the transformation and we will be on the right track when stock markets say ‘shame on you’, punishing those who continue to add stranded assets to their portfolios.” Earlier last week, 26 public and private financial institutions with more than $11tn in assets, as well as stock exchanges across the world, met to agree ways to combat climate change. “It is crucial to ensure that all new investment contributes to more effective climate action. As the world’s largest lender for climate-related investment the European Investment Bank is pleased to share experience with financial institutions from around the world,” said Jonathan Taylor, European Investment Bank vice-president. Philippe Joubert, chair of the Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group, which represents 23 global businesses including BT and France’s EDF, said: “Business leaders and investors now have a clear direction of travel. The Paris agreement will accelerate the shift to a new sustainable, equitable and decarbonised world.” Pressure is also expected to grow for a tax on major oil, gas and coal companies for the carbon contained in the fuel they sell. According to the German Heinrich Böll Foundation, 90 fossil fuel companies are responsible for 63% of CO2 emissions from human activities. They include Chevron, ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, BP, Gazprom and Shell. The foundation is urging governments to impose a carbon levy on all fossil fuel extraction and mining, with the proceeds going to help pay poorer countries for adapting to climate change and meeting the costs of its impacts. The levy would be applied to both the exploitation and the burning of fossil fuels, said a spokesman. The global fossil fuel divestment campaign, which claims to have persuaded universities, pension funds, foundations and others to drop more than $1tnof assets, can expect to see many more companies sell off their shares in fossil fuel companies."

"The Paris climate deal is an “opportunity to change the world”, François Hollande has said as he urged negotiators at the UN talks to adopt the final text of an agreement that will provide powerful momentum to efforts to curb climate change. The French president said: “We have to take that last step; the step that would enable us to reach our goal. And this would be a decisive step.” France’s foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, who led the negotiations, said: “Today we are close to the final outcome. It is my deep conviction that we have come up with an ambitious and balanced agreement. Today it is a moment of truth.” He hailed the agreement as a “historic turning point” in climate negotiations that have gone on for decades. The wording, which has been haggled over by politicians and officials during two weeks of intensive talks, embeds promises from 185 countries to reduce emissions – sufficient to limit warming to somewhere between 2.7C and 3.7C above pre-industrial levels. It also initiates regular national reviews and global “stocktakes” to try to increase these greenhouse gas cuts enough to curb warming to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, or even 1.5C in the longer term. But the French hosts said the final text would not be released until 12.30pm local time. Critics will argue that, as it stands, the deal condemns the planet to catastrophic climate changes that will wipe out entire island nations. But supporters say the talks have made major progress in formalising significant carbon cuts that can be built on in future negotiations and send a signal to global investors about the momentum behind clean energy and carbon-reducing projects. Six years after the Copenhagen climate talks ended in chaos and recriminations, the final text was agreed provisionally on Saturday morning after negotiations went through the night. A phone call between the US president, Barack Obama, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and appeals from Hollande and the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, helped to push countries towards agreeing the final draft. It must now be formally adopted by the full plenary session at the talks and requires unanimous agreement. This is set to take place on Saturday afternoon and evening, and objections at this stage could still scupper a final deal. But Ban urged countries to finalise the deal. “We have come to a final moment of a journey that has been going on for decades,” he said. “The end now is in sight. Let us now finish the job. The whole world is watching.” In a speech to the plenary session on Saturday morning that was punctuated by enthusiastic applause, Fabius piled pressure on countries that were holding out by invoking the ghosts of Copenhagen. “Nobody here wants a repeat of what happened in Copenhagen,” he said. “Today, if unfortunately we were to fail, how could we rebuild this hope?” He said failure would mean that “trust in the very ability of the concert of nations” to act on climate would be irrevocably lost.  “The very credibility of multilateralism … this is what is at stake. Quite clearly this text, the one we have built together, our text, is the best possible balance; a balance that will allow each group of countries to go back home with his head held high having achieved something important.” The negotiations have struck a careful diplomatic trade-off between the need to pull developing countries with high emissions, such as China and India, into the pollution-curbing agreement and the demands by poorer nations that rich countries continue to take the lead in reducing their own carbon pollution. They also want the rich world to help pay for the efforts of the developing world and the impact of current warming.  The deal also recognises the fierce campaign waged by island states and vulnerable countries for an agreement that acknowledges that science says 2C of warming is already dangerous and 2.7C disastrous. Scientists say 2.7C of warming will have catastrophic consequences, including rises in sea level that would inundate low-lying regions and islands, cause more floods, heatwaves and forest fire conditions, reductions in cropland, and ocean acidification that will severely damage coral reefs. But even more than the political process to review and ratchet up greenhouse gas cuts to meet the scientific requirements, it is hoped that the Paris pact will send a clear signal to financial investors that the shift to clean energy sources is inevitable. Key elements of the potential deal include:"

"By comparison to what it could have been, it’s a miracle. By comparison to what it should have been, it’s a disaster. Inside the narrow frame within which the talks have taken place, the draft agreement at the UN climate talks in Paris is a great success. The relief and self-congratulation with which the final text was greeted, acknowledges the failure at Copenhagen six years ago, where the negotiations ran wildly over time before collapsing. The Paris agreement is still awaiting formal adoption, but its aspirational limit of 1.5C of global warming, after the rejection of this demand for so many years, can be seen within this frame as a resounding victory. In this respect and others, the final text is stronger than most people anticipated.  Outside the frame it looks like something else. I doubt any of the negotiators believe that there will be no more than 1.5C of global warming as a result of these talks. As the preamble to the agreement acknowledges, even 2C, in view of the weak promises governments brought to Paris, is wildly ambitious. Though negotiated by some nations in good faith, the real outcomes are likely to commit us to levels of climate breakdown that will be dangerous to all and lethal to some. Our governments talk of not burdening future generations with debt. But they have just agreed to burden our successors with a far more dangerous legacy: the carbon dioxide produced by the continued burning of fossil fuels, and the long-running impacts this will exert on the global climate.  With 2C of warming, large parts of the world’s surface will become less habitable. The people of these regions are likely to face wilder extremes: worse droughts in some places, worse floods in others, greater storms and, potentially, grave impacts on food supply. Islands and coastal districts in many parts of the world are in danger of disappearing beneath the waves. A combination of acidifying seas, coral death and Arctic melting means that entire marine food chains could collapse. On land, rainforests may retreat, rivers fail and deserts spread. Mass extinction is likely to be the hallmark of our era. This is what success, as defined by the cheering delegates, will look like.  And failure, even on their terms? Well that is plausible too. While earlier drafts specified dates and percentages, the final text aims only to “reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible”. Which could mean anything and nothing. In fairness, the failure does not belong to the Paris talks, but to the whole process. A maximum of 1.5C, now an aspirational and unlikely target, was eminently achievable when the first UN climate change conference took place in Berlin in 1995. Two decades of procrastination, caused by lobbying – overt, covert and often downright sinister – by the fossil fuel lobby, coupled with the reluctance of governments to explain to their electorates that short-term thinking has long-term costs, ensure that the window of opportunity is now three-quarters shut. The talks in Paris are the best there have ever been. And that is a terrible indictment. Progressive as the outcome is by comparison to all that has gone before, it leaves us with an almost comically lopsided agreement. While negotiations on almost all other global hazards seek to address both ends of the problem, the UN climate process has focused entirely on the consumption of fossil fuels, while ignoring their production.  In Paris the delegates have solemnly agreed to cut demand, but at home they seek to maximise supply. The UK government has even imposed a legal obligation upon itself, under the Infrastructure Act 2015, to “maximise economic recovery” of the UK’s oil and gas. Extracting fossil fuels is a hard fact. But the Paris agreement is full of soft facts: promises that can slip or unravel. Until governments undertake to keep fossil fuels in the ground, they will continue to undermine the agreement they have just made. With Barack Obama in the White House and a dirigiste government overseeing the negotiations in Paris, this is as good as it is ever likely to get. No likely successor to the US president will show the same commitment. In countries like the UK, grand promises abroad are undermined by squalid retrenchments at home. Whatever happens now, we will not be viewed kindly by succeeding generations.  So yes, let the delegates congratulate themselves on a better agreement than might have been expected. And let them temper it with an apology to all those it will betray. "

"In the late 20th century, those who stood against globalisation were charged with swimming against an unstoppable tide, caricatured as “Stop the world, I wanna get off!” But in the 21st century, history is running with the anti-globalisers. World trade talks have gone nowhere, immigration controls have shot up the agenda, and two post-national EU projects – the euro and Schengen – are under strain. Figures as diverse as Donald Trump, Nicola Sturgeon and Marine Le Pen – who failed to convert a remarkable first-round victory in French regional elections into any outright wins – are all peddling one form of nationalism or another. Rumours of the death of the nation state, then, have proved exaggerated: globalisation is spinning into reverse. Looking back on the future as it appeared in the 1990s – as a technocratic, transnational order – a democratic push-back was surely inevitable, in some senses even desirable. But when problems from the overuse of antibiotics to terrorism refuse to respect national borders, the retreat from the dream of global governance has some frightening consequences, especially in connection with climate change, the archetypal global problem. Saving the planet in a fracturing world is a daunting challenge indeed.  The Paris COP 21 talks surpassed expectations in rising to it, demonstrating just how much can be achieved by determined diplomacy, even while working within the unbending red lines of jealously sovereign states. A formal treaty was precluded because it would hand a veto to the intransigent legislators of Capitol Hill, while also offending the sensibilities of Delhi and Beijing. Fortunately, it proved possible to work within the fudged alternative framework of a “legally binding instrument”. Everyone offered up voluntary emission targets, and agreed, too, to a five-yearly review of these. While the targets on the table are not yet adequate to avoid the disaster of more than 2C of warming, the surprise inclusion of an aspiration to cap temperature rises at 1.5C signals a shared understanding that the targets will have to be tightened at each successive review. The destructive standoff between developing and developed countries that doomed Copenhagen six years ago has been transcended: the big developing economies, which now produce the bulk of emissions, are no longer pretending that they can delay doing anything until the rich world is perfectly green; at the same time the rich world is effectively accepting that it will have to help shoulder the “loss and damage” costs inflicted by the long legacy of western pollution. This is, on the face of it, a rare and heartening case of disparate peoples being led to a common conclusion by evidence and reason, but serendipity played its part too. It happens, for example, that in 2015 there is a progressive US president who never has another election to win. It happens, too, that China is the midst of replacing filthy old power stations, which is already curbing its emissions growth, making it less painful than before for Beijing to engage. Indeed, the latest global CO2 data registers a striking levelling off, raising the tantalising possibility that technological progress could be entering a phase where the cast-iron link between emissions and growth begins to rust. If that pattern were borne out in future years, future climate negotiations could get smoother on every front. Then there is the great oil price crash, which facilitates a more fruitful discussion on fossil fuels, by making it much more imaginable to keep it in the ground. One anxiety is whether this fortuitous alignment of political and economic stars will remain, as nations move from making promises, towards real action. Paris cannot guarantees success, but it does encourage hope – and particularly if Ms Le Pen’s chauvinist form of nationalism can be seen off. The Front National dabbled in greenwash last year, but its insistence on an ecology defined by “patriotism and the national interest”, and its instinctive suspicion of a multilateral UN approach is precisely the attitude which could thwart the translation of impressive COP 21 words into deeds. Paris has given the world new hope in the possibilities of pragmatic diplomacy, at a time when France’s own politics illustrate the difficulties of assuming solidarity extends beyond national borders. If the answer to climate change is going to have to be found in continuous haggling between 200 nations, then success is also going to depend on winning the argument against narrow nationalism in every corner of the world."
"The impact of climate change may appear to be overwhelmingly negative but there is a bright spot for those who struggle to find enough time in the day: melting glaciers are causing the rotation of the Earth to slow thereby lengthening our days, new research has found.  Harvard University researchers have provided an answer to a long-held conundrum over how shrinking glaciers are affecting the rotation and axis of the Earth, calculating that the duration of a day has lengthened by a millisecond over the past 100 years.   The brakes will be more sharply applied to the Earth’s rotation as glaciers melt at an ever faster rate, meaning that at least five milliseconds will be added to each day over the course of the 21st century. The axis of the Earth will shift too, with the north pole set to move position by about 1cm (o.4in) during this century.  The research, published in Science Advances, apparently solved a scientific puzzle known as “Munk’s enigma”, which came from a 2002 researcher paper by oceanographer Walter Munk, examining how the melting of glaciers had altered the Earth’s rotation and axis.  As land ice from the poles melts due to rising atmospheric temperatures, the shifting weight of water across the world should cause a change to the axis upon which the Earth spins, and a slight wobble in the rotation. Also, the added weight of water towards the equator will cause the Earth to slow, much in the way a spinning figure skater would slow if he or she reached their arms out away from their body.  Munk factored in the impact of the end of the Ice Age 5,000 years ago, when melting over the previous 15,000 years would have helped slow the Earth’s rotation. But, surprisingly, he found that even with average sea level rises of 2mm a year during the 20th century, there was no change to the Earth’s rotation or axis beyond that caused by the Ice Age ending.  “There should’ve been a whopping great signal and it would be immediate as it only takes days or weeks for that melted water from the poles to shift around the world,” said Jerry Mitrovica, professor of geophysics at Harvard University and leader of the research.  Mitrovica’s team went back to Munk’s research and applied the latest scientific understanding to it. They found that Munk had slightly overestimated the average sea level rise – it was around 1mm to 1.5mm each year over the 20th century rather than 2mm. They also applied an updated model to the calculations. Munk assumed the Earth had rapidly adjusted to ice melting that occurred as the Ice Age ended. More recent understanding of this time, however, suggests that the Earth was not as spherical as it is now for a long time, as the huge ice sheets caused the poles to flatten and the equator to bulge out. Once the team had factored in other influences such as the tides, they found that the glacier melting of the 20th century had indeed caused the Earth to slow and wobble. The speed of the planet’s rotation can be gauged from measurements of stars’ position in relation to Earth and also the orbit of satellites, which have to adjust slightly if the world’s rotation changes.  This slowdown is set to become more pronounced. The global average sea level rise is now over 3mm, according to the IPCC, with the volume of the world’s glaciers set to slump by between 15% and 85% by 2100, depending on how sharply nations reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reverse mass deforestation.  A recent study found that the current retreat of the world’s glaciers was “historically unprecedented”, with scientists warning that a huge glacier in Greenland that holds enough water to raise global sea levels by half a meter has begun to crumble into the North Atlantic Ocean. Sea level rise is also fuelled by thermal expansion, where the ocean grows as it warms up. “The period of a day is now a millisecond longer than a century ago but that will accelerate as the melting increases,” Mitrovica said. “People won’t be running from their houses screaming about an extra millisecond but it adds yet further confirmation of what we are doing to our environment. It’s another fingerprint.”"
"The environment secretary, Elizabeth Truss, has set up a group to consider whether flood defences in Cumbria need to be strengthened after thousands of homes were affected by heavy rain and floods following Storm Desmond. The Cumbrian Floods Partnership group will look at options for slowing key rivers to reduce the intensity of water flows and build stronger links between local residents, community groups and flood-defence planning.   “After seeing first-hand the impact of the flooding in the north of England it is clear that the growing threat from more extreme weather events means we must reassure ourselves, and those communities at risk, that our defences, our modelling and our future plans are robust,” said Truss. The group will be chaired by the floods minister, Rory Stewart, and will consist of community flood defence groups, the Environment Agency and local authorities. Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, told the BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show there were “trends” of severe weather events caused by climate change. “I wouldn’t pin individual storms to those but I would say that addressing dangerous climate change is about security for people and making sure that for the long-term future they are not impacted by really dangerous weather events,” she said. Scientists have concluded that manmade climate change was partly responsible for Storm Desmond’s torrential rain, which devastated parts of Scotland, the Lake District and Northern Ireland. The researchers at the University of Oxford and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) calculated that climate change had made the flooding event 40% more likely. Localised flooding of roads continued in Cumbria, which bore the brunt of Storm Desmond and led to the flooding of thousands of homes. Soldiers from the 2nd Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment have been helping with the clean-up in Carlisle.  The world boxing champion Amir Khan led volunteers from his foundation and the international humanitarian charity Penny Appeal in giving practical support. The teams served hot meals at at local community centre, handed out toys and Christmas presents to children and delivered food parcels. “It’s very sad to see that people have had to leave their homes and all the furniture has been taken out of their houses, and the floods have destroyed all the homes, the kids’ toys and everything else,” said Khan. “I just want to come here and give kids some new toys and bring moral support, really.” Cumbria defied the devastation of Storm Desmond on Saturday by pressing ahead with a food festival in Cockermouth and a Christmas fair in Carlisle. Organisers described the events as indicative of the county’s resilience. The spirit of defiance coincided with figures revealing that, despite two-thirds of Cumbria’s principal tourist attractions recording cancellations following the floodings, nine in 10 attractions have opted to stay open. After a week of rain and floods, forecasters are predicting a sharp temperature drop causing icy conditions. Continued wet weather on Saturday and high river levels have prompted further flood warnings in the north of England.  The Environment Agency has issued 11 flood warnings (indicating flooding expected, take immediate action) across England and Wales. A severe warning (indicating a danger to life) for the west Lancashire village of St Michael’s was lifted on Sunday. Many householders in the village, which lies on the river Wyre, were forced to leave their homes earlier this week. Work has been continuing to temporarily fix the breached defences with sandbags and clay but further downpours have halted that progress. Affected residents were being accommodated in Garstang leisure centre, Lancashire police said. Areas affected by flood warnings include large parts of east Lancashire – including Pendle, the Ribble Valley and Burnley – and large areas of West Yorkshire – including Leeds, Dewsbury, Batley, Hebden Bridge, Todmorden and Cleckheaton. Elsewhere, flood warnings were also issued in Preston, York and Rochdale. Sleet and snowfall, combined with clearer conditions overnight could bring a greater risk of ice in many parts, the Met Office has warned. The sharp fall in temperature is likely to lead to widespread icy patches and freezing fog in the north of England, Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland, it said. The Met Office’s chief forecaster said as a warm front pushing slowly northwards meets the the colder air mass currently over Scotland associated rain is expected to turn to snow, especially on ground above 200 metres. “With this front stalling a relatively prolonged spell of snow is expected for parts of Scotland … Some disruptive snow is likely for a time north of northern parts of the central belt,” said the Met Office."

"When we think about climate change, it’s easy to focus on reducing emissions in order to maintain a healthy global temperature. But any real progress has to be complemented by a significant increase in clean and renewable energy. Fortunately, businesses have plans to build on recent successes and supply the world with the energy we need to grow economies. A great example is Vestas, a major renewable energy company. I had the pleasure of communicating with the Vestas CEO Mr. Anders Runevad. He has served as CEO since 2013 and prior to that he worked at Ericsson and Sony Mobile. Mr. Runevad combines a technical background and education with business training to chart out pathways for companies to build capacity in the rapidly evolving energy market.  Vestas is a company very familiar to people like me who work in the wind power industry. They are the largest manufacturer of wind turbines in the world. Just this year, they have reached 7 GW of announced orders; their turbines can supply energy to supply the needs of 75 million Europeans. But providing energy to the developing world is only part of the energy solution. Solving the climate change problem means we also need to revolutionize the power grids in the developing world. Companies like Vestas are working on that problem too.  Mr. Runevad recently met with India’s Prime Minister Modi and presented a plan to build blades at a new factory in India. They also have plans to increase the renewable energy supply in that country. As of now, Vestas has installed nearly 5,000 turbines in India and employs approximately 900 people there. Vestas has also committed to investments in Kenya by participating in the development of a wind park. The goal is to supply 15% of the electrical needs of Kenya, a country that is plagued by expensive and unreliable energy sources. I asked Mr. Runevad a few questions related to recent wind power developments and to the future outlook on the industry. I asked him what has happened to costs of wind power around the world and in the USA in particular. He told me that in the past 20 years, the cost of wind is down approximately 80%. In the past 5 years, the cost is down 15%. In the USA, the cost has decreased more than 50% since 2009. So, the cost decrease is significant and sustained. One concern people have about wind power is that they perceive it isn’t reliable. When the wind does not blow, power is not produced. But Mr. Runevad told me that the newer wind turbines are better at creating wind power in variable wind speeds. They have bigger rotors, higher towers, and lighter blades. The resulting grid is more stable. Importantly, there is better interconnection with neighboring countries and linking with storage or hydropower sources, which also increases reliability and efficiency. I asked how effectively wind can compete with fossil fuel sources, and learned that wind has become extremely cost effective. In areas where energy consumption is increasing so that new power sources have to be built, there is a basic parity and in many cases, wind wins on cost alone. In mature markets where existing coal, nuclear, or gas power generation infrastructure is already built (often with years of subsidies), it is more challenging to build wind because new infrastructure would have to be created. There, new-build wind has to compete with the costs of maintenance of the existing energy source. However, even then, wind is an attractive option, aside from the fact it creates energy without greenhouse gas emissions. With renewable energy technology changing so rapidly, I wanted to know what was in store in the near-term future. He told me that the cost reductions will continue into the future. There are three reasons for the cost reductions. First, turbines are becoming larger, with taller towers, and lighter construction. Second, increased efficiency in the supply chain and manufacturing systems are lowering cost. Finally, as the scale of wind installations increase, there are cost savings from the economies of scale that are realized. Companies like Vestas want to not only create products that can be profitable, but they are motivated by making a positive difference in the world. That is one of the reasons why they are interested in climate change and the impacts it can have on people and systems around the globe. I asked Mr. Runevad what he hoped to see out of the Paris climate conference. He told me that he hopes the talks result in increased funding for green development with a mechanism to review and revise emissions targets and renewable energy targets. These two mechanisms (reducing emissions and increasing renewable energy) are the tools we will have to employ simultaneously to lower our risk of climate change. As we get close to the end of the hottest year on record, it is encouraging that companies have clearly articulated plans to help us collectively emerge into the new energy economy. It’s apparent that smart planning now will not only help us solve the global warming problem, but will also create jobs and diversify our energy supply."
"Nigeria’s new environment minister, Amina Mohammed, was hailed this month as one of the world’s leading female “climate warriors” in the fight against global warming in a Vogue magazine photoshoot. She could, however, be forgiven for feeling a little battle-weary.  She was Ban Ki-moon’s right-hand woman during the fraught negotiations for the sustainable development goals (SDGs) as his special adviser on post-2015 development planning. She was still in New York last month when she got a call from President Buhari, asking her to return to Nigeria to be his environment minister rather than serve out her contract with the UN until the end of the year.  Two weeks into the job, she is in Paris on another high-stakes mission; heading up the negotiations team of Africa’s most important economy at the Cop 21 climate talks.  If she is feeling the strain, Mohammed does a good job of not showing it. She sees the climate negotiations as a chance to make sure that the baby she helped deliver – the 17 global goals hammered out in New York – get the financial backing they need to survive. And she has brought to Paris the same artillery of cogent and passionate arguments she deployed in New York, warning about the need to battle inequality and exclusion and bring women fully into decision-making.  Getting a global agreement on climate change, she says, “is the last of the obligations we have to make history in terms of achieving the SDG agenda”. The three and a half years of hard work it took to come up with SDGs means much of the heavy-lifting to get an equitable climate change agreement has already been done, she says: “Everything you see in terms of the climate change agenda you see in the SDGs. But it needs to be put into a framework that commits people to the investments needed to enable low-carbon growth.” That is what is at stake here in Paris. Mohammed lists what would constitute a success in Paris: a legally-binding agreement that holds emissions below 2C, a strong review mechanism to ensure countries stay on the path to cutting their emissions, and clarity about a commitment made last year that the developed world will spend $100bn annually on climate finance in the global south by 2020.  The last is non-negotiable, Mohammed says: “You can’t keep telling me it’s a lot of money. It’s a drop in the ocean. We have an over $70tn global economy and you are balking at spending $100bn for saving lives?” Mohammed said the situation will only get worse as global temperatures rise. “In Nigeria, the drying up of Lake Chad and coastal erosion at the other end of the country has pushed the population into a smaller space, creating poverty, landlessness and increasing conflict.” This has contributed to the rise of the homegrown jihadi group Boko Haram, responsible for the deaths of thousands of people. The attacks in Paris a couple of weeks ago have brought home to many delegates the very real threat to global security posed by terrorism and the ongoing migration crisis. “We are scampering around trying to do something about migration [but] there’s a very easy solution: deal with the root causes. That means investing in people in the destinations in Africa and south-east Asia where they are coming from, and where they would stay if they had an alternative. This isn’t a begging bowl. It’s an investment in global peace and security and prosperity.” And $100bn is only a starting point, she says. “The $100bn we are asking for is a signal from the international community that they are serious about the financing challenge for climate change. We need trillions, not billions. The first one hundred billion is the signal that trillions will be attainable.” So where are the trillions going to come from? Among her many speaking events at Cop 21, Mohammed turned up last week at the launch of Climate Investor One, the first project of an innovative financing mechanism funded by the Green Climate Fund, and backed by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to the tune of £50m. The $150m fund is designed to invest in all stages of renewable energy projects in some of the poorest countries, removing some of the risk that has deterred investors and prevented such projects from getting off the ground. It expects to be able to mobilise $2bn in private investment finance by 2020. Mohammed says such finance will be critical if Nigeria is to realise its plans to diversify from an oil-based economy to one powered by renewables. Despite the fact that Nigeria is Africa’s biggest energy producer, the country’s electricity infrastructure needs vast amounts of investment – only 40% of people are connected to the grid, and even they only get power 60% of the time. Mohammed points out that Nigeria’s population of 170m is expected to surpass that of the US by 2050. “We have got the population. We have got the natural resources. We will exploit them,” she says. “Do you want us to burn coal or use renewable energy. Someone has to pay for that.” But big lenders, such as pension funds, will only be prepared to invest the sums African countries require, she says, if the risks of policy somersaults, frequently changing governments, and institutional corruption can be lowered. The last point is particularly pertinent for Nigeria, where endemic corruption has enriched the elite and siphoned billions of dollars abroad, leaving most Nigerians in poverty despite the country’s oil riches, according to Transparency International. Buhari was elected in April, promising to root out corruption and regain public trust in government. If anyone is going to help him, it will be Amina Mohammed, who is the furthest one could imagine from the image of an indolent politician grown rich on petro-dollar back-handers. At the mention of the black and white Vogue photoshoot of climate warrior women, Mohammed seems embarrassed. “Oh my God. And all of us are over 50,” she laughs, adding that she is the mother of six children, aged between 16 and 34. But she says it is a reflection of the seriousness of the climate change issue that age doesn’t seem to matter, even for Vogue. Gender, on the other hand, does matter, and Mohammed sees Africa’s women as the untapped power for change. “We need to put women at the centre of decision making. This is not a question of saying that it’s our right as 50% of the population. Over and over again we are realising that climate change is manmade because it is the result of decisions taken by men.” A women-directed future could be very different.

"Insufficient airport capacity has long been a serious problem for UK aviation. It is misleading to think of any decision about a hub airport in the south-east as a choice between either Heathrow or Gatwick. Although there have been earlier proposals to run the two airports as one, those proposals considered only partial solutions. Merging the working of the two sites can be most effectively achieved by building a new runway at Gatwick, a direct high-speed rail connection with a parallel motorway linking the two sites, and running the combined airports with an integrated communications system.  That would provide four essential benefits. Additional runway capacity at Gatwick is cheaper, would be quicker to build, avoids the problems of even greater atmospheric and noise pollution over the densely populated London suburbs, and a merged system would greatly increase passenger and freight hub capacity. This proposal and its estimated cost can be found at radicalpossibilities.orgWalter Barker and Michael WadsworthBristol • That the government should even be thinking about expanding airports during the Paris climate talks shows just how fragile our commitment to tackling climate change really is. Flying makes a huge contribution to our greenhouse gas emissions but, like driving, it’s something politicians and much of the public choose to ignore. So your headline “Heathrow decision delay will provoke fury but little surprise” (11 December) may be true of those few who stand to make money out of airport expansion. But the rest of us should think about how to shrink airports, not to expand them.Jon ReedsLondon • Probably wise of Cameron to delay a decision about another runway.

"The right hand of French foreign minister Laurent Fabius gripped the gavel in the seconds before striking the historic first global deal on climate change.  Dignitaries, politicians and delegates had filed into the packed La Seine plenary room from about 5.30pm here in Paris.  But there was still time for some last-minute drama. It turned out that a paragraph that contained the word “shall” should have read “should”, but the delay was enough to create tension across the venue. But this is the nature of multilateral climate talks, where politics, words and interpretation can be the difference between success and failure.  The French know as much about diplomacy as anyone, and the government masterfully steered the talks through the two weeks. Fabius had been, on occasion, up until 5am in the backroom sessions here in Le Bourget.  As the foreign minister struck the gavel, down in the media room there was a collective sigh, then applause and the odd “whoop”.  Within seconds, broadcast journalists from across the globe bolted from their seats to tell the planet that Fabius had finally sealed the deal.  So what’s actually in the deal and what does it mean? Clearly in the coming days, analysts will pour carefully over the details of the 31-page Paris Agreement.  The guts of the agreement hang off the so-called “long-term goal” that commits almost 200 countries to hold the global average temperature to “well below 2C” above pre-industrial levels and to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C”. The long-term goal also states that “in accordance with best available science” that “in the second half of this century” the world should get to a point where the net emissions of greenhouse gases should be zero. The deal also puts into the agreement the 186 pledges submitted to the United Nations to stop the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels.  Those pledges on their own will miss the 1.5C target by a long way, but the agreement also includes a rule where nations must renew their pledges every five years. Each pledge “will represent a progression”.  Many delegates and representatives of environment groups have said how even just weeks ago, they could never have envisaged a deal that was so ambitious – even when it was still not ambitious enough. A few hours earlier, Fabius took to the formal plenary meeting to urge countries to take the opportunity that was now in front of them. “One of us reminded us of the Nelson Mandela sentence,” he said. “It always seems impossible until it’s done.  “In this room you are going to be deciding on an historic agreement. The world is holding its breath – it counts on all of us.” In the corridors, Belgian climate scientist Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was sporting a garish yellow tie covered in smiley faces. It matched his mood, he admitted.  .@JPvanYpersele sporting his ""optimist's tie"" on final day of #COP21 being interviewed by @readfearn pic.twitter.com/PdEaaNr9AP The deal, Van Ypersele said, was “a recognition that the science is solid and that everyone is aware of the urgency of tackling the issue”. Throughout the week, campaigners have said the deal had to send a clear signal to global industry that the era of fossil fuels was ending. Scientists have seen the moment as career-defining. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said the Paris deal was “sending a critical message to the global marketplace” of where the world was heading.  Fossil fuel projects on the table, such as the plans for a mega coalmine in the Galilee Basin in Queensland (my home state in Australia), now seem even more incompatible with the economic future than they already are. In the moments after the agreement, the Indian environment minister, Prakash Javadekar said: “This is a new chapter of hope for the seven billion people on the planet.”  The Paris deal shows that the world wants to close the book on fossil fuels. The question now is, can almost 200 countries deliver on their promises back home?  As UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said: “The work starts now.”"

"Ed Miliband has vowed to use the landmark international agreement on climate change to push the British government into being the first in the world to put a zero carbon emissions target into law. The former Labour leader said a global agreement on achieving zero emissions by the end of the century would make it logical for Britain to put its own commitment on the statute books.  Miliband, who will lead a cross-party campaign on the issue in the new year, added that the agreements in Paris would strengthen the hand of those who want more action from David Cameron’s government and “will weaken those who say Britain should hang back” on investing in green energy. He said: “At the moment we have an 80% reduction in domestic emissions by 2050. This international agreement establishes that the world trades in zero emissions by the second half of the century.  “The logical thing is also to commit to zero emissions domestically, and what I have suggested on a cross-party basis is to get the climate change committee to advise us on the date. It is the new long-term goal for the UK and we will, I think, be the first country to put it into law. I will now come back in the new year with my campaign.” Miliband, who was lauded in 2009 when he was energy secretary for rescuing something from a poor summit in Copenhagen, said the details of the agreement unveiled this weekend should be a source of optimism. However, he called for the UK to now back up its drive for setting ambitious international targets on emissions with more resolve on the domestic front. Cameron’s government has been criticised for a whole raft of recent policy decisions, including cuts to subsidies for renewable energy that have left many businesses in that sector bereft. Just 5.1% of energy used in the UK is renewable, according to figures produced by the EU statistical office. Miliband said Britain needed to show the way forward and match “high ambitions abroad, with high ambitions at home”. He said: “I think the biggest weakness to the Paris agreement is the commitment to keeping global temperature increases below 1.5 degrees – the national pledges don’t yet add up to that. “The anxiety around the green groups and others will be to ensure that reality ends up matching the rhetoric. I do think the 1.5-degree commitment is important and governments have set themselves a standard that they will be held to account for, and that is true for the government in the UK and elsewhere. “I think that is a really important tool in the arsenal for those people who want to push for further activity. I think it will strengthen those who say that we need to up our ambition and I think it will strengthen the business voices as well that wanted certainty on a global level and are now arguing for it on a domestic level. There has been uncertainty and drift.” Miliband said that, while it was difficult to link climate change to flooding events, such as those being endured by Cumbria in recent days, it was clear that there would be more such problems in the future without action. But he added that the environmental impact was not the sole reason for greater resolve by Cameron’s administration in backing renewable energy. He said: “It is important not just to avoid disaster, although of course we do need to do it for that reason, but it is also to do with jobs. That is what the government is doing wrong. They think it is good for the economy or it is good for the environment and you can’t have both. But actually the truth is the opposite.”"
"Malcolm Turnbull has lifted the ban imposed by Tony Abbott on wind investment by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) before it was officially enacted, even though it remains Coalition policy to abolish the green bank.   A spokeswoman for the prime minister said the new CEFC investment mandate – issued by the environment minister, Greg Hunt, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann – reflected “the Turnbull government’s strong support for renewables and innovation”. “The mandate puts the CEFC’s focus on new and emerging renewables technologies, rather than supporting well-established technologies that are financially viable without government support,” the spokeswoman said. In the wake of the new mandate and the Paris agreement, various stakeholders in the renewable sector were optimistic that the CEFC decision could reboot the government’s relationship with the clean energy industry. The new mandate says: “As part of its investment activities in clean energy technologies, the corporation must include a focus on supporting emerging and innovative renewable technologies and energy efficiency, such as large scale solar, storage associated with large and small scale solar, offshore wind technologies, and energy efficient technologies for cities and the built environment.” Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, welcomed the new mandate. “We have now got a government in step with the rest of the world and looking to undo some of the things that were done,” Thornton said. “There was a very clear signal from Paris that the whole world is going renewable as quickly and fast as they can. We saw every one from massive global businesses down to thousands of local council making decisions to favour renewables so the shift is on.  “We had a tough time under Prime Minister Abbott and clearly there has been a shift of sentiment under Turnbull which is very welcome. Australia’s role in Paris was material and it is a signal they are now serious about climate action and renewables.” But Senate crossbencher, John Madigan – one of the senators who negotiated for the creation of a wind farm commissioner – said he was disappointed that Turnbull had given the “green light” to the wind industry. “We have just come out of windfarm inquiry and made some recommendations to government,” Madigan said. “There are still question marks around industry, pertaining to compliance and now he’s given them the green light. There seems to be one set of rules for complying with permits and another set of rules for others.” A spokeswoman for the prime minister said the mandate “honours commitments made to crossbenchers during negotiations to secure passage of changes to the renewable energy target”. The CEFC lends to clean energy projects on commercial terms and has so far lent $1.4bn, which will reduce emissions by 4.2m tonnes annually and also achieve a positive return on the commonwealth’s investments. Andrew Bray, from the Australian Wind Alliance, called on the government to set stronger renewables policies to restore confidence in the industry.  He said while wind was “definitely a mature technology”, strong policy and financial innovation was needed to attract investors back to the marketplace. “Renewable energy investment is still recovering from the Abbott government’s attacks on wind power but the CEFC has shown that it can break apart these investment deadlocks,” Bray said. “If the government is seriously committed to delivering a 23% RET by 2020 it needs the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to be investing in wind power. Wind energy is the cheapest source of large-scale renewable energy but the market needs stronger signals from the Australian government to ensure that investment confidence is restored.” When the Coalition came to government in 2013, Tony Abbott pledged to abolish the CEFC but his plans were blocked by the Senate. In July this year, the Coalition issued a ban on government-backed wind investment when then treasurer Joe Hockey and finance minister Mathias Cormann wrote to the CEFC to end investment in new wind projects. “It is our policy to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation because we think that if the projects stack up economically, there’s no reason why they can’t be supported in the usual way,” Abbott said in July. “But while the CEFC exists, what we believe it should be doing is investing in new and emerging technologies – certainly not existing windfarms.” The Hockey-Cormann letter bypassed Hunt and caused consternation within the CEFC as to how such an order could be enacted within the corporation’s guidelines, leading to months of negotiations. It is understood the CEFC never officially received a formal ministerial directive on wind investment before the leadership change. In October, Turnbull added to the uncertainty by saying the need for the CEFC was an “open question”. A spokeswoman for the CEFC said the organisation was “looking forward to the new mandate”. “Our role is to catalyse new investment into the clean energy sector and we think it has enormous benefits to Australia in the transition to a low carbon economy,” the spokeswoman said. Last week, the CEFC committed $67m to Australia’s third-largest wind farm project in Ararat, which is expected to produce enough power for 120,000 homes. Greens senator Larissa Waters welcomed the new mandate by the Turnbull government but said if the government was serious about renewable energy, it would commit not to abolish the CEFC and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) which provides grants for energy projects. “Malcolm Turnbull has kept Tony Abbott’s desire to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the renewable energy agency and Australia has no credibility when it talks about clean energy, innovation, research and development when it still has those bodies on the chopping block,” Waters said. “So one very small but significant action that Malcolm Turnbull could take if he wanted to show he wasn’t Tony Abbott was to take those agencies off the chopping block and allow them to invest in and develop the wonderful clean energy potential that Australia has in spades.” Labor’s environment spokesman, Mark Butler, said Turnbull needed to join the rest of the world and set Australia up to take advantage of future jobs and investment opportunities. “It’s all well and good for Greg Hunt to write a different letter to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation but there is still legislation in parliament to abolish it entirely,” Butler said. “Either Greg Hunt and Malcolm Turnbull are going to join with the enormous opportunities in the future, which lie in renewable energy and clean energy or they are going to continue with Tony Abbott’s rightwing reactionary policies to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, to abolish the renewable energy agency and to withdraw support entirely from renewable energy beyond 2020.”"
"The devastating flooding caused by Storm Desmond is linked to the failure to tackle climate change, the “root cause” of the problem, according to Prince Charles. The Prince, whose charity has given £40,000 to affected communities, also lashed out at climate sceptics in a speech on Thursday. “What right do they have to sacrifice our children and grandchildren’s future?”  The flooding in Cumbria, caused by record rainfall, has forced thousands of people from their homes and caused damage estimated at £500m. Scientists said on Friday that global warming had made the flooding 40% more likely to occur. “You can’t simply ‘adapt’ to the ever-increasing, unprecedented levels of rainfall,” said Charles. “Already the flood defences erected after the last floods a few years ago have been overwhelmed.” “So how long must we wait before we tackle the root cause of an accelerating economic, social and environmental disaster?” he asked. “How long before people who should know better stop lobbying against the only sane course and, instead, lobby to ‘re-wire’ our whole unfit-for-purpose economy?” The government has been criticised for previous cuts to flood defence spending and the postponement of projects in affected areas. Flooding is the greatest climate change threat for the UK, according to the government’s own scientists. In October, the government rejected advice from its own climate change advisers for action to cut the impact of extreme floods. Charles, a long standing advocate of climate change action, helped open the crucial UN talks in Paris, which are due to conclude on Saturday. On Thursday, he reiterated his hope that an ambitious deal would be reached. “Humanity faces many threats but none - none - is greater than climate change, which magnifies every hazard and tension of our existence,” he said. “The good news is that we have the knowledge and the tools to have a chance of staying within 2C [of warming].” But he sharply criticised climate sceptics and noted the New York State Attorney General was investigating ExxonMobil and coal giant Peabody Energy over claims they misled the public and investors about the dangers and potential business risks associated with climate change. On Tuesday an investigation by Greenpeace revealed that two prominent climate sceptics were available for hire to write reports casting doubt on the dangers posed by global warming, while keeping the source of the funding secret. Charles also urged investors to consider divesting their funds from fossil fuel companies. The divestment campaign, which is backed by the Guardian, has seen funds worth over $3tn commit to sell off coal, oil and gas stocks. “Imagine if all asset owners invested in a way compatible with limiting the rise in average global temperatures to two degrees,” he said. Citing the example of the Environment Agency Pension Fund’s divestment, he said: “Not only do they believe that it is their legal duty to consider the impacts of climate change, but that it is also entirely consistent with securing the best long-term returns.”"

"Negotiators in Paris are embarking on another all-night meeting to try to reach a new global climate agreement, with the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, telling them they were “extremely close to the finishing line” as he presented yet another draft text. The marathon talks have become an exercise in a diplomatic attrition, with Fabius giving countries two hours to look at the latest draft before yet another less formal meeting – known as an indaba (a Zulu word for meeting) beginning at 11.30pm Paris time.   He said this all-night session would be an “inaba of solutions” and negotiators would be given 30 to 45 minutes in a corner of the room to settle any impasse. It comes after negotiators already met all through Wednesday night in two indabas, allowing all countries to once again vent their concerns.  “I hope I will present a final text tomorrow … it will allow us to complete the final lap,” Fabius said before the negotiating teams began poring over the text, in which the French had narrowed options and chosen compromise solutions. “We must do this and we can do this … I think, dear friends, that we will make it.” On Wednesday night each indaba had seats for about 80 negotiators, with more crowding in at the back. One, chaired by Fabius met until 5am Thursday. A second, chaired by the Peruvian environment minister, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, met until 8am. According to veteran negotiators the indabas had made sure every country felt their views had been heard. “They spend about 80% of their time repeating their previous positions, maybe 10% outlining new positions and only about 10% of the time compromising,” said a negotiator who took part in one of the meetings. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, turned up at the Fabius-chaired meeting about 2am Wednesday and had what observers described as an “animated” discussion with the US climate change envoy, Todd Stern, at the back of the room for about 20 minutes, possibly about separate informal talks on the issue of “loss and damage” – the idea that the agreement should recognise some countries will suffer irreparable harm from climate change.  The US is insistent any words about loss and damage should not suggest liability or compensation or open any possibility of legal action against US companies. Australia was represented by officials on Wednesday night. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, was on call but spent the night hosting a dinner for Australian business and environmental leaders attending the conference. The French presidency and the experts from the UN then spent Thursday once again carefully paring back the very many areas of disagreement to further distill the big political issues that it is hoped will form the basis of the final trade-off deal. A group called Parisagreement.org has analysed this task by counting the numbers of brackets - indicating disagreement. When the Paris meeting began there were 1,609 sets of brackets. In the Wednesday night text there were 361. By Thursday night it was down to 50. The key issues of dispute have been honed since the talks began 11 days ago. The deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute, Erwin Jackson, said the conference was “on the cusp of getting the best possible outcome … but some key political issues remain to be resolved”."

"The UK has given up its leadership role at the UN climate talks in Paris and is “moving backwards” with a string of cuts to green domestic policies, according to Prof Anne Glover, the former chief scientific adviser to the European commission. Her comments were endorsed by business people, NGOs, an ex-diplomat and two former ministers who are worried that the government is squandering the UK’s international standing on climate issues.  David Cameron told a gathering of world leaders at the Paris climate talks last week that they would have to answer to their grandchildren if they failed to agree a deal that stopped dangerous warming. But since taking power in May his government has been criticised for taking the axe to a series of green policies. “The UK does not have a leadership role, nor is it regarded to have a leadership role in Brussels,” said Glover, who is vice-principal of the University of Aberdeen. “If we don’t lead, who does? To me it looks like we’re moving backwards.” Ed Davey, who was energy minister from 2012 to 2015, told the Guardian: “No wonder the UK is being criticised in Paris – it’s the worst possible moment to undermine the UK’s strong record on leading the global climate change debate. “I doubt George Osborne will end up proud to tell his children and grandchildren of this monumental mistake – he’s caving into the pressure of the likes of fossil fuel interests and [prominent climate sceptic] Lord Lawson, just as the rest of the world agreed to do the right thing,” the Liberal Democrat said. The former Tory environment minister Tim Yeo said that taken in combination, the changes to domestic green policies “raise serious doubts about how seriously Britain still takes the climate change agenda”. Since the election, the Conservative government has:   The UK has historically been seen as a leader on climate change internationally, becoming one of the first countries to produce a legally binding national framework to cut emissions with the Climate Change Act in 2008.                But John Ashton, who was the Foreign Office’s top climate diplomat until 2012, said that it would be hard for UK diplomats to command the same authority in Paris with the government undermining green policies at home. “Rule one of diplomacy is, walk your talk: otherwise people stop listening,” he said. In article for the Guardian, he wrote: “In Paris last week David Cameron called for ‘action today’, not excuses tomorrow, on climate change. Back home, his ministers are already making excuses for what looks increasingly like a systematic repudiation of 10 years of successful action to build a prosperous low-carbon economy in Britain.” Both Ashton and Davey castigated the government for the decision to end subsidies for onshore windfarms, the cheapest form of renewable electricity in the UK, which they said would prove to be poor value for billpayers. Davey said it was “monumentally stupid” to drop the zero-carbon homes rules, which the government’s own statutory climate advisers also criticised last month. “It’s madness now to build things, knowing what we do about climate change, without going absolutely zero carbon. It’s just illogical, and it’s going to be far more expensive to retrofit. It’s irrational.” Glover was also critical of the policy changes on energy efficiency and renewables. “These are choices [on energy efficiency] that government has made and I don’t understand why they’ve made them. It’s the same with subsidies to renewables, I don’t get that either. Governments have historically always subsidised energy industries, so you would think you would want to subsidies the industries of the future rather than the industries of the past.” Jeremy Leggett, the founder and boss of SolarCentury, one of the UK’s largest solar companies, said the government’s approach has been a “scorched Earth assault” on low-carbon policies that had already resulted in hundreds of job losses in the solar industry. “There were weaknesses in both the coalition and Labour governments’ approaches. But at least they could turn up at climate summits without wearing a cloak of transparent hypocrisy.” Nick Molho, of the Aldersgate Group, which represents companies interested in the green economy, said: “We know from the international businesses that we work with that the weakening of our domestic clean energy commitments is getting noticed abroad. The government will rapidly have to come out with a clear plan to meet its own domestic climate commitments if its weight in international climate negotiations is not to be undermined.” The UK has slipped down several rankings on its attractiveness as a place to invest in clean energy in recent months, with its top sustainable energy rating of AAA being downgraded to AAB by the UN-accredited World Energy Council. In September, it fell out of EY’s top 10 countries most attractive for renewable energy for the first time, with EY citing “very reactionary policies being made almost in isolation of any evidence”. Conservative Lord Barker, who was climate minister under the coalition and a former adviser to Cameron on climate change, conceded the government had “rowed back” on renewable energy, but said it was necessary in the context of the “biggest cut in public spending of modern times.” But he said the recent promise by energy secretary Amber Rudd to phase out coal by 2025 outweighed what he said were smaller policy changes. “Yes, you can pick out individual line items, sure. But does that alter the overall, macro picture? Climate change levy versus a moratorium, a ban on coal. Zero-carbon homes versus a world first on coal? I know which I think is more significant. The changes that have been announced, by and large, are detail or insignificant relative to this historical announcement about ending coal.” A spokesperson for the Department for Energy and Climate Change said: “The UK is playing its part in driving action on climate change and transitioning to a global low carbon economy; leading the world on taking coal off the grid and providing international climate finance aid.” NGOs were also critical of the government’s actions. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, told the Guardian: “With the exception of a commitment to phase out all coal-fired power stations within a decade, the year of the Paris climate talks has coincided with an unexpected onslaught on a wide range of schemes and policies designed to support the development and uptake of renewable energy and energy efficiency. The UK is now not on track to meet its overall 2020 EU renewable energy target. As a result, the UK government now sits at direct odds with its stated position as a global leader on tackling climate change.” Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said: “With UK carbon reduction policies in disarray, and its energy strategy speeding in the wrong direction, the government will struggle to be taken seriously on climate change in Paris. The UK government’s credibility on climate change has plummeted since the general election.” He said that new policies introduced since the election in May had favoured fossil fuels over clean technology. “Huge tax breaks have been handed out to bolster oil and gas production, while policies aimed at boosting energy efficiency and renewable power have been shredded. The devastating floods hitting Britain should be a wake-up call to David Cameron and his ministers. There is massive support for renewable power in this country. It’s time for ministers to listen to the science, listen to the public, and make tackling climate change a top priority.”"
"Governments have agreed to “pursue efforts” to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels: something that would have seemed unthinkable just a few months ago.  There is a scientific rationale for the number. John Schellnhuber, a scientist who advises Germany and the Vatican, says 1.5C marks the point where there is a real danger of serious “tipping points” in the world’s climate. The goal of 1.5C is a big leap below the 2C that nearly 200 countries agreed as a limit six years ago in Copenhagen. But bear in mind we’ve already hit 1C, and recent data shows no sign of a major fall in the global emissions driving the warming. As many of the green groups here in Paris note, the 1.5C aspiration is meaningless if there aren’t measures for hitting it.  Before the conference started, more than 180 countries had submitted pledges to cut or curb their carbon emissions (intended nationally defined contributions, or INDCs, in the UN jargon). These are not sufficient to prevent global temperatures from rising beyond 2C – in fact it is thought they will lead to a 2.7C rise or higher.  The INDCs are recognised under the agreement, but are not legally binding.  Countries have promised to try to bring global emissions down from peak levels as soon as possible. More significantly, they pledged “to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century”. Experts say, in plain English, that means getting to “net zero emissions” between 2050 and 2100. The UN’s climate science panel says net zero emissions must happen by 2070 to avoid dangerous warming. Jennifer Morgan of the World Resources Institute said the long-term goal was “transformational” and “sends signals into the heart of the markets”. 187 countries have put forward their plans for how to cut and curb their emissions beyond 2020, as far out as 2030.  But those pledges are not enough to keep warming below 2C, beyond which climate change is expected to have catastrophic impacts. According to several analyses, the plans will see around 2.7-3C.  That’s why the text has a review mechanism to ramp up those pledges every five years, in order to make them strong enough to keep under 2C. The first stocktake will happen in 2018, but the first one under the deal happens in 2023. The text promises that parties “shall undertake ... [the] first global stocktake in 2023 and every five years”.  The deal includes loss and damage, a mechanism for addressing the financial losses vulnerable countries face from climate impacts such as extreme weather.  But it also includes a clause that will keep the US happy – that it won’t face financial claims from vulnerable countries hit by climate change: it “does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation”. Finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change and transition to clean energy was an important sticking point in the negotiations. This part of the deal has been moved into the non-legally binding “decision text” – a sop to the US, which knows it would not be able to get such a pledge of cash past the Republican-controlled Senate.  The draft text says that the countries “intend to continue their existing collective mobilisation goal through 2025”. That means the flow of $100bn (£66bn) a year will continue beyond 2020. By 2025 the draft agreement undertakes to improve on that “from a floor of $100bn”."

"John Kerry has rejected criticism from prominent climate scientist James Hansen that the Paris climate talks were a “fraud” and insisted the resulting deal will spur a global transition from fossil fuels towards renewable energy.  The Paris accord, the culmination of 20 years of often fraught climate talks, has been hailed as a success by various world leaders after 195 countries agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to hold global temperatures to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.  The 31-page agreement, thrashed out following two weeks of talks on the outskirts of Paris, also sets out the transfer of $100bn to poorer countries to help them adapt to the consequences of climate change. But Hansen, a former Nasa scientist considered the father of wider public understanding of climate change, tempered optimism by telling the Guardian on the eve of the deal that the talks were a “fraud” and a “fake” because they would not result in a carbon tax that would drive down fossil fuel use. Asked about Hansen’s comments by ABC, in an interview broadcast on Sunday, Kerry, who led US negotiators in Paris, said he disagreed. “Look, I have great respect for Jim Hansen and I was there in 1988 when he first warned everybody climate change was happening,” the secretary of state said. “But with all due respect to him, I understand the criticisms of the agreement because it doesn’t have a mandatory scheme and it doesn’t have a compliance enforcement mechanism. That’s true. “But we have 186 countries, for the first time in history, all submitting independent plans that they have laid down, which are real, for reducing emissions. “And what it does, in my judgment, more than anything else, there is a uniform standard of transparency. And therefore, we will know what everybody is doing. “The result will be a very clear signal to the marketplace of the world that people are moving into low carbon, no carbon, alternative renewable energy. And I think it’s going to create millions of jobs, enormous new investment in R&D [research and development], and that R&D is going to produce the solutions, not government.” Hansen and Kerry have previously clashed over the idea of a fee on each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted. Hansen told the Guardian he spent an hour trying to convince Kerry of the merits of the idea shortly after Barack Obama became president, only to be rebuffed.  Hansen said the subsequent cap-and-trade plan, which was later abandoned, was “absurd” as it did not properly price fossil fuels in relation to their damage to human health and the environment. Hansen said he “foolishly” had high hopes that Obama would convince hostile Republicans and the public that a carbon fee was needed to tackle climate change.  “But he’s not particularly good at that,” Hansen said. “He didn’t make it a priority and now it’s too late for him.” Republican opposition to any action on climate change, including the Paris agreement, could still hamper US efforts to reduce emissions and provide more than $3bn to nations considered at risk from rising sea levels and extreme weather. The Republican-controlled Congress has passed bills to overturn Obama’s plan to use the Environmental Protection Agency to cut emissions from power plants. A future Republican president would be unlikely to veto such legislation. Kerry said he didn’t think the American public would accept US backtracking on climate change in the wake of the Paris deal. “I think, frankly, a lot of members of Congress are on the wrong side of history,” he told the ABC.  “And I don’t believe you can be elected president of the United States if you don’t understand climate change or you’re not committed to this kind of a plan. “Obviously, if a Republican were elected, they have the ability, by executive order, to undo things … but that’s why I don’t believe the American people – who predominantly do believe in what is happening with climate change – I don’t think they’re going to accept as a genuine leader someone who doesn’t understand the science of climate change and isn’t willing to do something about it.”"

"Volkswagen has admitted for the first time that the diesel emissions scandal was the result of a collection of failures within the company, rather than just the actions of rogue engineers. Hans Dieter Pötsch, the VW chairman, said there had been a “whole chain” of errors at the German carmaker and there was a mindset within the company that tolerated rule-breaking.  VW provided the most detailed explanation so far about how the diesel emissions scandal occurred at a press conference in Germany. Pötsch said engineers had installed defeat devices in engines after realising they could not hit emissions targets for diesel cars in the US by “permissible means”. Nine managers have been suspended over possible involvement in the scandal.  Although Pötsch said no senior executives were believed to have been actively involved in cheating emissions tests, he warned: “This is not only about direct but overall responsibility.” The VW chairman said the scandal was the result of a combination of individual misconduct and mistakes in one part of the business but also flaws in company processes and a tolerance of rule-breaking. Work began on the defeat device as early as 2005 when VW decided to promote its diesel engines in the US. “We are talking here not about a one-off mistake but a whole chain of errors,” he said. VW has already admitted installing defeat devices in 11m vehicles worldwide to cheat diesel emissions tests. It faces the prospect of paying tens of billions of euros in fines and compensation to customers. Pötsch said an investigation involving an internal and external team of 450 people was continuing and more details would be provided in April at VW’s annual meeting. A team led by the law firm Jones Day has already interviewed 87 members of staff, seized 1,500 devices belonging to 400 employees and trawled through data equivalent to 50m books. “We are relentlessly searching for those responsible for what happened and you may rest assured we will bring these persons to account,” Pötsch said. VW will try to avoid a similar crisis in the future by overhauling its infrastructure and internal systems. For example, emissions will tested during on-road driving rather than in a laboratory and will be verified by external and independent third parties, which Pötsch said he hoped “will help us win back trust”. He added: “Even though we cannot prevent misconduct by individuals once and for all, in future it will be more difficult to bypass our processes.” The company will start to repair cars fitted with a defeat device next month. The recall of vehicles with 2-litre engines will begin in January, with 1.2-litre vehicles in the second quarter of 2016 and 1.6-litre vehicles in the third quarter. Vehicles with 1.6-litre engines will require a new flow transformer device, part of the air intake system, to be fitted alongside new software. However, VW is still working on repairs for vehicles in the US, where emissions targets are more stringent, and a compensation package for motorists that will reflect any fall in the re-sale value of their car. Matthias Müller, the VW chief executive, claimed the carmaker would come back from the crisis, despite figures showing that sales of VW cars fell 25% in the US and 20% in the UK last month as consumers turned against the brand. “Even though this situation is serious, the company will not go to pieces because of this,” he said. Müller, who replaced Martin Winterkorn in September, pledged to overhaul the culture of the company by making it more open, less hierarchical, and removing divisions between brands. “We don’t need yes-men, but managers and engineers who make good arguments in support of their convictions and projects, who think and act like entrepreneurs,” he said. “I am calling for people who are curious, independent, and pioneering. People who follow their instincts and are not merely guided by the possible consequences of impending failure.” He also pledged “greater humility” at VW and tighter control of costs, meaning the company will sell its private Airbus A319 aircraft and tone down its presence at motor shows. However, Müller said there are “no plans” to sell assets, which could include the company’s brands such as Audi, Seat and Skoda.  “Overall, the situation is not dramatic, but, as was to be expected, it’s tense,” the 62-year-old said. “We are fighting for every customer and every car.” The press conference followed a rare piece of good news for VW. On Wednesday, the company announced that the number of cars with irregular carbon dioxide levels was far lower than originally feared. VW warned last month that CO2 emissions and fuel consumption figures may have been rigged in 800,000 cars. However, it now believes that only about 36,000 vehicles are affected. The dramatic admission that VW may have rigged CO2 emissions as well as diesel emissions had threatened to significantly escalate the crisis at the company. VW initially estimated the “economic risks” of the CO2 discovery at €2bn (£1.45bn), but said it was too early to lower this estimate until more was known about the scale of the emissions rigging. Shares in VW rose 2% on Thursday following the press conference, but were still down more than 20% since the scandal broke in September."
"Ford is to invest $4.5bn (£3bn) in electric vehicles over the next five years as part of a push by global carmakers to overhaul their product range. The US company will launch 13 eco-friendly vehicles by 2020, meaning that 40% of its models will come in an electric version, up from 13%.  Ford’s move comes amid pressure from regulators for carmakers to lower their emissions, the growing threat of technology companies Apple and Google launching a car, and changing attitudes to vehicle ownership as people in cities use car-sharing services, taxis or public transport instead. The pressure on carmakers has been increased by the diesel emissions scandal at Volkswagen, which has revealed that its diesel cars were more polluting than previously thought. The investment in electric vehicles will include hybrid cars that still have a traditional engine, but also pure battery-powered vehicles. Ford will launch a Focus Electric next year that can be charged to 80% in 30 minutes, two hours faster than at present, and run for 100 miles. Raj Nair, chief technical officer at Ford, said: “The challenge isn’t who provides the most technology in a vehicle but who best organises that technology in a way that most excites and delights people. By observing consumers, we can better understand which features and strengths users truly use and value and create even better experiences for them. “This new way of working brings together marketing, research, engineering and design in a new way to create meaningful user experiences, rather than individually developing technologies and features that need to be integrated into a final product.”"
"Americans are capable of dramatically changing their energy use. And our political leaders can take decisive, bipartisan action on global environmental problems. This is not just wishful thinking. We know this because they have done so before – in response to the 1970s oil crisis. Before the crisis, the federal government had no real energy policy. Decades of cheap oil helped fuel the economic boom after the second world war. Until the early 1970s, few policymakers believed this would change. But between October 1973 and March 1974 the price of oil quadrupled, thanks to the October war between Israel and her neighbors, the rising power of Opec and the boycott organized by a group of Arab states.  Suddenly political leaders scrambled to find solutions to what became defined as “the energy crisis”. Americans agreed to turn off their Christmas lights and cope with gasoline rationing. The public went from assuming that oil would remain cheap forever to fearing it would soon run out. The energy policies that followed the oil shock had two remarkable qualities. They were overwhelmingly bipartisan: an otherwise-hostile democratic Congress quickly passed Richard Nixon’s emergency conservation measures, including a nationwide 55mph speed limit; the next democratic Congress adopted the Ford administration’s 1975 energy bill establishing mandatory fuel economy standards. Over the next 13 years, average automotive fuel economy rose 81%. There was also bipartisan support for boosting energy and conservation research, leading to a seven-fold funding rise between 1973 and 1979. Some investments yielded little, including the billions of dollars that were sunk into synfuels and nuclear fission. But other projects paid off: the astonishing growth in shale gas production in the 2000s can be traced to federally-funded programs and subsidies in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s that led to breakthroughs in drilling, fracturing, mapping and shale gas recovery. No one took energy policy more seriously than Jimmy Carter. Shortly after taking office in 1977 he declared in a televised address: “With the exception of preventing war, this (energy crisis) is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetimes.” Carter pushed for both conservation and price deregulation, and greater reliance on solar energy, coal and “synthetic” fuels made from coal and shale. But the second striking feature of these policies is that many were driven by a mistaken belief that the world was running out of oil. President Carter warned that oil wells “were drying up all over the world”. His secretary of energy, James Schlesinger, predicted “a major economic and political crisis in the 1980s as the world’s oil wells start to run dry”. The energy policies of the 1970s were obviously not designed to reduce carbon emissions. Few policymakers took climate change seriously before the summer of 1988, when Senate hearings during a Washington heatwave created a media sensation. Some of the post-1973 policies – like the promotion of coal-fired power plants – probably boosted carbon emissions. Yet on balance, the policies triggered by the illusory fear of oil depletion have done more to curb carbon emissions than any post-1990 policies meant to address global climate change. The level of decarbonization that the US achieved after the oil crisis is remarkable. In the decade before 1973, US carbon emissions rose an average of 4.1% a year; since 1973 emissions have grown just 0.2% a year. If we had continued on our pre-1973 “business as usual” trend, today the US would be emitting four times as much carbon pollution as it currently does. On a per capita basis, carbon emissions have dropped from 22.5 to about 17 metric tons per capita – which does not sound impressive until you learn that in the decade before 1973, per capita emissions were climbing 3.5% annually. While the move away from energy-intensive manufacturing was a big part of this change, this shift was in itself spurred, at least in part, by the energy crisis itself.  The year 1973 became the historic peak year of US per capita emissions: ever since then it has dropped. As a result, the response to the 1970s oil shocks gave the planet a life-saving head start in the struggle to avoid catastrophic climate change. Was it merely good fortune that the energy policies of the 1970s helped address a threat that almost no one anticipated? Maybe. But even if environmentalists of the 1970s were wrong about oil depletion, they were right that unchecked growth in petroleum consumption could push planetary boundaries past dangerous thresholds. Today we need a new round of deep decarbonization to forestall climate change. Americans rose to face a similar challenge 40 years ago; they must simply decide to do so again. "

"Negotiators in Paris are to present their final draft text on Saturday morning for a deal on limiting climate change after working through Friday night to thrash out remaining details. The French president, François Hollande, is due to join Ban Ki-moon at the landmark summit at 11.30am local time, when the text is expected to be published. The draft is predicted to be officially adopted in the afternoon. Sources said the final text was only settled on at 6.45am after negotiators and ministers worked through Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights at Le Bourget in north-east Paris. Laurent Fabius – the French foreign minister who has marshalled the text through its final stages as president of the talks – said on Thursday night: “All the conditions are ripe for a universal and ambitious agreement. “We will never find a momentum as favourable as in Paris, but now the responsibility lies with ministers, who tomorrow [Saturday] will make their choice. I will present them a text that will be the most ambitious and balanced as possible.” Earlier, Barack Obama had phoned the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, in a last-ditch effort to thrash out a climate change agreement to curb carbon emissions beyond 2020, when current commitments run out.  As the negotiations ran into overtime – something that has happened at virtually every such meeting of the last 20 years – Fabius on Friday called for a cooling-off period to allow more high level lobbying behind closed doors. He put off planned public plenary sessions, which risk being volatile, and gave the floor over to closed meetings in a last push for an agreement.  Peaceful protests are planned by climate activists across Paris. Civil society groups will hand out thousands of red tulips to represent red lines they say should not be crossed, and hold a rally under the Eiffel Tower if and when a deal is reached. Even with Obama’s efforts to call in political favours with the Chinese president, sharp divisions remained on Friday between the US, India and China.  Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said the talks were the most complicated and difficult negotiations he had ever been involved in.  “I have been attending many difficult multilateral negotiations, but by any standard, this negotiation is most complicated, most difficult, but most important for humanity,” Ban told reporters.  The White House said Obama telephoned Xi to try and clinch a deal, following on from phone calls earlier in the week with the Indian, French, and Brazilian leaders. Meanwhile, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, shuttled between delegations. “I think some of us have been working quietly behind the scenes to work out compromises ahead of time on some of those issues,” he told reporters. “And so tomorrow will be really a reflection of many of those compromises.” The extraordinary expense of political capital reflects the extent to which Obama is invested in achieving a credible climate deal at Paris – as well as the immense difficulties of bringing the deal to a close. The US and China last year reached an historic agreement to work jointly to cut emissions.  But the Chinese leadership pushed back on Friday on the framing of the main issue of the agreement: how to get off fossil fuels. Liu Jianmin, the deputy foreign minister, complained there was no clear definition of “greenhouse gas emissions neutrality” in the latest draft text.  China and India have been accused by some negotiators of trying to water down the long term ambition of the draft climate deal, but its negotiators argued rich countries were trying to railroad them into a deal.   “The developed world is not showing flexibility,” said Prakash Javadekar, India’s environment minister. Liu also dismissed the so-called “coalition of ambition” that has emerged at the Paris talks as a “performance”.  “We heard of this so-called ambitious coalition only since a few days ago, of course it has had a high in profile in the media, but we haven’t seen they have really acted for ambitious emissions commitments, so this is kind of performance by some members,” he said at a press conference. On Friday, Brazil bolted from the bloc of powerful developing countries to endorse the coalition, which had been cobbled together earlier this year by the US, Europe and some low-lying states and African countries, to try to break down the old divisions that have stood in the way of an agreement. “If you want to tackle climate change you need ambition and political will,” Izabella Teixeira, Brazil’s environment minister, said in a statement read out at a press conference. As of Friday evening the agreement in the works recognised a more aspirational target of 1.5C for limiting temperature rise – which scientists say would offer a better chance of survival to low-lying and coastal states – as well as the internationally agreed 2C target. The latest draft also incorporates a long-term goal of decarbonisation, albeit without firm dates or targets, a five-year cycle for reviewing emissions cuts, and clear rules on transparency. But for poor countries there was deep disappointment that the draft dropped any mention of climate or gender justice. There was also a backlash against Saudi Arabia, which leads important economic and regional blocs, and was accused of blocking a higher 1.5C target. “When Saudi Arabia talks about adaptation, I can not speak,” said Jahangir Hasan Masum, executive director of the Coastal Development Partnership, an NGO in Bangladesh working in low-lying areas vulnerable to cyclones. “I feel really disgusted talking about them because they are not serious for the planet. They are serious for their oil business and money and keeping their monarchy.” Brazil’s support for the new US-sponsored alliance led to a sense of growing isolation around China and India, which had not signed on to the high ambition coalition, and expressed ambivalence about the 1.5C target. But there remained much to play for between Friday night and Saturday. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Peru’s environment minister who presided over last year’s climate talks and is assisting Fabius, said countries had yet to find a formula for reconciling the core question of how industrialised countries and the rising economies should divide responsibilities for dealing with climate change. But he insisted talks – though moving slowly – were still headed in the right direction.  “The idea to postpone for some hours and not close on Friday has not been the result of a crisis,” he said. “We are used to have to postpone because of a crisis. In Lima, for example, we had a crisis, but today I think Fabius is giving people enough space to discuss all these issues.”    "

"After a period of decline in some countries, business travel is on the rise. Total spending is expected to have grown by 7.4% in the UK, 3.1% in the US and 15% in China, according to the Global Business Travel Association, with $1.25tn predicted to have been spent globally on business flights this year.   If you want to know who most of these business travellers are, four of the top 10 biggest spenders are the giant accountancy firms PwC, EY, Deloitte and Accenture, which are busy crossing continents still cleaning up from the financial crises they were woven into. Two others are aviation business themselves, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, kept company by ExxonMobil and a few others. It wasn’t meant to be like this. New, seamless video conferencing technology and businesses keen to save staff time and company money were supposed to be reading the last rites to business travel, especially flights. Other factors appeared to work against the industry, such as growing security concerns, lasting impacts from the financial crises creating a new, more austere corporate culture and, of course, climate change. But it seems the environmentally weightless economy has become long, if not permanently delayed at its departure gate. Why is this? From its earliest association with a glamorous, wealthy elite – which gave us the term jet set – flying has remained tenaciously aspirational.  A working paper for the Global Sustainability Institute highlights the growth of perhaps the most conspicuous aspect of business travel: private jet ownership and hire. NetJets, a company owned by the billionaire Warren Buffet, is one of the major providers of such a service. Its has a fleet of more than 700 planes, 200 more than the German airline Lufthansa, and it flies to 1,900 airports in 100 countries.  But, apart from the continuing appeal and status of flying around the world, aviation could well be experiencing a pattern very familiar to observers of historical technology development and energy use. The emergence of new technologies to perform a task already achieved by other means – in this case the technology to connect people without the need for travel – rarely, if ever, fully substitutes for the old methods but rather leads to a net increase in overall activity. For example, rather than substituting for fossil fuels, renewable energy technologies are currently just adding power generating capacity alongside the continued global consumption of coal, oil and gas. Similarly, the ease of establishing global relationships through social media, Skype and low-cost telecoms is likely to increase travel so that people meet face-to-face. What this demonstrates is that technological development alone cannot deliver sustainability, but needs to run alongside policy and regulatory changes too. Concern about global warming appears to apply no meaningful brake on aviation expansion. A frequent and startling failure to connect those issues may explain why the Confederation of British Industry felt able to lobby aggressively in favour of a new runway at Heathrow in London. This happened just as parts of the UK were reeling from record-breaking floods due to extreme weather events and the Cop 21 UN climate change conference was happening in Paris. When the runway decision was delayed, ostensibly for environmental decisions, though many suggest it was to do with political considerations around the upcoming mayoral election, there were cries from big business groups. International aviation has avoided inclusion in the scope of international climate agreements, receiving a free ride on efforts to reduce emissions elsewhere. In spite of expectations that, this time, an agreement in Paris would include some reference to a mechanism for the industry it appears to have escaped attention again.  The aviation industry body IATA promises carbon neutral growth of aviation by 2020 and a 50% emissions cut by 2050, much less than what scientists says is needed. Professor Alice Bows-Larkin, partner representative at the Manchester Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, says that IATA’s figures rely on a controversial and unproven mix of carbon trading, offsetting, efficiency and biofuels: “They think they’re special and wriggle out of sectoral targets, their numbers don’t add up. They are saying: ‘We are doing something, so leave us alone.’” One novel way to begin squaring all these issues is suggested by Prof Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the Tyndall Centre. He says that if demand for business travel continues to grow it means the industry is, in effect, expecting other sectors to compensate for its apathy, or for those poor communities living in climatically vulnerable parts of globe to suffer the impacts of ever-higher temperatures.  There could be a quick win to reduce emissions, says Anderson, that might change the culture of business travel for good. Take business flyers and airlines expressing climate concern at their word, or call their bluff. “If they don’t want demand reduced, but think that climate is important, they should remove business and first class seats from planes and make everyone travel economy, that would significantly reduce the carbon emissions from their planes.”"
"A historic, legally binding climate deal that aims to hold global temperatures to a maximum rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, staving off the worst effects of catastrophic global warming, has been secured. The culmination of more than 20 years of fraught UN climate talks has seen all countries agree to reduce emissions, promise to raise $100bn a year by 2020 to help poor countries adapt their economies, and accept a new goal of zero net emissions by later this century. Formally adopted in Paris by 195 countries, the first universal climate deal will see an accelerated phase-out of fossil fuels, the growth of renewable energy streams and powerful new carbon markets to enable countries to trade emissions and protect forests. As the final text of the agreement was released, the French president, François Hollande, said: “This is a major leap for mankind. The agreement will not be perfect for everyone, if everyone reads it with only their own interests in mind. We will not be judged on a clause in a sentence, but on the text as a whole. We will not be judged on a word, but on an act.” Economist Lord Stern added: “This is a historic moment, not just for us but for our children, our grandchildren and future generations. The Paris agreement is a turning point in the world’s fight against unmanaged climate change which threatens prosperity. It creates enormous opportunities as countries begin to accelerate along the path towards low-carbon economic growth.” The British prime minister, David Cameron, also welcomed the deal, praising those involved for showing what ambition and perseverance could do. “We’ve secured our planet for many, many generations to come – and there is nothing more important than that,” he said. His energy and climate change secretary, Amber Rudd, told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show that it did not always look like an agreement would be possible, but that the result was an “extraordinary achievement”. “It really went down to the wire with the final plenary meeting, it was suspended for an hour while final negotiations took place. And then we got it. But it’s only the start. The French did a fantastic job managing the whole process, but – as they said themselves – it’s a step in the right direction … the work begins now. “The current contributions that all countries are making actually takes us to [a] 2.7 [degree increase in global temperatures],” said Rudd. “So we need to do better than that, and what this did was set us on a pathway to try and achieve that. “It is ambitious, but it is legally binding in some ways, and not in other ways. But we had to get the balance of being totally inclusive, getting 200 countries to sign up, but also not having such a tough compliance regime which you could say we had at Kyoto, which didn’t succeed, that some countries would step away. “I think this is the right balance. While it is a compromise, it is nevertheless an historic moment.” The US president, Barack Obama, said in a seven-minute address from the White House that the deal “shows what is possible when the world stands as one”, and added: “This agreement represents the best chance we have to save the one planet that we’ve got.” But he went on to say the agreement “was not perfect. The problem’s not solved because of this accord”. Climate scientists and activists cautioned that while the agreement was unexpectedly ambitious, the measures did not go far enough. “The cuts promised by countries are still insufficient, but the agreement sends a strong message to business, investors and cities that fossil fuels belong to the past,” said Corinne Le Quere, director of the UK’s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at Oxford, cast doubt on the 1.5C target: “Human-induced warming is already approaching one degree and is predicted to be at 1.2C by 2030, so 1.5C will be a challenge.” Bill McKibben, founder of environment movement 350.org, said: “The power of the fossil fuel industry is reflected in the text of the agreement, which drags out the transition [to clean energy] so far that endless climate damage will be done.” Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace international director, added: “The deal puts the fossil fuel industry on the wrong side of history. But emission targets are not big enough. The nations that cause this problem have promised too little help to those people who are already losing their lives and livelihoods.” As tens of thousands of people demonstrated in the centre of Paris for a strong deal, the countries meeting at Le Bourget overcame historic differences in a series of all-night negotiations. They were urged by the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, to compromise for the sake of humanity. “History is coming, in fact, history is here,” he said. “On 12 December 2015, we can have a historic day, a major date to go down in the history of mankind. The date can become a message of life. I am delighted, relieved, proud, that it will be launched from Paris, because Paris was attacked almost exactly a month ago.” The only previous UN climate agreement, the Kyoto protocol, required a number of rich countries to cut emissions marginally and was rejected by the US; the Paris deal applies to all nations. And while there will be no legal obligation for countries to cut emissions, the agreement includes a five-yearly global stocktake and a review mechanism to assess each country’s contributions. The last hours of negotiations were fraught as the French government sought to bridge yawning gaps between rich and poor countries. “The outcome was a compromise that was hard to swallow for some countries but ultimately it had everyone’s buy-in,” said one Indian negotiator. “They [the French] talked to everyone. They got everyone on board. No party can say they have not contributed to this process. Everyone will have to swallow something. Everyone will lose something that is dear to them.” Despite the caveats, the agreement was broadly welcomed as a historic first step towards a decarbonised economy. Ed Miliband vowed to use what he described as a “landmark” agreement to steamroll the government into being the first in the world to put a zero-carbon emissions target into law. The former Labour leader said he would head a cross-party campaign to establish in British law a domestic goal of zero emissions at a point in this century. He said: “I would say this is a landmark agreement and I think it will strengthen those that say Britain has to act, and will weaken those who say Britain should hang back, shouldn’t go ahead. “I think it will strengthen those who say that we need to up our ambition and I think it will strengthen the business voices as well that wanted certainty on a global level and are now arguing for it on a domestic level.” Jennifer Morgan of the Washington-based World Resources Institute said the long-term goal was “transformational” and sent signals to the heart of global financial markets. Oxfam said the deal would be a landmark step but was not enough to ensure that a rise of 3C could be avoided or that sufficient climate funding had been secured for vulnerable communities. Phil Jennings, the secretary general of the UNI global union, which has 20 million affiliated members in 140 countries, said: “The world now has a shared vision. Governments and investors around the world now understand that fossil fuels are no longer a safe option for the global economy and look forward to a future powered by renewables.” According to Kevin Watkins, executive director of the Overseas Development Institute: “More financial support is needed to ensure poor countries are not left paying the price of a climate crisis that is not of their making. This is a stronger agreement than expected; and governments around the world have demonstrated an understanding that we face a common threat and we are all in this together.”"
"As negotiators try to finalize a UN climate pact being hailed as dangerously insufficient, a network of groups will express their outrage and pledge continuing action in the new year with massive civil disobedience at an iconic French site. Organizers hope to send a message that leaders should not try to claim the agreement is a success - with industrialized countries refusing to commit to a fair share of emissions reductions, putting the world on a path toward a catastrophic 3 degrees of warming. Backed by 350.org, Attac France and others, the action on Saturday will evoke “red lines” that are the minimal conditions for a just and livable planet and which activists say the world’s richest governments are trampling over. Since the Paris attacks that killed 130 people on 13 November, the French government has maintained a state of emergency prohibiting any form of protest, drawing criticisms that they are curbing the right to dissent. Despite the ban, hundreds of people have been turning out throughout the week for non-violent direct action training - including “speed-dating” to match people into teams - in a large cultural centre in the north end of Paris. Organizers plan to evade the ban on demonstrations - which are defined as “more than two people sharing a political message” - by sending out thousands of groups of two on Saturday, before converging at a still undisclosed Paris landmark. At that point, activists will unveil hundreds of red umbrellas and giant inflatable cobblestones that hearken to Paris’ revolutionary history. A 100-metre long red banner reading “Keep it in the ground” will identify the multinational corporations primarily responsible for climate change, according to plans seen by the Guardian. Scores of actions under the theme of “Climate Games” have already happened through the city and Europe in the last weeks, tracked by an anonymous online platform - including blockades by British group Plane Stupid to protest new Heathrow runways, and the installation of 600 fake adverts across Paris criticizing corporate sponsorship of the UN negotiations. Along the bank of the Seine river, graffiti has appeared criticizing the French government for using the security measures to eclipse other issues: “L’état d’urgences pour faire oublier les tas d’urgences.” (A state of emergency to ensure other emergencies are forgotten.) Activists plan to lay 5,000 red flowers and funeral wreathes to draw attention to what they described as the “climate emergency,” commemorating past and future victims of climate change, while fog horns give off a deep mournful sound. “We will widen the circle of grief from those murdered by terror to include those dying because of climate change,” says activist and artist John Jordan. “It’s also a battle over who tells the story of the outcome. Will it be governments and corporations or social movements who get to have the last word? We cannot let them declare this agreement a triumph, when in fact it will consign millions of the poorest people to death.” After the 13 November attacks, organizers cancelled their original plans to surround and blockade the summit conference center because they felt surprise actions, even with the commitment to non-violence, would have endangered activists with French police on high alert. Organizers also did not want to draw police to the St Denis suburb close to the UN conference centre, which has a large Muslim population that has already been targeted for violent police raids. Juliette Rousseau, coordinator of the French coalition representing 150 organizations, including labour unions, green organizationsand faith groups, says the French government has been determined to make it difficult for people to mobilize. “Even before the attacks of 13 November, the government was trying to close the borders to activists, trying to ensure the mobilizations would be as small as possible. The state of emergency has turned out to be a tool they could exploit to achieve this. They never wanted their agreement to be received with waves, never wanted their party to be ruined by civil society - which in its diversity is actually the best expression of society’s interests.” Campaigning group 350.org released a statement for the action, signed by Bill McKibben, Vandana Shiva and others, that promised bold action in 2016. “We know that our leaders have shown little respect – not for the rights of people on a planet torn by inequality and racism, nor for the red lines for a just and livable planet. Lines we should dare not violate. So we will stand with our bodies to draw red lines, committed to protect our common home from burning up,” it reads. “This will be our demonstration of hope, power and strength that we will hold as we bring the fight back to the fossil fuel industry in 2016.” Other groups such as student unions are said to be supportive of the planned civil disobedience but are worried that the government could, under its state of emergency powers, dissolve their organizations. Charges for refusing to disperse from actions include up to one year in jail and a fine of €15,000 (£10,850). As an alternative, the French government had offered civil society a sports stadium for an authorized protest on Saturday, but that has now been cancelled. The exact location of the noon action will be revealed by email and in meetings on Friday. A separate human chain action organized by other groups will convene later at the Eiffel tower on Saturday.

"The air quality is officially “good”, 400ft above Paris in a balloon at rush hour. From that height you can see the ring road and many of the city’s 37 bridges blocked with traffic, the commuting trains coming in, and – on the first cold day of winter – water vapour rising from several power stations as thousands of central heating systems fire up. A yellowish haze has formed on the horizon as air pressure builds, but the pollution from Paris’s transport, construction sites and power stations is minimal compared to that of Beijing or New Delhi at this time of year.   Paris measures its air pollution from 20 official sites, one of which is a large helium-filled balloon tethered to the ground with a small measuring device strapped to its base. At 9am at ground level, it registers 66,500 particles in a single litre of air; 400ft up, however, it reads 78,000. The most it has recorded is more than 6m in November 2013 when the city’s fumes were trapped for days in a particular weather pattern.  Then, says Jean-Baptiste Renard, a senior scientist at France’s national research station (LPC2E) in Orleans, it was not possible to see the Eiffel Tower from just 400 yards away. But even 6m particles a litre is nothing compared to what developing countries regularly suffer. At this time of year, he says, Chinese and Indian cities are likely to be 12 times as bad. This week Beijing was put on red alert as pollution levels from thousands of cars and factories rose to their highest levels in more than a year. “Pollution at altitude is worse than at ground level. It is dominated [in Paris] by very small carbon particles. It is worst in spring. Paris, like London gets two or three incidents a year when particulate pollution can spike. When it reached 6m per litre in 2013 it was the equivalent of smoking 6-8 cigarettes,” he said. Paris, which like London regularly exceeds EU pollution limits for some pollutants, such as NO2 gas, has begun “days without cars” and other measures to reduce traffic during the spikes of pollution which it experiences a year. When an alternate licence-plate system was introduced in September, it reduced NO2 levels by 10-40% in the city centre, said Renard. It now plans to greatly increase cycling and reduce traffic with more public transport. “This year it has not been too bad because of the wind and the rain. The real issue is not the spikes at peak times but the air we breathe all the year. It’s the everyday pollution which is the problem,” said a spokeswoman for Airparif, the independent monitoring organisation which works for the city of Paris.  “We need to reduce the number of diesels. We have a problem with heating systems, especially in the suburbs where people burn wood. In the spring there is a lot of pollution blown in from farms applying fertiliser,” said Renard. Renard, one of France’s leading particle researchers, increasingly finds air pollution crossing national boundaries. Indian air now is affecting weather on a regional scale in the east European countries, he says. “There is a strong pollution effect in the eastern Mediterranean from India. This is climate change on a regional scale. New Delhi’s pollution spreads far. China’s pollution has been detected thousands of miles away.” But there is conflicting evidence, he says, on how far that air pollution is linked to global warming. Some pollutants allow heat to escape, but others reflect the heat back to the ground, increasing warming and leading to the “heat island” effect. Concern is growing that “short-lived climate pollutants”, like ozone, methane and black carbon emitted largely from diesels, are potential warming agents with dangerous impacts on human health and food production.  Black carbon, says the World Health Organisation, is largely soot, much of it emitted from diesel motors. “It is a primary component of particulate matter in air pollution that is the major environmental cause of premature death globally. It has a warming impact on climate 460-1,500 times stronger than CO2,” said a spokeswoman at a health summit in Paris this week.  “Equally, methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is emitted largely from landfill sites,” she said. “People are beginning to understand that there is a direct link between air pollution and climate change, and that if they address air pollution they will also reduce climate change and improve health quickly. It’s a win-win situation.”"
"There’s a cafe next door to the thronging media centre at the UN global climate talks in Paris where the constant clang of the door to the chill air outside can barely be heard above the buzz. Veteran climate scientist and biologist Prof Lesley Hughes has taken a seat with me close by and is struggling to hear herself think.  But the chaos and noise of the global climate talks are not enough to drown out her feeling that a historic moment could be only hours away. Minutes earlier, scientists delivered a dose of sobering reality to negotiators from a meeting room where journalists took up every seat and then every square metre of floor space. “We still have 24 hours to pull something stronger together,” said Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Manchester, England.  What was currently in the draft text of the new Paris deal was, according to Anderson, “somewhere between dangerous and deadly” for the most vulnerable nations in the world. Others would disagree.  All the scientists here do agree that a new global deal, now expected to be put up for agreement sometime on Saturday, needed to match the scientific realities of keeping global warming to well below 2C while aiming for 1.5C.  For that, the conclusions were simple. By the back end of the century, or perhaps much earlier, global greenhouse gas emissions needed to hit zero. The deal, said the scientists, was a long way from perfect, but most seemed optimistic that it was a strong basis for improvement. Australia’s Hughes, from Macquarie University, has been in climate research since 1990.  As famous climate campaigner Bill McKibben hurries through the clanging glass door, she is choosing an optimistic tone. “Unless you are hopeful, then you may as well give up,” she says. “The only hope for the planet is to stay hopeful.” In 1994, Hughes was a co-author on a controversial paper in Nature that for the first time estimated how many species were at risk from extinction from climate change. As many as a third of all species could die out from climate change, the paper found. She authored an influential paper in 2000 in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution that for the first time brought together data from around the world to find that plants and animals were already showing impacts from increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Hughes says that back in 1990 when she began researching climate change impacts on ecosystems, terms like carbon footprint had not even been invented. “Back then climate change felt like a long way off. It was an academic thing. I could never have envisaged being at an international meeting with 40,000 delegates from 190 countries to agree a global agreement. It was beyond imagining.” Fellow Australian professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland, has been in Paris for two weeks. He’s in his Airbnb accommodation close to St Michel taking an hour or two’s break from the Le Bourget venue across town. The marine biologist has been researching the impacts of global warming and greenhouse gases on coral reefs since the mid 1980s. He first dived on the Great Barrier Reef in 1969 with his grandfather. “I started this in 1984 at the start of my thesis. I was looking into why it was that corals were going white in some parts of the world.” Hoegh-Guldberg’s work, beginning with a scientific paper in 1989, found that what might seem like modest rises in sea temperatures could have terminal consequences for coral reefs across the world.  “By the end of the next decade I combined projected sea temperature rises with the known tolerances of corals and I realised we would lose a lot [of corals] by mid-century with a doubling of CO2.” Hoegh-Guldberg says he is “shocked” at even the prospect of a deal being struck this weekend in Paris.  “I thought that we might have had a Copenhagen moment – but people seem to be coming from a position of working with the system, instead of gaming it.” What delights Hoegh-Guldberg even more is that under the current draft of the Paris agreement, there’s a statement that calls for countries to keep global warming “well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C”. That statement, he says, matches almost word for word a call that Hoegh-Guldberg and other world leading coral scientists made in the lead up to the Paris talks. “I thought that request was a little extreme,” he admits.  “But now it’s there in the text. But I am very conscious that the real work comes now. The [pledges] from countries get us to about 3C of warming. That’s disastrous for coral reefs.” Making sure the Paris agreement forced countries to regularly review their pledges so that “well below 2C” becomes a reality is something all scientists here in Paris seem to agree with. But Hoegh-Guldberg, and no doubt the other scientists here, declares an interest. “The Great Barrier Reef is a place that I’m grafted to,” he says. “The best place for me isn’t a wine bar but on a reef, diving. So I’m declaring the planet as my vested interest.” "
"Some developing countries risk destabilising the UN climate negotiations in Paris by trying to rerun old battles over climate aid that have already been resolved, the head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation has said. Angel Gurria, the OECD’s secretary general robustly defended the organisation’s assessment of global climate finance and said that developing countries should accept that most funding due to them under international agreements was already flowing.   Climate finance – to help poor countries cut emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather – is a key sticking point at the Paris climate change talks. Poor countries were promised in 2009 that at least $100bn (£66bn) would flow to them by 2020, and proof that this will be fulfilled is a pre-requisite for them to sign any agreement. But in a veiled swipe at the Indian delegation Gurria said it was never the intention of previous agreements that the finance would come exclusively from public funding. Previous agreements had always allowed the funds to come from a variety of sources, including the private sector. “You can make speeches about this, but it’s not serious and it’s not professional,” Gurria said. “You can’t make these statements [criticising the inclusion of private investment] without a very big risk [to the UN process] at this stage.” The OECD’s analysis found that financial flows for climate assistance were already strong, at about $62bn a year, and set to increase. “This is progress,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “We are not in a bad place. Does this mean we might overshoot the target [for providing assistance]? Hopefully.” The organisation was asked by the French hosts of the Paris climate conference to assess how much financial help was becoming available, but its findings have been disputed by some developing countries, which say the accounting methods used are unclear, and called for more money to come from public sector sources instead of businesses.   Countries including India and Brazil have strongly criticised the OECD analysis, arguing that the accounting methods were “murky”. Gurria mounted a tough defence of the methods used by the OECD. The organisation’s analysts had examined all the sources of finance, including overseas development assistance from rich to poor governments, loans from development banks, and export credits, and taken care to avoid double counting of any that could be overlapping. He pointed to the nearly 60 pages of the report devoted to an explanation of the methodology. “This is severe, this is rigorous, this is transparent,” he said. “No one can say that our method was wrong.” He suggested that some developing countries were seeking to reopen old disagreements. Commitments made at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, where the promise of $100bn a year was first made, and annual UN climate meetings since then, have specifically included private sector finance, as well as funding from development banks such as the World Bank, governments, and other institutions. But since then some NGOs and some developing country governments have argued that $100bn should be supplied only from the public sector of the industrialised world. In a letter, quoted by the Indian government in a recently published discussion paper on climate finance, 120 civil society groups said: “Private finance should should not be substituted for public funding or counted towards the $100bn.” This was never the intention of the Copenhagen pledge, or subsequent reaffirmations of it, Gurria said.  He also pointed out that the government of Peru, which hosted last year’s climate talks in Lima and is a leading developing country voice at the Paris talks, had co-signed the OECD report, a reflection of their confidence in it. If private sector money cannot be included, Gurria said, then developed countries would be called upon to pay $100bn a year from their taxpayers towards climate goals in the poor world. “Taxpayers would have to put their hands in their pockets, year after year,” he said. Just because a private sector company might make a profit, that did not negate the value of its investment in a developing country, he said. Gurria also rejected the idea that donor countries could hide behind general commitments to overseas aid, in order to inflate their climate finance figures. “We sniff very closely to see if it is real or not,” he said. “We don’t want substitutions from [existing] overseas aid. We have evidence and we know.” Gurria said that the OECD’s report had been instrumental in encouraging donor countries to have a “can-do” attitude and up their contributions, pointing to the US’s doubling of its commitments to poor countries to adapt to the effects of climate change. Gurria also said that the conference should abandon the idea that no parts of the deal can be resolved until the final moments. “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” is a mantra that has been cited by participants. The phrase comes from the Doha round of international trade talks, but according to Gurria it is “not conducive or constructive” at the current negotiations. He called for countries to resolve some of the outstanding issues – such as on the level of emissions cuts needed – separately, in order to make progress in time for the deadline."

" “I see no objections,” said the expressionless French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, barely glancing at the rows of country delegates then sharply banging his gavel. There was a moment’s silence as if no one could quite believe it, and then the cheers rang out, the tears of relief flowed and in scenes of high emotion, the anonymous conference hall in a northern suburb of Paris erupted. Thousands of delegates started to applaud each other. They had done it. Al Gore embraced UN climate chief Christina Figueres, who clutched UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, who radiated relief to everyone. Lawyers slapped diplomats on the back, NGOs high-fived security guards, who shook hands with the world’s media, who whistled and cheered. After more than 20 years of abject failure to agree a new global climate deal, rich and poor countries had agreed to differ and had finally adopted 31 pages of dense, legal text which, just possibly, could set the world on a different, cleaner safer, energy path. When 150 heads of state pledged two weeks ago in Paris to forge a new climate deal, it seemed certain they would make history where decades of tortuous UN climate talks had failed. On Saturday night, with protesters gathering in the streets of Paris and thousands of politicians, diplomats, lawyers, business leaders, charities and others exhausted from three all-night negotiating sessions, the deal was closed. For the UN and most governments, what has emerged is nothing less than a universal legal agreement to limit future man-made climate change, the greatest existential threat to life on Earth. The most complex talks ever engaged in by governments proved successful and an ambitious deal struck to limit temperature rises to 1.5C. Lord Nicholas Stern, academic and economist at the London School of Economics and author of an influential report on the economics of climate change, had said on Friday, “the future is bright”. He added: “If we get this right, it will be more powerful than the industrial revolution. A green race is going on.” Under the deal put to countries by Fabius on Saturday morning, nations agreed to hold temperature rises “well below 2C and endeavour to reach 1.5C” and would individually commit to reduce emissions. There would be regular reviews, $100bn a year would be mobilised to help poor countries to adapt, carbon markets would be developed, forests protected and renewable energy given the biggest boost it has ever had. But for many outside the halls, the package being offered was welcome but not nearly enough, because countries could choose their own targets, would not be legally bound and would not get anything like the money needed. “This is progress, but it’s only a start,” said one leading environmental group. After the 2009 diplomatic disaster of Copenhagen, when countries could only reach a weak deal, the path to Paris had been well-prepared. China, India and the US, the three largest polluters, all wanted a deal; 186 countries had volunteered to cut emissions; French diplomats had spent a year lobbying every key country; aid packages to help the poorest had been prepared and Barack Obama had met Chinese president Xi Jinping. Money was always the key to a deal, with big business, global banks and many rich countries lined up to pledge billions of dollars; 450 mayors of the world’s largest cities had agreed to slash emissions and the World Bank and others had said they would increase climate funding by more than $100bn. But behind the scenes, arguments raged as rich countries locked horns with large emerging nations such as India, China, Brazil and South Africa over money, legal liability, compensation and how emissions cuts would be verified. Poor countries pressed hard for a 1.5C temperature rise limit in the text. But the first two nights’ political discussions did not see the expected breakthrough and a second text was produced. On Wednesday came the first signs that the talks were stalling and major differences between rich and poor countries were emerging. The US was resisting any legally binding financial obligation, the Chinese anything that let rich countries off the financial hook. On Thursday, the US and the European Union played a trump card which they had been secretly preparing for months. Obama’s administration, along with the EU, had known the powerful developing economies would oppose them. Rising economies such as China and India resisted having to curb their emissions unless they saw even deeper cuts from the US and rich countries. The way to get a strong deal, they reasoned, was to split the China/India/ Brazil/South Africa bloc, known as the Basic group, from the rest of the G77 group of 132 developing countries. The plan involved Tony de Brum, charismatic foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, who was asked to pull together a “coalition of high ambition” of rich and poor countries that wanted the 1.5C limit on temperatures. When, on Friday, the coalition group took the stage, it spanned countries as diverse as Kiribati in the Pacific and Iceland, the US, the EU member states and Angola. It claimed to represent 90-odd countries, all of which supported the goal of limiting warming to 1.5C, a long-term target of decarbonising the economy, regular reviews of progress and transparency. In truth, it was unclear where the coalition came from. Unlike the official blocs at the talks, its members did not negotiate as a group. De Brum, when pressed, could not even articulate how many members were in the coalition. Negotiators from Bangladesh and small island states denounced it as a stunt. China called it meaningless. Others said it was a way for rich countries to hide behind the poor, or the power of small countries to shift large countries’ positions. But it had a galvanising effect, allowing more than 90 countries to claim the moral high ground and suggesting that anyone who was not with them was “unambitious”. In the next few hours, Chile, Switzerland, Iceland, Brazil and Australia joined. The once fanciful ambition of holding temperatures to 1.5C was now firmly on the UN agenda. But the major sticking point proved not to be temperature, but the principle enshrined in the original UN climate convention that rich countries, because they had caused the problem, were legally obliged to cut emissions more than poor countries and help them adapt. Even on Friday night, China, India and others were saying a deal was not certain unless it contained “differentiation” in every area. “It has been a paradigm fight,” said Meena Rahman of Third World Network. “The US has been telling the developing countries that we all have some responsibility, and therefore we should share the effort. Developing countries say the rich have been rewriting the rules. The world hasn’t changed and they are escaping. Developing countries will make our contribution, but it must be according to what we can do.” Other observers said the talks had always been slanted against poor countries, with US corporate muscle setting the agenda and making it hard for poor countries to negotiate other than under extreme pressure near the end of the summit, when their meagre resources would disadvantage them. “It is just like apartheid,” Nozipho Joyce Mxakato-Diseko, South African leader of the G77 group of 132 poor countries, complained bitterly in October. “We find ourselves in a position where, in essence, we are disenfranchised.” Asad Rahman of Friends of the Earth added: “We had a string of unbalanced texts and drafts before Paris. The result was that we reached a place at the end of the first week where we should have been nearly a year ago, so this week there have had to be trade-offs. It was the deliberate engineering of a car crash so a deal was never going to be sufficient or fair.” The second great battle erupted in the early hours of Friday morning, when the blocs led by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela began to push back against the draft released by the French. Saudi Arabia demanded that negotiators strike any reference to a temperature goal below 2C, while China objected to the idea of five-year reviews of emissions targets. Russia said the 1.5C limit was not supported by science. Bolivia demanded emissions be cut in line with each country’s historic responsibility for climate change. It looked disastrous when US secretary of state John Kerry took the microphone, saying the draft had gone as far as it could on the question of differentiation. “If we go any further, the whole agreement will be destroyed,” he warned, according to delegates’ accounts. By Saturday morning, the French presidency was shuttling between country groups in a frantic search for compromises. At 5.30am, it started to draw up a take-it-or-leave-it deal which meant all countries would have to abandon some red lines. No country would get all it wanted, but no country would lose all. It appeared to be the world moving in roughly the same direction."
"I saw my mother working in women’s clubs – to increase incomes, do childcare, keep girls in school. I was very aware as a little girl that I had to claim rights. It is a life story – it only became my job much later.  Climate change is an issue of justice. The poorest are the most vulnerable, particularly women. The drudgery of domestic work, of unpaid labour, is getting worse because of climate change. Women’s roles are still quite rigid. Devastation for women who live near coastal regions is harsher, since they generally have less mobility. People can live insular lives in the household and don’t have the information they need to avoid a storm, for example. The other side of the coin is that women are leading in adaptation. They’re finding solutions to the way they do agriculture in order to keep food at home, they are involved in leading responses at a community level. Women’s leadership shines through. [But] only a trickle of governmental money reaches the household, and when it gets there it may be taken by the head of the household. Who inspires me? Solome Mukisa leads a community-based children’s organisation in Uganda. My local government counsellor Beth runs a women’s group. Both are innovative, resilient and strong. Graça Machel. I also admire men like [South African human rights activist] Kumi Naidoo. I hope that adaptation as much as mitigation becomes the norm, that we do development differently: that we factor in the cost to the environment and the cost of women’s work. I came to climate change and its undermining of all kinds of rights of poor communities worldwide very late. From 1997 until 2002, as UN high commissioner for human rights, I don’t remember making any speech of any seriousness on climate change because another part of the UN system, the UNFCC, was dealing with it.  My foundation is about climate justice. I am encouraged about the women at all levels who want this to work. I’m as inspired by grassroots women like Constance Okollet of Uganda, or Ursula Rakova from the Catoret Islands [in Papua New Guinea], who says there’s nothing she can do about moving her people from the land of the bones of their ancestors. Then there’s good leadership. Christiana Figueres [the UN climate chief] is always positive and never lets it get her down. Some countries seem to want a narrow environmental agenda, like Norway. We need to keep gender in the text, as it’s necessary for good climate policy, because we [have] made mistakes. We had corn for ethanol that drove up food prices, big dams built and people displaced. I have five grandchildren who will be in their forties in 2050, and will share the world with nine billion people. We are the last generation to make decisions. That gets me out of bed in the morning. Remember the injustice of climate change – prioritise that. It’s the passion of my life. Women experience climate change but don’t know what lies behind it or how to mitigate it. In one village a woman had to go to the field to work at 4am since it was so hot through the day. She used to cook food for the family before going out, get her children ready, care for elders – she can’t do that [now she leaves so early]. We have run programmes related to alternate energy efficiency for almost 40 years, before climate change even existed as a term, in the form of smokeless cookstoves, bio-gas and popularising solar energy appliances – solar cookers, parabolic cookers, water heaters, lanterns. Those are “climate mitigation strategies” now, but when we started that was just a way of helping the women reducing their drudgery and bills. It was hard to find technicians, so with a manufacturer we trained poor women for the assembly, repair and maintenance of solar panels in two slum areas in New Delhi, as well as Dasna Jail, on the outskirts of Delhi. They could earn an income.  Women use energy at a domestic level, and have a strong say in the matter, even if the man might have a final say in the house. There’s only one model for the future – destroy the world’s resources with military rights.  The same patriarchal world view that abuses women has violated the earth’s ecological limits by thinking through separation and division. Women are the worst victims of ecological destruction. [Yet] women hold the solutions, both through other ways of thinking about economy, science and technology, and other ways of producing food than industrialised, globalised agriculture. Desertification and land degradation is at the root of conflicts, whether it be Nigeria or Syria. Women live through diversity, they think diversity, they defend diversity. This is the path to sustainability, justice and peace. There are six of us Saami women at COP 21, at the frontline of this UN process. The men are home taking care of the reindeer herds. Our rights are often violated in the name of climate change, and adaption and mitigation processes. [Our] reindeer have problems in winter getting food as the temperature shifts; it’s warm and cold, and raining when it’s not supposed to be raining, and the ice is more insecure, which is dangerous for us and them too. There have always been harsh winters but now it’s every year. I’m not hopeful at COP at all, it seems they’re deleting all texts about indigenous people’s rights. I’m disappointed my own country Norway is proposing to delete this from the text. Our traditional knowledge [needs] to be taken into account when it comes to finding out how climate change is affecting us. It’s fascinating how the idea of injustice is more easily understood when we think about issues affecting women – the lack of water, reduction in agriculture, and the crisis we face now in mosquito-born diseases and invasive species – women highlight that these are increasing. Most think of climate change mainly as pollution, but it has a big effect in the social sector, in health, education and agriculture.  Women change the agenda towards the social elements of agreements – there’s the science, economics, politics, diplomacy, but the women’s movement made issues of hunger and poverty a main analytic pillar of the agreement. I fought a battle and still do to get that accepted among delegates and key negotiators.  In finance, I heard a senior EU minister complain that governments tend to ask for major mitigation projects like airports, dams or forest preservations, but that women and NGOs ask for things closer to people like cookstoves. [At the local level] is where climate change hits the hardest, where it’s best understood and can best be prevented. [We must] get the gender balance right so that women have an equal shot in the decision-making process. I’ve been working with women from the Cartaret Islands, the world’s first climate refugees, who have lost islands and been relocated. We have a matrilineal culture so when the sea erodes land, women lose their inheritance, their children’s futures and cultures and traditions, because everything we do is about land.  I work with the women who were tired of waiting for the government’s relocation programme. They migrated on their own, searching for husbands who [had] left for work and [had] since remarried. Gender-based violence has increased, and poverty. We have a militarised society; they’re scared. Bougainville went through 20 years of war. The ones from small submerged islands continue to return [to them]. They want to sink with the islands they say, and die in dignity. Why relocate? We have not contributed to what is happening.  I’ve been doing this since 1992 and was a schoolteacher until there were no children to teach in the conflict, but there were so many human rights violations of women – my friends and I formed our agency to be together, and I mobilised groups to talk of women’s rights.  On women and climate change, there is a direct line between disaster and violence. In countries like Honduras, this situation leads to prostitution and trafficking for most women who have been forced to relocate due to climate change, since the criminal syndicates are in charge. Disaster affects children too – I have seen bridges destroyed so it is impossible to walk to school. Indigenous women ask for respect for their reproductive health rights. During Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, there was no gender sensitivity about relief material like sanitary pads for women. Their world view is tied up in their land, and their knowledge is linked to that. Women are the seed-keepers, but their crops are destroyed. They transmit knowledge, and can provide solutions in times of floods or droughts.  Indigenous people have some anti-women traditions, like inheritance laws or male governance systems. My own Igorot community pushed for the removal of bride prices and dowry practices. Women are under-represented and underestimated. They should be recognised as part of all of the human capital we have – both men and women, the young and the poor, indigenous people and disabled people. At this historical level, the experience of men and women is different. Over the course of my career … what I did come to see was that [women in] all of the Nordic countries still had much better opportunities than many other women – so what could happen if we used all this knowledge and human capital? One of the key issues I campaign on is sexual and reproductive health; when I was a student radical in the 60s and 70s, I didn’t think it would take 40 years [to get this far].  Gender sensitivity is in effect and most people understand it. As for those in more masculine societies or governments who might feel threatened, my answer is always the same: the smartest men will survive. For the Dutch government, gender is important; our trade and development minister, Lilianne Ploumen, and the minister of foreign affairs have been great advocates; our new environment minister is a woman. I got the role of tackling gender and climate change as I experienced a lot over my 40 years in politics. On an institutional level the women and gender constituency is very well organised, but delegations would take gender on as an “extra”. With Finland and Iceland, we invented a network for women delegations at COP. It was slow at first but there is more of a feeling for gender on every delegation now. We seek to enlighten, and we need a gender-focused climate policy. Two types of people look at gender – the emotional people who see it as a feeling – in Europe it’s in our genes – and those who see it as getting more efficient climate policy. Women need technology and can make decisions. We’re missing half the population otherwise – isn’t it so easy to see? You miss their power and energy. I am optimistic but when I see chances not taken … it’s all about being gender-responsive, and having an action-oriented plan. What comes next? It’s about women having access and being in control of their situation. I’m from Oakland, California, and I went to the Philippines to find my mother when I heard about the Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, where the eye of the storm was in my family’s hometown. I didn’t know for almost a week if she was dead or alive. Family members died, our homes were destroyed. I meant to stay for three months to help the community, and I stayed for over a year. Some livelihood projects after the typhoon were for men, like construction jobs. Some women had lost their husbands and were left out of conversations like [those on] relief-rehabilitation projects, working mainly with women in no-build zones, close to the seashores. As spoken poets we’re representing marginalised communities. We won a competition inspired by Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, and three out of four of us are women. I could write about being Filipino and my homeland. Our boats got washed away, our rice fields got flooded in sea salt, coconut trees are decapitated so you need to uproot and plant them for another seven years. The women’s livelihoods through [weaving with bushes were] completely wiped out. We’ve had so many more typhoons since then which don’t get coverage, even super typhoons."
"While the United Nations climate change talks in Paris struggled to elicit credible commitments, notably missing from the debate was “environmental displacement” – people fleeing their homes on account of natural disaster. As temperatures and sea levels rise, and land-use patterns change, there will be significant consequences for human mobility within and across borders. However, public and media debate scarcely discussed the issue, and the only references in the Paris summit’s negotiated outcome document are vague to the point of meaninglessness. This absence is especially striking in a year in which refugees and migration have otherwise been so high on the political agenda.  This political dissonance is of a piece with the compartmentalised way in which we approach many global issues. During a frenzied summer, media coverage and political attention focused almost exclusively on refugees. Now, with saturation point reached, the circus has moved on. Climate change has, instead, become the de rigueur liberal issue of the day. Remarkably, the global focus on refugees was insufficient to influence the debate in Paris. When we shift our attention so dramatically, we risk missing important analytical connections and, with them, opportunities for meaningful solutions. To be clear, the so-called European refugee crisis was certainly not caused by climate change. But it is symptomatic of a global protection crisis, with climate change as one key component. That crisis is partly the result of numbers: there are more people displaced around the world than at any time since the second world war. It is partly the result of political will: asylum is being undermined by governments around the world. However, it is above all a reflection of a growing gap between the contemporary nature of displacement and the institutions that govern forced migration. In the aftermath of the second world war, governments created the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. It ensures that states have a reciprocal obligation towards people fleeing a well-founded fear of persecution. This framework was well adapted to the refugee movements of the 20th century. It continues to be relevant, but it leaves gaps. Climate change is one cause that falls outside the existing refugee framework. Sinking islands, desertification and flooding, for instance, can all require people to leave their homes. However, the relationship between environmental change and displacement is complex and multi-causal; shaped by other factors, most notably governance. As Hurricane Katrina illustrated, in countries with strong governance such as the US, a natural disaster is unlikely to require people to cross borders. It is in countries with weaker governance and limited coping capacity that cross-border movements may take place. This was the case with people leaving Haiti for the Dominican Republic following the earthquake in 2010 and from Somalia to Kenya as a result of famine and drought in the Horn of Africa in 2011, for example. So far the institutional response remains limited, though there are two embryonic frameworks. First, in December 2010, an earlier round of the UN climate negotiations created the first international legal recognition of the relationship between climate change and migration. However, the framework did not specify how to address the problem of people moving on account of climate change and has not been built upon in subsequent rounds of negotiations. Second, in October 2015, came a government-led informal process called the Nansen Initiative. This launched a protection agenda, endorsed by 110 countries, though offered no governance framework to support international action. In Paris, there was little progress. The issue has not been a priority for governments. A draft text proposed “a climate change displacement coordination facility”. But this was watered down in the negotiations, leaving only a vague statement about a “task force” to “develop recommendations for integrated approaches to avert, minimise and address displacement related to the adverse impacts of climate change”. Standing back from these institutional discussions, it’s debatable whether the climate change negotiations are an adequate venue for addressing the underlying issue. The broader phenomenon is new displacement that falls outside the existing refugee framework but is not reducible to voluntary, economic migration. The huge challenge is how we should respond to the movements of vulnerable people who do not fit the institutional boxes. With the exception of sinking islands, what drives much supposedly environmental displacement is its interaction with a range of other social, economic and political factors. What’s more, if what we care about is ensuring protection for the most vulnerable people, then what matters is not to privilege a particular cause of displacement but to identify a threshold of fundamental rights. When these are unavailable in the country of origin, border crossing has to be guaranteed as a last resort. This wider challenge of how we think about new drivers of displacement can be found in the European refugee crisis. Nearly all Syrians would meet the 1951 standard of “persecution”. However, for many other nationalities the picture is more complex. Most are from refugee-producing countries, but not all would qualify for asylum. Yet this does not mean the residual category can be neatly subsumed under a label of “voluntary, economic migrants”. Rather, a significant proportion of those fleeing countries such as Afghanistan or Iraq are fleeing a chronically fragile state, within which they are unable to secure the minimum conditions of human dignity. It is these types of movement for which the international community lacks an adequate conceptual or institutional response. Part of the solution is about considering how we update and reform the global refugee regime. However, to respond to the 21st-century realities of people moving around the world also requires us to escape traditional silos. Policy responses cannot be found simply through European justice and home affairs policies. The root causes of displacement are inextricable from broader issues of the environment, development and security. From the climate negotiations to the sustainable development goals to next year’s World Humanitarian Summit, human displacement should be an integral and ongoing part of the agenda. Responses to the needs of millions of vulnerable people should not depend not upon box-ticking. Instead, across international processes and branches of government, we need to see the connections and opportunities.

"No superlative was left unused as the French president François Hollande, the foreign minister Laurent Fabius and the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon lined up on Saturday to maximise pressure on negotiators in Paris to accept the final draft of the climate agreement.  They would be “making history”, it was a “moment of truth”, it would go down as “a major date in the history of mankind”, there would never be another chance, the future of the world, quite literally, depended upon the decision they were about to make that moment. And then they broke for lunch. The meeting was in France, after all. Well-fed, and aware that the deal was already being hailed around the world, despite not yet being actually done, the negotiators did reconvene later in the day. But then – even as everyone had started celebrating – the agreement almost fell apart.  Somehow, the word “should” had been replaced with “shall” in a crucial part of the text, which created the possibility of a legal obligation and a very big problem for the Americans, who may then have had to take the agreement to Congress, where it would be defeated. The French proposed that the text simply be corrected, but some other delegates saw an opportunity – first African countries sought some compensatory last-minute changes but were persuaded by a number of countries, including China to desist. Then Nicaraguan negotiator Paul Oquist tried to get some concessions as well, and persisted. An hour ticked by.  Eventually – as things became desperate and ministers had been waiting in the room for 90 minutes not knowing the reason for the delay – both Cuban president Raul Castro and US secretary of state John Kerry were enlisted to call Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega to ask him to get his climate negotiator to stand down, according to a senior source.  And then finally it was done, with whooping and jubilation and hugs all round. It was the final step in a delicate diplomatic dance the French had played for a week to ease the negotiating blocs towards agreement and break down divisions that had atrophied over years – a second draft that built political capital in the developing world by leaning options their way, a third that tweaked some clauses back towards what the rich nations wanted and then – after several all-night negotiations – the moment, when the text was presented and adopted. But was it really so historic? What did it really achieve? Two weeks at the climate summit were a wild ride between cynicism and the final realisation that there were reasons to be optimistic, despite the dysfunctionality of it all. And not just because of good lunches. It is stuffy in the small packed room at the Paris climate summit where former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is delivering a speech about the green economy. He’s now the chair of the Global Green Growth Institute. He mentions planting four billion trees in the past four years. He doesn’t mention his country still has one of the highest rates of rainforest deforestation in the world or the recent peatland fires that produced greenhouse emissions equivalent to the entire United States.  Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, is speaking now. She talks about the profound economic changes as the world moves away from fossil fuels, then slips in the apparently obligatory Australian-politics rider about fossil fuels also being around for a long time and helping alleviate poverty. She also mentions – yet again – that Australia will “meet and beat” its climate targets. She does not mention that Australia’s total emissions are rising.  As she draws to a close, music starts up nearby. The “Paris” summit is actually 11km from the centre of Paris, an 18 hectare temporary tent city built around a former airport. The room is in a hangar, its thin plywood walls doing little to filter the strains of Songs of Freedom. The minister raises her voice to compete with Bob Marley. It’s moments like these that the blah blah of these climate summits becomes almost overwhelming. Endless scripted statements about doing the right thing by our children and saving the planet and the need for “ambitious action” blend into a wall of meaningless noise.  Delegates trudge past youth protesters doing street theatre or interpretive dance with barely a glance. A giant polar bear roars periodically. Sean Paul sings a toe-curlingly bad song called Love Song to the Earth. Ban Ki-moon walks past. Every morning cheerful people give everyone entering apples and chocolate. Days slide by. At the same time, in the backrooms and the conference halls the actual negotiators reprise the same arguments they’ve been having for the past 23 years that are all about maximising their domestic political interests and doing little.  The disconnect seems cavernous.  Island states and low-lying “climate vulnerable” countries like the Marshall Islands, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Vietnam run an unexpectedly effective campaign to change the goal of the agreement from limiting global warming at 2C to bringing it back to less than 1.5C. They assemble powerful supporters, including the United States, the European Union, Germany, France, Brazil and – eventually – Australia. President Obama spent some of his two days in Paris meeting with island state leaders and calls himself an “island boy”. The young activists paint 1.5C on their faces and sing songs about it in the streets.  In the end it all boils down to an agreed “purpose” in the Paris deal to hold global temperature increases to “well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit (them) to 1.5C, recognising that this would significantly reduce risks and impacts of climate change”. The need for a new goal is obvious, especially from the low-lying states’ point of view. Two degrees, according to Michiel Schaeffer of Climate Analytics, would deliver destructive sea level rises, threaten the existence of many islands and cause enormous dislocation in the low-lying states. (It would also devastate the Great Barrier Reef.) But the greenhouse gas reduction promises made by 187 countries in Paris – even if they are kept (and that’s a very big if) would result in warming of between 2.7 and 3.5C. Almost 1C of warming is already locked in. To get to 1.5C most scientists think the world would have to suck back greenhouse emissions already in the atmosphere, using processes that remain uncertain. And while negotiators and campaigners plead for a goal that appears unattainable, it is not until very late in the process – the second all-night meeting (called an “indaba”, using a zulu word apparently because a previous meeting was held in Durban) – that the fight gets down to the rules under which countries account for, report and review what they actually will do to achieve the emission reductions they have promised. This seems surprising, since these rules are the only real teeth this agreement has, because the targets themselves have to sit outside the legally binding part of the document (so the deal doesn’t have to go to the US Congress where it would inevitably be scuppered) and the implementing rules contain no sanctions. The whole idea of this thing is that peer pressure holds countries to account and builds the trust that means they agree to deeper cuts over time. It’s doubly surprising since some of the individual country promises are what campaigners politely described as “patchy”. Saudi Arabia, for example, has promised to reduce emissions by a specific amount each year, so long as the Paris agreement doesn’t hurt its capacity to export oil. If it does – and that is surely part of the point of the exercise – the Saudis say they will have to contribute less. (They spend most of the week trying to block pretty much everything anyway). Other promises are conditional on countries getting money. Many developing countries are determined to cling to a principle called “differentiation” enshrined in the 1992 climate convention agreed in Rio de Janeiro. It was conceived to recognise the fact that the industrialisation of rich countries was then responsible for most of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and it wasn’t reasonable to suggest poor countries forgo industrialisation to deal with the problem. But China is now the world’s largest greenhouse emitter. India is the fourth largest.  A new agreement can promise financial help to poor countries to cope with locked-in climate change, it can put different expectations of the extent of emission reductions different countries can deliver, and it can recognise that many of them just aren’t able to do comprehensive emission calculations. But in the view of countries like the United States and Australia, it must set the expectation that China and India and big developing emitters will properly account for their greenhouse gases. This is what they call a “red line”, a dealbreaker. The issue is discussed for hours. International negotiators appear to require superhuman levels of patience, as well as the ability to withstand a process designed to wear them down through the sustained deprivation of sleep. In the end they find an acceptable compromise. The agreement also established a system to review each country’s emissions every five years and conduct regular global “stocktakes” of the targets and also the finance being provided. Those, like Australia and India, which have promised reductions by 2030, will be “requested” to do a 2020 review.  India has made it very clear it is likely to decline the request. It’s formal pledge says things like “our ancient text says; “Keep pure! For the Earth is our mother! And we are her children!” and that “the ancient Indian practice of yoga, for example, is a system that is aimed at balancing contentment and worldly desires, that helps pursue a path of moderation and a sustainable lifestyle”. It includes actual plans, according to an assessment by Carbon Tracker, to lock in another generation of coal-fired power stations and emissions growing to five thousand million tonnes of CO2 by 2030, even though India also has plans for its renewable sector which is set to grow almost twice as fast as its coal-fired electricity generation. According to the United Nations Environment Program, the “gap” between fully implementing all the Paris promises and actually keeping global warming even to 2C is between 12 and 14 thousand million tonnes of carbon dioxide.  Comparing that reality with the political “support” for limiting warming to 1.5C makes the whole singing, dancing, roaring, sleepless circus seem pointless. But then a series of coffee shop conversations challenge my cynic’s take on the conference. I’m talking to Howard Bamsey, who I’ve encountered at many of these events – he was Australia’s lead negotiator in Kyoto in 1997 when the protocol was agreed as well as the special envoy on climate change in Copenhagen in 2009. He says he’s been to 18 or 19 of these “conferences of the parties” or COPs – he’s lost count. He’s an academic now and has always been a details man, not someone to get carried away by the speeches and the singing.  And despite everything, he’s optimistic. “I’ve had this impression growing on me all week. When this process started governments were all important, whether they moved or not was the whole story. Here governments are only part of the picture. When we went to side events by business or environment groups 15 or 20 years ago it was all about the good ideas they might be able to do if they had the right policies. Now it’s about what they have already done,” he says. I think back to the start of the conference. There was this thing called the Lima Paris Action Agenda where hundreds of businesses and thousands of regions and cities made promises to cut emissions that streamed into my email inbox in a torrent.  Mondelēz International promised US$400mn to support the production of sustainable cocoa with zero net deforestation in Africa; Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom announced they’d provide $5bn by 2020 if forest countries demonstrated measured, reported and verified emission reductions; 20 investor groups, representing US$3.2tr, committing to ‘decarbonisation’ of US$600bn in assets, 114 big companies promised to reduce emissions including Ikea, Coca-Cola, Dell, General Mills, Kellogg’s, NRG Energy, Procter & Gamble, Sony and Walmart. Clive Hamilton is the former head of the Australia Institute. He was also in Kyoto, in fact he was the one who did the quick calculations there to show Australia had pulled a swifty with the so-called “Australia Clause” which meant it knew it had already met its Kyoto target even before it was made because it could count land clearing that had already stopped in the state of Queensland. He wrote on the Conversation website that for him “the most surprising revelation here at the Paris climate conference has been the astonishing shift in the world of investors over the past 12 months. There is now unprecedented momentum towards participating in the transition to a low-carbon economy, and the view at the “big end” of the conference is that a strong agreement will provide an extra shove. It’s unstoppable now. “It’s not that investors and chief executives have had an ethical epiphany about climate change; it’s just that they can see where the world is headed, and it makes sense to be part of it rather than being stuck in the economy of the 20th century.” Even the reporting issue – the need to shine a light on what governments are doing – might be to an extent taken out of the hands of governments and the detailed requirements of this agreement, because private groups like Climate Tracker and the World Resources Institute are doing their own calculations and increasingly governments have nowhere to hide. John Niles teaches greenhouse gas accounting at the not-for-profit Greenhouse Gas Management Institute. In Paris he launched an international partnership with similar trainers around the world called the Carbon Institute. They’ll educate a generation of greenhouse gas accountants who can do the work in every country the Paris agreement demands. And if countries can’t or don’t report properly, or try to hide what they are really doing, Niles says the same accounting skills can reveal the truth anyway. “Of course we can check on governments,” he says. “Satellites can check CO2 in the atmosphere ... they can measure the size of a forest and take multidimensional pictures ... they can create a pretty good picture of what a country is doing,” he says. When you look at Paris as an expression of global will, a final piece of evidence for business about where the world is heading, a turbo-charge for investment decisions that are already starting, then the whole kerfuffle about the 1.5C target also makes sense. “It sends a signal, it creates a clear sense of direction, or urgency,” says one veteran negotiator, who asks not to be named. “Without it the take-out message might have been about the ins and outs of exactly what each country was doing and when they would do it. This points to where the world needs to be going and where it intends to go and that signal is unambiguous.” Bamsey concedes the national promises are “very, very patchy.” But he also says concentrating just on the detail of the reporting and the reviews misses the point. “Some developed countries still think of reporting as a way of checking up because you don’t want people getting away with anything, but that is really a reflection of the old thinking of climate change as a burden. Most governments understand it is in their national interest to do more ... what used to be seen as free riding, getting away with not acting, now is seen as economic suicide. “I’m finding it impossible not to be optimistic because it feels like we have reached a tipping point, like this shift has become unstoppable,” he says looking back on a lifetime of COPs like a parent assessing a wayward child who’s somehow turned out OK despite everything. And when the agreement is final reached, that is exactly what business is saying. Nigel Topping, from a coalition called We Mean Business, calls it an “historic economic catalyst”. Michael Jacobs, senior adviser for the New Climate Economy project, says the long-term goals in the agreement send investors the clearest sign “that the world was on an irreversible and irrevocable downward trend in emissions”. So I leave thinking the Paris agreement – for the first time setting expectations for all nations and for the world – might just be a strong enough signal to give real momentum towards slowing global warming despite the dysfunctional international process and the imperfect national promises and the arguments over detail that will continue interminably at such conferences. That’s a cynical optimist’s view of this extraordinary Paris summit."

"Reaching a new global deal on cutting carbon emissions beyond 2020 and agreeing financing to help poorer countries cope with climate change.  Paris’s north-eastern suburb of Le Bourget, from 30 November to 11 December (although the French have said the talks will run over into the weekend). 195 countries are attending, and about 150 world leaders including US president Barack Obama, China’s Xi Jinping, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi and the UK’s David Cameron attended the opening of the summit. Yes – but not immediately. The long-term decisions that governments and businesses take because of a deal in Paris will affect everything from which power plants provide your energy to what food you eat and how likely your home is to flood or be hit by extreme weather in the future. The Kyoto protocol, the world’s only legally binding international climate treaty, initially covered only developed countries, and now covers just the EU, Australia and a handful of other countries who are required to cut emissions by 2020. There’s also a separate, non-binding declaration that covers voluntary cuts by scores of countries, rich and poor, up to 2020. Security was tightened following the attacks, and planned side events, such as a huge march in Paris, did not go ahead. Some observers say the attacks may galvanise greater urgency and solidarity.  Hopeful, with caveats. China’s chief negotiator and the president of last year’s summit in Lima are among those who say the political will finally exists for a deal.  There are still some significant sticking points. Some of these appeared to have been resolved by Friday, the final scheduled day of the talks, but some tricky issues remained for negotiators to resolve. These include disagreements over finance from rich countries to help poorer countries adapt to climate change; how CO2 reductions should be accounted for and whether different rules should apply to rich and poor nations; and the issue of whether there will be language in the agreement that refers to liability or compensation for loss and damage suffered by some countries due to climate changes. The world’s two biggest emitters, China and the US, are both supportive of a deal in Paris – a key difference from the last big climate summit in 2009, when China was seen by many as a wrecker. The third-biggest emitter, India, has been more robust about elements of the proposed deal which it feels are being unfairly applied to it. India and other developing countries say their future growth could be curbed by the wrong kind of deal because of a problem that the rich nations created.  More than 180 countries – representing virtually all of the world’s emissions – have submitted their climate pledges to the UN. But those pledges would still see the world warm by 2.7-3.3C, according to analyses. That’s far more than the 2C world leaders have agreed to hold temperature rises to, which is why many countries want to see a mechanism that reviews them every five years. The UN says the conference will result in around 21,000 tonnes CO2 equivalent. The organisers are offsetting the emissions. Our in-depth guide shows how we got here via two decades of climate talks."

"French MPs have voted unanimously to force supermarkets to give away unsold food that has reached its sell-by date. Shops will also be banned from destroying food products, as they have in the past – sometimes by soaking them in bleach – to prevent them being distributed. The proposal was passed as part of another law in May but was subsequently annulled by France’s constitutional court because of procedural faults. It was reintroduced on Wednesday and passed by members of the Assemblée Nationale with support from across the political spectrum. The legislation was described in the house as a “crucial measure for the planet”, at a time when world leaders are thrashing out an agreement at the COP21 climate change summit. The law will come into effect after it has been rubber-stamped by the Sénat, the upper house of the French parliament, on 13 January. Arash Derambarsh, a local councillor who has campaigned for the law, said it was “a historic victory”. “It’s extremely rare for a law to be passed so quickly and with unanimous support,” he told the Guardian. The new legislation allows individuals to set up associations, with the approval of the agriculture ministry, to collect and distribute food. “It means that ordinary citizens can show their solidarity and help distribute this food to those who need it,” said Derambarsh. He said the next step is to persuade the European commission to require member states to introduce similar legislation across the EU and, eventually, around the world. He described the waste of food and the process of deliberately spoiling it and making it unfit for consumption – while the homeless, poor and unemployed go hungry – as “scandalous and absurd”. An estimated 7.1m tonnes of food are binned in France each year – 67% of it by consumers, 15% by restaurants and 11% by shops. The figure for across the European Union is 89m tonnes, while an estimated 1.3bn tonnes are wasted worldwide. A petition set up by Derambarsh has more than 211,000 signatures in France and 740,000 in Europe. After the vote, city authorities in Paris and a group of Parisian restaurateurs launched operation doggy bag or la box anti-gaspi [anti-waste box] in 100 of the capital’s restaurants. “Almost 60% of inhabitants [of the Paris region] say they do not finish what is on their plate in a restaurant, while 75% of them say they would be ready to use a takeaway bag, to eat it later,” the group said in a statement."
"Governments have signalled an end to the fossil fuel era, committing for the first time to a universal agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to avoid the most dangerous effects of climate change at crunch United Nations talks in Paris.  Speaking outside the conference hall, a jubilant foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said the agreement involving all nations and trading competitors could give Australia “comfort” to take tougher action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. After 20 years of fraught meetings, including the past two weeks spent in an exhibition hall on the outskirts of Paris, negotiators from nearly 200 countries signed on to a deal on Saturday evening that set ambitious goals to limit temperature rise and hold governments to account for reaching those targets. After an anxious two-hour wait for the final plenary session to begin, Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who was chairing the meeting, invited delegates to adopt the agreement. After looking up briefly, he brought down the gavel to widespread applause and cheering, signifying the deal had been formally agreed.  “It is a small gavel but I think it can do a great job,” he said, once the applause had died down. François Hollande, the French president, appealed to negotiators to approve the 31-page text, and said countries had a rare chance to make history. “We are at a decisive point in time,” he said. Fabius said: “It is my deep conviction that we have come up with an ambitious and balanced agreement. Today it is a moment of truth.” Bishop, who led Australia’s negotiating team, said it was a “historic” and “momentous” occasion because the whole world had agreed to act on climate change – something that could also allow Australia to do more. “It gives us comfort that we know what the major economies are doing, our major trading partners are doing, our trading competitors are doing,” she said. “It certainly means there is flexibility for us to do more, and the spirit of the agreement is to encourage countries to be ambitious, to aim higher and to take into account their circumstances. “We are having a review of our policies in 2017 and we will consider what more needs to be done at that time,” Bishop added. “This will give us comfort and confidence that we are working in collaboration with almost 200 other countries, including the major emitters, the US and China.” But she avoided questions about what the deal could mean for Australia’s coal industry, saying every country would act as it saw fit, and nothing would be imposed by others or by the UN. Bishop was the second minister to address the conference after the agreement had been adopted, speaking on behalf of the so-called umbrella group of developed nations. The US president, Barack Obama, meanwhile, hailed the historic deal as “a tribute to strong, principled American leadership”. In a seven-minute address from the White House, the president cited the US agreement with China on carbon in 2014 as a “foundation for success in Paris”.  Obama said the Paris climate deal answered the need for “an enduring global agreement that reduces carbon pollution and sets the world on course to a low-carbon future”. “We met the moment,” the US president said. “I want to thank the people of nearly 200 nations, large and small, developed and developing, for working together to construct a deal for the people of all nations.” He added: “Today the American people can be proud, because this historic agreement is a tribute to American leadership. Over the past seven years, we’ve transformed the United States into the global leader in fighting climate change.” Six years after the chaotic collapse of the Copenhagen climate summit, the agreement now known as the Paris Outcome for the first time commits rich countries, rising economies and some of the poorest countries to work together to fight climate change. Under the deal, adopted by consensus, all countries agreed to reduce emissions. Rich countries agreed to raise $100bn (£66bn, A$1.38bn) a year by 2020 to help poor countries transform their economies. The overall agreement is legally binding, but some elements – including the pledges to curb emissions by individual countries and the climate finance elements – are not. Government and business leaders said the agreement, which set a new goal to reach net zero emissions in the second half of the century, sent a powerful signal to global markets, hastening the transition away from fossil fuels and to a clean energy economy. The International Investors Group on Climate Change, a network managing €13tn of assets, said the decision would encourage greater investments in renewable energy. “Investors across Europe will now have the confidence to do much more to address the risks arising from high carbon assets and to seek opportunities linked to the low-carbon transition already transforming the world’s energy system and infrastructure,” the group said. Jennifer Morgan, of the environmental thinktank the World Resources Institute, said the long term goal was “transformational” and “sends signals into the heart of the markets”. The deal set a high aspirational goal to limit warming below 2C and strive to keep temperatures at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a far more ambitious target than expected, and a key demand of vulnerable countries. It incorporates previous commitments from 186 countries to reduce emissions, which on their own would only hold warming to between 2.7C and 3C. But it sets out procedures for review at regular intervals to deepen emissions cuts, with countries aiming for global greenhouse gas emissions to reach a peak as soon as possible, and then rapidly scale down in the second half of this century. Critics said the agreement would still condemn hundreds of millions of people living in low-lying coastal areas and small islands. But supporters said the negotiations took a significant step forward in getting countries to act together on a global challenge of immense complexity, and in sending a signal to global markets. Saturday’s agreement was the product of years of preparation and two weeks of intense negotiations, capped off by three sleepless nights, with Barack Obama and Hollande phoning other leaders to bring them on side with the deal. Accounts from behind the closed doors of negotiating session described tense exchanges between oil-producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, and a rapidly constituted US- and Europe-backed High Ambition Coalition, which kept up the pressure for a strong temperature goal and regular reviews of emission-cutting plans. #ParisAgreement is adopted in #Paris at #COP21! #GoCOP21 pic.twitter.com/9wCxyshWa7 The French hosts also won praise from negotiators for using a mixture of informal huddles, or indabas, and traditional shuttle diplomacy to bring the deal home. The text commits countries to peak greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, and to seek a balance between human-caused emissions and removals by carbon sinks. “This means bringing down greenhouse gas emissions to net zero within a few decades,” said John Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and a climate adviser to the Vatican. But he added that countries would have to move aggressively, peaking before 2030 and eliminating emissions by 2050 through reforestation and technologies such as carbon capture and storage. For vulnerable countries, the high ambition of the 1.5C goal was offset by the weakening of the agreement when it came to dealing with irreparable damage of climate change. Negotiators and campaigners said pressure from the US and European Union stripped the agreement of language that would have opened up new sources of funding for small islands and low-lying states that could experience irreversible damage due to climate change. “The idea of even discussing loss and damage now or in the future was off limits. The Americans told us it would kill the COP,” said Leisha Beardmore, the chief negotiator for the Seychelles. “They have always been telling us: ‘Don’t even say that’.” Even so, campaign groups were broadly positive about the outcome. Given intense pressure from oil-producing countries, negotiators managed to craft a text that was far more ambitious than expected. The universal nature of the agreement was a radical departure from the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement that drew sharp divisions between the obligations of wealthy and developing countries but ultimately failed to lower emissions. Unlike Kyoto, the agreement reached on Saturday depends on political will, with countries setting their own climate action plans. Rich countries promised that by 2025 they would set a new goal for climate finance “from a floor of $100bn per year”, the figure first pledged at the Copenhagen climate talks six years ago. However, the commitment was offered as a non-binding decision that accompanied the binding text. All the countries agreed on demands from the US and European Union for five-year reviews of their emissions reductions – an exercise that had been resisted by China."

"Even a successful fiction writer would be unlikely to attempt to pull off an absurd conceit whereby the self-styled “greenest-ever” government hands out subsidies to the most heavily polluting companies just as it prepares to approve a global climate change treaty. And yet last week British ministers did just that as a scheme developed under their electricity market reform programme gave £170m to energy companies so that they could build new diesel generators to run for 15 years.  To make matters worse, some of these diesel farms are owned by companies specifically set up by wealthy investors to take advantage of tax breaks through the Enterprise Investment Scheme. And these projects are all submitted on a one-by-one basis so that each falls under a 20 megawatt power threshold – above which they would not be allowed to operate, as they would break EU rules on pollution. Trying to obtain information about or even locate any of these diesel farms is hard. The government says it is up to the National Grid to run the capacity auction and vet the players. The grid, which both organises the auction and – bizarrely – successfully bids into it with its interconnector pipeline network, is coy about the bidders and says it is not empowered to discriminate between fossil fuel or other technologies. The diesel farmers themselves tend to hide behind obscure websites containing little information. One we did pin down said it could not give the locations of its facilities on the grounds that this would be a security risk. The government’s original intention was to hold a series of capacity auctions that would encourage energy firms to bid for financial aid in order to build new, lower carbon and flexible gas-fired power stations to meet peak demand. In fact, companies owning this kind of generating capacity did win half the contracts on offer – but only with existing power stations which would probably have remained operational anyway. A group of nuclear power stations and even coal-fired stations are also all beneficiaries of this generous incentive scheme, which is all paid for through higher bills for the hapless consumer. Something did have to be done. Britain’s energy system is at breaking point, as was clear at the start of last month, when the National Grid was forced to use emergency powers to keep the lights on. The country used to have spare capacity of around 20% which could be called on in the event of power station breakdowns – like the ones that happened in November – or in a winter cold snap when power demand soared. But those spare margins have been falling fast and energy regulator Ofgem warned that next summer they could fall to zero as more old coal and nuclear plants are retired. And yet there is no unforeseen event that triggered this lamentable situation. Climate change is not new – neither is ageing plant or deregulation of the energy sector over the past 25 years, which has helped encourage the wipeout of what was deemed in the City to be “inefficient” excess capacity. The government says diesel farms will run for very short periods and only make up a small part of the generating story. The auction scheme, it insists, ultimately provides energy security and value for money. But relying on climate burning and super-expensive diesel farms as a stop-gap is a symbol of failure at a time when the UK is rightly committing itself to lower carbon emissions at the UN climate talks in Paris. It is particularly grim given that the diesel revolution is accompanied by other anomalies such as huge subsidies being paid to foreign state companies to build the new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset. In addition, investment has been chased away from the cheapest form of renewable energy, onshore wind, while the government has slashed solar subsidies. Ministers have cut insulation and energy efficiency grants and failed to put their weight behind a sector that should be top of everyone’s agenda: demand reduction. Solving our energy problems does not involve science fiction, but it does require consistency, joined-up thinking and resolve. At 7am each weekday, companies listed on the London Stock Exchange issue their news to investors. They can contain the unexpected – a notice headed “change of directorship” can reveal a huge boardroom bust-up – but mainly the statements are timetabled financial information, many of them three-monthly updates. On Friday, though, came a sign that the 7am dump could be about to change: Legal & General announced it would no longer publish results on a quarterly cycle. The insurer is not the first big firm to take such a step: United Utilities, Diageo and National Grid were first to move. But its decision is significant because it is not only a market-listed insurance company but also a major investor in all the companies listed on the market. It is the clearest signal yet that quarterly reporting, introduced via an EU directive in 2007, is no longer a necessity. For a while it served its purpose: quarterly updates by banks during the crisis became more detailed as their bosses tried to demonstrate they were not hiding bad news. But as John Kay – appointed by Vince Cable to look at the reasons behind short-termist investing – pointed out in 2012, it has become something of a tyranny. The quality of the information disclosed often feels less important than the length of the statements being issued. L&G is careful to point out that it must be up to each company to decide whether to carry on with the practice (the rules were changed last year). It should also be flexible. For mining companies, for instance, it might be counterproductive to start releasing financial information less regularly during the current commodities rout. But in more normal times there should be an opportunity to put an end to the quarterly tyranny. Some respite from the quarterly chore may finally be coming for companies that have to spend too much management time preparing and delivering the updates – and for investors and analysts. Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct has always had a tricky relationship with the City. But the retailer – which was last week at the centre of a Guardian investigation revealing how workers are subjected to a regime of searches and surveillance, with thousands of them receiving hourly rates of pay that are effectively below the minimum wage – has survived, endorsed by a group of gold-plated advisers, headed by its joint broker, Goldman Sachs. Goldman, whose London co-head Michael Sherwood is close to Ashley, has helped the billionaire get through some difficult governance issues in the past, including four attempts to push through a £73m bonus for their client. Now Goldman and Sherwood must look again. When the director general of the Institute of Directors, no less, describes Sports Direct as “a scar” on British business, it is time for the company’s advisers to take stock. Shake up the board or quit, to prevent the scar becoming permanent."
