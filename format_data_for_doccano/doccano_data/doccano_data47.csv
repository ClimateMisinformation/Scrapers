"On an autumn afternoon in the Canadian prairies, golden wheat chaff blows from a rumbling grain dryer, shimmering in the sun like a snowfall. Clarence Zeleny stands beside the machine, irritation straining his face. “It’s giving me trouble today,” says the 83-year-old farmer as he studies the snaking tubes and wiring.  Dryers like this, which blast freshly harvested wheat and canola with warm air, are essential for farmers in the region as they attempt to salvage another poor harvest: weeks of rain and snow have left crops too wet to cut or sell otherwise. “Too many more years like this and farmers here might not survive,” he says. The patchwork of farms across the vast landscape of Canada’s western prairie provinces has long been the source of much of the world’s supply of canola seed and wheat. But farmers across the region are increasingly feeling pushed to the brink by an unfolding crisis that shows little sign of easing. This year’s dismal harvest marks the fourth poor season in a row – the worst run of bad luck in memory – and comes against a grim background of plummeting incomes and a trade war with China. “A farmer always says next year will be better,” says Norma Zeleny as she and Clarence lunch on cheese and crackers. Norma has helped run the family grain farm for nearly six decades. But the changes she’s witnessed over the years have made her question such received wisdom. “It’s sad because a lot of young people really do want to do farming. But they’re being discouraged.” According to Statistics Canada, farming incomes across the country dropped by 45% in 2018 – in Alberta the figure was closer to 70% – due to higher operating costs and interest rates and stagnant or falling crop prices. Meanwhile, the price of farmable land has soared, driven up by scarcity and speculation. When they first started their farm nearly 60 years ago, the Zelenys paid $100,000CAD (£58,500) adjusted for inflation, for 64 hectares (160 acres). A similar-sized plot now sells for more than six times the amount. The price of machinery has outpaced incomes: a combine harvester can cost nearly three-quarters of a million dollars, more than twice the cost of a house in town, and many farmers find themselves plunging ever deeper into debt. “It’s not uncommon for farmers to have millions of dollars in debt or to be very asset-rich, but cash-poor,” says Andria Jones-Bitton, an epidemiologist at the University of Guelph who studies farmers’ mental health. “One family I know have a $5m (£3m) loan over their head.” To make matters worse, Canadian farmers have spent nearly a year hostage to a diplomat dispute with China; Beijing halted all imports of canola from the country following the arrest of Huawei telecoms executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a US arrest warrant. The cold realities of modern farming in a globalised world have concentrated unprecedented pressures on individual farmers. Nearly half of all farmers in Canada feel immense stress from their job, according to research by Jones-Bitton. Although communities and government agencies are working to improve awareness of mental health, suicide has become a growing occupational hazard. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control found that farmers killed themselves five times more often than other sections of the population. Canada doesn’t track similar statistics with as much detail but Jones-Bitton said the country’s farmers die by suicide at rates much higher than other groups. “People say, ‘I’m worth more to my family dead than I am alive because of insurance’. It’s heartbreaking,” she says. ••• Sitting in the late morning sun at his kitchen table, Larry Kitz is exhausted. The night before, he seized the brief window of opportunity offered by a change in the weather and hired a team workers to harvest grain overnight in sub-zero temperatures. “There’s so many tentacles grabbing you at the same time – bank, weather, markets,” he says. He knows all too well the effect mounting stress can have on local farmers: his brother Gary, who ran the farm with him, killed himself two years ago. “Nothing was going right for him,” says Larry. “I reflect back and those fricking signs were there. The signs were there. I feel just horrible because dammit, it was happening.” He admits he comes from a region – and a generation – where speaking openly about mental health wasn’t encouraged. But after seeing how his girlfriend, a nurse of 25 years, meets friends as a way to process work-related trauma, Larry decided to follow suit. In recent weeks, he and a group of friends have met at a local diner to eat breakfast and openly discuss the challenges of life on the farm. “It’s the best damn therapy out there,” he says. It still takes an effort to share his concerns, he said, but speaking openly about the uncertainties of the harvest, the weather and the markets “makes a world of difference”. Other farmers are more bullish on both their mental health and their chances in the industry. Forced inside by a howling snowstorm, Braden Halina reclines in his garage, a can of beer in hand. The 28-year-old, from the town of Vegreville, Alberta, is a rarity, as fewer young people are taking up farming. After losing his father to suicide three years ago, Halina was forced to run the family farm. Now a father himself, he admits that the stresses of the job can seem daunting but he remains optimistic. “I’ve never really reached out for any help, because I don’t think that I need it, to be honest. I think I got it under control,” he says. Halina says he has developed defensive instincts that he hopes will better insulate him from the unpredictability of markets and weather. After all, he reasons, the world still needs people like him. “You need farmers. You fucking need farmers.” But the world that farms work in is changing. Experts predict the prairie region will warm in the coming years, potentially improving the growing season in some areas, but also increasing precipitation, which can delay the harvest. Many farmers in the area are sceptical about climate change science, but the area has already started to experience the effects; in 2017, forest fires hundreds of kilometres away in British Columbia blanketed the prairie region near Mundare with smoke, dramatically curtailing the growing season. While farmers debate how much to read into the changing weather, they also express frustration that their voices fall on deaf ears. Canada recently went through 16 weeks of election campaigning, with candidates criss-crossing the country in search of votes. But none of the party leaders, or the local candidates, spoke about the challenges farmers are facing, said Ryan Warawa, who farms 4,300 acres (1,740 hectares) outside of Mundare, Alberta. Like many in the prairies, he feels that the rest of the country is ignorant of the anxiety and desperation overwhelming farmers. “A farmer puts all his money and his heart into farming … and a lot of these city people haven’t got a clue what it takes to run a farm. No one cares about where their food comes from.” By late autumn, Ryan and his father, Danny, have nearly 1,400 acres (566 hectares) of unharvested wheat and canola in their fields. With weather jumping erratically between rain and bitter cold, the harvest is unlikely to be finished before winter sets in. Leaving the crop in the field might give them the chance to harvest the remainder in spring, but they will have to sell it for much less. If the trend of cold, damp days continues, “you might as well put a for sale sign up on the farm”, says Danny, who spurned retirement to help his son. To hedge against the increasingly bleak returns from wheat and canola, he points past the sheds and grain bins to a pasture he calls his insurance policy. Milling around the fields is a herd of 54 bison he recently purchased with his savings. “They’re my retirement,” he says with a laughs. “They pay me better than any bonds I could have bought.” Ryan estimates that they have $700,000 (£410,000) of wheat and canola left in the field – but they owe a similar amount to the bank. The family doesn’t own a grain dryer, which costs more than $130,000 (£76000), meaning no matter how hard they work or plan, the success of his operation will depend on the weather. “I got an 11-year old kid that absolutely loves the farm and would quit school tomorrow if I told him he could take over,” says Ryan, staring down at the ground, hands in pockets. “But I don’t want him to do this.” • Crisis Services Canada can be contacted on 1-833-456-4566.

I was notified by reader Ken of an interview conducted by German daily Augsburger Zeitung (AZ), appearing in the hard copy edition. Now posted here in German.
44-year veteran meteorologist Klaus Hager. Photo credit: University of Augsburg 
Interviewed was meteorologist Klaus Hager. He was active in meteorology for 44 years and now has been a lecturer at the University of Augsburg almost 10 years. He is considered an expert in weather instrumentation and measurement.
The Augsburger Zeitung writes that “hardly any of his colleagues are as familiar with the weather as the 73-year old is“.
“Fluctuations dominate climate, not trends”
The Augsburger Zeitung wanted to know Hager’s views on climate change. Hager doesn’t hold back any punches, claiming that “people are being deceived” on the subject and that man’s influence on the climate is very small.
On whether temperatures are warming in the Augsburg region, Hager says there is “no detectable trend showing this is so” and that it’s been cooling since 2005. When it comes to the climate variability, he agrees with Professor Lauscher of the University of Vienna: “Fluctuations dominate climate, not trends“.
Warming an artifact of new instrumentation
One reason for the perceived warming, Hager says, is traced back to a change in measurement instrumentation. He says glass thermometers were was replaced by much more sensitive electronic instruments in 1995. Hager tells the SZ (my emphasis):

For eight years I conducted parallel measurements at Lechfeld. The result was that compared to the glass thermometers, the electronic thermometers showed on average  a temperature that was 0.9°C warmer. Thus we are comparing – even though we are measuring the temperature here – apples and oranges. No one is told that.”
Hager confirms to the AZ that the higher temperatures are indeed an artifact of the new instruments.
Hager also calls climate change and climate protection “ideologically charged topics“.
“People are being deceived especially when it comes to reducing CO2.” He tells the AZ that weather depends on dozens of single factors – all of various weighting.
The AZ, seemingly stunned by it all, asks Hager: “So you’re saying that the calls for climate protection connected to CO2 are not serious?” Hager confirms, answering:
The CO2 taxes that are being levied are actually a sin against national wealth. If you want to stop the alleged climate change, then you need to ask what it’s all about and who profits from it at the expense of the citizens.”
Hager then explains how CO2 is only a trace gas and that its role in climate is overhyped.
When asked about how his position is completely contradictory to that of the mainstream, Hager scoffs at the notion:
You know I check facts and I want others to think about it and not to just swallow everything unfiltered- just because its the current zeitgeist. Manmade climate change will turn out to be a climate bubble. It’s going to pop like the forest die-off scare – and will do so because of nature – here I mean when solar activity falls again.”
I wonder how much longer he’ll lecturing at the university of Augsburg. Expect the warming-jihadists to go after him. Kudos to the Augsburger Zeitung for printing the interview!

It is well known that the local sea level is heavily influenced by wind speed and direction as well as barometric pressure. Most people are aware of storm surges associated with hurricanes, for example. The same thing happens on a near-global scale, and some of it is near-permanent. Here is a global map of sea level anomaly from the University of Colorado.

Figure 1 is the sea level rise trend since satellite radar altimetry began.
In Figure 1, the sea level in the Western Pacific has risen 10 or 12 mm per year, while the eastern Pacific, parts of the Southern Ocean, and a spot in the Atlantic, have fallen by 3 to 5 mm per year, over the satellite era.
The next interesting map comes from the European Space Agency (ERA). This map is generated by taking the sea surface height as measured by satellite and subtracting the gravity model from GOCE. The result is the sea surface height over the geoid.

Figure 2 is the sea surface height over the Geoid. 
Note the difference in height between the western Pacific and the Southern Ocean, about 3 meters. The difference in height between the western Pacific and the coasts of North and South America is over a meter. These height differences drive ocean currents. These differences are maintained by wind and pressure differences. If wind and pressure change, the sea level changes accordingly.
 
Next are plots (Figures 3 and 4) from Garza et al 2012, of Sea Level Pressure (SLP), and wind changes over the 1980 to 2009 epoch.
The SLP has increased over the eastern Pacific and decreased over the western Pacific. North of 10°N, easterly trade winds have increased in the eastern Pacific and south of 10°N, they have decreased. These small changes, along with thermal expansion, have changed the relative sea level between the two sides of the Pacific Basin by 1%, one centimeter out of one meter. My point is that not all of the western Pacific sea level rise is due to warming, a great deal of it is due to wind and SLP change.
Do you remember the controversy last year about the trade winds? One paper had them increasing, due to global climate change; the other had them decreasing due to climate change. They were both right. They were just looking at different parts of the elephant. North of 10° North the winds increased; south of 10° North the winds decreased.

"Three families of beavers are to be introduced on land managed by the National Trust as part of plans to ease flooding and improve biodiversity. Two Eurasian beaver families will be released next spring into enclosures at Holnicote estate on Exmoor, in Somerset, and another group will arrive at Valewood on the Black Down estate, on the border of West Sussex and Surrey.  Beavers were hunted to extinction 400 years ago in the UK for their fur, meat and scent glands. In recent years there has been a series of controlled reintroductions, including one by the government in the Forest of Dean, in Gloucestershire, as solutions are sought to tackle flooding. A wild colony also appears to have re-established itself spontaneously in the River Otter, in Devon. The schemes at Holnicote and Black Down are the first led by the National Trust and have been approved by Natural England. It is not yet clear how many animals will be brought in but it could be as many as 12: six adults and six kits. Ben Eardley, the project manager for the National Trust at Holnicote, said: “Our aim is that the beavers become an important part of the ecology at Holnicote, developing natural processes and contributing to the health and richness of wildlife in the area. “Their presence in our river catchments is a sustainable way to help make our landscape more resilient to climate change and the extremes of weather it will bring.” The beavers, which will live in two wooded enclosures, are one element in a range of measures being introduced at Holnicote that includes a pioneering project to return a tributary of the River Aller to its natural path.  Eardley said: “The beavers will help us achieve a more natural flow pattern, slowing, cleaning and storing water and developing complex river habitats. The dams the beavers create will hold water in dry periods, help to lessen flash flooding downstream and reduce erosion and improve water quality by holding silt.” Releases at both National Trust sites will be into fenced enclosures of 2-4 hectares (5- 10 acres) each so that the impact of the animals on the local ecology and the river can be properly assessed and understood. The beavers will be transferred from Scotland, where they have been successfully breeding since being reintroduced in 2006. The National Trust beavers are expected to breed and when the young become mature they will need to be moved, possibly to other sites owned or run by the charity. David Elliott, the lead ranger for Valewood, said: “Beavers are nature’s engineers and can create remarkable wetland habitats that benefit a host of species including water voles, wildfowl, craneflies, water beetles and dragonflies. These in turn help support breeding fish and insect eating birds such as spotted flycatchers. “There are just a handful of sites in the British Isles that have beavers. This is a different way of managing sites for wildlife – a new approach, using a native animal as a tool. “The beavers will live along the stream at Valewood and gradually create little ponds, dams and rivulets. Making a habitat that is perfect for them and for many birds, amphibians and invertebrates.” Both projects will be monitored with help from Exeter University and others, to note both ecological and hydrological changes to habitat. A footpath passes through the Valewood enclosure and close to one of the Holnicote pens so it may be possible for members of the public to glimpse the animals – though they tend to be active at dawn or dusk and can be shy."
"The Greens have launched what they describe as a radical and transformative manifesto with a warning that this could be the last general election where voters can choose MPs with a realistic chance of stopping runaway climate change. Unveiling the manifesto, based on 10 proposed bills on issues including the climate emergency and an economic vision based on equality, the Green co-leaders, Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley, said their party was the only one taking the issue seriously.  Speaking at a wildlife centre in south-west London, Bartley castigated Labour and other parties for failing to match their commitment for net zero carbon emissions by 2030, at the centre of the manifesto plan for a “green new deal”. Labour’s conference passed a motion making this commitment, but it is believed the party’s manifesto will water this down. The green new deal would “decarbonise every sector of the economy by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain”, Bartley said: “Our very planet is ringing the alarm. Hitting snooze for another 15 years simply isn’t an option.” He continued: “The Conservatives say net zero by 2050. Not good enough. The Lib Dems say net zero by 2045. Not good enough. “Labour members said net zero by 2030, but the party appears to be rowing the boat back. Not good enough. While the other parties are catching up, we’re racing ahead into the distance.” Berry told the launch that it was “the last election where we can take the first step down the right path, and that is what we must do”. Speaking afterwards, she stressed: “If we don’t get our carbon emissions down by 2030, there’s a 50/50 chance of tipping into runaway climate change, which doesn’t bear thinking about. “When I was a young person worried about climate change people would say to me: ‘You’re the future, your generation can sort this out.’ I can’t say that to the young generation, because there isn’t time for someone who is 15 now to get into power and do the things that are needed. It’s actually up to this generation of politicians. “Specifically, it’s those people elected in this election. The next set of MPs might be left with an impossible task.” The green new deal would seek to deliver on the 2030 target by reshaping the economy around industries such sustainable energy. The other nine promised bills cover: A second EU referendum. At least £6bn extra a year for the NHS. Scrapping university fees. A “sustainable economy bill” to ensure the economy functions within environmental limits. A “future generations bill”, requiring decisions to consider the needs of the future. Creating a universal basic income. Building 100,000 zero-carbon social rented homes a year. Improving tenants’ rights and lowering rents. Introducing proportional representation voting and an elected upper house of parliament. The Greens hope their distinct offering will cut through, amid signs the party could, as in the 2017 election, become marginalised during a tough Labour-Conservative battle. After good local election results, and an almost 12% vote share in May’s European elections, the party is now polling at about 3%. We believe that the escalating climate crisis is the defining issue of our lifetimes and that the planet is in the grip of an emergency. We know that our readers and supporters around the world care passionately about this too, as so many of you have told us. We want the Guardian to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe. So at the Guardian we commit to the following: Read our full environmental pledge  Berry warned there was a danger of the Greens being squeezed but said the electoral system and wider political culture was to blame. “In general elections there’s always a squeeze, a focus on the two big parties. But our system is broken,” she said. Berry highlighted the first TV election debate on Tuesday, in which only Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn will take part, with Berry and other leaders given a brief chance to contribute in a later programme. “The idea you’re going to have two people whose views on Brexit are not that far apart, you’re not going to have anyone there really holding them to account on their promises on the climate emergency, is ridiculous,” she said. “That’s a real symptom of how bad our democracy is in general.” The party, which has formed an anti-Brexit electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, has set its sights on eight new target constituencies, including Bristol West, Bury St Edmunds, Dulwich and West Norwood, Exeter, Forest of Dean and Isle of Wight."

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote a post about how a 44-year veteran German meteorologist poured cold water on the hypothesis of a man-made global warming and pointed out that a change in temperature instrumentation is probably behind much of the reported warming that Germany has supposedly seen since the 1980s.
Klaus Hager also has a website. At this website he posted a meteorological bulletin, which he authored and was published as an annex to the Berliner Wetterkarte (Berlin Weather Chart).
That bulletin was about the results of his eight and a half year study where he compared in a side-by-side test the former glass mercury thermometers with the newer electronic thermometers, which were installed during the 1980s and 1990s by Germany’s DWD German Weather Service.
Earlier mercury thermometer method
Earlier temperature measurement was done using a mercury/alcohol glass thermometer, where readings were taken ten minutes before each hour. The daily mean temperature was computed using the “Mannheimer” hourly values 07h, 14h, and 2 times 21h, all divided by 4. The DWD used this formula until March 31, 2001. The extreme temperatures were read at the glass thermometer at 7 a.m. as the low, and 9 p.m. for the maximum. Temperature was measured inside an “English” weather hut.
New electronic system
The new electronic system, however, employs a completely different sensor technology, known as the Pt 100, where temperature is measured with two measurement sensors that check each other. Each second a value is generated and measured for an entire minute, i.e. minute mean. The daily mean temperature is calculated from 24 values, each at 10 minutes before the hour (e.g. at 8:50 for 9 a.m.) The extreme is calculated from the minute mean values between 00 h and 24h. Today they are recorded inside a plastic hut with slats (at first made of aluminum).
The advantages and disadvantages are listed in the annex below.
Hager writes that although electronic sensors and the comprehensive IT networking implemented by the German DWD Weather Service do offer many advantages, there are also a number of disadvantages which he says are of importance with respect to assessing climate change, especially when comparing old datasets from the mercury thermometers to the new datasets recorded by the electronic sensor technology. He writes that it’s close to comparing “an apple and an orange”.
Results of 8.5 year side-by-side test
Hager compared the two different measurement systems side by side at the GeiInfoAdvisory Office of Fliegerhorst Lechfeld from January 1, 1999 to Jul 31, 2007. The following is a plot of the differences between the two measurement methods:

Figure 1: Differences in the daily maximum temperatures from the Pt 100 compared to glass thermometers for 3124 days (ca. 8.5 years) conducted at the GeiInfoAdvisory Office of Fliegerhorst Lechfeld (from 4) – mean difference 0.93°C.  Figure from Rengelink, 2012)
Clearly the electronic thermometers produced warmer readings than the mercury thermometers.
Worse, Hager says, the German DWD Weather Service did not adequately investigate the two different measuring systems and compare them, writing that:
Although the DWD set up so-called climate reference stations at (way to few) locations and published the studies from the comparison measurements, the results unfortunately were not satisfactory. Here not the “old data was compared to the new data”, instead only the electronic thermometer was investigated in various locations, but were not compared with the glass thermometers, which are readily at hand.”

Hager provides an example illustrating why one must be very wary when comparing data from the new electronic instrumentation to data taken from the old mercury thermometers. The following chart depicts an example comparison for the temperature measured using the two different methods on a single day, 12 November 2005:

Figure 2: Pt 100 measurements taken on 12 November 2005 at Fliegerhorst Lechfeld (WMO 10856) station. Red curve (upper) is the measurement sensor of the aluminum enclosure, showing daily mean temperature of 5.9°C. Blue curve (lower) is the Stevenson screen, showing daily mean temperature of only 5.2°C.
Hager writes:
Differing daily measured values from the old and new sensors for temperature measurement spurred the author [Hager] to conduct a comparison spanning from January 1, 1999 to July 31, 2006 at Fliegerhorst Lechfeld (WMO 10856) 8-1/2 years long, daily without interruption, among other comparison tests of mercury maximum glass thermometers in a Stevenson screen and a Pt 100 resistance thermometer inside an aluminum enclosure, both unventilated. The 3144 days yielded a mean difference of +0.93°C; the Pt 100 was higher than the mercury thermometer. The maximum daily difference even reached 6.4°C!
You can see the maximum difference in Figure 1, occurring in early 2006.
Hager also writes that the difference was between 0 – 1°C on 41% of the days, 1 – 3°C on 26% of the days, and over 2°C on 15% of the days [Here we assume that Hager made a typographical error and meant “1 – 2°C”]. Only on 15% of the days did mercury thermometers show higher mean temperatures.
Hager attributes the wide range of differences on factors such as cloudiness, sunshine duration, wind speed and air mass changes. The results, Hager writes, show that:
Earlier measured values cannot be compared to the values measured today for longer term temperature datasets without having interruptions in the overall dataset.”
Not only is the temperature sensing method very different than it was before, Hager writes that also the method for determining the daily mean temperature is different and thus another source of discrepancy. Earlier the “Manheimer” hours (7h +14h + 2 times 21h divided by 4 was used. Today the daily mean is comprised of 24 hourly values from 00 h to 23 h divided by 24.  “This too falsifies the quality of the recorded values,” writes Hager.
Hager concludes:
This all should give the current science something to think about, because actual practice tells us that there is a necessary rethinking when it comes to the theoretical and numerical approaches used for assessing the swings in climate.”
Annex:
Advantages/disadvantages of electronic measurement
Advantages:
– Considerable personnel costs savings due to elimination of visual readings.
– Possible densification of the measurement network through new sensor locations.
– Up-to-date and immediate availability of measured values.
– Extending the spectrum of measurements, e.g. radiation measurement.
– At times high measurement accuracy due to minimal sensor inertia.
Disadvantages
– Lack of comparability between the old measurements and those of the new sensors.
– Thermometer: formerly glass thermometer, today Pt 100 sensor.
– Precipitation measurement unit: formerly Hellmann pan, today with the teetering unit or the new weight measurement of precipitation.
– Humidity: formerly using the hair hygrometer, today it is the dew-point sensor or capacitive sensor.
– Wind speed: formerly using the cup anemometer, today with an ultrasound unit.
– Snow depth measurement: formerly measured by hand, today with laser or ultrasound device.
– Precipitation type and weather appearance of snow, rain, hail, and cloud observation are done by visual observation.
– Increased maintenance requirements for the sensors done by a maintenance center.
– Sensor downtime of various types with disruptions in the climate dataset.
– Onset of measurement techniques through other evaluations of daily means, see: Temperature Measurement at the DWD “Formerly and Today”.

"The furore that erupted when David Slater, a British wildlife photographer, released a “selfie” taken by a macaque monkey in 2015 has only just reached legal resolution. The animal rights group, PETA (“People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals”), which had filed on behalf of the macaque, allegedly named “Naruto”, withdrew its suit against Slater when he agreed to give 25% of any royalties from the selfie to animal welfare charities. This case marks a high-profile opening salvo in a struggle that will be increasingly fought among animal rights activists, protectors of human intellectual property and defenders of the free market. The case has been generally reported as being about whether a macaque that took a selfie (and gained worldwide notoriety courtesy of Wikipedia) is entitled to copyright. While this account is fine as far it goes, the case also hints at the profound challenges that digital and animal cultures pose to the law’s recognition of human uniqueness. The story begins with Wikipedia, whose “open source” and “open access” approach to knowledge production makes it the ultimate free market in cyberspace. Basically anything is fair game for inclusion on its pages if it is not prohibited either by its own editors, who are largely crowdsourced, or some explicit legal ruling. When Wikipedia’s editors decided to feature the macaque selfie, Slater claimed that it was in violation of his copyright. The selfie had been taken while his camera was active but unattended in Indonesia, where he was on assignment photographing the rare monkeys. Wikipedia replied by saying that if anyone owned the copyright, it was the macaque who actually took the selfie. At that point, PETA got involved, suing Slater on behalf of the macaque for copyright infringement. The court had no problem dismissing the case, simply by arguing that copyright law was not designed to include animals as copyright-holders. But it also said that the law may be amended to include them in the future. In doing so, it tiptoed around the issue that PETA was keen on raising, namely, whether the monkey was morally entitled to whatever royalties might otherwise accrue to Slater as the copyright-holder. This helps to explain the out-of-court settlement, which left Slater the formal victor in the case. But that was really all that he was left with. Slater had been earning minuscule royalties from the selfie and even approached bankruptcy as PETA’s case against him dragged on. The most striking feature of the case is not the very idea that a monkey might hold copyright, but that the internet’s relatively unregulated market environment provided the opportunity to broach the issue. The placement of a photo in virtual as opposed to physical reality radically loosens our intuitions about ownership. This became clear in the recent flurry of cases around the multiple postings of nude celebrity selfies in social media. Defendants claimed loss of control over their image in a world where image control is everything. In a more profound sense, something similar is happening to the image of the human being itself in the monkey selfie case. The monkey selfie case managed to level the playing field between the human and the animal because the distinction between producer and consumer is largely erased in cyberspace. Unless the law intervenes, an online object can be reframed and reappropriated as the user wishes. And among these reframings and reappropriations are accounts of what makes the object what it is. In the end, only the explicit disqualification of animals from copyright law ended up saving Slater, even though some legal experts admitted that Naruto may have behaved toward the camera in a way that would make a comparably situated human eligible for copyright. Faced with Slater’s original claim to copyright infringement, Wikipedia interestingly gave little weight to the core of Slater’s argument, which was that had he not gone to Indonesia, photographed the macaques and even set up the camera so that they might use it, the selfie would never have been taken. (Of course, Slater was also the one who allowed the photos to go online in the first place.)  Instead Wikipedia focused on the particular monkey’s skill in arranging the camera so as to take the striking selfie. To the ears of animal rights activists, Wikipedia made Slater sound like an employer who claims ownership over his employees’ labour because he took the effort to set up the business for which they work. When only humans are involved, it’s called exploitation. Why not extend the same concept to the macaques? Whatever may have motivated Wikipedia to pursue this framing of the situation, it certainly resonates with the history of extending human rights. Thanks to Karl Marx, we understand exploitation as a form of injustice that comes when workers are denied the full fruits of their labour. Wikipedia opened the door to revisit Marx, and PETA charged through it. The original capitalist rejoinder was that the employer is the one who takes the initial risk, invests the capital and sets up the environment which makes the work possible and so the workers, who might otherwise not be employed, should be satisfied with a steady wage, not a share of the profits. One hears echoes of Slater’s defence here, including his claim that his photography was part of an effort to save the macaques from extinction. But bound up in this dispute is a disagreement about whether all producers are also creators. Historically, in the human sphere, Marx ultimately won this argument, largely by appealing to a conception of the human that is both universal and exceptional: all (but only) humans are both producers and creators. Like today’s copyright law, Marx recognised a clear species barrier between humans and other animals when it comes to creativity.  Cyberspace’s blurring of the producer/consumer distinction may be opening the door to reimagining “creator” more generally, as the source of whatever makes an object valuable to its user. In that case, the law may need to be adjusted to provide legal protection to “creative” animals in the same spirit as it historically provided protection to “creative” workers."
"Jeremy Corbyn has launched the most radical Labour manifesto in decades, promising an “investment blitz” that would leave no corner of the UK untouched and welcoming the hostility of billionaires, big business and dodgy landlords. Speaking at an upbeat event at Birmingham City University, where students and activists leaned over balconies adorned with banners setting out Labour’s policies, Corbyn urged the public to vote for “hope” at the general election in three weeks’ time. At the centre of the manifesto, called It’s Time for Real Change, is a large increase in public investment, funded by taxes on corporations and top earners. The Labour leader called it “a manifesto full of popular policies that the political establishment has blocked for a generation”, and it appeared significantly more radical than the party’s 2017 programme. Corbyn insisted that, as Labour has promised in 2017, there would be no tax rises for 95% of earners, with only those on incomes of more than £80,000 being affected. “You can have this plan for real change, because you don’t need money to buy it: you just need a vote,” he said. A Labour government would also give public sector workers a 5% pay rise next year, helping to offset the impact of the 1% pay cap that has been in place for several years, the manifesto says. One key revenue-raiser is an £11bn windfall tax on oil and gas companies which would create a “just transition fund” to help shift the UK towards a green economy without causing mass job losses. The one-off tax would be calculated according to an assessment of each firm’s past contribution to the climate crisis, Labour said, and could be paid over a number of years. The total is 10 times the £1.1bn the Treasury expects to raise from the oil and gas sector this year. Corbyn said: “We can no longer deny the climate emergency. We can see it all around us, as the recent floods in Yorkshire and the east Midlands have shown. We have no time to waste. The crisis demands swift action, but it isn’t right to load the costs of the climate emergency on to the nurse, the builder or the energy worker. “So a Labour government will ensure the big oil and gas corporations that profit from heating up our planet will shoulder and pay their fair share of the burden with a just transition tax.” The windfall tax is one of the most striking policies in Labour’s manifesto, and follows a string of significant announcements during the general election campaign, including: Free broadband for all, paid for by taxing tech multinationals and part-nationalising BT. A pledge to build 150,000 council and social homes a year by the end of the parliament. Six years of free training for adults and 1,000 new Sure Start centres. With Boris Johnson pressing home the Tories’ message that he will “get Brexit done”, Labour has been keen to shift the election debate to domestic policies – including its determination to tackle the climate crisis. Corbyn has also repeatedly underlined his determination to take on big business, deliberately putting himself on the side of “the many”, against “the most powerful people in Britain”. The proceeds of the new tax would go towards adapting the economy to tackle the climate crisis, including retraining workers from the oil and gas industries and investing in green technologies. As expected, Labour’s migration policy is significantly less liberal than the open borders motion passed at its conference in Brighton. The relevant passage says: “If we remain in the EU, freedom of movement will continue. If we leave, it will be subject to negotiations, but we recognise the social and economic benefits that free movement has brought both in terms of EU citizens here and UK citizens abroad – and we will seek to protect those rights.” Labour is also publishing a separate “grey book” alongside its manifesto, to show how it will fund its promises. It detailed tax increases worth £82bn a year. These would include a £9bn a year tax on financial transactions – the buying and selling of shares. Higher earners would also face tax increases, with those paid more than £80,000 subject to a 45p rate, and a new “super-rich” rate of 50p for those earning more than £125,000. Many of the new costs will fall on business, with income from dividends and capital gains being taxed at the same rate of income, for example. Labour’s trade union supporters have insisted that its ambition of making progress towards net zero carbon emissions by 2030 must be backed by strong protection for workers – including the creation of 1 million jobs in green industries. The windfall tax may prove controversial in Scotland, where Labour faces a tough battle against the Scottish National party, and where many voters have long felt they never benefited sufficiently from the country’s natural resources. The decision to focus the “just transition fund” partly on retraining oil and gas workers appears to be aimed at assuaging some of those concerns. Corbyn said: “North Sea oil and gas workers have powered this country for decades, often working under dangerous conditions. We won’t hang them out to dry.” In 1997, the New Labour government imposed a windfall tax on utilities companies, which were perceived to have made excess profits in the years after privatisation. The proceeds were used to fund welfare-to-work policies. Labour said £11bn was an estimate and the final figure would be based on an assessment of the cost of the retraining and investments in green technologies. Output from the North Sea peaked in 1999, but the industry is likely to argue that the tax would accelerate its decline."
"Hermit crabs are well known for their ability to turn an empty shell into protective armour, but it seems that shells aren’t the only armour around. A new species of hermit crab that shelters in solitary corals has been discovered in southern Japan. Details of the discovery, made by scientists at Kyoto University, have just been published in the journal PLOS ONE. With bright red legs and brilliant white claws, the adult crab is just a few millimetres across but is capable of carrying coral bodies that are far larger. Named after the coral it carries, Diogenes heteropsammicola has a lot to gain from having a coral for a home. Throughout their lives most hermit crabs shift from shell to shell to get a better fit, competing with other crabs to get the best deal. But for this particular species, there is no need. Its body sits safely curled up inside a cavity in the coral – a space that grows with the crab, so it never needs to find a new shelter. To add to that, the coral comes with a sting, protecting the crab from would-be predators, like starfish, larger crabs and octopus. The crab certainly gets a good deal here, but what of the coral? Not all corals are the reef-building kind. Solitary corals, like those inhabited by these crabs, are often found on shallow sandy seabeds. Such a lifestyle comes with the risk of being buried by sediment and overturned by strong currents. To combat this, some (known as walking corals) have evolved an incredible partnership with other creatures to shift them out of the sand and on to pastures new. Walking corals literally use other species to do their walking for them. Until now, the key coral-shifting creatures we knew about were “sipunculans” – a type of marine worm that, in exchange for accommodation, would shuffle corals across the seafloor. Relationships like this are known as symbiotic and each partner, accordingly, is known to science as a symbiont. It is very unusual for a symbiotic relationship to change and – if it does – the new partner is usually from a closely related species. This is because both symbionts are heavily dependent on each other. They are also highly specialised, which makes working with another partner difficult. But hermit crabs have now been found inhabiting some of the corals in the Amami Islands, part of a chain that stretches southwards from Japan towards Taiwan. The crabs filled the exact same cavity often occupied by worms. They filled the same role: walking the coral out of trouble, and they even received the same shelter benefits in return. So how did this come about? I contacted Momoko Igawa, one of the scientists who made the discovery while surveying corals in the Amami and Okinawa Islands. She told me that typically a young coral first settles on a small shell that has already been colonised by a sipunculan. “The coral then grows over and ultimately beyond the shell, providing a coiled cavity for the equally growing worm partner,” she explained. It seems likely that a similar process led to hermit crabs inhabiting the corals. The corals provide shelter for the hermit crabs, protecting them from predators. In turn, the crab transports the coral about the sea floor, rescuing it when overturned by strong currents and stopping it from getting stuck in a sediment overload. As Igawa points out, these are mysterious animals with a remarkable evolutionary history."
"Gas is hugely important to the UK. The country uses more than 65 billion cubic metres to heat most of its 25m homes and generate around a quarter of its electricity each year. Despite efforts to move to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, demand for gas is likely to remain high for the foreseeable future. Until 2004 all the gas the country needed was sourced from the UK, primarily from the North Sea and East Irish Sea. Since then, production has declined to the point where indigenous gas provides only 45% of the total. The shortfall comes from European pipelines (38%), particularly from Norway and Russia; and liquid natural gas (LNG) deliveries (17%), primarily from Qatar.  This dependency on foreign gas is precarious to say the least. We saw this in March 2013, for example, when an unseasonal cold snap almost left the country short of supplies. It was averted by an LNG delivery docking at Milford Haven in Wales in the nick of time.  This late in its lifespan, conventional new gas exploration in the North Sea is unlikely to reverse this situation. This is why many argue that the UK should consider all options, including onshore shale gas. They point to its success in the US and the recent announcement that Centrica will decommission the UK’s main gas storage site in the southern North Sea, making the country even more reliant on imports to meet the demand.  Meanwhile, opponents raise understandable concerns about the environmental impact of the hydraulic fracturing – fracking – that would be involved and on the industrial scale required. This seems to have resonated with the public, with support for fracking recently hitting an all-time low of 17%. The Conservatives included a commitment to shale production in their June election manifesto, but only if “we maintain public confidence in the process”.  Yet both sides tacitly assume that fracking would work if exploration drilling went ahead. They pay little attention to whether the country’s geology is suitable for shale oil and gas production. The implication is that because fracking works in the US, it must also work here. In fact, the UK’s geological history suggests this is probably wrong.  For a “sweet spot” suitable for commercial fracking, a number of geological criteria need to be met. The source rock needs a relatively high organic content, a good thickness, sufficient porosity and the right mineralogy. The organic matter must have been buried and heated in such a way as to produce large amounts of gas. There must also be a relatively simple geological structure.  The most successful US shale areas, such as the Marcellus, Barnett, Haynesville and Bakken, all lie at depths and temperatures that mean they are ready to expel their oil and gas when fracked. The basins in which these occur are primarily in relatively stable, undeformed areas away from the edges of active tectonic plates, which geologists refer to as “intracratonic” basins. They are characterised by continuous layers of rock with only gentle dips and few fractures or major faults. This all aids subsurface imaging, gas/oil detection and the directional drilling needed for shale exploration.  A cursory look at the geological map of the UK shows a very different proposition. The whole land mass has been significantly uplifted by a chain of geological events that started some 55m years ago with the upward rise of a plume of magma under Iceland. This helped break the tectonic plate in two, pushing Greenland and North America in one direction and the eastern segment containing the British Isles in the other, forming the Atlantic Ocean in between.  The crust moving east buckled against the stable tectonic interior of continental Europe, not only uplifting the British Isles but also tilting it so that north-west Scotland was elevated the most. For this reason, the oldest rocks in the UK are in places such as Lewis and Harris while the youngest ones occur in south-east England.  This movement profoundly affected many of the basins of sedimentary rock that make up the British Isles – including those considered to contain large shale resources. Areas once buried sufficiently deeply to experience temperatures where oil and gas are generated were lifted to levels where this could no longer occur – unlike in the US where the relevant rock formations remain at their greatest depth of burial today.  The UK rock formations have also been highly deformed by the buckling to create folds and faults that cause the shales to be offset and broken up into compartments. At the same time, the activity created pathways that have allowed some of the oil and gas to escape. One example is the Weald Basin of southern England. What originated as a major area for sedimentary deposits in the Cretaceous period between 65m and 145m years ago was subsequently deformed into a major anticlinal arch, such that the original basin now sits in its uplifted core. The margins of this tectonic fold are particularly well defined since they are marked by the steeply dipping chalk ridges that form the North Downs and South Downs in south-east England. As for other UK basins said to hold large quantities of shale gas, like those containing the Carboniferous Bowland Shale in Lancashire and West Lothian Oil Shale in Scotland, they went through an additional previous episode of deformation about 290m years ago. This has compounded their structural complexity.  In short, even where a shale source in the UK may have high organic content and thick and favourable mineralogy, the complex structure of the basins will be detrimental to ultimate recovery. Yet the only question that has been addressed to date is how large the shale resource could be in the UK. The inherent geological complexity of the sedimentary basins has not been fully appreciated or articulated. As a result, the opportunity has been overhyped and reserve estimates remain unknown.  At the very least, there is a need to factor this considerable and fundamental geological uncertainty into the economic equation. It would be extremely unwise to rely on shale gas to ride to the rescue of the UK’s gas needs only to discover it is 55m years too late."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf there is anything that I can say about the German power grid, it is that power outages have been very rare since I’ve been here. But lately the ones that do occur seem to be doing so far more frequently, and there’s been a lot of talk about grid operators having to constantly intervene to prevent blackouts – something they rarely had to do 10 years ago.
Today T-Online news site here reports that areas near Cologne, Germany blacked out over the Easter weekend. Amusement park Phantasialand lost power three times – in 24 hours!
Hat-tip: DirkH
T-Online writes of “power chaos” as electricity went out for 45 minutes on Sunday and blacked out twice yesterday.
The cause of the outages is being attributed to “technical faults” and a “power supply error”. Parts of the Cologne area, for example the city of Bruhl where the power utility is located, also lost power.
There’s no indication that the erratic green energies such as wind and sun are behind the Easter weekend blackout. My guess is that in this case they are not because the weather conditions were quite stable and saw no spikes of any kind. Yet German blackouts seem to be occurring more frequently as the capacity of sun and wind increases.
Blackouts beoming more common
In 2005 a late November snowstorm across northern Germany caused power transmission towers to collapse under the weight of snow and ice, knocking out power for hours and even days in some regions.
In November 2006 a large part of Western Europe was blacked out as power giant E.on miscalculated on how to handle 10,000 megawatts of wind energy flowing through the power grid. The English Wikipedia page fails to mention anything about the wind energy.

In November 2012 the power in parts of Munich went out due to “a defective line”.  Also read more here. Later a city utility spokesman said, “It is suspected to be a power spike that somehow got through.”
Last year again in Munich during the busy Friday morning rush hour the power for 20,000 households went out because of a blown transformer station.
Germany’s power supply has become far more erratic and uncontrollable lately. The power chart for the last two weeks shows the tremendous power spikes that Germany’s power grid had to endure during recent stormy weather.

Source: Agora
The above chart shows a major and sudden power spike occurring on March 29 and a super spike that went off the chart on March 31 when a massive 76 gigawatts of wind power got uncontrollably fed in at 1 p.m. How the grid operators went about handling this may be the topic of a later post.
One thing is clear: the situation on Germany’s power grid has gotten far more unstable. German center-left/green weekly Die Zeit here conducted an interview with power expert Frank Umbach. When asked the question of how reliable the German power grid is, Umbach told Die Zeit:
The situation has gotten considerably worse. […] All risk assessments on supply stability show a worsening.”
Moreover Umbach tells Die Zeit that Germany narrowly missed “widespread outages” three times since the country shut down 8 nuclear power plants in 2011 and increased dependency on wind and solar power.

"When it comes to deciding which plants and animals to protect and which to remove, our approach might make even the most forthright nationalist blush if it were ever applied to people. The central question in the UK and many other countries is whether a particular species is native or non-native.  Rarer natives are more likely to have government money spent on their protection. The UK has a long list of them, including the likes of the spiny cockle, the moustached warbler and the sturgeon. Non-natives, on the other hand, may be rightly targeted for extermination if they threaten significant damage and are spreading fast – Japanese knotweed and rhododendrons being well known “invasive” examples.  On the face of it, native is good and non-native is bad. Not only do we make this distinction at UK level, we do it for species in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It may seem simple, but the very definition is less clear cut than it first appears.  Take the beech tree. This tree has long been considered non-native to Scotland and, in some cases, has been treated as an invader. It has been the subject of many back and forth arguments about whether it should be encouraged or removed.  Beeches colonised the south of England after the last Ice Age. They began spreading north but failed initially to establish themselves. This was due to competition with other trees and the subsequent rampant deforestation of the UK by our ancestors.  Nowadays, beeches are found throughout the UK, but considered non-native to Scotland for two reasons. The first relates to the arbitrary cut-off point that decides these things in the UK: about 7,000 years ago, the time of the post-Ice Age expansion of human agriculture. (Other countries take a different view of time for native/non-native purposes – the US dates it to 1492, the time of European settlement, for example.)  The second indicator is that beeches are considered to have been introduced to Scotland by people rather than spreading of their own accord. In reality, it has been easier to say this than to prove it. The most recent update to species maps for the UK mapped beeches as native “regardless of status” because it was so hard to figure out which had been introduced by people and which had made it themselves.  I recently co-published a paper which removed this uncertainty. By combining DNA evidence with historic information, we were able to identify the origin of populations of beech in Scotland and in northern England.  It is well known that beech grows and reproduces without problems in the Scottish lowlands. So while humans might have speeded its spread, beeches would have taken root in Scotland anyway. This led us to the conclusion that there is no justifiable reason to maintain its status as non-native, and we should just embrace it as another natural occupant of the Scottish landscape.  This beech controversy is strongly linked to our tendency to be resistant to change in the natural world. We think in terms of communities of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria that live together in the same place at the same time, and tend to view these as fixed and unchanging – something we can describe, quantify and map.  In truth, such communities change constantly as species move in accordance with changes in their environment – little different to how humans shift in response to things like war or economic hardship. With plants and animals, we pick a point in time 7,000 years ago and say the community that existed at that time is native and the species stops here.  The tree bumblebee is another interesting example. It is believed to have arrived from the continent under its own steam in about 2001 and spread rapidly up the country.  Like beech, its spread was made easier by humans – in this case by providing bird boxes and roof spaces that these bees are adept at colonising.  The tree bumblebee is a clear-cut non-native according to our established definitions. Yet its colonisation of the UK is believed to have been a natural event that would have occurred (more slowly) without human intervention.  It’s also part of a much bigger trend. A wide variety of species including birds, butterflies and other insects are on the move as our climate warms. Since 1995, some 11 species of dragonflies have returned to or newly arrived in the UK – one in five of all dragonfly species in the country.  We are likely to see many more of these developments as the climate keeps warming, sometimes with serious negative effects. It all challenges one of the fundamental principles of conservation, that of keeping things the same. How, then, do we overcome our resistance to change without abandoning efforts to stop the spread of invasive species altogether?  Certainly where an area is of particular biological, historical or cultural significance, we might continue to spend money trying to keep it that way. But more broadly, it makes sense to think in terms of harm and benefits.  With beech, we might say that while its expansion across Scotland is undoubtedly a threat to some woodlands, it represents a great opportunity when species like ash and oak are at significant risk from new pests and diseases. As for the tree bumblebee, rather than damaging ecosystems, it performs vital pollination services while other pollinators suffer unprecedented declines.  We should continue to use our limited conservation funds to fight invasive species that cause the most damage, while striving to stop human introductions of new species to ever more areas of the globe. But trying to turn back the clock to an arbitrary time in the past is a fool’s errand. Change is the new norm and will be for the foreseeable future. Perhaps the arguments around native and non-native need to stop forever looking back, and start looking forward, too."
"The strain of remaining on message for a whole hour in his head-to-head debate with Jeremy Corbyn seems to have been too much for Boris Johnson. It really wasn’t part of the plan for the prime minister to reveal ahead of time a rabbit due to be pulled out of the hat at the Conservative party manifesto launch – an increase to £12,000 in the threshold at which national insurance contributions have to paid. Although premature, the announcement dovetails with other Tory proposals – higher public spending, an increase in the national minimum wage to £10.50 and the decision not to go ahead with cuts in corporation tax. All are intended to win support among voters in the marginals in the Midlands and the north of England and to defuse the argument that Johnson is only interested in delivering for the rich. At the 2017 general election, the Tories had no offer to counter Corbyn’s anti-austerity programme; this time they do.  The prime minister’s pledge was a bit vague. Did it apply just to employee NICs or to the NICs paid by employers as well? How long would it take to raise the threshold from £8,632 to £12,000? And why £12,000, when it would make more sense to align the NICs threshold with the income tax personal allowance at £12,500? The answer to the last question was simple. Johnson meant to say £12,500 but got the figure wrong. Number crunchers at the Institute for Fiscal Studies have estimated that a NICs threshold at that level would cost £11bn a year if it applied to employees and the self-employed, and £17bn a year if employers were included as well. Quite legitimately, people are going to ask how this promise is going to be met because it is hard to square with the new, watered-down rules for the public finances that the chancellor, Sajid Javid, has come up with. These are that the government can borrow up to 3% of national output for public investment and that day-to-day spending will be matched by tax revenues by the middle of the next parliament. Javid inherited a bit of scope to cut taxes or increase spending from Philip Hammond but the increases in public spending announced in September and changes to the way the public finances are calculated mean that leeway has already been used up. And that’s before slower growth this year is factored into the equation. Hence it wasn’t that long before Tory spin doctors were obliged to come clean about one of the other questions: it would take time to hit the £12,500 threshold. To avoid breaking the fiscal rules or being forced to raise other taxes, the limit will be raised initially to £9,500, with a £2bn price tag. Voters should remember to read the small print. China is a totalitarian one-party state. Protests, as events this year in Hong Kong have shown, are discouraged. But if ever there was a country that needed its own version of Extinction Rebellion it is the world’s second biggest economy. Why? Because China’s appetite for coal-fired power stations is both staggering and scary. It is staggering because demand for the fossil fuel massively outweighs attempts elsewhere in the world to cut back on the use of coal. Thirty countries have agreed to phase out coal-fired power stations and between them in the 18 months to June they reduced capacity by 8GW. Yet over the same period China increased its capacity by 42.9GW. That’s scary because climate scientists say time is running out to tackle global heating. There will be no point in the rest of the world agreeing to the urgent and unprecedented changes demanded by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change if a country as big and as resistant to external pressure as China’s growth model means it is pushing in the opposite direction. Globalisation has allowed western countries to outsource not just manufacturing jobs but their carbon emissions to China. At some cost."
"The Brazilian government has earmarked a vast tract of Amazonian land for mining. The so-called “Renca” reserve sits in the last great wilderness area in the eastern Amazon and contains lots of unique rainforest wildlife. The controversial decision to allow mining has since been rewritten to clarify that development cannot take place on indigenous lands that lie within the “Renca”, and then put on hold by a federal judge, pending support from congress. Protected areas such as the Renca are under threat right across the Amazon, and many have already been downsized or downgraded. Conservation is undermined by chronic underfunding of the national environmental protection agencies, the devolving of environmental enforcement to regional states that cannot cope, and by rural violence so severe that Brazil leads the world in assassinations of environmentalists.  The result of all this is an Amazon where 90% of logging is illegal and deforestation is increasing, where unprecedented wildfires burn each summer, and where large vertebrates are now going extinct for the first time since the Pleistocene. Brazil says mining and logging will boost national economic growth. Yet people in the Amazon remain some of the poorest and most marginalised in South America, and there is little evidence this kind of development has enhanced their quality of life. For example, the municipalities of Eldorado dos Carajás, Marabá, and Paraupebas, all of which surround large mining operations, have a human development index lower than that of Libya, a country stricken by civil war. And the construction of the controversial Belo Monte dam resulted in the regional capital of Altamira attaining the highest per capita homicide rate in all of Brazil, equivalent to 25 murders a day if scaled to a city the size of London. First, the companies driving the change are generally big multinationals based either in and around Rio and São Paulo (1,700 miles away) or abroad. Despite some municipal taxes, only a tiny portion of the profits remain locally. Development, as currently practised, also favours the wealthy over the poor. When protected areas are downgraded the chief beneficiaries are landholders who are able to log or mine their territory. Other social groups aren’t so lucky. Some are even actively attacked – either directly, as occurred in the assassination of ten landless movement squatters in a large Amazonian farm, or through legal changes, such as the downgrading of the rights of quilombolas, historical communities descended from African slaves, and indigenous peoples. Brazil’s ongoing “car wash” corruption scandal has led to allegations of worrying links between large development projects in the Amazon, such as the Belo Monte dam, and the diversion of state funds to political parties. If the purpose of development is political gain, there can be little hope for regional citizens.  Both Amazonian people and forests would benefit if we stopped evaluating development schemes solely in terms of the profits they could generate. This sort of narrow, economic assessment cannot truly capture the value of the Amazon’s forests: how do you put a price on conserving unique species, or mitigating global climate change?  The forests of the Renca are some of the most dense and slow-growing in the Amazon basin. Even deforesting just 30% of the area would effectively emit more than four billion tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere – equivalent to Brazil’s entire fossil fuel emissions over the past ten years. Unless climate change forms part of the decision making process in the region, Brazil will fail to meet its international commitments such as the Paris agreement. Development must also secure constitutional rights for everyone, not just those of the elites. Brazil currently has so called “differentiated citizenship”, where in practice there is a gradation of rights among citizens, depending on their race, social class or region. Local action is often the only defence against the expansion of mining or dams. Recent examples of a grassroots success include the Munduruku indigenous people, who are forcing various concessions by resisting megadams on the middle Tapajós River. Another example is the  practice of “counter-mapping” among indigenous peoples which entails them mapping their own territorial boundaries to defend their land from industrial agriculture, mining, dams and logging.
 
These alternative approaches are the best way forward in the Renca too. Instead of opening up the area for mining multinationals, Brazil should recognise the rights of local people and empower them to lead decision-making. Brazil nut harvesting is already big in the local economy and, along with ecotourism and carbon-payments (being effectively paid to not chop down a forest), could deliver sustainable development, while leaving the minerals in the ground."

A comparison of both the capital cost and energy production effectiveness of renewable energy in Europe.
By Ed Hoskins
(Some editing by P Gosselin)
The diagrams below show the cost and capacity factors of the major European renewable energy power sources: onshore and offshore wind farms and large scale photovoltaic solar generation. They are compared to the cost and output capacity of conventional gas fired electricity generation.
First two term definitions:
– Capacity factor:  installed nameplate capacity compared to the actual electrical energy output achieved.
– Capital cost:  comparison with the cost of equivalent electrical output produced by gas fired electrical generation.

Overall European renewable energy has almost 6 times lower capacity than conventional gas-fired power generation and it costs about 16 times more in capital expenditure alone.
In all the capital costs expended by 2013 in Europe amounted to some €1/2 trillion for approximately 170 gigawatts of “nominal” installed renewable energy generation. But because of the reduced capacity factor, those installations provide only approximately 30 gigawatts of real output electrical power.  That output amounts to only about 2.9% of the total European generating capacity of 1024 gigawatts [1].
The following is a table summing up performance of the various wind and solar sources. The

In addition, electrical output of renewable energies wind and solar power is intermittent and non-dispatchable. Their output cannot respond to electricity demand as and when needed. Energy is fed into the the grid in a haphazard, almost entirely random manner – depending on the weather, time of day and season.
In short, it is inefficient, exorbitantly expensive and often unavailable when it is needed, or severely excessive when it isn’t needed. It offers everything that makes a modern economy uncompetitive.
Renewable energy technologies
When it comes to wind and solar power, onshore wind power is the most effective form of renewable energy in terms of capital cost. It only costs approximately 9 times as much as conventional power generation. On average across Europe, the capacity utilization is about 23%.

Offshore wind too expensive
Offshore wind power is about 17 times more expensive to install, but its increased capacity factors mean that it should be significantly more productive than onshore installations. Nonetheless, in addition to the significant additional capital costs, offshore wind power appears to have major problems with costlier long term maintenance and questionable reliability [4].
The sun sends huge bills
Large scale photovoltaic solar power is proven to be the least economic renewable energy source, costing about 34 times more than gas fired power in terms of capital costs. However, solar power usually has reasonable maintenance costs. On average in Europe, solar PV yields roughly 11% of its nameplate capacity.
In addition to the impacts of cloudy weather, photovoltaic units are susceptible to performance degradation from ice or snow, or obscuration with accumulating dust in drier climates. Solar power might operate reasonably well at mid latitudes, but it is inevitably a poor investment in Northern Europe where yields are low because of latitude, adverse weather, the seasons and the daily rotation of the Earth.
Though the cost of the technical photovoltaic elements of the systems are reducing, these high-tech elements are becoming an ever smaller part of the final installation. The costs of the support infrastructure and linkages to the grid are irreducible. It is also clear that the service life of solar cells is limited, and degrades over time. System degradation of the DC to AC inverters is particularly significant:  they are an expensive element in any solar system with a limited operational lifetime.
Wind and solar make little sense
In summary the following analogy describes the nationally mandated use of renewable energy:
By law a family has to purchase two cars: one works well all the time, is cheap to buy, cheap to maintain and does not cost too much to run. But the other is very expensive to buy and only works about 1/6th of the time. However the fuel costs are very low. But by law the family is forced to use the expensive car if it is working even though it may well let them down at any time. At the same time the cheap car must be kept idling, using fuel but doesn’t go anywhere.

"A coral scientist whose work is attacked in a mini-documentary from the Institute of Public Affairs says the rightwing thinktank has misrepresented her study. The IPA says its YouTube film, Beige Reef, is a “must watch” because it shows healthy Acropora corals living at Stone Island, near Bowen. This, the film claims, is in a place where a study published in 2016 claimed all those corals had died. But Dr Tara Clark, of the University of Wollongong, says the film’s central claim is wrong because her 2016 study did not make any such statement and the IPA’s film had focused on a different location. Clark told Guardian Australia: “Our work has clearly been misrepresented.” The IPA, which has been heavily funded by the mining magnate Gina Rinehart, is known for promoting fringe views on human-caused climate change. In the film, the IPA’s Dr Jennifer Marohasy claims the study, appearing in the journal Scientific Reports, reported that “there are no longer any Acropora at Stone Island” before showing footage taken from her filming expedition. “This claim is of course irreconcilable with what we saw,” she says in the film, which has been promoted by the Sky News commentator Andrew Bolt and the Liberal MP Craig Kelly. Clark’s paper does reference a visit to the site in 1994 by Dr David Wachenfeld, now the chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and a co-author on the study, and states that “no living Acropora colonies” were present at Stone Island at that time. This is the section of text highlighted by the IPA in the film. But Clark said the surveys of Stone Island for her 2016 study were conducted in 2012 and the information presented in the video had been misinterpreted. “For example, we never claimed that there were no Acropora corals present in 2012,” she said. The paper states that in 2012, in a deeper area from the reef flat, “living tabular Acropora [species] and Porites [species] colonies were occasionally found”. Clark said: “Marohasy’s interpretation of [my 2016 paper] is incorrect.” Clark said the two main aims of the study were to revisit the precise locations of historic photographs taken around 1890 – sites revisited by Wachenfeld in 1994 – and to test a method to date the death of corals. Clark also said her study was conducted “in a different location and environment” to Marohasy’s film, “making it a little like comparing apples and oranges”. Marohasy’s filming had taken place over subtidal reefs rather than over the reef flats that were the focus of her study, Clark said. The 13-minute IPA video features drone and underwater footage from a chartered boat trip to Stone Island, with extensive commentary from Marohasy. In a separate video promoting Beige Reef, the IPA’s policy director, Gideon Rozner, says what Marohasy found “refutes a key claim” in Clark’s paper “that there are no living colonies of Acropora coral at all”.’ Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Rozner says: “The suggestion that the Great Barrier reef is dying is based on claims like this from the Nature paper. If this is wrong then what else are they wrong about?” (Rozner and Marohasy say the study appeared in the “prestigious journal Nature” but in fact the study appeared in Scientific Reports.) Associate Professor Andrew Hoey, of James Cook University’s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said: “Concluding the reef is fine from a single visit to one section of one reef is ludicrous, and is akin to visiting a house that is left standing after a natural disaster (earthquake, tsunami, bushfire) and concluding there has been no damage. “Importantly the video [the IPA] show is of areas of subtidal reef, yet the study by Clark and others describes changes on the intertidal reef flat,” he said. Hoey added that a separate claim in the video that no bleached corals had been found was misleading, because “you wouldn’t expect to see any unless that area was experiencing an extended period of elevated temperatures at that time”. He said: “The majority of corals that bleached on the GBR in 2016 and 2017 died shortly after and were subsequently covered by algae within a few weeks.” The Liberal MP Craig Kelly shared the IPA video on his Facebook page, with the heading “YET ANOTHER CLIMATE ALARMIST LIE DEBUNKED.” Kelly wrote: “Everytime their lips are moving, those from the climate alarmist industry are peddling lies trying to recruit the naive and gullible to act as their useful idiots.” At the end of the video, a credit says the film was “produced with financial support from the B.Macfie Family Foundation”. In a response to questions from Guardian Australia, Marohasy pointed to sections of Clark’s study that she said backed her claim. She said that Clark and colleagues “took just two transects each of 20 metres at Stone Island” and stated in the study that “only nine dead corals were found along transects 1 and 2, and that these corals were covered in mud and algae.” She claimed Clark and colleagues had drawn “erroneous conclusions” from those transects. Responding, Clark said the reason they described the numbers of dead corals they found was because they were specifically seeking dead samples to test a dating method. Marohasy admitted the location of her filming was “just around the headland from the location of the two transects” but said she was planning further films that would show more live corals. Arguments over what conclusions could be drawn from the 1890 and 1994 Stone Island photographs were the catalyst for the censuring and then sacking of the James Cook University academic Dr Peter Ridd, who had complained about their use. With the IPA’s backing, Ridd successfully sued his old university, which is appealing the case."
"North Sea oil executives believe the ageing fossil fuel basin may still lead a global climate revolution by providing a testbed for clean energy breakthroughs. An industry report has revealed that the North Sea could emerge as an unlikely climate hero by becoming a global showcase for the energy transition after decades producing fossil fuels. The basin has produced almost 40bn barrels of oil over the last 40 years, but as oilfields decline the empty caverns could be used to store carbon emissions, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The advisory firm added that North Sea gas producers may eventually be able to produce zero-carbon hydrogen by using electricity generated by offshore wind turbines to split the carbon molecules from natural gas. The North Sea is already equipped with major offshore infrastructure, such as pipelines and platforms, which could be used to help transport and store the carbon emissions captured by UK factories and hydrogen producers. Drew Stevenson, PwC’s UK energy sector leader, said there is “huge potential” for the North Sea to help meet the “necessary urgency to move to a low-carbon world” by focusing on low-carbon innovations and new technology. PwC based its report on interviews with 20 key energy industry executives to pinpoint how the North Sea could adapt to a net zero-carbon future. “The appetite exists for the North Sea energy industry to play a significant role in the transition: investor sentiment is rapidly becoming more committed to low carbon technologies while smaller exploration and production companies are looking at ways to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. All of this creates an opportunity for the North Sea to lead the way in the energy transition,” Stevenson said. The report comes after the government’s climate watchdog warned over the summer that the North Sea would need to embrace technology, such as carbon capture, to earn a role in the UK’s low-carbon future. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, told the Guardian following its climate progress report in July that the North Sea industry must make sure that it is part of the UK’s net-zero carbon story. “It would, of course, be an easier task to simply say that we shouldn’t bring oil and gas out of the ground but we know that there will potentially be some uses for those hydrocarbons, in particular for the production of things like hydrogen,” he said. “The key test for whether that can ever be a part of the future scenario is whether the sector itself is supportive of carbon capture and storage and whether the resources in the North Sea are used in an effective net-zero way. If there was ever a point for the industry to feel challenged, it’s now,” he added."
"The world’s nations are on track to produce more than twice as much coal, oil and gas as can be burned in 2030 while restricting rise in the global temperature to 1.5C, analysis shows. The report is the first to compare countries’ stated plans for fossil fuel extraction with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which is to keep global heating well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5C. It exposes a huge gap, with fossil fuel production in 2030 heading for 50% more than is consistent with 2C, and 120% more than that for 1.5C. Scientists have warned that even the difference between 1.5C and 2C of heating will expose hundreds of millions of people to significantly higher risks of extreme heatwaves, drought, floods and poverty. The report was produced by the UN Environment Programme and a coalition of research organisations. It complements an earlier UN analysis showing the current Paris agreement pledges to cut emissions would still lead to a catastrophic 3-4C rise. “We’re in a deep hole – and we need to stop digging,” said Måns Nilsson, executive director of the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), which was part of the analysis. “Despite more than two decades of climate policymaking, fossil fuel production levels are higher than ever.” Most action to tackle the climate crisis involves reducing emissions, but Inger Andersen, head of the UN Environment Programme, said a focus on fossil fuel production was long overdue. Most of the action pledges made by countries under the Paris deal do not even mention changes to production. The UK is a “striking” example of this mismatch, said Cleo Verkuijl, at the SEI’s centre in Oxford, UK. It was the first major economy to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, she said, but also subsidises fossil fuel production at home and abroad and intends to extract “every drop of oil and gas” from its North Sea fields. In recent years, the UK oil and gas industry has received £176m more annually in government support than it paid in taxes, the report said. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  The UK Oil and Gas Authority said in a statement: “Oil and gas will remain an important part of our energy mix for the foreseeable future, including under net zero scenarios. Maximising the economic recovery from the UK remains vital to meet those energy demands as long as they exist, and to reduce reliance on imports.” The report’s warning was strongly backed by senior figures. “Ensuring a liveable planet for future generations means getting serious about phasing out coal, oil and gas,” said Christiana Figueres, at Mission 2020 and is the person who delivered the Paris agreement in 2015 as the UN’s top climate official. “Countries such as Costa Rica, Spain and New Zealand are already showing the way forward, with policies to constrain exploration and extraction – others must now follow their lead. There is no time to waste.” Prof Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics, said: “This important report shows planned levels of coal, oil and gas production are dangerously out of step with the goals of the Paris agreement.” The report highlights the nations that are taking some action, including the closure of most coal mines in Spain and some in China, along with the end of new offshore oil and gas exploration licences in New Zealand and some parts of the Arctic governed by Canada, the US and Norway. Verkuijl said a global agreement to phase out production would be ideal but is difficult at present with the US under President Donald Trump, as the country is due to withdraw from the Paris agreement. But she said many Democratic presidential candidates have promised to cut fossil fuel production by restricting extraction on public land, for example, or removing subsidies. She said such a candidate beating Trump in the 2020 election would be a “gamechanger”. The report said it was crucial that workers in fossil fuel industries were helped into new employment as production ramped down. “Leaders need to [talk with] workers and their unions to plan a just transition away from fossil fuels,” said Sharan Burrow, head of the International Trade Union Confederation. The analysis is based on the published national plans of eight key producers: Australia, Canada, Russia, US, China, India, Indonesia and Norway, which account for 60% of global fossil fuel production. The plans of other big producers, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, are not publicly available. The researchers assumed these and other producers would maintain a similar share of global production to today at around 40%. • This article was amended on 20 November 2019 to clarify the description of the methodology. The researchers did not assume that producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran would follow “similar paths” as the eight countries that were covered, but that those producers would maintain a similar share of global production as the eight countries that were covered."
"Labour’s 2019 general election manifesto, launched on Thursday by Jeremy Corbyn, is its most radical in more than 35 years. It will strike a chord with millions who want categorical change in Britain. The chord will be loudest with those who have seen life chances stall and fracture, and communities weaken, during the fiscally strangulated years that have followed the financial crash. It will ring out, too, for those who want inequality reversed, taxes increased to renew public services and the climate crisis placed at the centre of public policy. The manifesto raises the bar. Its ambitions match the seriousness of the times. The green agenda is the single most important pledge, an overarching imperative. But it is not the only issue the manifesto confronts in bold terms. The neglect of towns and regions, the need for modernised transport and infrastructure, the importance of reskilling, and of rights against employment injustice, the case for affordable housing, the demands for child and elderly care, a better deal in education and health spending all cry out too.  The manifesto is not historically as startling as it will be caricatured as being. The Britain that Mr Corbyn and his supporters are imagining is a leftwing form of social democracy for which, with relatively few changes of policy, it might have stood at various times between 1945 and 1983. Mr Corbyn is explicit that he wants to roll back the deregulatory revolution of the 1980s and restore tax and spend, national provision of social goods, and the state-managed sector – issues that were bedrocks of the postwar economic settlement – to the heart of public policy from which Margaret Thatcher expelled them. He wants to see the forward march of labour, which was halted in those years, resumed. But we are on the threshold of the 2020s, not the 1970s. The single most consequential thing that will be decided on 12 December is the enormity of Brexit, which will shape everything else that any new government, Labour or not, attempts in the new decade. Mr Corbyn’s Brexit offer is ambiguous. He will not say if he wants Britain to remain in Europe or not – and Labour is badly harmed by his evasion. Mr Corbyn is ambiguous too in his trade union agenda. Yes, employees absolutely need a stronger voice in their workplaces and over their terms and conditions. But what exactly does Labour mean by the repeal of “anti-trade union legislation” and scrapping “unnecessary restrictions on industrial action”? Over-mighty unions were part of the dark side of the 1970s. Enthusiasm for Labour’s general ambitions should not mean a free pass on such issues. Labour’s approach speaks to and connects with the deep injustices and unfairnesses of modern Britain. But a manifesto must be more than a utopian wishlist. Planting lots of trees is magnificent. But money does not grow on them. Even in tough times like these, and even in the face of Boris Johnson, a Labour manifesto is only as inspiring as its implementation is credible and as its party leader inspires confidence. Neither of these is a given. Pledges like scrapping universal credit, keeping the state pension age at 66 and abolishing tuition fees will be popular, but they carry big price tags, not all of which will be paid by the super-rich or business. “These are vast numbers, enormous, colossal,” said the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It added that Labour’s claim that only higher earners would pay higher taxes was “not credible”. Mr Corbyn has three weeks to win this argument. Just as questions of affordability cannot be wished away, so Mr Corbyn’s net dissatisfaction rating of minus 60 among voters cannot be ignored either. The Labour leader’s response on Thursday was to defy such scepticism. He would accept the hostility of the rich and the powerful, he said, echoing Franklin Roosevelt. Current polling suggests that many who are neither rich nor powerful have doubts too. Labour’s manifesto may in the end be more effective in consolidating the left’s control of the party than in transforming the most important election in decades. Mr Corbyn’s manifesto will raise many spirits, as its predecessor did in 2017. The question now is whether its strikingly ambitious radicalism can change the election outcome."
"Human society rewards individuals who can handle complex social interactions and control large groups of people. Extreme examples of this power are comedians who can fill stadiums entertaining 70,000 people, or politicians who, through their rhetoric and charm, convince millions of us to vote for them so they can run our lives. Intelligence, humour, and charisma are used to co-opt a greater share of resources for themselves and their family. In fact, many scientists now think this is exactly why we evolved a very large brain. Originally, large brains were thought to be essential for the making of stone tools, and this is why Homo habilis (skillful man) was thought to be the start of our Homo genus some 2.5m years ago. But we now know that many other animals make and use tools. We also know hominins living 3.3m years ago were already using stone tools half a million years before Homo evolved.  So why did we evolve a large brain if it wasn’t essential for tool making? One reason is that existing in a large social group is very mentally taxing. Those who are better at playing the social game will have more access to mates and resources and will be more likely to reproduce. As the groups get larger, so the computational power needed to keep up with the interconnections grows exponentially, as does the stress. Modern humans like to live and interact in communities of about 150 people. This magic number is found in the population of stone age settlements, villages in the Domesday Book (a census of England in 1085 AD), 18th-century English villages, modern hunter-gatherer societies, Christmas card distribution lists, and even modern Twitter communities – just to name a few examples. Groups of 150 are about what we would expect, when comparing the size of human brains to those of our relatives. Community size in primates is linked to the size of the neocortex region of the brain, where all social cognitive processing occurs. Other primates, with smaller brains, live in smaller groups. Species, such as the baboon-like mandrill of Central Africa, that do gather in larger numbers only contain females and children in their “horde” so these are not true mixed sex social groups. If one extrapolates the relation between brain and group size in other primates then humans with their very large neocortex extend the graph to a community size of 150.  This relationship is extremely useful as it means we have a way of estimating group size in our extinct ancestors. Those a few million years ago, lived in groups of 50 or so. The big change occurs with Homo erectus at about 2m years ago when groups jumped up to nearly 100; then Homo heidelbergensis at 130 and, of course, modern Homo sapiens at 150. Human ancestors with larger brains would have been better at hunting and gathering food, better at sharing the spoils, and better at fighting off predators.  Yet there are also significant survival risks associated with a larger brain such as an increased need for food. Mother mortality rates also increase due to what is known as the “obstetric dilemma”, which refers to the danger of giving birth to a baby with such a large head. While chimpanzees give birth relatively easily as their heads are significantly smaller than the birth canal, human heads are much larger, and so the baby has to twist twice to get through the hips.  For the selection pressure to continue – for brains to keep getting larger – there must have been huge rewards for being smart and having a bigger head. One of those rewards was better social skills. The increased complication of childbirth would require mothers to have help from others, and individual females who were more socially adept would get more help, therefore they and their infants were more likely to survive. This positive feedback loop drove the evolution of larger brains as a means of having greater social influence.  Underlying this social brain hypothesis is an internal arms race to develop the higher cognitive skills to enable greater social control. Clearly, with the emergence of Homo erectus, H. heidelbergensis, and eventually H. sapiens, the positives outweighed the negatives. In my latest book, Cradle of Humanity, I discuss how this was driven by rapid environmental changes in East Africa, increased competition for resources within the species as the population expanded, and competition with other species. We humans emerged from Africa with an extremely large, flexible and complex “social brain”. This has allowed us to live relatively peaceful lives around millions of others. This does not, however, mean that we live in harmony with each other, instead we have swapped physical conflict for social competition. We are constantly strengthening our alliances with friends and partners while working out how to keep up and if possible surpass our peers in terms of social position. And that is why it is so stressful simply being human."
"Coldplay have pledged to make any tour in support of their new album “actively beneficial” to the environment. Frontman Chris Martin told BBC News that the British group was waiting to tour their new album, Everyday Life, so they can ensure such a tour is carbon neutral. “Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,” said Martin. “We would be disappointed if it’s not carbon neutral. We’ve done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it’s not so much taking as giving?” Coldplay are the latest musical act to address the impact of touring on the environment. Billie Eilish has announced plans to make her world tour “as green as possible” by banning plastic straws, encouraging fans to bring refillable water bottles and providing comprehensive recycling facilities. Every venue on the tour, commencing next March, will feature the “Billie Eilish Eco-Village”, where fans can learn about their role in the climate crisis. Those who pledge to fight the climate emergency with the organisation Global Citizen can earn free tickets to the sold-out shows. The 1975 are working towards making their tours carbon-efficient and have pledged to plant a tree for every ticket sold to their UK arena tour in February. The British band have also stopped producing new T-shirts, instead screen-printing a new design over old merchandise stock. Emma Banks, co-founder of leading tour agents Creative Artists Agency, questioned the need for musicians to tour at a scale that might require dozens of trucks to transport equipment. “While I certainly don’t want to be putting anybody out of business, I think we have to start being realistic and going, ‘OK, let’s just dial it down a bit,’” she told the BBC. Music festivals are also facing pressure to go green. This year, Glastonbury banned the sale of single-use plastic bottles across its site, offering 850 water taps and dozens of water kiosks. More than 60 major festivals, including Reading, Leeds and Download, have pledged to go plastic-free by 2021. Coldplay will play two shows in Jordan on 22 November, on the day their album is released, which will be streamed live. On 25 November, they play a one-off concert at the Natural History Museum in London, with all proceeds going to environmental law charity ClientEarth."
"London’s proposed “Garden Bridge” is no more. After years of controversy, the city’s mayor has finally sunk the idea into the Thames. The notion of a bridge covered in plants and trees spanning the river did have some merit. But it needed to be in the right place, with the right design, and the project needed to generate support from local Londoners. Thomas Heatherwick’s proposal appeared to lack awareness of this.  Nonetheless, the Garden Bridge’s failure shouldn’t be an excuse to rein in our ambitions. In order to deliver more innovative urban greening in London and beyond, there remains value in thinking bigger, bolder and greener. To actually deliver visions of such urban oases we should continue to dream. But we must also be realistic. Long before such a project even makes it onto the drawing board, architects, politicians and the public need to agree on certain vital questions. Who will eventually own it? How it will be funded? And who will be able to access it? The Garden Bridge was an example of what not to do. A lack of transparency lead to approximately £37m of taxpayer funding being lost in the project; the level of private funding lost remains unknown. Likewise, the pseudo-public nature of the bridge would have restricted access for groups, cyclists, and buskers, instead providing a corporate space underwritten by ongoing public investment. But this sort of thing can work, and there are many examples where derelict or brownfield land in urban centres has been transformed into multi-functional public spaces. Millennium Park, in the heart of Chicago, was built on a former rail yard and car park. The High Line in New York turned a disused elevated train line into a park, and there are similar projects in Atlanta and Seoul. Each brought disused transport infrastructure back into public use. There’s now a clamour among cities across the world to develop the “next” High Line – the latest proposal being a “Camden Highline” in north London. Such enthusiasm to follow the success of New York illustrates how cities want their brands to be associated with projects that are innovative yet also green and sustainable.  One of the big ideas behind the Garden Bridge was to create such an oasis in one of the world’s busiest and most polluted cities. Where successful interventions have occurred, they have been achieved with community (public and business) backing. The redevelopment of the Historic 4th Ward Park in Atlanta or the Cheonggyecheon River restoration project in Seoul would be very different projects without public support. Likewise, the Olympic Park site in London is largely publicly accessible 24/7, making it a multi-functional and valuable public space. Even in Milan where the Bosco Verticale – a pair of tree-covered skyscrapers – shows the architectural merit of innovation on private property, it is complemented by a new public park, allotments and communal spaces. What each of these projects does is to find a balance between funding, ownership and access, which helps to limit conflicts over use. Future projects should therefore take notice of what these investments got right, and the Garden Bridge got wrong. Developing truly valuable parks and open spaces is a delicate process. It requires a mixture of funding from public and private sources but should not be held hostage to the demands of private investors.  Publicly-funded projects need to meet the needs of the public and should reflect both local community and wider city-level aspirations. This may mean negotiating a prize-winning design for a more intuitive space that is functional for older people, families or children. The Maggie Daley Park in Chicago is an excellent example of this. There is also a need to ensure that ownership is transparent and that everyone knows their rights of use. This should be publicly and not privately focused, as there is a wealth of evidence to highlight the social, health, and economic value of accessible parks and gardens. Finally, the Garden Bridge should be a cautionary note for future investments. There are many projects in London, across the UK and globally that have worked with various partners to design, develop and manage parks and open spaces successfully. They have managed to grasp the needs of local communities, work with complex design and funding issues, and negotiate ownership and access rights. These projects are the ones we should be promoting as best-practice examples of what make a good public park. As they (nearly) say, one bad apple doesn’t spoil the whole bunch."

Worldwide there are 366 million people with diabetes. By 2030, if trends are not curbed, 165 million Americans will be obese and by 2050 100 million will have diabetes. Lustig calls it “a standard pandemic” The related health costs will be astronomical – and unaffordable. No modern civilization can survive that.
Tragically these are the numbers that were necessary to finally get the US government to concede that its longstanding dietary guidelines (once solidly and irrefutably confirmed by the “vast consensus of scientific experts”) had been severely flawed for decades. Read here and here.
Why did it take so damn long for the government to wake up? It gets down to obstinate egomaniacal scientists, greedy food and pharmaceutical industries, and governments corrupted by the same industries. See here.
Because established scientists have a long habit of insisting their pet theories are right and scoff at those who challenge them, renowned German physicist Max Planck once wisely remarked, “Science advances one funeral at a time.” he noticed that false theories don’t die until their founders do. Sadly, as the case of nutritional sciences shows, hundreds of millions of people have gotten or are about to get early funerals. Hence, government science advances 100 million funerals at a time. Such is now the case with the science concerning saturated fats and human health.

The very same tragedy has begun in earnest in climate science today. Just as the saturated fat theory was founded on the junk science and phony 7-Country chart of Ancel Keys, the CO2 global warming theory was founded on the junk science of NASA scientist James Hansen and the dubious hockey stick graph of Michael E. Mann. And just as dissenters were ignored, marginalized and cut off from funding in the nutritional sciences, so are skeptic global warming scientists experiencing the same today. And just as a consensus among all scientists was claimed endorsing the saturated fat theory (fully backed by the National Academy of Sciences and virtually every American medical association), an illusionary 97% consensus is also being claimed in climate science today. And just as the American Dietary Guidelines were promoted and made official by a Democrat Presidential loser candidate (George McGovern), the global warming science and proposed energy dietary guidelines are being promoted today by Democrat Presidential loser candidate Al Gore. The parallels between the two sciences indeed could not be more stunning.
It would be nice if the parallels ended there, but it is unlikely they will. Just as the case has been with the saturated fat theory, the CO2 climate change theory now risks killing hundreds of millions in the future – thanks to energy poverty and starvation. Without energy, people die horrible deaths from exposure.
All of this could be avoided, of course, if only governments were honest in their interpretation of climate data and stopped making up excuses for colder and colder  winters, and 18 years of zero warming. Unfortunately that does not appear likely to happen anytime soon. Tragically it’ll probably take tens of millions of unnecessary premature deaths resulting from energy deprivation to get the governments to realize they have made a horrible mistake. Instead of making a course correction on the climate issue, the US government, led by NASA, is now altering the historical temperature data in a manner that would even make Ancel Keyes blush.
People can argue about the impacts of faulty science on human life. But one thing cannot be argued: Truth leads to life; lies lead to death.
Clearly the US policy will likely have to see another 100 million or so early funerals before it allows climate science to advance.

"Hurricane Irma – one of the strongest on record to hit the Caribbean – recently scoured the islands leaving catastrophic damage in its wake. And just as we began to piece together the devastating and potentially long–term impacts of Irma, Hurricane Maria has now left another path of destruction. Puerto Rico, the British  dependency of the Turks and Caicos, and many other Caribbean islands have suffered what have been described as “apocalyptic conditions”.  When the world talks of the tragic and devastating consequences of severe hurricanes, the focus tends to be on the land, and the people who live in affected communities. Indeed, nearly 30 people have been reported killed, while Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez has said that the hurricane has set the country back by “20 to 30 years”. We see images of toppled trees, torn off roofs and severe flooding. But marine environments can be also badly affected by hurricanes, with potential long-term effects.  The force of hurricane winds, and the resultant tides and waves are so strong that both plants and animals are ripped from the sea floor leaving lifeless rubble and sediment behind. Hurricanes have a washing machine effect: they mix up coastal sediments with knock-on effects for marine life. Suspended matter left floating in the water column limits the amount of sunlight that reaches marine habitats and so reduces growth and recovery. Meanwhile in shallow coastal environments, debris, sewage and run-off continue to flow in to the sea long after the hurricane has passed.  The devastation of coastal environments, particularly seagrass meadows, can also result in long-term losses of the benefits that humans receive from them, such as fisheries support or coastal protection. Damage to these ecosystem services consequently impacts human well-being, because people can no longer rely on them for their livelihood and food supply.    Some of the most severely affected areas of the recent hurricanes in the Caribbean – Florida, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico, Cuba and the British Virgin Islands – all house extensive seagrass meadows. These shallow water marine habitats support valuable lobster fisheries, as well as shrimp, conch, and finfish fisheries. Seagrass also stabilises sediments and protects the white sand beaches that attract so many tourists to the region.  Previous hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons (weather events which are essentially the same but have different names depending on where the storm happens) across the globe have shown the severe negative effects they can have on these vital seagrass meadows. The seagrass plants are ripped up or buried under sediments, leading to their suffocation. The extensive associated murky water leads to widespread loss of seagrass, as was seen in the years that followed hurricane Katrina hitting the US. Initial indications from the Everglades in Florida show that seagrass destruction in the wake of Irma is extensive, with large piles already being washed far onshore. This should ring alarm bells for Caribbean fisheries, as hurricanes Katrina and Rita led to losses in the seafood industry that reached billions of dollars. The Caribbean spiny lobster fishery business alone is worth more than US$450m, and directly employs 50,000 people. Healthy seagrass provides the best fishing grounds with the greatest revenue, and the recent hurricanes have the potential to decimate this.  But this is not just about money. Seagrass loss also threatens marine biodiversity and the health of charismatic species. After a severe cyclone in Australia in 2011, turtles and dugong starved due to the damaged meadows. In addition, seagrass is a marine powerhouse, which stores vast amounts of carbon in meadow sediments. When the seagrass is removed, this carbon is released back into the environment. Hurricanes have always been a part of life in tropical seas. The destruction they cause and their recovery have been observed throughout human history. What is alarming now, however, is the apparent increased frequency and intensity. The already poor state of the Caribbean marine environment restricts the ability of habitats such as seagrass meadows and coral reefs to recover from the effects of severe storms. Poor water quality and over-fishing, for example, promotes the overgrowth of algae, preventing recovery. With repeated hurricanes occurring over time periods that are insufficient for recovery to occur, this will only get worse. The severity of hurricanes Irma and Maria are a wake up call. We need a fundamental shift in how marine environments are protected to enable long-term sustainability for the food and income they provide. Many locations in the Caribbean, for example Puerto Rico, have ineffective marine protection rules and so destructive practices continue unchecked, meaning that when a disaster does occur, the environment is unable to recover. Although local actions against climate change are difficult to achieve, it is possible to manage river catchments to improve water quality, and focus on small scale immediate actions, such as implementation of marine protected areas to limit immediate and direct damage to coastal resources. Coordinated small scale actions will ultimately help enhance the resilience of the Caribbean Sea, and make sure that the environment can better recover from any future extreme events."
"Young activists frustrated and frightened by Democrats’ inaction on the climate crisis occupied the office of the top Democrat in Congress on Monday to mark the beginning of a hunger strike. Roughly a dozen strikers with Extinction Rebellion are taking part in a global climate hunger strike that nearly 300 people have pledged to join.  They say the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is holding back progress, so they are targeting her instead of top Republicans. They are demanding that she meet with them for an hour on camera before they call off their hunger strike. “Every day the evidence piles up at your desk, but you have yet to pass even symbolic legislation recognizing the climate crisis as a national emergency. With all due respect, you have failed,” the group said in a letter to Pelosi. Pelosi’s office contested allegations of inaction but did not say whether Pelosi or her staffers would meet with the protesters. In a press statement, Pelosi cited a bill the House passed to keep the US in the Paris climate agreement, which Donald Trump is exiting. The international pact is voluntary, and experts say it is not strong enough and also not being upheld by many countries. Extinction Rebellion calls for governments to declare a climate and ecological emergency, cut heat-trapping pollution to net-zero by 2025 and create a citizen’s assembly to direct a way forward. Their demands are far more aggressive than most environment organizations. They want radical change to keep world temperatures from climbing 3C or beyond the normal of just a century ago and disrupting human civilization. Thousands of scientists warn of a future that threatens “untold suffering”. On Monday, the strikers were given vitamins and supplements and weighed before beginning their protest. Not all of the hunger strikers were present. Some will participate in the sit-in later this week, when they are able to miss work. Pelosi’s office issued a press statement but did not respond directly to Extinction Rebellion. Seventeen-year-old Sophia Kianni, in a speech she planned for the hunger strike said “it is deeply saddening and shameful that we must resort to a hunger strike just to get our leaders to care about their children’s futures. Our nation’s leaders would rather watch climate activists starve than give us the time of day.” She accused Pelosi of employing “cowardly politics”, and “worrying about alienating big businesses”. Nick Brana, a spokesman for Extinction Rebellion in Washington, accused Pelosi of holding back a resolution to declare a climate emergency and a Green New Deal and “neutering” a special House climate committee that does not have the power to subpoena fossil fuel companies or the ability to write legislation. Twenty-year-old Giovanni Tamacas, whose Washington hunger strike the Guardian reported on in August, said he joined Extinction Rebellion because he felt other climate activism groups were not disruptive enough. He came to the organization after some of its protesters stripped off their clothes to draw attention to the crisis in the British parliament. Young people around the world have been striking from school on Fridays in solidarity with Greta Thunberg. Celebrity activist Jane Fonda, 81, is also protesting at the US Capitol every Friday too and has been arrested multiple times. “The way that this movement is going is we’re going to need more and more extreme actions in order to bring the climate crisis to the forefront of the debate, and you know it’s going to take mass participation in civil disobedience and direct action,” Tamacas said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago the German ZDF national television late evening news presented a profile of the 2014 Starmus Festival in Tenerife, which featured distinguished Nobel prize scientists and astronauts (last September).
Hat-tip Wolfgang Neumann at facebook.com. 
Example of those in attendance were Harold Kroto, Steven Hawkins, and astronauts Charlie Duke, Walter, Alexey Leonov, and Apollo 7 Astronaut Walter Cunningham.

A video of the ZDF newscast is posted here at the network’s website. The part of interest begins at the 16:10 mark where the ZDF begins its the segment on Starmus. The really interesting, and unexpected, part begins at the 18:05 mark where ZDF British Nobel prize chemist Harold Kroto comments on CO2 and climate, which follows (in part translated from the German voice-over):



<!--

Even if there is no global warming, it is still in the interest of humanity to find an alternative to fossil fuels. As a chemist I’m telling you that it is almost criminal to burn them.”
But former astronaut Charles Duke doesn’t buy Kroto’s view:
A single volcano emits more climate gases into the atmosphere than man does. I don’t think we are responsible for the global warming.”

And neither does astronaut Walter Cunningham buy into the global warming theory:
Those who are sounding the alarms have corrected their claims multiple times. It is one of the greatest scientific fiascos of all time.”
It’s quite a surprise that Germany’s leading politically correct national television, ZDF, showed that sound byte, and did so in an untypically neutral way. Too late now – millions of Germans heard what undoubtedly will serve as seeds for doubt.

Readers here who are familiar with German climate politics of course are expecting certain PIK scientists to pick up the phone and to vigorously scold the ZDF for their “irresponsible” journalism, for giving a few seconds time to highly qualified skeptics.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAwhile back I announced I was disassociating myself from the Catholic Church because of their growing acceptance of the wacky man-made global warming theory. How can it be that the Church, symbol of truth and morality, would accept a science that is built on outright lies, flakey theories, deception and fortunetelling? That’s no Church for me.
Some readers thought that I may have acted to hastily, and advised me to at least wait until the Pope releases his upcoming encyclical on the topic. Maybe the Vatican is not really quite going in that direction.
Unfortunately that hardly seems to be the case. All signs are pointing to a Vatican that is ready to accept the bogus science. One can only speculate about what earthly benefit they may be getting in return. Even the Vatican’s soul can be bought.
For example the Vatican writes in a December 11 press release concerning the Lima Conference that climate protection is “a grave ethical and moral responsibility” and that “the consequences of environmental change […] remind us of the grave consequences of mismanagement and inaction.” and that “The time for seeking global solutions is running out” claiming there exists “a clear, definitive and unpostponable ethical imperative to act”.
I’d say the Vatican’s position is quite clear. The press release continues:
Pope Francis thus emphasised that an ‘effective battle against global warming will be possible only through a responsible collective response that sets aside particular interests and behaviours and develops free from political and economic pressures’.”
Other Vatican press releases on the subject use the same language.

Today the catholicphilly.com reports on the Pope’s upcoming visit to the Phillipines. It writes: “A worldwide campaign is emerging among Catholic individuals and organizations concerned about climate change and protecting the environment. The Global Catholic Climate Movement went public Jan. 14, coinciding with the visit of Pope Francis to the Philippines.”
Okay, this does not appear to be a direct initiative from the Vatican, but it is one that is awfully close to it. As more Catholics adopt global warming, it is only a question of time before the Church becomes divided.
Also new today is that Catholics in Australia are joining global movement to curb climate change. Great, these Catholics now believe in rain-dancing and indulgences.
They write:
We accept the findings of scientific leaders, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to widespread and mostly harmful changes to planetary systems. We are certain that anthropogenic [human-made] climate change endangers God’s creation and us all, particularly the poor, whose voices have already spoken of the impacts of an altered climate.”
It’s one thing when the members leave the Church, but it’s quite another when the Church leaves its members – and joins up with a flakey movement that is based on phony data, deception, slimy politics and fortunetelling. I have no desire to follow the Vatican in this folly. The Church has to come back to the truth, and not the other way around.
The Vatican would be very wise make an immediate course correction and to take a neutral position on the issue.
PS: My “Pope’s “to-do list” is meant to be satirical.

"President Donald Trump’s vow to hit North Korea with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” is an unveiled threat to unleash America’s most potent weapons of mass destruction onto the Korean peninsula. According to many defence analysts, the risk of nuclear confrontation over Europe and the Indian subcontinent has also increased in recent years. In a more hopeful turn of events, 122 countries voted in June to adopt the United Nations Treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons in New York. The “ban treaty” will make nuclear weapons illegal for ratifying countries, and many see it as an opportunity to kick start a renewed effort towards multilateral disarmament. Supporters of the treaty argue that even a limited, regional nuclear war would produce a catastrophic and global humanitarian crisis. Equally, other analysts suggest that the reality is not as severe as is often depicted. In March this year, Matthias Eken, a researcher of attitudes towards nuclear weapons, wrote in The Conversation that their destructive power “has been vastly exaggerated” and that one should avoid overusing “doomsday scenarios and apocalyptic language”. Eken argued that nuclear weapons are not as powerful as often described, on the basis that a 9 megaton thermonuclear warhead dropped over the state of Arkansas would only destroy 0.2% of the state’s surface area. He also observed that more than 2,000 nuclear detonations have been made on the planet without having ended human civilisation, and argued that if we want to mitigate the risk posed by nuclear weapons, we must not exaggerate those risks. Eken’s sanguine approach towards nuclear weapons stands in contrast to the more dramatic rhetoric of global humanitarian catastrophe and existential threats to humanity. So what is the basis for the latter? The greatest concern derives from relatively new research which has modelled the indirect effects of nuclear detonations on the environment and climate. The most-studied scenario is a limited regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan, involving 100 Hiroshima-sized warheads (small by modern standards) detonated mostly over urban areas. Many analysts suggest that this is a plausible scenario in the event of an all-out war between the two states, whose combined arsenals amount to more than 220 nuclear warheads. In this event, an estimated 20m people could die within a week from the direct effects of the explosions, fire, and local radiation. That alone is catastrophic – more deaths than in the entire of World War I. But nuclear explosions are also extremely likely to ignite fires over a large area, which coalesce and inject large volumes of soot and debris into the stratosphere. In the India-Pakistan scenario, up to 6.5m tonnes of soot could be thrown up into the upper atmosphere, blocking out the sun and causing a significant drop in average surface temperature and precipitation across the globe, with effects that could last for more than a decade. This ecological disruption would, in turn, badly affect global food production. According to one study, maize production in the US (the world’s largest producer) would decline by an average by 12% over ten years in our given scenario. In China, middle season rice would fall by 17% over a decade, maize by 16%, and winter wheat by 31%. With total world grain reserves amounting to less than 100 days of global consumption, such effects would place an estimated 2 billion people at risk of famine.  Although a nuclear conflict involving North Korea and the US would be smaller, given Pyongyang’s limited arsenal, many people would still die and ecological damage would severely affect global public health for years. Additionally, any nuclear conflict between the US and North Korea is likely to increase the risk of nuclear confrontation involving other states and other regions of the world. A large-scale nuclear war between the US and Russia would be far worse. Most Russian and US weapons are 10 to 50 times stronger than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima. In a war involving the use of the two nations’ strategic nuclear weapons (those intended to be used away from battlefield, aimed at infrastructure or cities), some 150m tonnes of soot could be lofted into the upper atmosphere. This would reduce global temperatures by 8°C – the “nuclear winter” scenario. Under these conditions, food production would stop and the vast majority of the human race is likely to starve. Eken suggests that both the scenarios of a limited regional nuclear conflict and an all-out war between US and Russia are unlikely. He may be right. However, both scenarios are possible, even if we can’t reliably quantify the risk. Continued adversarial rhetoric from both Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un about the use of nuclear weapons is not making this possibility any smaller. What we can say, is that the doctrine of nuclear deterrence represents a high-risk gamble. Nuclear weapons do not keep us safe from acts of terrorism, nor can they be used to fight sea level rise, extreme weather, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss or antimicrobial resistance. This is why so many medical and public health organisations have been campaigning to make nuclear weapons illegal. Regardless of how many need to be exploded to cause a catastrophe or produce an existential threat to humanity, and regardless of the risk of this happening, the adage that “prevention is the best cure” remains the case when it comes to these abhorrent and dangerous weapons. Research papers and discussions on the public health and environmental effects of nuclear weapons will be part of the Health Through Peace 2017 conference at the University of York in September."
"Although most species of plants on Earth have flowers, the evolutionary origin of flowers themselves are shrouded in mystery. Flowers are the sexual organs of more than 360,000 species of plants alive today, all derived from a single common ancestor in the distant past. This ancestral plant, alive sometime between 250m and 140m years ago, produced the first flowers at a time when the planet was warmer, and richer in oxygen and greenhouse gases than today. A time when dinosaurs roamed primeval landscapes. But despite the fact dinosaurs went extinct 65m years ago we have a better idea of what an Iguanodon looked like than of how the ancestral flower was built.  This is partly because these first flowers left no traces. Flowers are fragile structures that only in the luckiest of circumstances can be transformed into fossils. And, as no fossil has been found dating back 140m or more years, scientists have only had a limited sense of what the ultimate ancestor would have looked like. Until now. A major new study by an international team of botanists has achieved the best reconstruction to date of this ancestral flower. The research, published in Nature Communications, relies not so much on fossils as on studying the characteristics of 800 of its living descendant species.  By comparing the similarities and differences among related flowering plants, it is possible to infer the characteristics of their recent ancestors. For example, because all orchid species have flowers in which one half is the mirror image of the other (bilateral symmetry), we can suppose that their ancestor must have had bilateral flowers. By comparing those recent ancestors to each other it is then possible to go a step further back in time, and so on, until eventually we reach the base of the flowering plants’ family tree. In some respects, the original flower resembles a modern magnolia: it has multiple, undifferentiated “petals” (technically tepals), arranged in concentric rings. At its centre there are multiple rows of sexual organs including pollen-producing stamens and ovule-bearing ovaries. It is hard to resist the temptation to imagine ancient pollinators crawling in this flower, collecting pollen grains while unknowingly helping the plant to produce seeds.  The new study helps to settle the controversy about whether early flowers had separate sexes, or whether both male and female reproductive organs were combined in the same flower. Previous evidence pointed to different answers. On the one hand, one of the earliest diverging lineages of flowering plants, represented nowadays only by a rare shrub from the Pacific island of New Caledonia called Amborella, has flowers that are either male or female. On the other, most modern species combine both sexes in the same flower.  The authors of the study settle the question and show that the ancestral flower was a hermaphrodite. This means that early flowering plants could reproduce both as a male and a female. Combined sexes can be advantageous when colonising new environments as a single individual can be its own mate, and indeed many plant species colonising remote oceanic islands tend to be hermaphrodite. Maybe the combination of sexes helped early flowering plants to outcompete their rivals. Despite the apparent similarity with some modern flowers, their ultimate ancestor has a few surprises up its sleeve. For example, botanist have long thought that early flowers had floral parts arranged in a spiral around the centre of the flower as can be seen in modern species such as the star anise. The new reconstruction, though, strongly suggests that early flowers had their organs arranged not in a spiral, but in series of concentric circles or “whorls”, as in most modern plants. The early flower had more numerous whorls, however, suggesting flowers have become simpler over time. Paradoxically, this simpler architecture may have given modern plants a more stable base upon which to evolve and achieve more complex tasks such as sophisticated interaction with certain insects as in orchids, or the production of “flower heads” made of dozens or hundreds of simpler flowers as in the sunflower family. Although now we have a good idea of what one of the earliest flowers may have looked like, we still know little about how that flower came to be. The detailed steps leading to its evolution are unknown. Perhaps we will have to wait for the discovery of new fossil flowers spanning the gap around 250m-140m years ago, before we can understand the very origin of what is the most diverse sexual structure on the planet."
"The climate emergency has risen to the top of the UK’s election agenda in a way that would have been “unthinkable” even five years ago, leading environmentalists have said, predicting that it augurs a permanent change in British politics. On Wednesday, Labour took the unprecedented move of putting green issues as the top section of its manifesto, the first time one of the UK’s two major parties has done so. Jeremy Corbyn led the appeal to voters with policies including an £11bn windfall tax on oil and gas companies, a million new jobs in a “green industrial revolution” and commitments on moving to a net-zero carbon economy.  “Such focus on climate and the environment would have been almost unthinkable five years ago,” said Shaun Spiers, executive director of the Green Alliance. “Tackling climate change runs through this manifesto in a way that is unprecedented from either of the main parties ahead of a UK general election.” “It would not have been possible five years ago,” said Tom Burke, chairman of environmental thinktank E3G and former adviser to several governments, who said the move marked a permanent change in British politics, as younger voters in particular were “energised” over the environment. Public anxiety had been fuelled by people seeing extreme weather around the world, and the rise of climate activism in movements such as Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes reflected that. “The politicians are following the public on this, not the other way round.” Public concern over the climate is “unequivocal”, and people “back decarbonisation by a massive margin”, said Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “The UK has never had an election like this one in terms of the profile of climate change. To have all the major parties supporting a transition to net zero within a few decades, and competing with each other on policies to deliver, is unprecedented.” Labour disappointed many green campaigners by failing to put a date on its commitment to a net-zero carbon economy. After union pressure, a proposal to mandate the transformation by 2030 was watered down to “achieve the substantial majority of our emissions reductions by 2030”, which should imply swifter and stronger action than the Tory pledge to decarbonise by 2050, but leaves room for interpretation. There was also no frequent-flyer levy, despite increasing concern over aviation emissions from the independent Committee on Climate Change, and a heavily hedged green light on airport expansion. “Labour’s manifesto stops short of getting full marks – its policy for tackling exploding aviation emissions is not fit for purpose,” said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK. “And the commitments on plastic pollution and waste do not go far enough.” Ryan Shorthouse, director of the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue, accused the party of wanting too much state control in calling for nationalisation of energy, water and railways. “[The Labour manifesto] equates to a significant and unprecedented expansion of state expenditure and control. They envisage a super-spending, suffocating state. But voters are not stupid – the state cannot and should not deliver everything.” Burke believes Labour’s stance on Brexit will also alienate many environmentally minded voters. “Brexit is appallingly bad for the environment. The Labour party wants to do good things on the environment and wants do that within a strong EU – Corbyn is letting them down.” However, pushing the climate emergency back to the political periphery would no longer be an option for any party, he said. “This is mainstream now.” The Liberal Democrats, while focusing on Brexit, have also made the climate emergency a key priority, promising to generate 80% of the UK’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030, to bring forward to 2045 the deadline for net-zero carbon, and to expand electric vehicles and ban fracking. The Green party wants to spend £100bn a year for the next decade on the climate crisis, replacing high-carbon infrastructure and creating jobs. This weekend, the Conservative manifesto is expected to include policies on combatting climate change, reconfirming its commitment to net-zero carbon. Next year, thanks to Theresa May’s offer to the UN, the UK will host the most important international summit on the climate since the 2015 Paris agreement was signed, requiring a massive diplomatic effort if the government is to make it a success. But the party may be hampered by its recent see-sawing on environmental policies, with incentives to low-carbon development withdrawn, home insulation schemes closed and incoming housing regulations scrapped. Spiers said: “This will be a big moment for UK politics if the Conservatives show a similar level of ambition [to Labour].”"

The Die Welt article quotes German commercial meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net, who is often quoted in the German print media. Here’s the Die kalte Sonne post in English!
=============================
Dominik Jung warns of uncertain climate forecasts: “Us meteorologists know just how difficult forecasts for the next 5 to 10 days are. So how certain can 50-year trends be?”
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Exemplary reporting on the 2014 German temperature record appeared on December 30, 2014 in Die Welt. The daily allowed meteorologist Dominik Jung to get a word in. Jung puts the temperature trend in important context: 1000 years ago during the Medieval Warm Period it was at least just as warm in Germany as it is today. One needs to be careful when using the word “record”. What follows is an excerpt from the Die Welt article:
For the first time we have the number ten before the decimal point for Germany’s annual mean temperature. The mean temperature was around 10.2°C. ‘That’s a one hundred year record. Never has it been so warm in Germany,’ says meteorologist Dominik Jung at the weather site wetter.net. […]
‘One must clearly state: The temperature trend for Germany is clearly upwards over the last 130 years. And naturally this is climate change,’ said Jung. He then adds: ‘But: Climate is always changing. The earth’s climate has been subject in part to large fluctuations. During the Medieval Period there were both warm and icy times. So this pattern isn’t really anything new. However, there’s a lot of controversy in the ongoing discussion concerning what impact man has on the on the current increase in the mean temperature. Today that still has not yet been adequately determined.’ […]
‘We are a long way away from the severe drought summers, or winters without ice and snow – just a look out the window is already enough. These extreme scenarios help very little. They only serve to spread uncertainty. We do not know what will be 30, 40, or 50 years into the future. Chill out: Us meteorologists know just how difficult forecasts for the next 5 to 10 days can be.’ Jung has doubts on ‘How accurate the 50-year trend will be.'”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate science critical group Klimakontroverse.de is holding its next meeting at the Freizeitheim Linden in Hannover, Germany, 19 February, at 7:30 pm.
The group regularly has meetings on climate and is known for taking the discussions directly to the public, but doing so with respect, courtesy and politeness. It writes:
The main topic of the next meeting is the reliability of the temperature measurements. There’s the frightening suspicion that NASA (GISS) has manipulated the temperatures upwards. How much of this is true?
At the last meeting we discussed the topic of 2014 being the warmest year in Germany and worldwide since records began.
Short summary:
Germany: Despite the warmest year since records began, the overall trend shows no increasing temperature, (see 1 and 2), over which the German DWD Weather Service has yet to inform the public.
Globe: 2014 was a warm year, like 2010, but it was the warmest with only 38% certainty. The Met Office in Great Britain has even distanced itself from the claim that it has been the warmest ever because the temperature was only 0.02°C above the old record, which is well within the range of uncertainty (Met Office).
Satellite measurements show no evidence of an especially warm 2014 (UAH).

"The largest wildfire ever recorded in Greenland was recently spotted close to the west coast town of Sisimiut, not far from Disko Island where I research retreating glaciers. The fire has captured public and scientific interest not just because its size and location came as a surprise, but also because it is yet another signpost of deep environmental change in the Arctic.  Greenland is an important cog in the global climate system. The ice sheet which covers 80% of the island reflects so much of the sun’s energy back into space that it moderates temperatures through what is known as the “albedo effect”. And since it occupies a strategic position in the North Atlantic, its meltwater tempers ocean circulation patterns.  But Greenland is especially vulnerable to climate change, as Arctic air temperatures are currently rising at twice the global average rate. Environmental conditions are frequently setting new records: “the warmest”, “the wettest”, “the driest”. Despite its size, the fire itself represents only a snapshot of Greenland’s fire history. It alone cannot tell us about wider Arctic climate change.  But when we superimpose these extraordinary events onto longer-term environmental records, we can see important trends emerging.  Between 2002 and 2016 the ice sheet lost mass at a rate of around 269 gigatonnes per year. One gigatonne is one billion tonnes. One tonne is about the weight of a walrus.  During the same period, the ice sheet also showed some unusual short-term behaviour. The 2012 melt season was especially intense – 97% of the ice sheet experienced surface melt at some point during the year. Snow even melted at its summit, the highest point in the centre of the island where the ice is piled up more than 3km above sea level.  In April 2016 Greenland saw abnormally high temperatures and its earliest ever “melt event” (a day in which more than 10% of the ice sheet has at least 1mm of surface melt). Early melting doesn’t usher in a period of complete and catastrophic change – the ice won’t vanish overnight. But it does illustrate how profoundly and rapidly the ice sheet can respond to rising temperatures.  Despite its icy image, the margins of Greenland are actually quite boggy, complete with swarms of mosquitoes. This is the “active layer”, made up of peaty soil and sediment up to two metres thick, which temporarily thaws during the summer. The underlying permafrost, which can reach depths of 100m, remains permanently frozen.  In Greenland, like much of the Arctic, rising temperatures are thawing the permafrost. This means the active layer is growing by up to 1.5cm per year. This trend is expected to continue, seeing as under current IPCC predictions, Arctic air temperatures will rise by between 2.0°C and 7.5°C this century.  Arctic permafrost contains more than 1,500 billion tonnes of dead plants and animals (around 1,500 billion walrus equivalent) which we call “organic matter”. Right now, this stuff has been frozen for thousands of years. But when the permafrost thaws this organic matter will decay, releasing carbon and methane (another greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere. If thawing continues, it’s estimated that by 2100 permafrost will emit 850-1,400 billion tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (for comparison: total global emissions in 2012 was 54 billion tonnes of CO₂ equivalent). All that extra methane and carbon of course has the potential to enhance global warming even further.  With this in mind, it is clear to see why the recent wildfire, which was burning in dried-out peat in the active layer, was especially interesting to researchers. If Greenland’s permafrost becomes increasingly degraded and dry, there is the potential for even bigger wildfires which would release vast stores of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  Major changes in the physical environment are already affecting the species that call Greenland home. Just look at polar bears, the face of Arctic climate change. Unlike other bears, polar bears spend most of their time at sea, which explains their Latin name Ursus maritimus. In particular they rely on sea ice as it gives them a deep-water platform from which to hunt seals. However, since 1979 the extent of sea ice has decreased by around 7.4% per decade due to climate warming, and bears have had to adjust their habitat use. With continued temperature rise and sea ice disappearance, it’s predicted that populations will decline by up to 30% in the next few decades, taking the total number of polar bears to under 9,000. I have considered only a handful of the major environmental shifts in Greenland over the past few decades, but the effects of increasing temperatures are being felt in all parts of the earth system. Sometimes these are manifest as extreme events, at others as slow and insidious changes.  The different parts of the environmental jigsaw interact, so that changes in one part (sea ice decline, say) influence another (polar bear populations). We need to keep a close eye on the system as a whole if we are to make reliable interpretations – and meaningful plans for the future."
"Self-driving cars will change how we live, in all sorts of ways. But they won’t just affect us humans – the coming revolution in autonomous transport has significant implications for wildlife as well. Nature conservationists and planners need to think hard about the impact of driverless vehicles, most notably in terms of renewed urban sprawl. In some ways, wider developments in automotive technology bode well for the environment. Electric cars will increasingly replace the internal combustion engine, and that should, in theory, reduce carbon emissions and health-afflicting air pollution. Through minimising traffic jams, driverless cars may also reduce overall energy use. Unlike human drivers, computers can avoid the “concertina” effect of needless acceleration and braking that exacerbates congestion, and won’t be tempted to “rubberneck” when passing an accident. And, as autonomous vehicles aren’t restricted by human reaction times, it may make sense to increase speed limits for them on major inter-city routes. So driverless cars promise a future of faster journey times with much reduced environmental impacts. They may even mean less wildlife roadkill. But it’s the very efficiency of driverless cars that poses a challenge for planners and conservationists. The threat is an unchecked increase in low-density urbanisation. Autonomous vehicles promise a future in which passengers are free to use their time productively (working, for example). And they can park themselves (or be part of a shared pool) which saves yet more time in the morning rush. Coupled with faster journey times, the incentives to live further out of town will increase significantly.  There are both push and pull factors at work here: sky-high residential prices in most cities push people away from urban centres while healthy environments and green living pull people towards the hinterlands. The limiting factor in suburban spread is often travel time, either by public or private means. Driverless cars fundamentally alter the equation. Existing planning policies are based on our current transport systems. Green-belts, for example, are designed to reduce urban sprawl by restricting development within a buffer zone around an urban area. However, the reduced transport times offered by driverless cars make it easier to live outside the belt while still working inside. So these loops of green are in danger of becoming a thin layer in a sandwich of ever-spreading suburbanisation.  This is, of course, a familiar challenge since the rise of the automotive age in the 1940s. However, the solutions designed by planners have been calibrated for a human-driving automotive system – not for the supercharged future of driverless transport. Other examples of planning protection for wildlife include nature reserves, national parks and (in the UK) “Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty”. Such areas have either strict controls on development, or do not permit it at all. However, they are nice places to live in or nearby. The coming revolution in automotive journey times and the ability to work behind the (computer-driven) wheel will make living in such areas increasingly compatible with a commute to the nearest city.  Natural habitats being lost entirely or splintered into ever-smaller fragments have long been understood as some of the primary causes of species extinctions across the world. Renewed urban sprawl threatens to increase the magnitude of both habitat loss and fragmentation. These threats are well known among conservationists, but there are differences of opinion on how best to respond. For example, eco-modernists advocate a strategy of “land-sparing”, whereby human activities are concentrated into urban areas and vast tracts of land are set aside for nature. There are many cultural and ethical problems inherent in herding humans into cities, but the near-term planning issues posed by autonomous vehicles will exacerbate the challenge given they will boost demand to live in “unspared” lands. Alternatively, some conservationists advocate “land-sharing”, in which human communities redesign the way we farm and live so as to co-exist with wildlife, cheek-by-jowl. Autonomous vehicles pose significant challenges for either approach, by supercharging the fragmentary effect of road systems. Whichever approach is taken, we’ll need to redesign existing systems and policies to take account of the increased range that driverless transport facilitates. This may involve new zoning laws to protect wider areas of countryside than at present. It certainly requires further development of green infrastructure, habitat corridors and “greenways”.  It might also involve engineering solutions, especially given the fact that autonomous vehicles should be much more amenable to being driven underground. It is possible to imagine a future in which the famous bear bridges of Banff are tiny precursors to a vast programme in which rural highways are covered with forests of green. Retro-fitting roads into tunnels won’t be cheap, but it becomes easier when human drivers are taken out of the equation. Software drivers are less bothered by artificial light and more efficient at mitigating the congestion impact during construction. Much conservation policy is based on planning for the world we live in now. Strategic conservation planning needs instead to take account of likely futures. And in a future of driverless cars, that is likely to result in the mega cities of the 20th century becoming the mega sprawls of the 21st. Unless, of course, planners and conservationists rise to this new challenge."

Share this...FacebookTwitterResistance to wind power in Germany is snowballing. And it needs to be noted that this resistance is grass roots and sustained almost entirely by volunteers and privately donated time and effort.
In the latest wind energy critical site www.vernunftkraft.de here has a report summarizing the performance of Germany’s wind turbines in 2014. Again the result is so ugly that the wind industry does not want anyone to see it.
Vernunftkraft.de writes in response to the wind industry’s recent boastings of yet another successful “record” year:
Rolf Schuster finalized the evaluation of the actual wind energy feed-in data in order to counter the propaganda with honest figures.
The most important result: 14.8 percent.
The following diagrams depict the installed capacity in light blue shading, i.e. the cumulative capacity of all Germany’s wind turbines.
As is easy to see, the installed rated capacity has been expanded because new turbines were installed over the course of the year. This is the so-called ‘record’.
The dark blue area shaded depicts the energy that was actually fed in. Here it is easy to see that wind energy is extremely volatile. During some quarter-hour periods the roughly 25,000 turbines indeed delivered a lot of power. But at other times they delivered practically nothing.
One does not even see any real available baseload – a sort of reliable minimum output to rely on.”

Germany’s 2014 installed wind turbine rated capacity (shaded light blue), and the actual power fed in (dark blue). The average: 14.8%! Chart by Rolf Schuster, see here.

The next three charts at Vernunftkraft.de (not shown here) show the January-April, May-August and September-December periods respectively with a higher resolution so that readers can get a better idea of the extreme volatility one gets with wind energy.
The following table sums up the “honest figures” one really gets with wind turbine energy:

Source: Rolf Schuster, here.
The left box shows a total of 39,612 MW of installed rated capacity. The maximum energy fed in was 29,687 MW (74.9% of rated capacity) briefly in December. The absolute minimum was only 24.0 MW (0.06%), probably barely enough to power a single large cement mill.
The average was 5868 MW or 14.8% of the installed rated capacity.
Theoretically that means 85.2% of the rated capacity did nothing the entire year. Imagine a company where only one of seven workers ever show up for work.
The box above on the right also provides interesting figures. They show that Germany’s wind turbines as a whole ran at between 0 to 10% of their rated capacity 45.5% of the time (3986.75 hrs)! The turbines, which the German government says will become the “workhorse” of the German power industry, ran at over 50% of their rated capacity only for 461 hours, or just 5.2% of the time.
It’s little wonder that wind turbines have been assigned the failing grade of “F”. But what else could one possibly expect from a student who shows up for lectures and does his homework only a few times per semester, and stays in bed 6 out of 7 days a week? And now comes the funny part: The parents of this lazy, total-failure-of-a-student are forced to pay Ivy league level tuition – 20 years long! And don’t expect the lazy bum to have a degree of any sort when he walks off campus at age 38.
Little wonder vernunftkraft.de calls wind turbines the sloth of the energy industry.

Sun-powered Solar Impulse 2 aircraft is to circumnavigate the globe “without a drop of fuel”. However it will in fact need thousands of litres of fuel from support planes. Photo credit: Brussels Airport, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.
There’s been a fair amount of hype surrounding the Swiss Solar Impulse 2 project where it is being attempted to go around the world in a purely solar-powered aircraft, “without using a drop of [fossil] fuel“. It is being billed as a landmark flight, signifying a milestone in green aviation. However, nothing could be further from the truth.
Hat-tip: Reader Konrad.
The fixed-wing aircraft departed Abu Dhabi on March 9 and has since landed in India. From there it will continue to China, Hawaii, Phoenix, New York, Morocco before finally coming full circle back to Abu Dhabi sometime in August, 2015 – “without emitting any climate gases”. Full planned route here.
The pilots Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg will alternate as the craft makes a series of stops along its journey. The plane is able to carry only a single pilot and no passengers. The aim: “We want to show what’s possible with innovative technologies,” Piccard boasted.

The 2200-kg pioneering aircraft has a wingspan that is comparable to that of an Airbus A340. According to Wikipedia lithium polymer batteries will store and power 10 hp (7.5 kW) motors with twin-bladed propellers. The upper wings have 11,628 photovoltaic cells. The major design constraint is the capacity of the lithium polymer batteries. See plane specs here.
Of course the entire flight is supposed to be done “solely” using renewable energy from the sun, and not use a single drop of aircraft fuel. But when one examines the flight more closely it turns out that mission indeed involves a huge fossil fuel carbon footprint.
According to an audio report by SRF Swiss Radio and Television the Solar Impulse 2 mission involves the substitute pilot, a technical ground crew “of dozens of people” and tonnes of equipment and logistical supplies that have to be flown behind using conventional charter flights. The “fossil fuel-free” Solar Impulse 2 journey is in fact being made possible only with the use of tens of thousands of litres of aviation fuel. This is a fact that is being almost entirely ignored by the media.
The SRF reporter tells listeners:
It is so that the entire group, the team members, are multiple dozens of men and women, have to fly behind in charter planes. This naturally is the less sustainable aspect of the entire project, but it just isn’t possible any other way. This involves one cargo plane for transporting all the equipment, and a small passenger plane on which the entire group travels to the destinations.”
A promotion video here shows how the aircraft was transported from Europe to its start point in Abu Dhabi earlier this year: With a Boeing 747!

Share this...FacebookTwitterDirk Notz of the Hamburg-based Max-Planck-Institute: Arctic sea ice could again expand in the coming decade
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Over the past 30 years Arctic sea ice has shrunk considerably. Although both in 2007 and 2012 negative records were reached, the ice recovered in the years that followed.
Former US Vice President and climate activist Al Gore was clearly impressed by the 2007 melt record and so in 2008 he declared the Arctic could be completely ice free by 2013. The year 2013 came and went, but the ice stayed. Using the same alarmist bullhorn, US Senator John Kerry also announced that the Arctic sea ice was set to melt away, read here:
The truth is that the threat we face is not an abstract concern for the future. It is already upon us and its effects are being felt worldwide, right now. Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013. Not in 2050, but four years from now.“
The idea of an ice-free Arctic from both politicians obviously had been whispered to them by IPCC scientists such as Wieslaw Maslowski. The BBC reported here on December 12, 2007:
Scientists in the US have presented one of the most dramatic forecasts yet for the disappearance of Arctic sea ice.
Their latest modelling studies indicate northern polar waters could be ice-free in summers within just 5-6 years. Professor Wieslaw Maslowski told an American Geophysical Union meeting that previous projections had underestimated the processes now driving ice loss.”
Looking back at these completely failed prognoses, one would at least expect a return to reason. But this has not been the case for some. There are still climate alarmist scientists who continue insisting that the Arctic sea ice only has a few years left. They’re dead sure. The same is true with the end-of-the-world. And when the predicted end of the world fails to happen, the goalposts get pushed back, or the focus switches to some other end-of-world scenario.
One of the more outspoken believers of the Arctic death spiral is Peter Wadhams of the University of Cambridge. In 2012 he announced to the world the prognosis that Arctic sea ice would disappear within four years. Today, two years later, the trend is in the opposite direction. It doesn’t look good for Wadhams and his prognosis. Now even some of the most obstinate alarmists think the same. For them the apocalyptic visions are really starting to get annoying. During a sea-ice conference in September 2014 in London, Gavin Schmidt had harsh words for Wadhams via Twitter:
“Some anticipation for Peter Wadhams. Audience members already crying,” “Wadhams still using graphs with ridiculous projections with no basis in physics,” “Wadhams now onto methane pulse of 50 GT. But no better justified than his previous statements,” and “Wadhams clearly states that there is no physics behind his extrapolations.”
The latest prognoses come from James Overland and Muyin Wang, who published them in the Geophysical Research Letters in May, 2013. Here they employ three prognosis approaches which look at the end of the ice in 2020, 2030 or 2040. What follows is the abstract:
When will the summer Arctic be nearly sea ice free?
The observed rapid loss of thick multiyear sea ice over the last 7 years and the September 2012 Arctic sea ice extent reduction of 49% relative to the 1979–2000 climatology are inconsistent with projections of a nearly sea ice-free summer Arctic from model estimates of 2070 and beyond made just a few years ago. Three recent approaches to predictions in the scientific literature are as follows: (1) extrapolation of sea ice volume data, (2) assuming several more rapid loss events such as 2007 and 2012, and (3) climate model projections. Time horizons for a nearly sea ice-free summer for these three approaches are roughly 2020 or earlier, 2030 ± 10 years, and 2040 or later. Loss estimates from models are based on a subset of the most rapid ensemble members. It is not possible to clearly choose one approach over another as this depends on the relative weights given to data versus models. Observations and citations support the conclusion that most global climate model results in the CMIP5 archive are too conservative in their sea ice projections. Recent data and expert opinion should be considered in addition to model results to advance the very likely timing for future sea ice loss to the first half of the 21st century, with a possibility of major loss within a decade or two.”
Other scientists have become more cautious, as they were burned too many times in the past with overly hasty projections. Sea ice scientist Dirk Notz of the Hamburg-based Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology declared in September 2014, in response to a request made by Pierre Gosselin of notrickszone.com, that because of the variability over the coming decade the ice could just as well expand as it could shrink. Interestingly in the model graphics provided by Notz for the coming decades, there are no ice free polar seas to be seen. What follows is the exact wording of the notable e-mail from Notz to Gosselin:

Dear Pierre,
Thanks for being in touch, and sorry for the slow reply. I was at a meeting with surprisingly little internet access. Regarding the bet: I’d be very careful to place a bet in either direction, simply based on our understanding of the system from climate-model simulations. These basically say that on short time scales, such as from one decade to the next, internal variability can cause both an increase or a decrease of the ice coverage. To exemplify this, I’ve attached a slide that shows 30-year long trends from our climate-model simulations.

There you see 30-year long trends for different start dates in our simulations, which vary wildly. This would even more be the case for 10-year long trends. Hence, I wouldn’t put money on a further decrease of the ice cover in the years to come, nor on the opposite. I’ve also attached a plot showing two of the simulations with our Earth-System Model, which suggest that there might be slightly less sea ice in the next decade, but other simulations show a slight increase on these short time scales.

Hence, on time scales such as one decade, the ice cover could well increase a bit (as you are suggesting), but it might also decrease. This depends in my opinion primarily on weather patterns in individual summers – nothing we can predict at the moment. Having said this, however, one of the presentations at the meeting I’ve just been to by Andrey Proshutinsky went in the same direction as you’re suggesting, namely that because of ocean cycles there will be a recovery of sea ice in the years to come. However, I don’t believe this to be a very robust finding that I would put money on at the moment. It’s nevertheless certainly something that we’ll investigate more in the time to come. […] Please let me know if any further questions should come up.
Best wishes,
Dirk”
With all the long-term prognoses we are also naturally interested in how things will develop with Arctic sea ice over the coming year (2015). In her blog Judith Curry provided a forecast Blog in October 2014. She expects the ice in the summer of 2015 to at least reach the extent seen in 2014:
And finally, my prediction for 2015 sea ice minima. I predict minimum sea extent will be the same or greater than 2014, with a continued recovery of sea ice volume. I expect continued recovery in the Atlantic portion of the Arctic, with continued low sea ice extent in the Siberian Arctic. My decadal scale prediction is either no trend in sea ice minima or an increase (I do not expect continued decline in the coming decade).”
It doesn’t look good for Peter Wadhams and the followers of the climate-alarmism movement.

"It is more than ten years since Al Gore’s documentary An Inconvenient Truth brought climate change to the masses. At its heart, it showed the former US vice-president giving a comprehensive global warming slide show – warning of the dire consequences if we do nothing about the climate crisis.   The film grossed US$24m in the US and US$26m internationally. Not only was the film a financial success but it was also a critical success and won two Oscars. An Inconvenient Truth has been credited for raising international public awareness of climate change and re-energising the environmental movement. The documentary has been included in science curricula in schools around the world. It was also instrumental in Al Gore sharing the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).   A decade on, Gore has made a follow-up entitled An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. This film updates us on the major changes that have occurred over the past decade; including the accelerated retreat of the ice caps, extreme weather events and the historic signing of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015.  The sequel is different to the first film – it is much more biographical and focuses on how Gore became the great climate change communicator and what he has been doing with his charities to build awareness and train future climate change leaders around the world.  Had this film been released a year ago, its optimistic tone would not have seemed out of place. It is almost as if the filmmakers had assumed there would be a different election result. The film has been hastily edited to include Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The end of the film seems out of kilter with the optimistic tone of the rest of the film, which occasionally borders on triumphant. I interviewed Al Gore and we mainly focused on politics and how to deal with bipartisanship. We both believe that it will be in the political realm where the fight to solve climate change will be won or lost. Watch the interview here Mark Maslin: It’s clear that the first film had a huge impact. So what is the motivation behind you doing a sequel? Al Gore: When we reached the ten-year anniversary of the first movie it seemed like an appropriate time to present what’s new in the previous decade – and there have been two very big changes and a third that occurred during the filming of the movie.  The first is that unfortunately the climate-related extreme weather events have of course become far more common and more destructive. Mother nature is speaking up in a very persuasive way.  The second big change is that the solutions are here now. A decade ago you could see them on the horizon but you had to have the technology experts reassure you that they’re coming, that they’ll be here – well now they’re here. And for example electricity from wind and solar has fallen so quickly in price that in many regions it’s much cheaper than electricity from fossil fuels and soon will be almost everywhere. Electric cars are becoming affordable. Batteries are now beginning to decline sharply in price which will be a real game-changer for the energy industry. LEDs and hundreds of new far more efficient technologies are helping to stabilise and soon reduce emissions. I was struck in the middle of your film by a profound statement: “To fix the climate crisis we need to fix democracy”. And then the film moved on to another topic. How do you think we can fix our democracies now in the 21st century? Well, big money has hacked our democracy even before Putin did. And it accompanied the transition from the printing press to television, when all of a sudden candidates – especially in the US – were made to feel they have to spend all their time begging rich people and special interests for money so they can buy more TV ads and their opponents. And that’s really given an enormous unhealthy and toxic degree of influence to lobbyists and special interests. Now just as television replaced the printing press, internet-based media are beginning to displace television and once again open up the doorways to the public forum for individuals who can use knowledge and the best available evidence. If you believe in democracy as I do and if you believe in harvesting the wisdom of crowds, then the interaction of free people exchanging the best available evidence of what’s more likely to be true than not will once again push us toward a government of by and for the people. One quick example. Last year the Bernie Sanders campaign – regardless of what you might think about his agenda – proved that it is now possible on the internet to run a very credible nationwide campaign without taking any money from lobbyists and special interests or billionaires. Instead, you can raise money in small amounts from individuals on the internet and then be accountable to them and not have to worry about being accountable to the big donors. There was a poignant moment in the film when you’re sitting in front of the Senate hearing – and there’s a Republican senator and he’s just not hearing what you’re saying. In a two-party system, how do you reach out to those Republicans – and some of the Democrats – that still don’t to get climate change? Well, part of it is related to the changes necessary in the financing of campaigns. A famous journalist in the US, over a century ago, Upton Sinclair wrote: it is difficult to get a man to understand something if his salary depends upon him not understanding it. And if you substitute campaign finance for salary, you get part of the answer.  But I know for a fact that there are many Republican members of the Senate and House who know that what they’ve been advocating is wrong and would like to crawl back from the end of the limb they’ve put themselves on. And as more and more people express the passionate view that we’ve got to solve the climate crisis that can give them the backbone to change their position, some of them already have. There’s a new Noah’s Ark caucus the Climate Solutions Caucus in the Congress – a reference to the biblical deluge but also a reference to the fact that they only can join by twos one Democrat one Republican – and more Republicans are now switching sides. You’ve done a great job at communicating climate change around the world – but perhaps you being a very prominent, highly respected liberal Democrat has incensed some Republicans and actually hardened their view against climate change. Do you feel that’s fair? I don’t think that’s fair at all and in fact there’s been a great deal of social science research that shows that’s completely inaccurate. You may know Joe Romm – a great climate blogger – he has compiled all that research. For two and a half years after the first movie, bipartisanship increased significantly on this issue. The Republican nominee in 2008, John McCain, had a very responsible position on this issue. But what happened was in the wake of the Great Recession the carbon polluters launched the Tea Party movement – some of them joined on their own, but they actually provided the seed money and insisted that climate denial be a part of that political movement. The polluters have done exactly what the tobacco companies did years ago when they hired actors and dressed them up as doctors and put them on camera to say there are no health problems with cigarettes – 100m people died as a result. Well, now the carbon polluters have taken that same approach hiring the same PR firms spending more than a billion dollars to put out pseudo science and false information. They’re not necessarily going to win the debate. They just want to give the appearance that there is a debate – in order to paralyse the political process. But people are seeing through it now. What struck me about the interview – and also the film – is that Gore is making two very clear points. First is that now all the solutions to climate change exist. There is a wonderful sequence in the movie where he meets Dale Ross, the mayor of Georgetown in Texas. The mayor describes Georgetown as the reddest city in the reddest county in Texas – and he’s a conservative Republican. But he sees moving toward renewable energy, as just making sense. As his job is to deliver the best value for money to his taxpaying citizens and wind and solar are the cheapest energy source.  The second is that Gore makes the profound statement that Western democracies are broken and in order to solve the climate crisis they need to fix democracy. In the interview, Gore suggested that big business has bought many politicians and this must be unpicked so that they are free to make informed unbiased decisions.   He sees social media as the great leveller as campaigns can be run on much smaller budgets reducing the power of party donors. He also suggests in the film that educating both politicians and the electorate on the damages of climate change will make a significant difference. But this is the same rhetoric we here from intellectuals all the time – if the poor people were properly educated they would make the correct political decisions.   In the post-truth era this neatly sidesteps issues of growing inequality, poverty and a general feeling of disenfranchisement. In this way, An Inconvenient Truth was the right movie at the right time and An Inconvenient Sequel is the wrong movie at the wrong time. At the end of the film, Gore makes an impassioned rally speech – part Winston Churchill and part Martin Luther King – which even the hardened sceptic couldn’t help but admire. He finishes by declaring the tag line of the film: “It’s time to fight like your world depends on it.”  Given the forces of big business and Trumpism aligned against climate action, we all need to be as passionate, optimistic and committed to a new safer cleaner future as Gore – because he is right, the world does depend on us acting now."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf anyone needed more proof showing that former US Vice President Al Gore is a pathological serial exaggerator, look no further. He has proven it yet again, this time at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a location where dozens of world economic leaders have flown with private jets.
The Guardian reports here, quoting Mr Gore:
I think that these extreme weather events which are now a hundred times more common than 30 years ago are really waking people’s awareness all over the world [on climate change], and I think that is a gamechanger.”
This gaffe is even worse than his remark claiming that the core of the earth is 1 million degrees hot. It’s truly embarrassing that a vice president of the United States could say such a dumb thing.
In Gore’s view we can only assume that a 100-fold increase in extreme weather events is what it would take to get policymakers to take real action. The reality, however, is that there has been no detectable increase at all. Thus it all means we are light years away from “the climate crisis” Gore likes to hysterically bellow about.
And let us recall what the last IPCC report concluded on the subject of extreme weather event trends: No data exist showing extreme weather events have become more frequent. That’s from the IPCC itself.

Gore is obviously a very desparate man trying to get attention. He’s beginning to appear like the village marketplace fool.
Now responsible journalists are shaking their heads at Gore’s doozy of an exaggeration.

For example Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski has reacted in a head-shaking way at Gore’s mega-whopper, calling “curious” and sarcastically commenting at Twitter:
Why have there been 5 IPCC reports?
Gore delivers another blow to the global warming science. Let him keep talking.

"By continuing to delay significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we risk handing young people alive today a bill of up to US$535 trillion. This would be the cost of the “negative emissions” technologies required to remove CO₂ from the air in order to avoid dangerous climate change.  These are the main findings of new research published in Earth System Dynamics, conducted by an international team led by US climate scientist James Hansen, previously the director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The Paris Agreement in 2015 saw the international community agree to limit warming to within 2°C. The Hansen team argue that the much safer approach is to reduce atmospheric concentrations of CO₂ from the current annual average of more than 400ppm (parts per million) back to 1980s levels of 350ppm. This is a moderately more ambitious goal than the aspiration announced in Paris to further attempt to limit warming to no more than 1.5°C. Many climate scientists and policymakers believe that either the 2°C or 1.5°C limits will only be possible with negative emissions because the international community will be unable to make the required reductions in time.  The most promising negative emissions technology is BECCS – bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration. It involves growing crops which are then burnt in power stations to generate electricity. The carbon dioxide produced is captured from the power station chimneys, compressed, and piped deep down into the Earth’s crust where it will be stored for many thousands of years. This scheme would allow us to both generate electricity and reduce the amount of CO₂ in the Earth’s atmosphere. BECCS has important limits, such as the sheer amount of land, water and fertiliser required to satisfy our energy demand. Perhaps more importantly, it doesn’t exist at anything like the scale required of it. Thus far only small pilot projects have demonstrated its feasibility. Other negative emissions approaches involve fertilising the ocean to increase photosynthesis, or direct air capture which sucks CO₂ out of the air and converts it into plastics or other products.  The Hansen team estimate how much it will cost to extract excess CO₂ with BECCS. They conclude that it would be possible to move back to 350ppm mainly with reforestation and improving soils, leaving around 50 billion tonnes of CO₂ to be mopped up with negative emissions technologies (the plants grown for BECCS take in the CO₂, which is then sequestered when burned).  But that’s only if we make significant reductions in rates of emissions right now. If we delay, then future generations would need to extract over ten times more CO₂ beyond the end of this century. They estimate costs between US$150-350 for each tonne of carbon removed via negative emissions technologies. If global emissions are reduced by 6% each year – a very challenging but not impossible scenario – then bringing CO₂ concentrations back to 350ppm would cost US$8-18.5 trillion, spread over 80 years at US$100-230 billion a year.  If emissions remain flat or increase at 2% a year, then total cost balloons to at least US$89 trillion and potentially as much as US$535 trillion. That’s US$1.1 to US$6.7 trillion every year for eight decades.  To give these numbers some context, the entire US federal budget is about US$4 trillion, while annual spending by all countries on military and defence is US$1.7 trillion. Humans have pumped over 1.5 trillion tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere since 1750. It is not just the amount, but the rate at which this CO₂ has been added.  The oceans can absorb extra CO₂ but not fast enough to remove all human inputs and so it has been progressively building up in the atmosphere. This extra CO₂ traps more heat than would otherwise escape out into space. More energy is therefore entering the climate system than leaving it.  Over decades and centuries the climate will move back into balance with the same amount of energy leaving as entering. But this will be at a higher temperature with among other things less ice, higher sea levels, more heatwaves, and more floods. The last time the Earth’s climate experienced such an energy imbalance was the Eemian interglacial period some 115,000 years ago. At that time global sea levels were six to nine metres higher than today.  The Hansen team argues that even maintaining the current energy imbalance risks locking in several metres of sea level rise. That is because slow processes such as melting ice sheets still haven’t “caught up”. The longer the climate is held out of balance, the greater their effect will be. One argument against making drastic cuts to greenhouse gas emissions is that it will harm economies as our industries are still largely fossil fuelled. Responding to climate change needs to balance the desire to continue to grow economies today with avoiding disastrous climate change or prohibitively expensive remedies tomorrow.   Whatever assumptions you make about economic growth, or however much you discount future costs, it’s unimaginable that US$535 trillion could be afforded. While these costs will be spread over 80 years, this will also be a period in which the global population will increase from seven billion to perhaps 11 billion and beyond. Humanity will need to grow enough crops to feed these billions while fuelling BECCS schemes at a time when climate change will already be impacting food production. There are also no guarantees that BECCS or any other negative emission technologies will actually work. If they fail then large amounts of CO₂ could be released very rapidly with disastrous consequences. By delaying significant carbon emission reductions we risk handing both an impossible financial and technological burden to future generations. Our children and grandchildren may be unable to understand how we negotiated such an arrangement on their behalf."
"Angus Taylor has scheduled a discussion with state and territory energy ministers about the planned overhaul of the Morrison government’s emissions reduction fund, a move following the government’s decision to quietly appoint an expert panel to come up with new ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions. According to the draft agenda for Friday’s Coag energy council meeting, obtained by Guardian Australia, the commonwealth has scheduled a discussion about the $2.55bn ERF, now rebadged the Climate Solutions Fund, at the long delayed meeting of federal and state energy ministers. Ahead of Friday’s meeting, the first in nearly 12 months, Taylor has signalled he wants to pursue a series of deals with the states to roll out new generation and transmission – an approach that has followed the Morrison government’s decision to ditch the national energy guarantee (Neg). The Neg was a casualty of the federal Liberal party’s leadership eruption last August. The Coalition initially faced pressure from some of the Liberal state governments, including New South Wales, to revive the Neg, which was supported by most stakeholders in the energy sector. But with Canberra refusing to reboot the Turnbull-era policy mechanism that combined reliability standards and emissions reduction for electricity, the states have in more recent times pursued a plan B, giving Canberra specific wish lists of projects they want assistance with. Taylor has not ruled out the side deals including direct assistance for emissions reduction in the states, and the Morrison government has been quietly pursuing an overhaul of the ERF, appointing a panel of four business leaders and policy experts to suggest options to expand it. The conversation at the Coag meeting on Friday is expected to seek state and territory buy-in for the planned overhaul of the fund, which has been heavily criticised for failing to deliver substantial emissions reduction from the industrial sectors of the economy. It is likely the states will want cash from the fund to drive abatement in their jurisdictions. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A discussion paper flagging the ERF overhaul, first reported by Footprint, says the fund has been successful in generating carbon offsets from native vegetation and landfill projects, largely because they cost relatively little and do not require businesses to make substantial operational changes. But it says the scheme has done little to cut emissions through energy efficiency projects and from industry, agriculture and transport, in part due to high upfront and transaction costs. The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction, rewarding landowners and businesses that make cheap, viable bids for taxpayers’ support to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The paper says the government is looking at ways to attract more participants from industry and agricultural businesses. Stakeholders report there is a diversity of views within the reviewing panel, headed by Grant King, the outgoing president of the Business Council of Australia and a former chief executive of Origin Energy, about how to refashion the scheme, and the process is operating on a tight timeframe. Ahead of Friday’s meeting, Victoria has asked the Morrison government to fast-track work on the KerangLink – a transmission line increasing power transfer capability between the Snowy area and Melbourne. The request from Victoria follows a similar pitch from the NSW government, which has asked Canberra to underwrite new generation to replace the Liddell power station, and either underwrite or de-risk new investments in transmission that have been highlighted as urgent by the Australian Energy Market Operator. The side deal with NSW is understood to be close to sign-off. South Australia has not telegraphed its wishlist publicly, but says it will pursue options for expanding the state’s abundant renewable energy resources in ways that deliver more affordable and reliable power to consumers. But the ACT has expressed alarm about the current trajectory. The ACT’s energy minister, Shane Rattenbury, says the Morrison government should be implementing a coherent national plan to secure Australia’s energy future rather than cutting a series of deals with states it regards as friendly. Rattenbury has also expressed concern that ministers at Friday’s meeting of the Coag energy council will be herded into a decision about hydrogen that will be “a backdoor means of propping up the coal sector”. Friday’s agenda includes a briefing from the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, on the national hydrogen strategy and governance. Victoria has also sought and scheduled a discussion about a review of the reliability standard, which Taylor supports."
"In a remote corner of far-western Brazil lies the Vale do Javari, home to one of the greatest concentrations of isolated or entirely “uncontacted” tribes in the Amazon. Unlike indigenous lands elsewhere in the country, which have been colonised and polluted, the Javari’s very inaccessibility has kept it largely untouched. But the people who live there remain extremely vulnerable. Recently, illegal gold miners in the region were alleged to have boasted of a brutal mass murder of ten members of an uncontacted tribe.  The allegations emerged a decade after the UN General Assembly adopted its Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) on September 13, 2007. The declaration was a result of decades of tireless campaigning by indigenous activists across the world, yet ongoing horror stories of abuses deep in the Amazon show how far countries like Brazil still have to go. The UNDRIP affirms indigenous people, as a collective or as individuals, must enjoy the same human rights as everyone else. It also says they must give “free, prior and informed consent” regarding the use of traditionally held land or resources. A vast majority of states voted in favour of the declaration, with just 11 abstentions and four votes against (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US), and it today remains the most comprehensive international instrument on the rights and status of indigenous people. In the decade since UNDRIP was adopted all four of the initially opposed states have now expressed their support, as have two of the abstainers, Colombia and Samoa. Indigenous groups have used it as a framework to successfully challenge their treatment by states and even corporations. Activists themselves speak of another unanticipated outcome of the UNDRIP negotiation process: the growth of a well-connected global indigenous movement. Yet, as with all UN declarations, UNDRIP is non-binding. And this inevitably means big delays in transforming international standards into local laws – never mind actually enforcing those laws. Brazil is a good example. The country’s constitution, written following its transition from dictatorship to democracy in the 1980s, gave indigenous people various legal and political rights. Brazil also signed UNDRIP and the earlier International Labour Organisation Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, which demands respect for the culture, spirituality, social and economic organisation of these groups. But the state is still repeatedly accused of mistreatment and human rights abuses, particularly in relation to land. In 2016, the UN’s special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples went to Brazil and found “a disturbing absence of progress” and, in some areas, “a worrying regression”. Although the government has rejected these particular observations the recent alleged massacre would indicate that much more needs to be done to protect, respect and empower indigenous Amazonians. The Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI), the government body tasked with monitoring and protecting indigenous groups, has an unusual history. Created in 1973 as a predecessor to the discredited Indian Protection Service, the foundation’s original aim was to assimilate indigenous communities into the Brazilian mainstream so that the resources of the Amazon region could be more effectively harnessed for economic growth by the military regime. But after staff witnessed the death and dispossession associated with the vast trans-Amazonian highway project, its objectives were altered to reflect a growing concern with protection and preservation rather than assimilation.  Today, FUNAI’s role includes safeguarding remote indigenous territory from would-be farmers and miners. Groups under its jurisdiction include more than 100 uncontacted tribes who, as Survival International point out, are among the most vulnerable peoples on the planet. Their protection poses a very particular set of challenges. A brutal history of disease and violence shows that leaving them alone is necessary for their very survival, yet their unique isolation also means they can’t participate in the political system or access any means of judicial redress.  However, in the face of soaring public debt, the Brazilian government slashed FUNAI’s budget in 2016, forcing it to shut down many of its regional offices. The cuts have been overseen by conservative president Michel Temer, who currently holds a mere 5% approval rating, and they have been hastened by the presence of a dominant right-wing voice in congress. Both president and congress stand accused of pandering to the interests of a wealthy agri-business lobby that is committed to dismantling FUNAI together with an array of environmental protections that limit agricultural and extractive activities in the Amazon. With Brazil’s main opposition, the Partido dos Trabalhadores (Worker’s Party) still mired in an epic corruption crisis, a heavier burden falls on federal prosecutors and civil society to ensure the state honours both its legal and moral obligations in the area of indigenous peoples’ rights. Although the past year has seen a notable rise in domestic mobilisation by indigenous activists, it is not clear how effective this has been: recent protests in Brasilia over land reforms were met with rubber bullets and government inaction. As the alleged massacre in the Vale do Javari shows, Brazil’s uncontacted tribes may be protected by a UN declaration in theory, but in practice they remain very vulnerable."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRainer Hoffmann of the German language Klimamanifest has produced a short clip on the 2°C target we keep hearing about.
According to activists the globe mustn’t be allowed to warm up more than 2°C over its 1900 level, otherwise it will tip into an irreversible and unstoppable spiral to climate catastrophe that will lead to “the end of civilization as we know it”.
Many of us have been misled to believe that the 2°C was established by leading climate scientists and even made to “international law” that now has to be strictly adhered to, and that CO2 emissions must start falling by 2020. Prof Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber (0:18 mark), Director of the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, for example, claimed on German public television on July 3, 2011, that the 2°C target indeed was “international law” and that CO2 emissions needed to start falling by 2020 if humanity was to have any chance of reaching the 2°C target.

But these are two patented alarmist falsehoods. Don’t take it from me, but from the climate scientists themselves.
On December 3, 2014, Schellnhuber admitted that the 2°C target was not international law (0:53) and then postponed the year CO2 emissions would have to start dropping by an entire decade, to 2030. Suddenly we got goalposts that were not international law and had been moved out another 10 years.
2°C target is purely political
On the question of: Is the theoretical 2°C target a scientific one? The answer to that question is also a definite “no”.

On February 2, 2010, Prof. Dr. Christian Schönwiese (1:27) told FAZ journalist Christian Bartsch on German public television:
They formulated a 2°C target. It is not from a climate scientist, or a physicist, or a chemist, but from an outside person who simply plucked it out of thin air and said ‘2°C'”
Bartsch asks Schönwiese rhetorically:
“So it’s no scientific target?”
Schönwiese acknowledges: “Right.”
At the 2:03 mark of the video, Prof. Hans von Storch in a speech he made in January, 2011 confirmed Schönwiese:
We are in a time where scientists and politicians claim, or at least suggest, the science, in the form of the IPCC, or the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU), has shown that the 2°C target is scientifically mandatory, and is thus no longer a political question that has to be negotiated by society, but rather a target that policymakers only must execute – quasi an order. However the IPCC has never in any way presented the 2°C target as mandatory. Rather this was done by a few scientists, or shall I say: politicians disguised as scientists.”

"Donald Trump has done many things to tarnish America’s reputation, but his decision to walk away from the Paris Agreement is probably the most internationally symbolic and damaging. That a US president can put climate change denial at the centre of his climate and energy policy is truly unprecedented, and it is difficult to remember an administration that has been so intent on undermining the intellectual and scientific findings on global warming. Fighting back against Trump’s climate folly seems to be an uphill task. Even the impending publication of the Climate Science Special Report, drafted by scientists from 13 federal agencies, is unlikely to do much. The final report is expected to warn of the dangers of climate change, but it will most likely be surreptitiously sidelined.  One of the reasons behind Trump’s bullish attitude might be to do with public opinion in the US. In a poll carried out by Yale University in 2016, 70% of Americans said they believed in global warming and 58% believed that it will harm Americans. However, only 40% believe that it will actually impact them individually. Furthermore, just 24% said they heard about global warming in the media every week. In a poll conducted by the Pew Research Centre this year, 76% said terrorism should be a top priority for the administration. Only 38% mentioned global warming. The polls suggest that Americans might be concerned about global warming and want more to be done about it. But they are more likely to be worried about, say, Kim Jong-un than climate change. It appears that confronting Trump – or any other climate denier – on the basis of facts simply won’t work. The challenge should perhaps be to first rally public opinion until there is an overwhelming consensus that serious and urgent action is needed. One practical short-term solution might be to shift the public discourse from “climate change” to “pollution”. Focusing on pollution has three advantages that may mean it moves public opinion better than global warming. First, pollution is tangible. The fact that glaciers are melting might be alarming but it is not something that most of us experience in everyday life. And why would a rise in temperature matter as much to someone living in Sacramento, California, where it is already hot and where one can find shelter in air conditioned buildings?  Pollution, however, can be experienced on a daily basis and causes nuisances of all sorts. The same Sacramento resident who is indifferent to global warming might be concerned with the pollution in their local urban river parkway, for instance. In addition, reports claiming that there are millions of annual deaths from air pollution have a different, more personal ring from those making the more abstract claim that “global temperatures” are rising fast. Americans also seem to be more concerned about the environment than global warming. In the same opinion poll carried out by Pew, 55% of Americans saw “the environment” as a priority, a similar score to crime or poverty (and comfortably ahead of the military, immigration or “global warming”). They seem to be more worried about the quality of air and water where they live rather than losing sleep over a global climate phenomenon.  What might also be encouraging is a poll carried out by the Center for American Progress this year which showed around two-thirds of those who voted for Trump opposed the idea of privatising or selling off America’s national forests and public lands. Whether this is a strong enough basis for there to be a rallying of the public is difficult to know. Nevertheless, focusing on the local environment is a good start. A focus on pollution might also actually open up the debate on the environment and encourage some kind of grassroot reaction. Too often the discourse on the environment and global warming has been dominated by scientific experts and politicians. As such, the public might believe that this is a matter of scientific debate that somehow they cannot participate in, without some prior knowledge. After all, what can you, personally, contribute to a debate on carbon dioxide parts-per-million, or melting glaciers? Would you even know either was a problem if scientists hadn’t warned us? By contrast, feeling the effects of environmental pollution does not require expert knowledge. The public can express remedial actions and suggestions, without having to pretend that they understand atmospheric science. Moreover, actions are more likely to be taken on a local level if the focus is on local pollution. The public should be scientists’ first ally in this battle. Any language and issues that engage people against Trump’s climate folly in whatever way should be the priority for scientists and policy makers seeking to address the problem."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman public radio Deutschlandfunk (DLF) reported earlier this year that scientists have discovered that twice as much snow has been falling in the Ural Mountains than 100 years ago.

Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne here.
The DLF reports:
Ural: snow causing the tree line to rise.
Climate change does not only mean that the temperature is increasing, it can also change the precipitation patterns. In the Ural Mountains of Russia significantly more snow is falling in the wintertime than 100 years ago. The development is having surprising consequences: The bigger amounts of snow is causing the tree line to rise. […]
In the summertime in the Urals its has not gotten notably warmer over the past 100 years. The wintertime temperatures, however, have increased from minus 18°C to minus 16°C. Warmer low pressure systems are bringing more precipitation to the mountains. In the Urals today twice as much snow is falling than 100 years ago. And that is having an impact on the treeline.”
According to the DLF, a team of German and Russian scientists say the tree line is currently rising at a rate of about 4 to 6 meters per decade.
The scientists believe that the doubled snowfall serves to protect young saplings during the winter and allow soil conditions that foster growth during the summer time. Photos of the region has allowed the scientists to determine treelines that today are up to 60 meters higher than 100 years ago.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe last couple of days I posted on an 8.5 year side-by-side test conducted by German veteran meteorologist Klaus Hager, see here and here. The test compared traditional glass mercury thermometer measurement stations to the new electronic measurement system, whose implementation began at Germany’s approximately 2000 surface stations in 1985 and concluded around 2000.
Hager’s test results showed that on average the new electronic measurement system produced warmer temperature readings: a whopping mean of 0.93°C warmer. The question is: Is this detectable in Germany’s temperature dataset? Do we see a temperature jump during the time the new “warmer” system was put into operation (1985 – 2000)? The answer is: absolutely!
1900 to 1985: almost no warming
Josef Kowatsch, an independent scientist and regular contributor at EIKE, has looked at the German temperature dataset and discovers that Germany’s mean temperature indeed coincidentally jumped by a similar 0.9°C during the same period. First he sent me a chart depicting Germany’s annual mean temperature from 1900 to 1985, measured using the old glass mercury thermometers:

For 85 years the trend was pretty much consistent, hovering at about 8.2 or 8.3°C. As indicated by the bold black line, there was an increase from 1900 to 1935, followed by a slight decrease from 1935 to 1985, i.e. in a time when CO2 emissions were rising strongly worldwide.
1986 – 2000: massive warming
Next Josef sent me a second chart depicting Germany’s mean temperature trend while the country was transitioning over to the new electronic measuring system, described here, from 1986 to 2000:

Here we see the trend for the period rising strongly, from about 8.4°C to 9.3°C, i.e. precisely during the instrumentation transition period! This too happens to be a rise of 0.9°C, which coincides precisely with the results of the side-by-side temperature measurement test Hager conducted over 8.5 years comparing mercury thermometers to electronic ones. That could be a sheer coincidence, but on the other hand it is screaming to be investigated.
2000 to present: no warming

Next Kowatsch provided a chart showing Germany’s mean annual temperature for period 0f 2000 to present, i.e. the period that has been using the new electronic measurement system:

Here we see there is no longer any rising trend, but that the mean temperature is at a new, higher plateau. As a result, almost the entire mean annual temperature rise Germany has seen since 1900 occurred during the single short 1986-2000 period. Josef Kowatsch commented (by e-mail):
In these 15 years, did CO2’s greenhouse gas effect suddenly go into action? Who switched on the CO2 greenhouse gas effect for these 15 years?”
Moreover, didn’t Germany’s national DWD Weather Service check and calibrate the new electronic system to be sure it would produce results similar to the earlier used mercury thermometers and thus ensure the recording of reliable data? Hager says they never did, and it seems they were quite content to adopt the warmer readings.
The following chart is a plot of Germany’s mean annual temperature over the entire 1900 to present period:

Chart adapted from here.
To me this all appears to have all the elements of an epic instrumentation debacle that is as bad and sloppy as any could get. Again, I repeat: Hager writes that the DWD never conducted any systematic comparison tests in order to be sure the new electronic ones were producing reliable daily data.
If this is really the case, then we can be happy that the DWD is not in the business of calibrating altimetry systems for commercial jets.
Of course the 1986 – 2000 rise likely is not solely an artifact of poor instrumentation calibration, as part of the warming is surely due to the natural ocean cycles which pushed global temperatures up during the end of the 20th century. However, the results of Hager’s comparison test are difficult to ignore and raise lots of questions.

"Scott Morrison has argued there is no direct link between Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and the severity of fires ravaging the continent, even suggesting Australia could increase its emissions without making the current fire season worse. Under pressure due to a record season of early bushfires and the accusation by a coalition of former fire chiefs that the government has avoided the issue of climate change, Morrison said on Thursday there was no “credible scientific evidence” that cutting Australia’s emissions could reduce the severity of bushfires.  On Thursday Morrison defended the government’s handling of the bushfire season, telling ABC’s AM it had put additional resources into emergency services and praising the “outstanding” response and coordination of state governments. Morrison said he “took issue” with the suggestion by Greg Mullins, the former chief of NSW Fire and Rescue, and 23 other fire chiefs that the government was not adequately prepared. Explaining why he didn’t meet Mullins, Morrison said the government already had the same advice about the impact of climate change from “existing fire chiefs doing the existing job”. At first, Morrison appeared to accept that climate change was affecting the severity and frequency of bushfires. “These are things that are very well known to the government – the contribution of these issues to global weather conditions and to conditions here in Australia are known and acknowledged,” he said. “In February I acknowledged the contribution of those factors to what was happening in Australia – amongst many other issues.” Morrison then said “the suggestion that any way shape or form that Australia, accountable for 1.3% of the world’s emissions, that the individual actions of Australia are impacting directly on specific fire events, whether it’s here or anywhere else in the world, that doesn’t bear up to credible scientific evidence either”. “Climate change is a global phenomenon and we’re doing our bit as part of the response to climate change – we’re taking action on climate change,” he said. “But I think to suggest that at just 1.3% of emissions, that Australia doing something more or less would change the fire outcome this season – I don’t think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all.” The comments follow a controversy in September when the minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, David Littleproud, said he doesn’t “know if climate change is manmade”, before a total about-face. The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Australia’s response to climate change has been ranked one of the worst in the G20, with rising greenhouse gas emissions since the Abbott government abolished the carbon price in 2014. Australia’s target of 26%-28% emissions reduction by 2030 will require it to cut emissions by 695m tonnes cumulatively across the next decade. The Morrison government said more than half of that cut, 367m tonnes, would come from carryover credits from overperformance of earlier targets and not from practical emissions reduction. The centrepiece of federal climate policy is the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, now rebadged as the climate solutions fund, a reverse auction processes that pays landowners and businesses to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The government has been quietly pursuing an overhaul of the emissions reduction fund, appointing a panel of four business leaders and policy experts to suggest options to expand it, and will consider the issue with the states at a meeting of energy ministers on Friday. On Thursday Morrison refused to give further details of his proposed crackdown on environmental protests and secondary boycotts, saying the government would make announcements when it had “finalised those arrangements”. The attorney general, Christian Porter, has suggested measures could include extending the prohibition on secondary boycotts to environmental campaigns, and a crackdown on environmental litigation and use of litigation funders for class actions against mining companies. In a speech to the Business Council on Wednesday, Morrison flagged an overhaul of environmental approvals for major projects to reduce the length of time it takes for businesses to navigate environmental approvals."
"For years, optimists have talked up carbon capture and storage (CCS) as an essential part of taking emissions out of electricity generation. Yes, build wind and solar farms, they have said, but they can’t be relied on to produce enough power all the time. So we’ll still need our fleet of fossil-fuel-burning power stations; we just need to stop them pumping carbon dioxide (CO₂) into the atmosphere.  Most of their emphasis has been on post-combustion capture. This involves removing CO₂ from power station flue gases by absorbing them into an aqueous solution containing chemicals known as amines.  You then extract the CO₂, compress it into a liquid and pump it into a storage facility – the vision in the UK being to use depleted offshore oil and gas fields. One of the big attractions with such a system is it could be retrofitted to existing power stations.  But ten years after the UK government first announced a £1 billion competition to design CCS, we’re not much further forward. The reason is summed up by the geologist Lord Oxburgh in his contribution to the government-commissioned report on CCS published last year: There is no serious commercial incentive and it will stay that way unless the state demonstrates there is a business there.  The problem is that the process is costly and energy intensive. For a gas-fired power station, you typically have to burn 16% more gas to provide the capture power. Not only this, you end up with a 16% increase in emissions of other serious air pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Concerns have also been expressed about the potential health effects of the amine solvent used in the carbon capture.  You then have to contend with the extra emissions from processing and transporting 16% more gas. And all this before you factor in the pipeline costs of the CO₂ storage and the uncertainties around whether it might escape once you’ve got it in the ground. Around the world, the only places CCS looks viable are where there are heavy state subsidies or substantial additional revenue streams, such as from enhanced oil recovery from oilfields where the CO₂ is being pumped in.  Well, say the carbon capture advocates, maybe another technology is the answer. They point to oxy-combustion, a system which is close to reaching fruition at a plant in Texas.  First proposed many years ago by British engineer Rodney Allam, this involves separating oxygen from air, burning the oxygen with the fossil fuel, and using the combustion products – water and CO₂ – to drive a high-pressure turbine and produce electricity. The hot CO₂ is pressurised and recycled back into the burners, which improves thermal efficiency. It has the additional advantage that CO₂ is also available at pressures suitable for pipeline transportation.  It is, according to some enthusiasts, the “holy grail” of CCS. Admittedly it looks promising, but I wouldn’t go that far. It’s not suitable for retrofitting existing power stations. With many existing stations viable for several decades, this will do little for immediate emissions. And you are still obtaining and moving fossil fuels in large quantities, with the resultant emissions along the way. Finally, my experience would indicate that there is always  very significant cost growth with new technology scaled up to industry.  One UK post-combustion CCS project that was cancelled earlier this year was the joint-venture between SSE and Shell at the Peterhead gas-fired ation in northeast Scotland. It aimed to capture 10m tonnes of CO₂ over a 10-year period and store it 2km under the North Sea.  Let’s put this saving into context. The diagram below summarises the amount of power produced and used in the UK. It shows that the country uses 108 terawatt hours (TWhrs) of domestic electricity per annum.    UK electricity generation/consumption Of this domestic usage, 16% goes to cooking. Boiling kettles makes up 34% – that’s 5.9TWhrs per annum, the equivalent of a 670MW power station. Domestic kettle use is particularly inefficient as we regularly overfill our kettles. We could save at least half the energy if we boiled only what we need to make tea and coffee.  That would negate the need for 335MW of power. Now compare that to what CCS would have saved from Peterhead – 85% of a 400MW gas turbine, or 340MW. Simply by not overfilling our kettles, we could remove about the same amount of CO₂. Unlike CCS, let alone oxy-combustion, we could do this immediately, for free, and cut our electricity bills and remove various air pollutants at the same time.  Of course, being kettle smart will only deliver a fraction of the UK’s required carbon reduction goals. It’s only about 3TWhrs out of the approximately 170TWhrs produced by gas-fired power in the UK each year. But it hopefully illustrates why energy efficiency is a much smarter way of reducing carbon and other harmful air emissions than CCS.  If we took the same approach to lighting, computer monitors, TVs on stand-by, running water and everything else, it becomes a very different proposition. If we could achieve the aim of a carbon-neutral house, we could shut down half the UK’s existing gas-fired power stations. And if industry and other non-domestic consumers made energy savings of the order of 20%, that would bring down the gas-fired power requirement by a corresponding percentage.  Is 20% realistic? As a chemical engineer with a 40-year industrial career, I am confident it is. Key areas to be considered would be pump and compressor efficiency, energy use in separation processes, combined heat and power, furnace fuel management, green concrete and energy integration. Together with the government giving greater priority to renewable energy like offshore wind and solar, you have a viable plan for delivering the UK’s carbon goals. CCS may still have its place, but as a means of removing carbon emissions from burning things like wood and rubbish as opposed to fossil fuels. Suffice to say it looks more promising on that front.  But in short, it is time for governments to stop wasting time and money on technologies like CCS that aren’t working. They need to finally get serious about leading a major drive for energy efficiency instead."
"Just after calling the general election, Boris Johnson’s government made two almost simultaneous policy announcements that encapsulated the longstanding contradictions of environmental policy over the past decade. His decision to announce a moratorium on fracking – which, as the Labour party pointed out, was a temporary commitment rather than a ban – made headlines and was heralded as a signal of green intentions, but the go-ahead for a new deep coalmine in Cumbria was slipped out to little fanfare.  The conflicting signals were in keeping with a decade of environmental policy under the Conservative-led coalition and two Tory governments, during which U-turns and flip-flops have cheered and infuriated campaigners and green businesses alike. A 25-year environment plan and a target for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 have been highlights since the last general election, but the policies needed to implement them remain mired in confusion. “[There has been] a disjunction between the government’s willingness to say the right things, and even to put them into legally binding targets, and their unwillingness to make the tough choices we need to achieve them,” said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK. “The 2050 net zero target, while not as soon as we would like, is a real achievement. [But] it is still accompanied by road-building, new licences for oil drilling, a third runway at Heathrow and stubborn opposition to onshore wind and solar.” Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group of green businesses, said: “The story of the last 10 years is also that of a missed opportunity to cut emissions in key areas such as buildings and transport. We have seen incredibly slow progress.” Planning rules for onshore windfarms were changed and subsidies drastically scaled back from 2018, since when scarcely any new onshore windfarms have been built. Meanwhile, solar installations – vaunted under the coalition – have plummeted after incentives for households were taken away. A nine-year freeze on fuel duty, at a cost of £9bn a year to the Treasury, has buoyed fossil fuels and contributed to a 3% rise in transport emissions in the last five years. There have been similar reversals in housing, one of the biggest sources of emissions. As chancellor, George Osborne scrapped the zero carbon homes standard on the eve of its planned introduction in 2016. The number of existing homes fitted with new insulation had collapsed by early 2016 and has never recovered, after the government ended home insulation programmes. While ministers talked up the prospects of electric vehicles to tackle the climate emergency and the air pollution that contributes to 40,000 premature deaths a year, tax breaks that encouraged their purchase were scrapped last year. In June, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said sales of the cars had plunged by nearly 12% year on year. Before the government promised under Theresa May to phase out diesel cars in 2040, it fought a bitter campaign in the courts to avoid having to meet clean air requirements. There has also been confusion over the planned expansion of Heathrow: Boris Johnson promised to “lie in front of the bulldozers”, while Theresa May’s cabinet backed the developers.  These mixed signals across a wide variety of areas have produced mixed results. While greenhouse gas emissions from energy generation have fallen, largely owing to the long-term shift away from coal, carbon from transport has grown. There has also been an impact on jobs, with a drop of nearly a third in the number of renewable energy jobs, according to the union Prospect, and job losses in home energy efficiency. Mike Clancy, Prospect’s general secretary, said: “The last decade has been a masterclass in overpromising and underdelivering on environmental policy. This election needs to be a wake-up call that the climate emergency needs a serious rethink on austerity.” Policies for the natural environment and animal welfare also hang in the balance. While the government recently promised small-scale animal welfare improvements such as banning primates as pets and microchipping cats, a new influx of Tory MPs could result in a challenge to the hunting ban, and the party still firmly supports the controversial badger cull. Farmers, usually reliably Conservative in their voting patterns across most of England, have been promised taxpayer funding to reduce emissions and air pollution and preserve wildlife, but the agriculture and environment bills that would enable these policies have been left in limbo. The UK will next year host the most important climate conference since the signing of the 2015 Paris agreement. That will mean unprecedented scrutiny for the new government’s plans, and an opportunity to bring coherence to what has often been a piecemeal approach to environmental policy – and to prove that the UK’s environmental commitments will be upheld after Brexit. “Over the last 10 years we’ve seen a few steps forward for the environment, but the scales are heavily tipped towards policies which spell disaster for people and the planet,” said Dave Timms, head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth. “We’re living in a climate and ecological emergency. Tough regulation and massive investment in the right places are what we urgently need.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Northeast USA is being socked by frightful cold and massive snow. The brutal New England winters are back and now we are witnessing last ditch efforts by disgraced climate scientists to blame the brutally cold winters on a warming planet (which in reality has not warmed in 18 years).
At his latest Saturday Summary at WeatherBell Analytics, chief meteorologist Joe Bastardi delivers a stinging critique of Michael Mann’s recent claims: “Sea surface temperatures off the coast of New England right now are at record levels, 11.5C (21F) warmer than normal in some locations.” Mann also claimed there’s two times more moisture in this warm air, and thus is responsible for the turbocharged snowy icebox winter Boston has been experiencing.
At his Saturday Summary Joe thoroughly demolishes these claims.
Falsehood 1: It’s 11.5°C warmer than normal “off Cape Cod”
Joe calls Mann’s assertions a mistake, and shows that the area of warm sea surface water “off the coast of Cape Cod” is in fact way off the coast. At the 2:25 mark Joe shows how the waters along the eastern seaboard “are close to normal” and that a small patch of 3°C above normal water is some 1000 kilometers off the coast, and that a larger patch of 5°C above normal water is in fact 2000 kilometers off the coast (see following figure):

Dr. Mann’s warm water is in fact 2000 kilometers “off the coast”. Cropped from WeatherBELL.
Joe tells his viewers, and Dr. Mann, at the 3.00 mark:
There’s no way that that moisture is getting fed back into New England.”
Climatologists need to learn how to read a weather chart
So why would a climatologist like Mann make such an absurd claim? Joe tells us that a climatologist making a statement does not understand how the weather works, and advises them to first learn how to read a weather chart (2:15) before making such statements.
Falsehood 2: Heavy snow due to warm sea surfaces
The real reason it snowed so much over New England, Joe explains, is because of the “tremendous horizontal temperature gradient” in the area where extremely cold Arctic air clashes with normal temperature maritime air (3:30). It’s the cold, stupid!

At 5:27 Joe explains:
Where this storm was embedded, it’s cooler. You cannot use the argument that we use for warm eddies, and hurricanes where we see some blow up over the warm eddy. You can’t use that with these.”
Falsehood 3: Two times higher water vapor in the air
At the 5:45 mark the veteran Penn State graduate meteorologist shows the water vapor situation in the region where the storm developed:
During this time of the snow blitz over New England, the mixing ratios, which is the water vapor, is below normal! It’s below normal! It’s not above normal! In the area that we’re targeting, this period that we’re looking at, that had all this snow, is below normal.”
Snow (surprise!) is due to cold
The reason why water vapor is so low is “because it’s so darn cold”. The heavy snowfalls are related to the extreme cold, and not the unrelated warm patch 2000 kilometers “off Cape Cod” (6:10).
At the 7:47 mark Joe summarizes on warmist climatolgists’ claims:
If they’d looked at this, they would have seen how bogus their argument is. There is nothing above normal in that area. What happened was that it was so darn cold that it creates a very strong horizontal temperature gradient. […] It’s not because it’s so much warmer and humid off the eastern seaboard; it’s the exact opposite reason in this particular case. […] It’s because it’s cold.”
At the 9:30 mark Joe shows a chart of the AMO which that he says “has major implications“. The AMO has dipped sharply downwards, and although the current PDO is warm, it will turn colder within a couple of years. Implication: don’t expect global warming anytime soon.
Also Joe explains how cold winters across the United States are predominantly dependent on the ENSO. In years of El Nino spikes, US winters do greatly tend to be colder.
In summary this year’s brutal New England winter has nothing to do with the bogus, made-up explanations being served up by climatologists who are desperate to salvage their disgraced science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe keep hearing that the climate and weather forecasting tools are gaining in sophistication, and correspondingly in reliability. Climate model simulators claim to be able to see decades, even centuries, into the future!
Yet Spiegel Science journalist Axel Bojanowski has an analysis here which looks at the recent spate of failed El Niño predictions by the NOAA, and shows that these forecasting tools are still terribly lacking. His latest piece: “Change in global weather: El Niño embarrasses meteorologists“. (Here I’m not sure why Bojanowski (or his editors) chose the term ‘meteorologists’ because much of the work is arguably done by climate scientists.)
It is an accepted fact that the El Niño cyclic changes in the equatorial Pacific surface temperatures have major impacts on the global weather, especially the northern hemisphere. Thus it would be useful if scientists were able to predict them with some degree of rough accuracy.
Unfortunately accuracy is still a long way off as forecasters falsely predicted an El Niño four years long, and only now has it finally begun to take hold. Bojanowski writes:
Seldom have meteorologists been made to look so foolish. Four years long they published the same prognosis: Soon an El Niño would be taking hold in the Pacific.”
The Spiegel journalist describes how last June experts were “80% sure” a powerful El Niño was in the works, and how in 2013 “a peer-reviewed paper in a well known science journal” boasted of new forecasting methods for El Niños. Sadly, these experts aren’t anywhere near getting it right. So, as a result, Bojanowski writes, they have recently become “considerably more cautious” with their forecasts. Embarrassment does that.

Bojanowski describes how the ENSO’s impact on global weather patterns, wildlife, and even regional sea levels, and how NOAA experts have had to admit the latest El Niño has been an unexpectedly tame one – in stark contradiction to forecasts made earlier. He writes: “The inaccurate forecasts of the past year has forced the scientists to rethink their methods, said NOAA expert Gabriel Vecchi in the journal ‘Nature’.”
Numerous buoys out of order!
Bojnowski also writes that the biggest problem is reliably predicting the weakening of the tradewinds, and says this has become difficult because “numerous buoys have ceased to function over the years” and so are no longer able to measure the changes in sea surface temperature.
That is certainly an interesting revelation presented here by Bojanowski. Still, NOAA El Niño forecasters should not feel too bad about their measurement and forecasting woes because it could be much worse. For example their climate colleagues haven’t gotten their global temperature forecasts right in over 18 years!
And concerning what can be done in place of the “numerous” out-of commission buoys, perhaps the NOAA El Niño scientists could consider using the “filling in the data” method and simply apply the measurements made by the closest functioning buoy (even if it is 1000 kilometers away). After all the global surface temperature scientists seem perfectly satisfied with that particular method. The data-fill-in method would surely allow the NOAA El Nino experts to make forecasts that are just as spectacularly accurate as those of the global warming climate scientists.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Swiss Handelszeitung (Trade News) reports on the world’s second largest reinsurer Swiss Re, and on the losses from natural catastrophes for 2014. Let’s recall that natural catastrophes are supposedly becoming more and more frequent due to the alleged man-made climate worsening from manmade CO2 emissions.
Hat-tip: Kurt
However the Handelszeitung writes that preliminary estimates show that the Swiss reinsurer saw “markedly less damage claims than in previous years” and far less loss of lives. Fortunately this is lots of good news, but the catastrophe-obsessed media are refusing to report it.
Deaths plunge almost 60%!
According to preliminary Swiss Re estimates, total economic losses from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters were USD 113 billion in 2014, down from USD 135 billion in 2013. Out of the total economic losses, insurers covered USD 34 billion in 2014, down 24% from USD 45 billion in 2013.
The 2014 loss amount is way below the annual average of $188 billion dollars for the past 10 years, 1.e. over 41% less.

The Swiss Re press release writes that disaster events have claimed around 11,000 lives this year – down almost a whopping 60% from the 27,000 fatalities in 2013.
“No major hurricane”
The Zurich, Switzerland based reinsurer attributes the reduced damage in part to “the mild hurricane season“. It adds: “No major hurricane made landfall in the US, the ninth year running that this has happened.”
“Very low temperatures and heavy snow”
Moreover, the major losses resulted from cold events. The Swiss Re writes that “2014 started with extreme winter conditions in the US and Japan and, as the year drew to a close, the Northeast US was once again gripped by very low temperatures and heavy snow. The storms in the US at the beginning of 2014 alone caused insured losses of USD 1.7 billion. This is above the average full-year winter storm loss number of USD 1.1 billion of the previous 10 years. In mid-May, a spate of strong storms with large hail stones hit many parts of the US over a five-day period, resulting in insured losses of USD 2.9 billion, the highest of the year.”
Another myth bites the dust.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRoger Lewis of the UK online Spectator presents a highly interesting portrait of environmentalist, doomsday-believer Dylan Evans and his Utopia Experiment. Lewis concludes from it: “Designs for living always end in tears, or worse.”
So disconnected from reality was Evans, and academic, that he believed he could actually make himself a better life departing the comforts of the modern age and getting back to the natural beauty of raw survival with other like-minded persons – in the raw climate of northern Scotland of all places.
Strangely Evans selected a site that he thought would allow the generation of electric power to accompany his natural living.
Some excerpts on how his “Experiment” turned out:
Evans admits that his utopia was doomed to failure. It attracted only idealists and disaffected romantics when what was needed were people with practical skills… […]
…the small group began to disintegrate. One member even started to invent his own religion, building a shrine. […]
He himself was soon fed up with sleeping under rancid fleece blankets  … the sanitary arrangements were grotesque. […]
It soon became apparent that ‘the whole experiment had been a huge mistake’. […]

Evans was eventually detained under the Mental Health Act in a maximum security psychiatric hospital. […]
He fretted unduly about global warming and ‘the looming energy crisis’… Evans, the doctors concluded, was already craving the abyss and in the throes of panic-attacks and a breakdown.”
If the story of Evans tells us anything, it is that it vividly illustrates how far out to lunch academics in the ivory towers can sometimes become. Why on earth would policymakers ever listen to their loony utopian ideas to begin with? Evans just proved that its all lunacy.
Evans and the loads of past academics show that their radical formulae for rendering utopian life are pure delusions of deranged minds. Yet these are precisely the minds behind the doomsday global warming scenarios, and the advocacy of a carbon-free utopia.
The proof that these minds are deranged is the fact that none, except for Evans for a brief time, are willing to give up the carbon life themselves. Man was destined to escape nature, and not to stay at its mercy.
Finally one cannot help but notice the contempt loony academics and pseudo-intellectual journalists hold for humans. Lewis writes;
It’s best to muddle along as we are, not because human beings are morons or suckers, or traitors to the cause, but because life is meant to be messy, muddled, contrary, comic.”
Actually, as Evans clearly illustrates, the real morons are the academics and all the gullible media and policymaker idiots who believe the utopia that they preach. At least there is hope for Lewis as well, who seems to grudgingly concede that maybe the current system isn’t so bad after all and sure beats living in the cold mud.

"The 1987 treaty that stopped the pollution causing a hole in the ozone layer is rightly seen as a major success story. It’s arguably the most successful international environmental agreement ever. It’s true that, 30 years on from the signing of the Montreal Protocol, the Antarctic ozone hole still reappears every year. Yet the protocol really is working and its continued development means that it is doing more good than ever, including helping the fight against climate change. In 1985, scientists made the unexpected discovery that the Earth’s ozone shield, located in the stratosphere about 20km-30km above the surface and essential for life, contained a huge hole over Antarctica. The cause was quickly established to be chemicals, notably chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used as aerosol propellants and refrigerants, which are stable at low altitudes but release ozone-destroying chlorine and bromine when they break down in the upper atmosphere. It took just two years for intensive research, building on work on ozone depletion from the 1970s, to provide enough evidence for politicians representing every country in the UN to take action. They agreed to limit production of CFCs and other related gases. Signed on September 16, 1987, the Montreal Protocol put the brakes on increasing ozone depletion. This prevented the catastrophic scenarios of large, global-scale ozone depletion that would have severely damaged animal and plant life at the surface through large increases in ultraviolet (UV) radiation. For example, skin cancer rates in humans would have increased greatly. Despite the success of the protocol, a large Antarctic ozone hole continues to appear every spring in the southern hemisphere. In fact, the hole continued to grow for almost 20 years after the Montreal Protocol was put in place, with the largest hole recorded in 2006. This is because the process by which the atmosphere can cleanse itself of the stable CFC molecules takes many decades. Even though the emission of these chemicals has now largely stopped, the CFCs already in the atmosphere will carry on releasing their chlorine and bromine for decades to come, as they are slowly broken down by sunlight in the upper atmosphere. As such, the ozone hole will take about three times longer to disappear than it did to appear, eventually closing sometime in the second half of the century. In the meantime, the thinner ozone shield will lead to some increased levels of surface UV and changes to surface winds and temperature, especially in the southern hemisphere. Even over the past ten years, scientists have struggled to detect the first signs of repair. Polar ozone loss is driven by the formation of stratospheric clouds at low temperatures. This means ozone depletion is worse after colder winters because more cloud particles form. So natural variations in the meteorological conditions in the stratosphere – occasionally enhanced by volcanic eruptions that can replicate the role of the clouds – have helped to mask the small recovery trend. Despite this, scientists have finally started to observe the expected increase in ozone. Comparing the current behaviour of the atmosphere with detailed computer models that remove the effect of meteorological variations shows that recovery really has started. As a result, researchers have a high degree of confidence that the Antarctic ozone hole will gradually decrease and return to its 1980 size, when it first became detectable, by about 2050. It is now a question of being vigilant for other unknown factors and checking that the recovery proceeds as expected. The process of protecting the ozone layer didn’t end when the Protocol was signed, and it has continually evolved with periodic amendments to place stronger controls on ozone-depleting gases and to bring new ones into the agreement. Most recently it has been drafted into the fight against man-made climate change. The ozone-depleting gases being controlled by the agreement are also very potent greenhouse gases. Like carbon dioxide, they very efficiently absorb infra-red radiation and so contribute to global warming.  In the latest amendment to the Montreal Protocol, signed in 2016, policy makers agreed to limit the emission of the compounds designed to replace CFCs, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These gases, used for example in air conditioning units, do not lead to ozone depletion but are greenhouse gases. So bringing them under the umbrella of the Montreal Protocol will help reduce future climate change. We all owe a debt of gratitude to the scientists, politicians and industry leaders who created such an effective and flexible agreement which, 30 years on, is doing what it set out to achieve and more."
"News Corp executive chairman Rupert Murdoch has said “there are no climate change deniers around I can assure you” after he was asked at the corporation’s AGM why his company gives them “so much airtime” in Australia. Murdoch was speaking in New York on Wednesday when he received a question from a proxy for Australian activist shareholder Stephen Mayne. Murdoch was asked about the company’s “stance on climate change”. The questioner asked: “What do you believe is the global role of News Corp in the geopolitical climate? If you do believe in climate change, Mr Mayne is interested to hear why News Corp gives climate deniers like Andrew Bolt and Terry McCrann so much airtime in Australia?” Murdoch responded with a promotion of his company’s corporate carbon reduction goals, saying “we have reduced our global carbon footprint by 25% six years ahead of schedule”. Murdoch, 88, who was born in Australia, said News Corp was the first North American media company to commit to “science-based targets to limit climate change” and the company had cut its energy costs by US$18m ($26.5m) since 2014. He also said his company was sourcing its print paper from certified sustainable sources. Murdoch then added: “There are no climate change deniers around I can assure you.” Bolt, a political commentator and blogger for News Corp Australia, is known for promoting the views of climate science deniers, and for his own attacks on “alarmists” and his derision of climate change science. Bolt also has a nightly show on Sky News where he often interviews guests who reject that humans cause climate change. Business writer McCrann is known for attacking the viability of renewable energy in his columns. In an interview on Sky News in early November, McCrann was responding to a question about a statement from 11,000 scientists warning of a climate emergency. McCrann said: “I am sceptical of that word ‘scientist’. I think if you substitute ‘loon and hysteric’ then that is getting more accurately to the description of who these people are.” A 2013 study of climate coverage in Australian newspapers found that one-third of coverage was sceptical and pointed to News Corp titles as the dominant factor. At the time, News Corp said: “News Corp and its newspapers do accept the scientific consensus. There is no company edict on the line to take – editorial control rests with the editors.” Murdoch himself has given conflicting messages over time on his view of the science and impacts of climate change. In 2006, Murdoch appeared to shift his views away from scepticism, saying the planet “deserves the benefit of the doubt”. Since then, his views appear to have reverted back. He told Sky News in 2014 that climate change should be treated with “much scepticism.” In 2015, Murdoch tweeted from a flight over the North Atlantic where he spotted sea ice: “Global warming!” Just flying over N Atlantic 300 miles of ice. Global warming! pic.twitter.com/loXwe7lwtK Later that year, Murdoch tweeted that a United Nations climate meeting would spark “endless alarmist nonsense”, and said he was a “climate change sceptic not a denier”. A climate change skeptic not a denier. Sept UN meets in NY with endless alarmist nonsense from u know whom! Pessimists always seen as sages In October 2018, Bolt himself described Murdoch as a sceptic, claiming that many mainstream media outlets had stopped quoting Murdoch’s views on the issue since his 2006 statement."
"Global carbon emissions from the aviation industry are growing faster than expected, and pose a serious risk to the world’s climate efforts if left to grow unchecked. The rise of flygskam, or “flight-shame”, has spurred airlines and travel companies to offer customers the option of offsetting the carbon emissions of their flights. But not everyone is convinced that climate sins can be absolved through projects based on simple carbon accounting. Offsetting involves calculating the emissions of a trip or activity and then purchasing “credits” from projects that prevent or remove the equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. Many accredited carbon offsetting schemes involve planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which according to recent research could play a major role in helping to tackle the climate crisis. Other schemes invest in renewable energy projects which save carbon emissions by replacing fossil fuels alternatives. Growing awareness of the climate crisis, and the “Greta Thunberg effect”, has driven demand for carbon offset schemes. The amount of investment from people who hope to “cancel” their carbon footprints has climbed fourfold in recent years, according to the offsetting watchdog Gold Standard. EasyJet’s pledge to fly carbon neutral follows a string of other airlines which hope to encourage passengers to keep flying despite climate concerns. At least 10 other airlines – including Air New Zealand and Air Canada – offer carbon offsetting to their passengers. British Airways said this year that it plans to start offsetting the carbon from all its domestic flights from 2020. For passengers travelling further afield BA offers a carbon calculator and a range of accredited offset schemes to invest in. The schemes include reforestation in the Amazon basin and fitting low-smoke stoves in Sudan. Royal Dutch Shell offers drivers which fill up at its petrol stations in the UK and the Netherlands the chance to “drive carbon neutral” at no extra cost by using carbon credits from conservation projects in Peru, Indonesia, the US and Britain. In short, airlines plan to use carbon offsetting to address the aviation’s expanding carbon footprint while continuing to increase the number of flights they offer every year. The aviation industry plays a growing role in the climate crisis by releasing hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere every year. The global carbon emissions from commercial flights are rising up to 70% faster than predicted, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, because of growing demand for air travel in developed countries. The group said emissions increased by a third between 2013 to 2018, the equivalent of building 50 coal-fired power plants, and may triple by 2050 if left unchecked. If airlines hope to avoid a backlash against the industry while still increasing the number of flights they operate, then offsetting is the quickest answer. Not all airlines have taken up carbon credits. American Airlines, the world’s biggest airline, does not offer an offset scheme. Instead, it has taken “many meaningful steps to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions” such as buying new planes which are more fuel efficient. Green groups are clear that the best way to reduce emissions from the aviation industry is to take fewer flights. Many fear that carbon offsetting may do more harm than good by offering airlines a licence to keep polluting and encouraging travellers to continue to choose the most polluting option. There is also concern among environmentalists that the confusing state of carbon accounting may mean that projects fall short of neutralising the damage caused by air travel in the first place. Greenpeace UK described easyJet’s carbon offset scheme as “jumbo-size greenwash” and warned that expert analysis has cast serious doubts about whether offsetting schemes work at all. Instead, policymakers should put in place a frequent flier levy to curb the number of flights and their climate-wrecking emissions, Greenpeace said. Other groups have urged passengers to view carbon offsets as a last resort which can be used as a positive nudge to donate to green projects – not as a solution to the climate crisis. The early days of voluntary carbon offsetting were relatively unregulated and open to abuse. Today, a flurry of watchdogs have emerged to verify carbon offset schemes and projects which help to make the carbon savings. These include the American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, Plan Vivo and Verra, which offer many hundreds of projects for business and individuals to choose from. Gold Standard offers carbon offsets which help install low-smoke stoves in Rwanda and build wind power projects in Rajasthan, India. C-Level will offset carbon emissions by helping to restore grasslands in Mongolia and reducing deforestation in Tanzania."
"Until the advent of cheap credit and cheaper item costs, for many consumers in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s rental was the most accessible way of obtaining products such as televisions, video recorders and washing machines that were high cost and frequently required repair. Now we buy cheap and pile high or just chuck out when something stops working – even if we could fix it.  The consumption of household goods in Western society is now at its upper limit, so much so that Steve Howard, Ikea’s head of sustainability, said it had reached “peak stuff”. While he was quick to say that this did not contradict Ikea’s target to double sales by 2020, he suggested a break from a prevailing “take, make, use, throw” economic model towards a circular model that encourages repair, reuse and collaborative ventures that share the use of products. At the heart of the circular economy is the sharing economy, in which products and services are leased for a time. It’s about access rather than ownership, and any number of things can be shared, from transport, property and consumer goods (such as tools and kitchen appliances), as well as skills and knowledge.  Participation in the sharing economy lets you use under-utilised assets and even spare time to earn additional income. There have been routes to borrowing items for many years – hiring formal clothing for events, for example, or car sharing schemes that are now commonplace in many cities. And despite more recent funding cuts, public libraries still offer access to books, music and films, while big businesses such as Amazon Kindle, Netflix and Spotify mean there is no need to actually own physical, hard copies of media items. But sharing, borrowing and reusing is now becoming something that businesses are actively engaging in. Take the Riversimple Rasa – a hydrogen fuel cell car that has been designed specifically within a car-share business model.  After an initial failure, SpaceX’s attempts to recover and reuse its Falcon 9 booster met with success, and in 2017 one recovered booster was used to launch a communications satellite. Rival company Blue Origin is also developing its reuseables. It means that in the age of space travel, we may already be taking advantage of cheaper, recycled technology. Back down to Earth, local community schemes have the potential to share expensive and rarely used items and change the way household goods are consumed. Grassroots examples include the Library of Things in London, a community business providing low-cost access to items such as DIY tools, sewing machines, camping and gardening equipment, carpet cleaners, projectors and musical instruments.  While sustainability is at the heart of the project, which resists an own everything, throwaway culture, the library is also a social space with a practical purpose. It reinvents the traditional models of renting, swapping, bartering and gifting, and also offers a place to meet and learn new skills through classes, workshops or one-to-one instruction in cooking, sewing, furniture making and general DIY skills.  This kind of scheme empowers people to use the items they borrow and to do things for themselves. And given that the average electric drill is in use for just 15 minutes each year, and is kept in storage for the rest of the time, it’s clear that many “household” items don’t really need to be owned at all. And sharing or borrowing means a better environmental impact.  The right to ownership and property is deeply rooted in Western culture for reasons from social status to convenience. Nevertheless, increasing the number of items that are leased or rented is feasible – the sharing economy offers financial savings and access to better quality goods in the short term, while reducing people’s personal carbon footprints, and in the case of projects like Library of Things and repair venture, Restart, a greater sense of community and skills sharing. Established businesses may see these enterprises as a threat to their business models. After all, if consumers share or rent things, this might impact on sales. However, it could instead incentivise manufacturers to produce more reliable, durable products which they would retain ownership of and lease to consumers, remaining responsible for maintenance and replacement costs. This would mean further incentives to design and produce longer-lasting, reliable products which could easily be repaired or re-manufactured and passed onto less demanding customers at a lower cost.  Sharing as part of a circular economy promotes better efficiency in materials, which reduces the lifetime carbon emissions of products that are designed and maintained for optimum life spans and used more intensively. It allows for a growth in consumption without the corresponding demand for resources. This is one area that needs addressing if we are to stand a chance of reaching the targets set in the Climate Change Act and meeting commitments under the Paris Agreement."
"Romania’s prime minister, Mihai Tudose, recently raised the prospect of reopening the country’s huge Roșia Montană goldfield. The area had been mined from Roman times until the last state-run operation closed in 2006. An application by a previous government to make the area a UNESCO world heritage site has now been withdrawn, paving the way for new development.  Roșia Montană is nestled in the Carpathian mountains and, with 314 tonnes of gold, has Europe’s largest known deposits. A short-term mining bonanza promises employment for thousands of labourers and hundreds of millions of Romanian Leu in investment in the EU’s fastest-growing economy. But is the boom really worth it? After all, gold mining has historically resulted in long-term, chronic environmental problems. Roșia Montană is big, but the threats posed by acid mine drainage are bigger. The problem is, if completed, the so-called Roșia Montană project would use “cyanide amalgamation” to extract the gold from its ore body. This is the same cyanide used to poison people, fish and elephants. It has a toxic past in Roșia Montană, too: back in the 1970s, a copper mine in the area needed somewhere to store its cyanide-contaminated waste and the nearby village of Geamana was evacuated and flooded. It has been submerged under toxic waters ever since.  Geamana is one of Romania’s greatest ecological disasters, surpassed only in 2000 when a gold mine in Baia Mare in the north of the country spilled an estimated 100 tonnes of cyanide into a river. The latter incident was described as Europe’s worst environmental disaster since Chernobyl. No wonder that when the government first mooted the resumption of mining in 2013, it led to weeks of protests – protests which now threaten to erupt again. Cyanidation was the breakthrough gold mining technology of the 1890s, when it enabled Anglo mining conglomerates to make colossal profits from low grade ores. Simply put: cyanidation involves mixing finely crushed ores (referred to as “sands” or, when water-based, “slimes”) in a weak cyanide solution (usually calcium cyanide). This solution is then mixed in large tanks and the gold separated from its ore body.  The process increases yields of gold but produces immense quantities of highly-toxic waste that releases acid and metals into the environment. Around 90% of all gold extracted worldwide uses this method. The waste from cyanidation is a fine rock solution that is left in open air ponds while the concentration of acid is reduced to legal limits. The risk here is from dam failure or breakages in the lining of waste ponds, which can lead to catastrophic spills or leakage through the porous land surface into the water table.  In nearly all metal mines, and some coal mines, acid drainage occurs because of the oxidation of iron ore found alongside precious mineral deposits. Uncovered by the mining process, the iron reacts with the air and releases sulphuric acid into the water. This process can last centuries. Spills from cyanidation waste are more short-lived, but more highly toxic than acid mine drainage occurring through iron oxidation.  The ratio of waste to metal recovered in gold mining is vastly disproportionate: the Fimiston Super Pit, near the West Australian town of Kalgoorlie, and until recently the largest open cut mine in the world, has returned approximately 1,640 tonnes of gold since operations began there in 1989. But that’s only a small portion of the 15m tonnes of rock extracted per year. On a more personal scale, a single gold wedding ring generates 20 tonnes of waste. Cyanidation poses catastrophic ecological risks because cyanide leaks so easily into groundwater. Historical parallels suggest the Romanian proposal will most likely leave a toxic legacy. In 2015, as the US Environmental Protection Agency attempted to drain polluted water from the Gold King Mine, Colorado, which was closed in 1920, more than 3m gallons were accidentally spilled into the Animas River. The polluted plume turned the entire river a deep mustard yellow. Water acidity levels increased 100-fold, and in some places a thousand times over levels considered safe for wildlife.  The spill only posed no threat to fish in the Animas because ongoing pollution had already killed them. But the plume drained into the San Juan, a larger and cleaner river that flows into the spectacular Glen Canyon and, eventually, the Grand Canyon. There, the pollution threatened rare birds and endangered fish like the Colorado pikeminnow and razorback sucker. EPA chief Scott Pruitt returned to the site at the beginning of August this year vowing to complete the clean-up after the agency had “walked away” from the problem. At a water treatment plant installed on the site, 500 gallons of mercury and arsenic-laced water a minute flow from the Gold King Mine. The clean-up could take a decade and has already cost the EPA US$29m. The EPA has estimated that the cost of cleaning up just 156 mines in the US could be between US$7billion and US$24 billion. Clean-up on most sites will take decades – those with acid drainage will require water treatment in perpetuity. Acid drainage is a little-known global crisis. The UN has even labelled it the second biggest problem facing the world after global warming. In the US, an estimated 22,000km of streams and 180,000 acres of freshwater reservoirs are affected by acid mine drainage. Rivers and lakes in Arizona, Patagonia, Guangdong (China), Ontario, Papua New Guinea, and at Rio Tinto in Spain, to name just a few, have all been polluted by acid mine drainage. In South Africa, the problem is chronic. These threats are prescient. Brazil recently announced a huge reserve in the Amazon rainforest has been earmarked for mining, including gold. In New Zealand, local activists fear the Karangahake Gorge is now under threat after a large, high-quality gold seam was found in the region. Around the Yellowstone National Park, mining companies are positively salivating at the possibility that Obama-era restrictions will be lifted, granting access to 3,000 tonnes of proven in-ground gold reserves. In Peru, marines have been dispatched to wage war against illegal mining on the River Santiago in the northern Amazon, which has done enormous damage to the region’s bio-diversity and placed the livelihoods of 70,000 indigenous Awajúns and Wampís at risk. Multinationals hold out the promise of sustainable development through mining. But without careful forethought we’ll find ourselves dealing with chronic pollution for centuries."

"An estimated 6,000-14,000 tons of sunscreen are deposited into coral reef areas of the sea every year. The chemicals we rub onto our skin might help prevent skin cancer but we’re only just beginning to understand the environmental impact of sunscreen – and the initial assessments are not looking good. But early stage research suggests that nature might provide a solution to this emerging problem if we can mimic the way that some plants and animals protect themselves from the sun. Sunscreen is vital to helping prevent skin damage from ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that can cause melanoma and other skin cancers. They contain a number of ingredients that act as UVR filters, absorbing and scattering the radiation and stopping it from reaching the skin. Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of regular sunscreen use, including long-term studies in Australia that have shown reduced skin cancer rates.. The potential problem is that many ingredients used in sunscreen products are synthetic organic molecules, like those used to make plastics. These molecules are designed to be highly stable and so they don’t break down when they enter the environment. As a result, sunscreen ingredients are detectable in species including fish, sea mammals such as dolphins and even marine dwelling birds. The impact of these molecules on the environment isn’t fully understood but is a growing focus of research. We know that some filters have a similar structure to the hormone oestrogen and mimic can its action. This can cause hormonal changes and even alter the sex characteristics of some fish. UVR filters have also been linked to coral bleaching.  These concerns are being monitored by many regulatory agencies. The European Chemicals Agency has listed eight out of the 16 most commonly used sunscreens in Europe as a potential threat to the environment and health, raising the ultimate possibility of a ban. Fears about damage to coral reef systems has already led to bans of particular sunscreen ingredients in some coral hotspots such as Hawaii. These fears are currently relatively minor – but ways to improve the safety and biocompatibility of sunscreens need to be investigated. As is often the way, the answer may lie within the very environment that is being affected. Many marine species are continuously exposed to high levels of UVR throughout the day and have evolved efficient ways to prevent damage. For example, microorganism species such as cyanobacteria and algae produce a group of compounds called mycosporine-like amino acids (MAA), which act as UVR filters. These are passed up the food chain to animals such as corals, invertebrates and fish, which then store the compounds in tissues exposed to UVR such as the skin, eyes and eggs. MAA efficiently absorb UVR and convert it to harmless light and heat, and aren’t broken down by the radiation.  There is also evidence that these compounds can act as potent antioxidants, another very beneficial property that most synthetic filters don’t have. Solar radiation can cause highly reactive atoms or molecules, known as free radicals, to break away from other bigger molecules. Free radicals can cause what is known as oxidative damage to tissues, but they can be neutralised by antioxidants The potential for these compounds to be applied to human health, particularly as sunscreens, is only just beginning to be explored. They have shown excellent potential in laboratory models. The next step is to translate this to human studies to truly understand their potential. In the meantime, it’s very important for public health that people don’t stop using synthetic sunscreens. So far, there is only limited evidence for the potential ecological harm of sunscreens, especially at the concentrations at which UVR filters are found in the environment. But the effects of UVR on the skin are well known and proven beyond any doubt."
"Jeremy Corbyn has urged the public to vote for his “manifesto of hope” as he unveiled plans for the most dramatic increase in tax and spending in more than half a century if Labour wins power next month’s general election. In an upbeat launch event at Birmingham City University, the Labour leader said he welcomed the hostility of the billionaires, bad bosses and dodgy landlords who would lose out from his policies. Experts were taken aback by the scale of Labour’s spending plans, which dwarfed the substantial increase in the size of the state envisaged in the party’s 2017 manifesto. “See this [2019] manifesto and vote for the person who’s struggling who you don’t even know,” Corbyn urged the public, adding: “How can any government claim it cares about our country when it cares so little about the people who live here?” With Labour still trailing significantly behind the Conservatives in the polls, party strategists hope the manifesto will help to tempt wavering voters. Corbyn said it was “full of popular policies that the political establishment has blocked for a generation”. The slim red volume, titled It’s Time for Real Change, included a number of fresh announcements, in addition to the policies announced earlier in the campaign. Key plans include: Universal free broadband, delivered by part-nationalising BT and paid for with a tax on tech companies. An immediate 5% pay rise for public sector workers, plus above-inflation increases for future years. 100,000 new council houses a year by the end of the parliament. 1 million new jobs as part of a “green industrial revolution”. Nationalisation of rail, water and mail, and new powers to allow councils to take control of bus services. Corbyn promised an “investment blitz”, which he said would leave no part of the country untouched, and suggested the deindustrialisation that begun in the 1980s would be reversed. “Margaret Thatcher’s government wiped out huge swathes of Britain’s industry. We will rebuild it, as green industry,” he said. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “This spending increase would be comparable to the first Wilson government and would mean the UK having a bigger state than Germany.” Corbyn acknowledged his plans were radical, saying they would transform society, but he insisted there would be no increase in income tax, national insurance or VAT for 95% of taxpayers, with only those paid more than £80,000 a year paying the price. “You really can have this plan for real change because you don’t need money to buy it. You just need a vote, and your vote can be more powerful than all their wealth,” he said. But with the plans requiring an extra £82bn a year in tax revenue by the end of the next parliament, some analysts said the changes envisaged, including a significant increase in corporation tax, would be likely to have knock-on effects lower down the income scale. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, a leading economics thinktank, said: “The truth is of course that in the end corporation tax is paid by workers, customers or shareholders so would affect many in the population.” He added: “If you want to transform the scale and scope of the state then you need to be clear that the tax increases required to do that will need to be widely shared rather than pretending that everything can be paid for by companies and the rich.” Ryan Shorthouse, the founder of Bright Blue, a liberal conservatism thinktank, said Labour’s plans would amount to “a significant and unprecedented expansion of state expenditure and control. They envisage a super-spending, suffocating state.” One of the most eye-catching tax rises is an £11bn windfall levy on oil and gas companies, which Labour said would pay for a “just transition fund” to lessen the impact on jobs and communities of the move towards a net-zero carbon economy. It said the new tax would be levied according to the companies’ historical contribution to climate change and that some of the proceeds would go towards retraining workers from the oil and gas industries declines, and creating new green jobs. As expected, the policy on immigration was somewhat less liberal than the pro-open borders motion passed at Labour party conference in Brighton. The manifesto said: “If we remain in the EU, freedom of movement will continue. If we leave, it will be subject to negotiations, but we recognise the social and economic benefits that free movement has brought both in terms of EU citizens here and UK citizens abroad – and we will seek to protect those rights.” Most of Corbyn’s speech focused on his promises for domestic policy. But he also sought to take the fight to Boris Johnson over the UK leaving the EU, attacking the prime minister’s promise to “get Brexit done” as “a fraud on the British people”. “His sellout deal will be just the beginning of years of drawn-out, bogged-down negotiations and broken promises … and his toxic deal with Donald Trump will take even longer,” the Labour leader said. As Corbyn warned of the risk a bilateral trade deal with the US could leave the NHS exposed to “rapacious American corporations”, the audience of activists broke out into a chant of “Not for sale. Not for sale.” The Conservatives have dismissed Labour’s claims about the risk of privatisation of the health service as scaremongering, but Tory candidates say the idea has been resonating with voters and is beginning to crop up spontaneously during canvassing. Many policies in the Labour manifesto were also in the 2017 document, including the abolition of student tuition fees. However, there was no sign of a plan to alleviate the burden of existing student debt, which the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, had hinted at earlier this week. Answering questions after his speech, Corbyn said that student debt was something the party was considering. “We are looking at ways in which we can stabilise it; in which we can bring about some relief,” he said."
"The price of offshore wind continues to fall dramatically. The UK government’s latest round of contracts for renewable generation have just been announced, and they show the costs of subsidies have halved in just two years. Cheap wind power is a great source of low carbon electricity, and it’s good news for politicians who may have been worried about subsidies bumping up household bills. But the scale of investment in offshore wind raises bigger, more systemic questions. The contracts – known as Contracts for Difference (CFDs) – pay operators of renewable energy installations a fixed price per unit generated for 15 years, regardless of what happens to the actual wholesale price of electricity in that time. For operators, this removes a lot of uncertainty about investing in relatively new and expensive technologies such as offshore wind because the subsidy and a guaranteed market for their power mean they can be confident they will recoup their costs. Contracts are awarded through an auction, where eligible developers bid against each other for projects being constructed in any given year. The projects with the lowest costs are awarded a contract, so ensuring the eventual cost to consumers is kept down. This is the second such auction for CFDs, and was limited to offshore wind, biomass, and energy from waste. More established technologies such as onshore wind and solar were excluded from the auction process. The results compared with the first auction are pretty spectacular. In 2015, two offshore wind projects were awarded contracts at £120 and £114 per megawatt hour (MWh). Two and a half years later, two projects are priced at £58/MWh, while a third is £75/MWh. This is a 50% fall in the level of subsidy, and makes offshore wind significantly cheaper than new nuclear power (the equivalent contract for Hinkley Point C is around £93/MWh). Offshore wind has dominated all three allocations of CFDs, with around 70% of the total awarded. In part this is because it can deliver on a much larger scale than other renewables; one of the new contracts is for a huge wind farm off the Yorkshire coast which could power up to 1.4m homes. It is also the result of the government’s shift towards an explicit industrial strategy that intends to use the development of offshore technology to stimulate economic growth. But the scale of this will profoundly shape the country’s electricity system. As the proposed wind farms are as large or even larger than conventional fossil fuel or nuclear stations, the UK will continue to rely on relatively few individual plants. Renewables could of course mean lots of small-scale wind and solar farms, leading to a more decentralised system. But a big offshore boom will lead to more centralisation. The level of investment needed to build an offshore wind farm is enormous, and therefore only open to a handful of large companies with access to the necessary funds. This reduces the potential for new entrants into the market, and excludes all the new investors who had begun to put their money into smaller scale, onshore projects over the past few years. The prices of the contracts awarded in this round are also so low that there must be the prospect that some of the projects are not actually built. This is partly because the costs of turbines and cables might not decline as quickly as expected, but is also related to Brexit. A decline in the pound means the cost of importing the necessary materials might well increase to the point where the subsidy on offer is not enough to allow investors to recoup their costs. While the impact of this might be relatively slight for a small scale, onshore project, it will be much larger for a complex, very capital-intensive wind farm built many kilometres out to sea. The UK could afford to lose a few smaller hilltop wind farms, but losing a massive offshore project would put a huge dent in its renewables output. So, the decline in offshore wind costs is fantastic, and a real endorsement of a rapidly-developing technology. But the bigger picture shouldn’t be neglected here. The UK is putting a lot of eggs into one basket. Centralised generation increasingly excludes new entrants, and literally concentrates power in the hands of a few very large developers. That makes life easier for policy makers who have fewer firms to deal with, but concentration also increases the risk of collusion and, in the longer-term, will mean less innovation. While increased generation from renewables is a desirable thing in itself, it is a real pity to be neglecting the increased levels of participation in the system which smaller scale projects offered. If Britain continues along this route, the days of community energy groups and energy co-ops may well be over."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWintertime is when people especially need reliable power for their homes, living and workplaces – especially in a northern country like Germany.
Unfortunately wind and solar power just aren’t able to come through and deliver when the chips are down.

The above chart shows German power supply by the various sources available and demand over the last 30 days. The lion’s share of Germany’s installed renewable energy (wind and sun) went just about completely AWOL three times during the period. Chart source: Agora.
 Dark blue – conventional power (fossil and nuclear)
 Medium blue – wind
 Yellow – solar
 Green – biomass
Germany today has a combined installed wind and solar capacity of close to 80,000 MW (see chart below). But as the chart above shows, often they put out only a tiny, measly percentage of that.

Germany installed sun and wind capacity (2013). Source Wikipedia. 
And on the seldom occasions when the sun and wind do both happen to be in supply at near full capacity, the power grid gets severely overloaded, conventional power plants have to throttled, massive amounts of surplus energy need to be dumped at negative prices in foreign countries, power plants have to shut down (and lose money), yet can never be taken off line. Overall the German energy production system system is market hostile where demand is ignored and supply is uncontrolled.
Recently, German energy giant E.ON announced it is getting out of conventional power generation business altogether: too risky and no foreseeable profits in the future.

Former German Economics Minister and socialist party honcho Wolfgang Clement calls the German Energiewende “a disaster“.
in a recent stinging op-edpiece, environmentalist centre-left Die Zeit called the Energiewende “a blunder with ugly consequences“.
Renewable energy expert Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt recently called Germany’s energy policy “suicidal”.
Late last year, German Vice Chancellor and socialist party leader Sigmar Gabriel called the mad rush to green energies “ruinous” and said “others think we’ve lost our marbles“.
Overall in Europe wind puts out on average a measly less than 15% of its installed rated capacity.
Much of Germany’s solar system manufacturing, which in its heady days employed tens of thousands, have shuttered their operations – leaving a silicon rust belt in its wake and tens of thousands of disillusioned workers.
To top it all off, Germany’s coal consumption has risen, and not fallen as green energy proponents hoped.
But don’t expect to read this at Winston’s Wikipedia, or to hear any of it from Europe’s green energy swindlers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIsraeli scientist Nir Shaviv recently posted at his site an article on the effects of cosmic radiation on climate. At the end he summarizes:
The results have two particularly interesting implications. First, they bring yet another link between the galactic environment and the terrestrial climate. Although there is no direct evidence that cosmic rays are the actual link on the 32-million-year time scale, as far as we know, they are the only link that can explain these observations. This in turn strengthens the idea that cosmic ray variations through solar activity affect the climate. In this picture, solar activity increase is responsible for about half of the twentieth-century global warming through a reduction of the cosmic ray flux, leaving less to be explained by anthropogenic activity. Also, in this picture, climate sensitivity is on the low side (perhaps 1 to 1.5°C increase per CO2 doubling, compared with the 1.5 to 4.5°C range advocated by the IPCC), implying that the future is not as dire as often prophesied.
The second interesting implication is the actual value of the 32-million-year oscillation. The relatively short period indicates that there is more mass in the galactic plane than accounted for in stars and interstellar gas, leaving the remainder as dark matter. However, this amount of dark matter is more than would be expected if it were distributed sparsely in a puffed-up halo as is generally expected. In other words, this excess mass requires at least some of the dark matter to condense into the disk. If correct, it will close a circle that started in the 1960s when Edward Hill and Jan Oort suggested, based on kinematic evidence, that there is more matter at the plane than observed. This inconsistency and indirect evidence for dark matter was also advocated by John Bahcall, who for many years was a Faculty member here at the IAS.”

==================================
The sun in January 2015 and Atlantic prognoses
By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Solar report January 2015
Last month the sun reached a sunspot number of 67.0 and thus was once again below normal in activity: It reached 85% of what is normal for the particular cycle month.

Fig. 1: The mean activity of the sun since systematic observations have been conducted is shown in blue and the current cycle (24th cycle, red), along with the relatively similar Cycle No. 1 of 260 years ago.
The red curve shows that the sunspot maximum is now over. Up to now that was not so easy to identify because instead of the usual pronounced maximum (compared to the mean curve in Fig. 1), there have been two peaks with a pronounced dip between them.
Observation of the sun’s polar magnetic fields brings certainty rather than guesses. We reported on this in detail before the end of the year. In short the polar fields have a zero polarity during the solar sunspot maximum. The difference of north polar field and south polar field is zero, yet it can occur often when the fields do not reverse at the same time. During the current cycle the fluctuation about the zero line was quite intense:

Figure 2: The difference between the polar fields of the sun, source: leif.org.
The zero value was first approached in fall 2012, in early summer 2013, and again at the beginning of 2014. The maximum dragged on for some 15 months. But now the trend appears to be clearly away from zero and the maximum to be behind us for good. The month with the highest activity was month no. 63 of the cycle, February 2014, with a SSN= 102.8.
We are seeing an unusually weak cycle with a delayed start and delayed maximum. Another thing is noteworthy: The polar fields are building up only very slowly, especially the solar north pole is dipping as before close to zero. Could that be an indication of an even weaker cycle to follow? It is still too early to determine this, but we will know in a few years. What follows is a comparison of all the cycles:

Fig. 3: The summed deviations from the mean value (blue in Fig. 1) for all cycles for all months up to the current one. The right bar in Fig. 3 is growing deeper into negative territory. This indicates a strongly reduced solar activity since approx. 2006.
North Atlantic harboring a bitter surprise?
As some readers may recall, we reported earlier here on the North Atlantic and we suspected that a relatively significant reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) could be in the pipeline. Since then there have been additional mesurements of this near surface warm current, which impacts the Atlantic part of the Northern Hemisphere and to some extent other large regions of the Northern hemisphere. Our earlier prognoses are now confirmed:

Fig. 4: The AMOC strength between 2004 and spring 2014. Source: climate-lab-book.ac.uk.
It is the decisive element that controls the AMO, and probably the approximately 65-year temperature oscillation. Earlier it had been positive, the transition from negative to a positive phase precisely coincides with the time frame that most climate models were parameterized: between 1975 and 2004.

Fig.5: The AMO since 1870, Source: climatedataguide.ucar.edu. The signal is determined by measuring surface temperatures of the entire North Atlantic and the deviation from the linear long-term trend. The AMO thus expresses an internal variability.
The additional added heat from the variable oscillation may have led to the models having calculated an excessive forcing from greenhouse gases, just as the AMO will also not be accounted for in the newest CMIP5 models when it comes to the global and northern hemisphere temperatures.
Getting back to the AMOC, if it weakens, it will lead to a falling heat content in the North Atlantic at depths from 0 to 700 meters and so less heat getting conveyed towards the North Pole. This is precisely what has been observed since 2007:

Fig. 6: The heat content of the upper 700 meters in the region of impact of the AMOC, Chart source: Climate Explorer. 
It is highly likely that the focus of the AMOC-effect can be found in the sub-polar gyre, which is a relatively small area of the sea in the North Atlantic located off the southern tip of Greenland: 45°N…60°N; 50°W…20W°. Here we are seeing truly dramatic events:

Fig. 7:  The heat content of water between 300 meters depth and 125 m of the sub-polar circulation. The depth limit was chosen in order to exclude falsifications from the effects of atmospheric processes. (Image source: Argo Marine Atlas)
Beginning in the spring of 2014 (after the end of the available direct measurement in Fig. 4) we see the occurrence of a steep drop. Also the forecast of the British Met Office for the next years is now taking this development into account and foresees with some certainty for the next ten years global temperatures at the lower end of the models’ ranges. It is also stated very carefully that a temperature stall could occur over the next 10 years, which for the models would be a real large-scale catastrophe. Just as we wrote back in January, 2014:
The AMO] is not accounted for in the IPCC models and would limit the trend rise in global temperatures since the beginning of the impact of greenhouse gases to about 1°K/ century.  How much longer will we have to wait before the IPCC finally accepts the multidecadal oscillations, as it already has here and is shown in other works?”
The North Atlantic is indeed a special region and could contribute much to understanding our climate. Also a greater impact by the sun than what has been considered up to now would be possible. A new paper by authors in China and Scandinavia examined high resolution proxy summer temperature data from northern Iceland and came to the result that the fluctuations there over the last 3500 years correspond to solar activity, and do so significantly over long time frames (centuries and millennia).

Fig. 8: The coincidence between North Atlantic summer temperatures and solar activity in the gray range over the last 3500 years (top), with the correlation (middle) and significance (bottom – the lower the p -value, the greater the certainty) of the relationship . Source: Figure 5 of the above-mentioned paper.
When one looks very closely at Fig. 8, one sees a time delay in temperature with respect to solar activity characteristic numbers. And when one now looks at Figure 3 of post and notice the especially high activity until the end of the 1980s and the rather dramatic drop afterwards, what do you think the solar drive will do to the Atlantic temperatures?
Things could become very bitter for the IPCC forecast models! With much excitement we look forward to how the climate unfolds.

"The most shocking political development of 2019 may be the end of the nearly three-decade old consensus that the public doesn’t care about the climate crisis. People were hopelessly and permanently apathetic, the argument went, or unable to see beyond the present. They were said to suffer what Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger memorably called “apocalypse fatigue”, a numbness brought on by years of scientific warnings about a dismal future. And this in turn meant they were uninterested in, if not outright hostile to, any kind of meaningful climate action. All of this appeared to be backed up by data. Years of polling and other measures of public engagement showed that even as awareness of the crisis grew, there was no interest in changing anything.  But after an unprecedented wave of popular climate protests – centred around the latest and most terrifying scientific predictions – recent polling suggests that orthodoxy has suddenly and dramatically reversed. A YouGov poll found that more than half the country backs a national target of zero carbon emissions by 2030, a policy that as recently as a year ago was offered only by the Green party. Other polls suggest that two-thirds of the country believes the climate crisis is the biggest issue facing humankind, and that it has overtaken the economy on voters’ list of concerns. There have been suggestions that the climate crisis will be a central issue in the upcoming general election – it’s even being called “the climate election” – and a majority of Britons say that it will influence the way they vote. The public now appears to want to take part in the politics of climate change. The trouble is, such a thing barely exists. This sounds ridiculous, because we have clear evidence of at least two kinds of climate politics: the familiar international conferences, with rooms filled with bureaucrats and national leaders parachuting in for the final handshakes and signatures; and the recent actions by grassroots groups such as the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion. But between the insulated world of international negotiation and street-level protest there is almost nothing. For most people, politics means national politics, and a choice of policies delivered by ideologically distinct national parties. But for nearly a generation, climate politics has hovered in the almost apolitical space of international treaties, out of the reach of the public. Climate policies have been formulated in broad and loosely defined terms that politicians can all agree on. They commit to future targets that would seem to require radical changes in the way we live, but those decisions remain unmade, because the major parties have never brought them in front of a national electorate. The UK’s own Climate Change Act of 2008 – often touted as the most progressive climate legislation in the world – neatly illustrates the limits of climate politics as they currently exist. The act passed with an overwhelming majority, and committed the UK to an 80% emission reduction by 2050 (since increased to 100%). It started from a premise everyone agreed with: that climate change was a problem, and that we had to do something about it. But 10 years later, the question of what exactly we will do has hardly been addressed. The government hit its first two mandated climate targets largely by tinkering with policy out of the public eye, decommissioning coal plants and supporting renewables where it was easy to do so. The next steps, though, would require transforming more visible and tangible aspects of public life – whether they are the boilers we use to heat homes, the kinds of food we eat, or the way the countryside is balanced between exploitation and protection – and would involve stronger government intervention, and spending, than has been committed before. There aren’t currently any plans to do that, and so as it stands the UK is expected to miss the 2025 and 2030 targets. This is how the politics of climate change has always played out. Targets are made by consensus, but policies are never brought forward because they would involve change, and thus be contentious, partisan – the stuff of real politics. Instead, we’re left with a framework that is never filled in, a set of guy-wires meant to steady a bridge that is never built. For a long time our leaders haven’t been held to account for this; they’ve been safe knowing the public doesn’t care enough to demand more. That appears to have changed over the past year, and the initial response is promising: the declaration of a climate emergency by parliament, and MPs convening a public assembly on the climate crisis are good starts. But they’re still in the realm of acknowledgement and declaration. They need to go further than that, by presenting people with an actual political choice. Not just a choice of different future targets, but the policies to deliver them. The Greens have been offering those kinds of policies for years. Now Labour has indicated it will bring forward its version of a green new deal, likely a path to net-zero carbon by 2030 backed by new regulations and a massive government spending programme on infrastructure and housing. It’s unclear what the Conservative platform will be, but, several months ago, 41 Tory MPs produced a draft manifesto with market-based initiatives that they believe will deliver net-zero by 2050. These visions are likely to be attacked by some as reckless, or ineffectual. But they are serious proposals because they place their policies within a political vehicle familiar to each party’s voters, and to the wider public. They indicate that the climate crisis may be about to descend from the lofty realm of consensus into the arena of real politics. That can only happen when the public is given – or demands – a proper democratic choice. • Stephen Buranyi is a writer in London"
"The eco documentary 2040 is a gentle antidote to environmental anxiety. Directed by Damon Gameau, it imagines a world 20 years from now, free from the climate crisis that’s gobbling up our globe. Committed to changing the nihilistic narrative surrounding climate change, Gameau takes his audience on a search for solutions and offers up a message of hope. As 2040 is released, however, the doom and gloom of the climate crisis Gameau’s documentary takes pains to avoid is inescapable. Australia is ablaze. New South Wales, where he lives with his wife and two children, is experiencing the worst bushfires the country has ever seen. His daughter, to whom 2040 is dedicated, is unable to attend school. For Gameau, the irony of this tragedy stings. “Thousand of school kids were derided for protesting against the very thing that’s now forcing them to miss school,” he says. “People are so frustrated. They’re overwhelmed. They’re angry. Our government is still denying that the fires are climate related. The cognitive dissonance is remarkable.”  Gameau’s frustration at his government’s refusal to acknowledge the climate crisis is noticeably absent from this film. Shifting the focus away from horrific stories of floods and fires, of political ignorance and denial, 2040 is instead a blueprint for the way out of the mess. “There’s been a failure of imagination,” he says. “Instead of constantly beating people over the head with how bad things are, we need to inspire them.” In 2040, Gameau interviews a host of environmental experts, showing us networks of solar panels, seaweed platforms, the electrification of transport and decentralised energy grids: all solutions to the climate crisis and all of which exist today. Quirky editing has experts perching on toasters, tin roofs and wind turbines as they explain the intricacies of each. It’s unusual and engaging. The message: we must put these ideas into practice if we’re to make any difference. Gameau says he made 2040 for his daughter’s generation. The film returns repeatedly to warm interviews with children, gently reminding us whose future is at stake. Asked to imagine themselves as adults, kids giggle at the thought of chocolate rain and rocket boots. Climate change is their biggest concern. Unprompted, they speak of hopes of an end to deforestation and dream of “meat grown from a seed”. One imagines an “intergalactic rubbish dimension”. “It’s their future,” Gameau says. “We’ve got to show them there are people who care about that.” With the success of the school strikes, which has seen more than a million children take to the streets to demand government action on the climate crisis, I ask Gameau if it’s not the kids who need convincing, but the adults. “Kids voices are working,” he says. “People are waking up.” He is determined to use 2040 as a tool for change. It has been projected on to the walls of the UN. A copy of the DVD will be sent to every Australian MP. A screening in the UK parliament is planned for the New Year. In an effort to reach as many young people as possible, 2040 has been screened free for children in Australia and the Into film festival has rolled out free screenings for schools in England. Delegates to the Youth Climate summit attended a screening in New York. Even singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding has had a private screening. Could 2040 mark the beginning of the “Greta effect” in documentaries? Gameau thinks so. ‘“Governments, Hollywood, the fossil fuel industry – they’ve always known that film is incredibly powerful,” he says. “We’ve got to be clever and start using the medium for our own benefit.” With Extinction Rebellion keen to encourage film-makers to focus on the climate crisis, I asked Will Skeaping, co-editor of This Is Not a Drill: An Extinction Rebellion Handbook, how useful he thinks film can be to the cause. “Film-making is vital,” he says. “We need to bring this crisis into all forms of conversation. Film, as the most accessible medium, is one of the best ways to do that.” Gameau’s documentary shows us there is a way out of the climate crisis. It listens to children, then amplifies their voices. Though the film focuses on the personal changes we can make, Gameau has harnessed the medium to target the political, too. Afterwards, it’s over to us. As Skeaping says: “It’s about getting people out of the cinema and on to the streets.” • 2040 out now in the UK. A Q&A with Damon Gameau and climate activist Jack Harries is on Friday 22 November at Everyman Broadgate, London EC1. "
"Unlike parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, wild marjoram missed out on a role in the classic song Scarborough Fair, made popular in the 1960s by Paul Simon. But it does have a key additional advantage over most herbs. People know it best under its widely-used alternate name of oregano, which is also the scientific name – origanum vulgare. It is a common feature of Italian cooking and a native around Europe and in the UK. More importantly though, it is one of the best of all plants for attracting bees, butterflies and other pollinators to your garden.  The most widely grown and appreciated garden favourites, of course, are those with attractive flowers. And there is a common assumption that those plants which delight human eyes will also be the most attractive for bees and other flower-visiting insects. Research at the Laboratory of Apiculture and Social Insects at the University of Sussex can give a more empirical take. One project carried out in 2011-2012 saw 32 varieties of summer flowering garden plants grown in beds and counted the insects visiting them – 87% of which were bees. The plants selected were all summer-flowering varieties often grown in gardens. All were attractive to the human eye. However, they were very different as far as the insects were concerned. The most attractive to them were marjoram and agastache, a herbaceous perennial with simple, aromatic leaves and small flowers in dense spikes. These two had 100 times as many insects as the least popular, the pelargonium, which belongs to a large group of frost-sensitive plants used for summer bedding.  It is a simple lesson. By choosing suitable varieties to provide nectar and pollen, gardeners can make a big difference. Our research show that helping bees and flower-visiting insects needn’t come at a cost. In a 2012 survey of over 200 varieties of asters, also known as Michaelmas daisies, at the British National Collection in Picton Gardens, Herefordshire, the varieties that attracted more insects were just as easy to obtain, easy to grow, and attractive to the human eye. Prices are similar, although that depends mainly on the size of the plant when you buy it. So, how good for insects are the flowers grown in parks and gardens? In the East Sussex town of Lewes there is a beautiful park, Southover Grange Garden, which is carefully managed to provide magnificent floral displays in spring and summer. We counted the insects on 79 varieties in full bloom in August 2012. The results were surprising. The park appeared to be a bee paradise, but only three of the varieties were highly attractive to flower-visiting insects. On 24 varieties we saw no insects in any of the 15 counts made, and on a further 37 there were very few. Clearly, there is room for improvement. Many garden flowers are more show than go: bred for many bright petals instead of food for the bees.  Many gardeners in the UK get their plants from one of more than 2,000 garden centres and retail nurseries. They are popular destinations for plants and equipment (and for a cup of tea and a slice of cake). They play an important role in what British gardeners end up growing and what insects will be able to visit. Garden centres normally sell plants in bloom with each variety in a distinct patch. This makes it easy to monitor the insects. In 2015 we counted the insects on the 59-74 plant varieties in full bloom on sale in five garden centres and one nursery in Sussex. We made 12 counts over one day in each. We even brought in our own marjoram plants to set up two comparison patches of a variety we knew to be very attractive. We found a similar pattern to that seen in the other two studies. Most varieties on sale had few bees and other insects, and a small number had many. Our marjoram did well, as expected, but 4.5% of the plants on sale turned out to be even more attractive, with an average of 26% more insects. Strong performers included the deep magenta flowers of cosmos bipinnatus “Sonata Carmine” and caryopteris x clandonensis “Heavenly Blue”, a compact shrub with clusters of dark blue flowers. Some of the plants on sale, about 15%, were marketed as bee-friendly, and just over half of those appear on the Royal Horticultural Society’s “Perfect for Pollinators” list. How good were these? Well, the average looks good: recommended plants attracted three times as many flower-visitors as the rest. However, many plants in that group were unattractive to insects or underperformed. Equally, some non-recommended varieties such as iberis “Masterpiece” and alstromeria “Inticancha Dark Purple” did really well. The labelling appears to be inconsistent and certainly over-optimistic. Perhaps “better for pollinators” would be more accurate.  Our research shows that the public could be making their gardens much more attractive to bees and other insects simply by more careful flower choice. And garden centres can be part of this, by improving stocks and by educating customers to favour more of the highly attractive varieties.  Many of the plants of the family lamiaceae, the mint family, are great for pollinators. That includes marjoram as well as thyme, lavender and Russian sage (perovska). Others, such as heleniums and some dahlias are in the daisy family. Different varieties bloom at different times, and can provide valuable additional food across the whole summer to a whole range of flower-visitors.  If you want to help bees and other insects in your garden, have a look round your garden centre on a sunny summer day. Plants with 10 insects, even five, per square metre when in full bloom are the ones to go for. But don’t buy a plant that you don’t like. There are plenty of bee-friendly varieties, so a win-win situation is possible: chose plants that you – and the bees – both love."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few years ago at a social event I had a brief discussion with a secondary school teacher who happened to be on some sort of committee in Hannover which decided the textbooks the children at Lower Saxony upper secondary schools were to use.
On that subject I told her I thought that the geography textbook our children were using was designed to indoctrinate the kids on the subject of climate change, and that it dissuaded them from critical thinking on the subject. My opinion was that the schools should teach children, and not indoctrinate them.
Needless to say, I got quite a stern, German-style reaction. I’ll never forget the icy, piercing look in her eyes, one that made my grade school principal Arlene Simons look angelic by comparison. Parents, especially cowboys, obviously were not expected to question the state when it comes matters concerning the education of children.
The following is a letter written by a biology teacher, posted at Die kalte Sonne site. It was sent to one of Germnay’s larger textbook publishers: Ernst Klett Verlag.
======================================

Answers are requested: How do school textbook publishers handle the climate discussion?
To: Klett-Schulbuchverlag
From: Teacher of Biology and Chemistry [anonymous in order to avoid problems with colleagues]

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
Because the general contact-page at your website is blocked, I am using this address and requesting that you pass my comments on the subject of climate change on to the responsible editors:
In the preparation of my lessons (Biology Grade 7) in your textbook Prisma Biology 2, ISBN 978-3-12-068390-2, I came upon an illustration depicting the causes of climate change which I find to be unserious and unscientific. Under the heading, ‘The greenhouse effect is being enhanced’ one finds the following text: ‘Over the past decades scientists have been measuring a steady increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. At the same time the average temperature of the earth has risen because the heat trapping gas barrier is getting tighter…“
Here the illusion of a causal relationship is being given, when this is everything but certain. Why do you not provide the development of the mean global temperature over the past? This would allow the pupils to see that warm periods have always occurred, long before man could have had an impact on the earth’s atmosphere. The pupils would be able to recognize that the climate in the Middle Ages was similar to today’s climate and that it provided significant benefits to the people living back then.

My view is that it is scientifically unserious to show only an increase over the last decades. Here it is being suggested that there weren’t any climate changes earlier.
Why don’t you show how little the share of man’s CO2 is in the earth’s entire CO2 budget?
Why do you not mention the ongoing discussion on CO2 climate sensitivity?
Why do you not mention that the global mean temperature of the earth has not risen over the past 18 years, even though the CO2 atmospheric concentration of the atmosphere has risen during the same period?
Why do you not mention that many studies have shown that in the past temperature increased first, and then CO2 and methane concentration followed, and thus the driving force for the earth’s temperature could not have been these gases?
And why do you fail to mention that the climate models, which projected a significant warming of the earth, have been proven false?
What I find to be especially manipulative and unserious is the exercise: ‘Evaluate the single information sources using this sentence: Who posted what, and with what intention, in the Internet?“ This is all about speculation and the manipulation of 13-year olds who do not yet possess the knowledge necessary for assessing the seriousness of a source in the Internet. It may very well be that the ideological stipulations of political parties may lead a school textbook publisher to depict the reality as such, so that it fits the political narrative. But this has absolutely nothing to do with science. Serious would be to show in a neutral manner the different views on climate changes of the last 150 years, side by side, and to provide as many of the known facts as possible.
Yours sincerely”

=======================================
Well, don’t expect the Lower Saxony Ministry of Education to give this letter an A+ by any means.
Today Germany’s kids are being told what they can be critical about, and climate science is certainly not one of them. Even the concerns of parents are being dismissed by what appears to be a state apparatus that has gotten excessively arrogant on the subject. Indeed it’s back to school – the old nasty German one of thought control.
And it’s unbelievable that the climate of intimidation in academia has become so aggressive that the biology teacher fears being identified, and thus chose to stay anonymous. This should make anyone pause and think.

"Last year Justin Milne got into trouble for acting like he ran the ABC, giving directions for staff to be sacked or telling management what they should do. But no one seems to mind the current ABC chair’s forthright style. Ita Buttrose is in demand and she grants interviews and makes statements that occasionally sound like she, and not David Anderson, is the managing director. Or at least that’s how certain media outlets interpret her comments, to be fair to Buttrose. Headlines such as “Ita Buttrose urged to scrap MeToo documentary” and “Ita Buttrose pulls ABC’s Q&A show over ‘call to violence’” add to this perception. In the last few weeks she has “pulled Q&A”, made comments about bias and political correctness, and now has appeared to veto a staff-led climate emergency group to develop ways to report on the climate crisis. The Australian reported that Buttrose had “ruled out” the creation of a staff advisory group after the paper revealed ABC staff had suggested to colleagues they form an “ABC-staff climate crisis advisory group” and some staff welcomed the idea enthusiastically in a leaked email chain. Buttrose was asked about the initiative, which the Oz saw as something sinister, on ABC Adelaide’s Mornings with David Bevan. She told Bevan, “it was one of those ideas that is not going to happen”, perhaps meaning it was not going to form official policy. “Policy is decided by the leadership, not by members of the staff,” Buttrose said, adding that it was not her call but that of the leadership team. “I haven’t had anything to do with it,” she said. But Weekly Beast can reveal the staff move has not been stymied at all. Staff are free to discuss climate change coverage among themselves and are still planning to go ahead with the advisory group, with 77 people expressing an interest already. There has been no edict from above to stop the email chain. Meanwhile over at News Corp, executive chairman Rupert Murdoch’s claim that “there are no climate change deniers around I can assure you” has left people wondering whether the Oz will get an edict from above that it needs to stop publishing climate deniers. Clearly editor-in-chief Chris Dore doesn’t have the memo yet because on Friday the paper published denier-in-chief Ian Plimer declaring “We are not living in a period of catastrophic climate change”. The Tracey Spicer-fronted documentary Silent No More is being furiously re-edited and thoroughly legalled by the ABC ahead of its scheduled broadcast on Monday, in the Four Corners timeslot. The ABC was forced to apologise last week for failing to blur out the names of three survivors of sexual abuse or harassment before releasing the #MeToo film to a handful of reviewers last month. With just a few days to broadcast the three x 42-minute documentary was not available for preview, and on-air promos were conspicuously absent from ABC TV because of the last-minute checks. This fuelled rumours it was going to be pulled from the schedule at the last minute. But the ABC says it is going ahead as planned. “The ABC again reiterates that no names, images, emails, stories or any other details – identifying or otherwise – of anyone who has suffered sexual abuse or harassment will be broadcast in Silent No More without their explicit consent,” a spokesman said. “We refer you to our full statement.” The problems arose when Spicer agreed to be filmed reading out survivor stories from her computer screen and some details of the confidential messages were shown in the documentary. The debacle has exposed how vulnerable the ABC is when it outsources its programs to the independent sector. This film may air in the prestigious Four Corners spot but it has not been produced by ABC news and current affairs journalists.  There is a lot riding on the three-parter, which cost an estimated $200,000 to $250,000 per hour, funded in part by Screen Australia. After a month of razzle-dazzle and sizzle reels, Australia’s five free-to-air networks’ 2020 program launches came to an end on Wednesday with SBS’s multicultural feast for 500 media and advertisers at Sydney’s The Cutout at Barangaroo. They saved the best for last. With a budget a fraction that of Ten, Nine and Seven, and significantly smaller than its bigger public service sibling, the ABC, SBS delivered a slate rich in original, diverse and surprising content. Starting off with Ten unveiling its new MasterChef judges last month, the other networks offered several crass reality shows packed with advertorials, with drama and documentary an afterthought. The ABC’s offering was more interesting, with a raft of local dramas – Stateless, Fallout, Mystery Road, Harrow and The Heights – but it lacked the spark of the SBS schedule. Your guide to the year ahead across SBS channels.https://t.co/3CzZ6TvR4Y Highlights include Rachel Perkins’ First Wars, a polemic documentary series about the 100-year history of the frontier conflict between the Indigenous population and the settlers; SBS’s first period drama, New Gold Mountain, and topical documentaries, Who Gets to Stay in Australia?, Addicted, Jess Hill’s See What You Made Me Do and Come Fly with Me. With the proliferation of streaming services now available, don’t forget SBS on Demand, which is free. The Australian Financial Review really loves the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella. Nadella has been the subject of no fewer than 10 articles over four days, starting on 18 November. They have been, in the main, fawning and very lengthy running to thousands of words. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Nadella charmed the pants off the audience” at the AFR’s Chanticleer lunch this week, where he was interviewed by AFR journalist Tony Boyd, readers were told. “Under Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft has successfully positioned itself as the world’s “good tech” company,” another piece said. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says trust is key when it comes to growing a business. https://t.co/QBb7KeMq9y A Microsoft employee was even quoted saying she loved listening to her boss. “Microsoft sales director Tiffany Wright said she liked hearing Nadella respond to the Financial Review’s Chanticleer columnist Tony Boyd’s questions on Microsoft’s company culture, and the idea of gravitating towards the good parts of company culture and ditching the bad during his rise to the top.” “Nadella cracked guests up with his easy sense of humour, regaled tales of his childhood growing up in India, and talked about his path to the top of Microsoft with likeable humility,” readers were told, in case they hadn’t worked out what a great man he was. The Chanticleer lunch in Sydney is a nice little earner for the Fin, but even that doesn’t explain the overkill. Boyd had a disclosure at the end of his articles – “The author’s self-managed super fund owns shares in Microsoft” – but that wouldn’t explain the enthusiasm for the CEO either. Editor Michael Stutchbury says there was no commercial objective for the lunch “other than showcasing the power of the Australian Financial Review’s brand and delivering high value content to our paying subscribers”. “Our lunch attracted the cream of Australian business,” Stutch said. “The Financial Review’s coverage of the event was driven solely by the capacity of Australia’s biggest business and finance newsroom and Australia’s leading business technology news masthead to meet the demands of our paying subscribers. The Nadella stories were among our most read stories of the week. “I’d be surprised if, within its lesser means, the Guardian Australia didn’t give blanket coverage to any similar lunch it managed to organise with Satya Nadella – or the likes of Jeremy Corbyn!” Worst front page story of the week has to go to the Courier-Mail for this shocker. The story is not just distasteful, it’s plain wrong. Weekly Beast understands the man wasn’t medevacced to Australia because of a “botched penis enlargement”, but for an entirely unrelated medical condition. He did attempt a backyard penis enlargement, but it did not lead to his evacuation. Tomorrow's front page, tonight! You'll never guess how a botched penis enlargement got an asylum seeker into Oz https://t.co/tvXk0nYCkB pic.twitter.com/LbYYdiI93w The ABC has had a couple of interesting corrections recently. The first was for a report from the ABC in Pilbara which claimed that Elijah Doherty was “run over in 2016 by 56-year-old Wayne Martin”. The Indigenous teenager was run over by a 56-year-old man, but it wasn’t Martin, and the offender’s identity is still suppressed by the court. “On November 11 ABC Pilbara reported that Wayne Martin ran over Elijah Doughty in Kalgoorlie in 2016,” the correction said. “This was not the case. Wayne Martin was the Western Australia chief justice at the WA supreme court where the case was held. The 56-year-old man responsible cannot be identified.” The second one was a correction which it says it didn’t need to make but did so “in good faith”. A reader was concerned that an ABC Eyre Peninsula article stated that teenagers had walked through an “untouched” landscape in 1843 when Indigenous people had been in Australia for many thousands of years. The ABC said the article did say they were “the first western people” to walk south of Streaky Bay and included a picture caption which clearly stated that they “walked on beaches no westerners had ever stepped on”. “Nevertheless, in good faith, the ABC amended the article to state: ‘In 1843 two teenagers fled the brutal life of a whaling station at Fowlers Bay on the far west coast of South Australia and walked more than 500 kilometres through a pristine landscape to be rescued’.” Journalists who work for digital media startups or digital-only publications – like Daily Mail Australia – will be treated equally to their print colleagues under a landmark Fair Work ruling handed down on Thursday. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance welcomed the decision, which they said “removes the award’s outdated focus solely on print journalists which placed digital workers at a disadvantage”. Digital journalists will now have access to minimum standards for wages, penalty rates, overtime and other conditions of employment such as hours of work and breaks just as their print colleagues do, the media union said. The MEAA media federal president, Marcus Strom, said: “Digital is the reality of all newsrooms today. It’s about time the award caught up with the working lives of our members.” Guardian Australia’s journalists have access to penalty and overtime rates under their enterprise agreement, which came into effect in July 2019."
"The UK government is proposing a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040, in a move that echoes a recent announcement in France. Setting this sort of media-friendly target is a positive and welcome response to the challenge of air pollution across UK cities. But delivering the infrastructure, research and development support and incentives to switch to greener cars will be the hard part. If conventional vehicle manufactures start getting nervous, then environment secretary Michael Gove may find the road to an electric future needs to be paved with more than good intentions. Planned well, a ban on sales of conventionally fuelled vehicles could deliver long-term benefits for both air quality and economic investment in post-Brexit UK. There is no question that a switch to alternative-fuelled vehicles would significantly improve air quality in towns and cities. The actual benefit will not be felt for many years, however, given the slow replacement rate for vehicles. Still, it does establish a clear direction of travel for public investment and as battery prices are set to tumble over the next decade, it will be one more reason for businesses to switch to greener vehicles. The 2040 target should encourage big electric vehicle manufacturers to invest in the UK. The country is a significant consumer market and has strong production capabilities in green technologies, especially the use of lightweight materials. BMW, for instance, has just announced it will build the fully electric Mini at its plant in Oxford. An even clearer example of policy driving private investment is Chinese carmaker Geely’s investment in a new hybrid model of the London taxi to take advantage of the capital’s new “ultra low emission zone”. Then there is the question of infrastructure. The UK has 6,535 charging stations, which sounds like a lot. But compare that to Norway, which has slightly more stations for a population less than a tenth the size. The number of charging points will have to rise to the hundreds of thousands.  New homes are required to have charging points by 2019, but installation costs £1,000 in existing houses. Subsidies can reduce the cost, but will need to be taken up on a vastly greater scale. And even this won’t help those dependent on on-street parking or multi-story living. A comprehensive infrastructure would certainly cost hundreds of millions. And even if successful, the government faces another headache – lost fuel duty could leave a hole in the budget of between £9 billion and £23 billion by 2030. Equally important is the need to think about energy supply. The widespread adoption of electric vehicles could put a strain on the grid at a time when fossil fuels are being phased out and a higher share of more volatile renewables is taking over. This means the government will need to think seriously about how excess power is stored during the hot, blustery days that favour solar or wind farms, and how to manage demand from electric vehicles when there is not enough sun or wind.   For car manufacturers, 2040 is several production cycles away. This gives them and the government time to think creatively about mass electrification. Roads that charge your car as you drive would need a big initial investment but would make electric cars significantly cheaper and better.  Self-driving cars and the trend towards mobility being a service you buy on demand through firms such as Uber might mean some people eventually don’t need to purchase vehicles at all. But these technologies are still many years away from the mainstream. This highlights a key point: that a shift to sales of alternative fuelled vehicles will not immediately reduce air pollution and will do nothing to impact on congestion. Only a more comprehensive policy of shifting people to different modes of transport will achieve this, and here the government’s commitment shouldn’t be relied upon. On an optimistic note, there are good reasons to imagine that a shift to greener vehicles may occur anyway. Pete Harrop, chairman of industry analysts IdTechEx, is bullish, predicting driving ranges of up to 1,000 miles and electric vehicles that can harvest solar electricity and act as batteries to store renewable power. “Electric vehicles are not simply catching up with conventional vehicles,” he told us. “They are overtaking.”  It’s clear which way the wind is blowing. Norway, as market leader, wants to ban sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2025, and the German upper house has debated a 2030 target.  By 2040, internal combustion engines may no longer be able to compete in the market. But whether the UK’s infrastructure is ready for millions more electric vehicles remains to be seen."
"The Syrian civil war has raged for more than six years now. You’ve probably heard the following story linking it to climate change: an intense drought, made more likely thanks to global warming, caused “mass migration” within the country from rural to urban areas, which in turn contributed to the 2011 uprising which then escalated into civil conflict.  This narrative assumes that there is a relationship between drought, migration and conflict. However, the connection is not so clear-cut. Our worry is that putting too much emphasis on the climate overlooks the role of political and socio-economic factors in determining a community’s vulnerability to environmental stress. Conflict is not inevitable in the face of drought. That’s one conclusion from our work on drought and resource management in Syria. In our research, we broke down the popular “climate war” claim into two parts – the link between drought and migration, and the link between migration and conflict – to see if and how these factors fit together. We started with the very idea of environmentally induced migration. The problem is that it’s very difficult to determine the actual reasons why people leave home and look for opportunities elsewhere – a changing environment is likely to be only one among several factors and not necessarily the most significant. For instance, having the capital to move is a major factor for migration, so only those who can afford to move in response to drought are able to.  In the case of Syria, there has been no scientifically proven link between reduced rainfall or failed crops, and rural-urban migration. The evidence that has been used to prove the drought-migration link comes from displacement reports published by the Syrian government and UN assessment missions. The two phenomena are claimed to be linked because they coincided in time. Scientifically, however, this is not enough.  The drought which affected Syria has been described as a severe, multi-year drought that lasted between 2006 and 2010. But rainfall levels in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 were close to normal, both in Syria as a whole and in the northeastern “bread basket” region. This suggests that only 2008 was a real drought year. A drought can be devastating for one community but barely noticed in another. Just look at the Kurdistan region of Iraq, which was affected by the same dry period as Syria but without any mass migration flows at the time. A community’s vulnerability to drought is more important than the drought itself. Various factors meant Syrian farmers were particularly vulnerable to drought. An overuse of water to nourish thirsty crops such as cotton had left the land dry and degraded. The government had also cancelled subsidies for fuel used to power irrigation pumps and to take produce to market – and it had dismantled a micro-finance network that had served as an income security net. A national drought strategy that had been approved in 2006 was not implemented once the rains dried up. The second stage of the Syrian narrative is that migration causes violent conflict. While some research does suggest a connection, there is also evidence suggesting no strong link at all. By simply looking at migration flows past and present, we can see that violent conflict is rare. In fact, migration may actually strengthen social and economic conditions in receiving communities in the developing world. While urban migration does not cause development per se, sustained economic development does not occur without it. Religious, social and ethnic integration may also improve as contact with one another increases. However, migration can also promote conflict, through increased competition for resources and services, and tensions due to ethnic and demographic changes. The potential for conflict in a given urban space is mitigated by factors such as the destination area’s ability to absorb migrants, the permanency of people’s migration, and whether there is already social and/or political instability. In the case of Syria, there was a mass exodus of farming families from the worst drought-affected areas in the north of the country (the agricultural bread basket of Syria) to the nearby cities of Damascus, Hama and Aleppo. However, what role this migration played in helping to fuel the uprisings and then the conflict is far from clear.  The initial protests broke out in the city of Daraa, in the south-east of the country, in response to the arrests and mistreatment of a group of youths allegedly caught painting anti-government graffiti. What started as a provincial uprising spread to other parts of the country where deep-seated socio-political dissatisfaction had been simmering for years. What this sequence of events highlights is that the conflict is a culmination of several interconnected factors that had been steadily developing over decades. While drought, migration and conflict may all be linked by association, such links are not established facts and, in the case of Syria, they are difficult to gauge. What can be said with much greater certainty is that economic struggles stemming from drought vulnerability, the loss of subsidies and the loss of agricultural wages did contribute to widespread dissatisfaction with the government. And it was this dissatisfaction which served as a rallying cry to unite people in opposition."
"Dear readers, The Guardian believes in open journalism, which is why we’ve never put up a paywall. Your continuing support allows us to keep our reporting and analysis accessible to readers across the world. Last year you helped us raise more than $1m in our year-end campaign.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the news (the Associated Press, Seth Borenstein) 2014 is the hottest year on record. His numbers come from NOAA and NASA, so of course they are correct (sarc off).
And of course the record Seth is quoting only goes back to the last half of the Nineteenth Century, so that leaves out the Medieval Warm Period, the Roman Warm Period, the Minoan Warm Period, the Holocene Climate Optimum, and previous interglacials, but I digress.
Several things are left out of most of the discussions on the relative warmness of 2014:

Statistically, averaging thermometer readings that are accurate to 1 degree and sussing out a record that differs from another year by 0.01°C is one problem.
Spatially, averaging grid boxes that have as few as one thermometer, (and more than a few have zero!) with grids boxes that have scores of thermometers is another problem.
Correcting (homogenizing) a city thermometer by adjusting adjacent rural thermometers upwards to “correct” for the urban heat island is a whole different problem.
Pretending that changing the measuring instrument type and numbers, as well as the measurement times world-wide in the 1980’s and 90’s, didn’t change the resulting readings is also a large problem. See here and here.
This report is also guilty of “cherry-picking”. If it is the Meteorological Year that is picked, December to November, the record is still held by 2010, by 0.01°C. If it is satellite data (UAH) that is picked, 1998 is still the record, 0.15°C warmer than 2014.


Figure 1 is the latest GHCN and UAH Meteorological Year (December through November) data, along with the difference plot when the data are matched (normalized) at 1979.
In Figure 1, except for El Niño years, satellite data is not warming nearly as fast as the GHCN global data. The difference is now averaging more than 0.1°C.

GHCN adjustments
GHCN is constantly changing their data. Every time they get new data, they completely recalculate the whole database all the way back to 1880. This gives ample opportunity for confirmation bias to adjust the numbers. Here is an example. I had downloaded the global data last September, with numbers updated through August. Just now, I downloaded the current data with the numbers through December, completing both the meteorological and calendar years. Here is a chart of the monthly differences between the two data sets for the last 17 years Beware. This data will change every time they get new data and recalculate. The chart shown was from data downloaded at 1 PM eastern time on January 18th, 2015, today. It is different from the data I downloaded last Friday.

Figure 2 is a plot of the changes in GHCN data for all the months since 1998 up to August of last year. The vertical scale is in 1/100 degree C.
The changes are small, but they are nearly all in one direction, warmer. One would think that data corrections would be in both directions, some warmer, some cooler, but in the last 17 years, a total of 200 months, only three months were corrected in the cooler direction. Note that in the last year the corrections were mostly in the warmer direction by .02° or more. Only one, August in the September update, was cooled. It was completely offset by the July change. All the changes in the first six months of 2014 were sufficient to make 2014 the warmest calendar year.

"Global heating is “supercharging” an increasingly dangerous climate mechanism in the Indian Ocean that has played a role in disasters this year including bushfires in Australia and floods in Africa. Scientists and humanitarian officials say this year’s record Indian Ocean dipole, as the phenomenon is known, threatens to reappear more regularly and in a more extreme form as sea surface temperatures rise. Of most concern are years in which the sea surface off the coast of Africa warms up, provoking increased rains, while temperatures off Australia fall, leading to drier weather. It is similar to El Niño and La Niña in the Pacific, which cause sharp changes in weather patterns on both sides of the ocean. Caroline Ummenhofer, a scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts who has been a key figure in efforts to understand the importance of the dipole, said unique factors were at play in the Indian Ocean compared with other tropical regions. While ocean currents and winds in the Atlantic and Pacific can disperse heating water, the large Asian landmass to the north of the Indian Ocean makes it particularly susceptible to retaining heat. “It’s quite different to the tropical Atlantic and tropical Pacific events. There you have you have steady easterly trade winds. In the Indian Ocean that’s not the case,” Ummenhofer said. “There is a certain season where you have easterly winds. Otherwise you have seasonally reversing monsoon winds, which makes for very different dynamics.” Recent research suggests ocean heat has risen dramatically over the past decade, leading to the potential for warming water in the Indian Ocean to affect the Indian monsoon, one of the most important climate patterns in the world. “There has been research suggesting that Indian Ocean dipole events have become more common with the warming in the last 50 years, with climate models suggesting a tendency for such events to become more frequent and becoming stronger,” Ummenhofer said. She said warming appeared to be “supercharging” mechanisms already existing in the background. “The Indian Ocean is particularly sensitive to a warming world. It is the canary in the coalmine seeing big changes before others come to other tropical ocean areas.” Australian climatologists have pointed to this year’s dipole as at least one of the contributing factors in the bushfires. Jonathan Pollock, of Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology, said this dipole was “up there as one of the strongest” on record. Gemma Connell, of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, raised concern over the impact of stronger and more regular Indian Ocean dipole events on Africa. “What we are seeing from the current record events is large-scale flooding across the region. Entire swathes are under water, affecting 2.5 million people,” she said. “And putting it in the broader picture of the climate crisis, this flooding is coming on the back of two droughts. What we are seeing, and what we are going to see more of, is more frequent climatic shocks coming. And all that is on top of the violence and conflict that has already displaced many of the people involved. “In Kenya, for example, the region hardest hit has been around Lake Turkana, where there are already global malnutrition rates above 30% following drought. People are trying to cope with back-to-back shocks and their resilience has been eroded.” Another concern for Connell and other humanitarian officials is that although climate scientists are racing to try to develop predictive modelling, there is disagreement over whether stronger Indian Ocean dipole events will lead to a wetter climate for Africa or a drier one. “As non-meteorologists trying to plan ahead, we’re being faced with complex and changing scenarios. We’re just running to keep up. Looking now at southern and eastern Africa, with failed rainy seasons and then flooding, none of it looks normal,” she said. “The new normal is a severe weather events. Looking at the Indian Ocean dipole’s effects, you have to see this is as a preview of what can be expected in other parts of world. And while I’m not surprised that attention of the world is elsewhere, that is still unforgivable given how many are suffering from a phenomenon the rest of the world helped create.” "

Share this...FacebookTwitterFace it. When it comes to environmental protection, the EU can be awfully strict. Drop just a single molecule of something hazardous out somewhere in nature, and expect it to be treated like the crime of the century. That’s the way it usually is with eco-bureaucrats, except of course when it comes to green energies like ugly wind turbines. There everything suddenly has no real environmental impact, and so they get a free pass.
German news weekly Der Spiegel here recently reported on how windmills are now polluting the North Sea through their corrosion protection systems. Spiegel writes:
With the continued expansion of wind parks out to sea, over the coming decades thousands of tons of toxic metal compounds will be brought into the North and Baltic Seas. The reason is the use of so-called sacrificial anodes. These are for preventing the corrosion of the steel bases of the wind parks.
Spiegel describes how these sacrificial anodes, which contain heavy metals, dissolve over time in the water and that no environmental impact study has ever been conducted. According to Spiegel just the interior corrosion protection of each steel tower will dump up to ten tons of aluminum over its 25-year lifetime. Yes, “each tower”!
With plans to install 6500 turbines out to sea by the year 2020, Spiegel calculates that this means 13,000 tons of aluminum rubbish could end up in the North Sea.
The German weekly also writes that the electrical method of corrosion protection, such as that used on ships, is also possible, but that the method is too expensive due to “higher maintenance requirements”. After all, wind power is already unaffordable enough!
So in Europe are 13,000 tonnes of chemical rubbish getting dumped into the sea anything to really worry about? Obviously not if they comes from “green” sources.

"There are parts of Louisville, Kentucky, that are enveloped in green, where towering trees arc over broad avenues and walkers, joggers and bikers enjoy beautiful parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the man who drew up plans for Manhattan’s Central Park. Even on the hottest days of summer, these neighbourhoods feel comparatively refreshing next to the more sun-baked quarters of the city, where shade is often an unavailable commodity on the street.  Cities are their own climates, often hotter than their surroundings due to the way surfaces like asphalt trap heat even as cars and buildings exude it. When a city is markedly warmer than surrounding rural areas, it is called an urban heat island – and Louisville ranks among the worst heat islands in the US, according to a 2014 study, with an average temperature difference of 2.7C (4.8F). Worse still, a 2012 study by Georgia Tech’s Urban Climate Lab found that Louisville was the fastest-warming urban heat island in the nation. Part of the reason for Louisville’s temperature extremes is geography. But a lot of it comes down to trees. Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis. This year saw the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those  as far north as Alaska, where thermometers hit 90F (32C) for the first time.  This week Guardian Cities is examining the growing challenges for US cities and the best ideas for reducing the impact of the climate crisis on communities.  Mark Oliver, special projects editor, Guardian US A study commissioned by Louisville in 2015 found that the city had lost 54,000 trees a year between 2004 and 2012, reducing the city’s canopy cover from 40% to 37% over the period. Today, canopy cover is likely to be around 27%, according to Cindi Sullivan, executive director and president of the nonprofit TreesLouisville. Trees provide shade while also lowering the temperature of their surroundings through evaporative cooling. Without action, it is feared the tree canopy will continue to decline as trees fall due to storms, pests and age – a scenario that could see the city’s rapid warming continue, alongside a number of other deleterious effects. “Without a robust tree canopy,” said Sullivan, “our air quality is going to continue to decrease, stormwater and flooding from these extreme weather events is going to increase, the effects of draught are going to increase. There will be more health problems.” And while Louisville may be among the worst heat islands, the problems seen here are replicated nationwide – the city was only fifth-worst US heat island in the 2014 study, behind Las Vegas, Albuquerque, Denver and Portland, Oregon. “Most cities by the middle of the century [will be becoming] increasingly dangerous places to be outside,” said Brian Stone Jr, who wrote the Georgia Tech report on urban heat islands. “So if no steps are taken, that will just be amplified.” He added: “I think this is a non-trivial health-related issue for all large cities in the US. “It isn’t just that heat is uncomfortable – it kills people and is only set to get worse as the climate crisis continues.” While individual cities have little ability to impact the planet-wide climate crisis on their own, they do have the ability to temper the urban heat island effect within their own borders. Louisville is hoping to do just that. When it was named the fastest-warming US city in 2012, it did not take its new superlative lightly. The city created an office of sustainability, hired an urban forester and tapped Stone to conduct an urban heat management study, the first of its kind for a major American city. The city’s main approach to cooling itself has been twofold: promoting the use of more “cool surfaces” for paving and roofs to reflect radiation and heat away, but, more importantly, encouraging the planting of trees. “You need to do both. It’s not one silver bullet,” said Maria Koetter, formerly head of the city’s office of sustainability. TreesLouisville offers free trees to Louisville’s residents that can either be delivered to them or picked up. The group, in conjunction with the city, also offers a rebate to residents of up to 40% of a tree’s price – up to $80 – for trees they purchased themselves. Sullivan says that with 70% of the land available to plant in Louisville privately owned, getting individual families and businesses to plant trees is the only way the city can preserve and ultimately grow its tree canopy. “Five or six decades ago you wouldn’t move into a house without planting a tree, because that tree was your air conditioning,” she said. “So the idea that trees are a valuable asset is something that is not front of mind anymore for many people.” The Depave Project aims to plant trees in parking lots, and the city is offering rebates to residents and businesses that use cool roofs. Meanwhile, the University of Louisville’s Green Heart Project has just started to plant the first of its 10,000 trees in south Louisville neighbourhoods as part of a study looking into the impact on greenery on health that it says is the first of its kind. Aruni Bhatnagar, the professor of medicine leading the project, calls it “a community-based clinical trial in which instead of pills, we have trees.” The main hypothesis of the estimated project, which is expected to cost $20m, is that planting trees will reduce air pollution and thus improve cardiovascular health. But Bhatnagar says they will also be looking closely at secondary outcomes: when it’s greener and cooler, will residents be more inspired to exercise outside, lowering rates of diabetes and obesity? Will stress and anxiety levels drop? Will trees shield enough noise that sleep quality and duration improves? In cities like Louisville, tree canopy cover often corresponds directly with things like race and income, bringing heat, lack of shade and the associated heat-related health problems to areas already suffering other inequalities. An NPR analysis of 97 major US cities this summer found that poorer neighbourhoods were more likely to be hotter in more than three-quarters of the cities. Sullivan said a TreesLouisville analysis had found that Louisville neighbourhoods that were red-lined in the 1930s – that is, where loans and other services were refused based on racial discrimination – have 22% canopy cover today, while those that weren’t red-lined have 49%. In announcing the city’s study of its heat island problem in 2016, Louisville mayor Greg Fischer said: “We know that too often the zip code where you are born can correlate with negative health outcomes. That’s unacceptable.” But getting Louisville to a tree canopy cover to the city’s goal of between 40% and 45% may prove difficult. Reaching those goals could take decades and cost north of $1bn, according to the city’s canopy study. Money is tight and the city, despite its commitment to the heat island issue, recently folded its office of sustainability into another department and laid off Koetter, the office’s director. “I wouldn’t say we are necessarily on the path” to addressing the heat island effect, says Koetter. “I would say we are aware of what needs to happen.” She added that to meet its tree canopy goals, Louisville needed to plant about 100,000 trees a year for the first 10 years of a canopy building program, but that she did not see the city as being able to generate enough revenue to do that. Stone, the Urban Climate Lab director, pointed out that New York City was able to plant 1 million trees over the course of eight years, but said he was less optimistic that Louisville could reach its tree canopy goals. In 2017, Louisville passed an ordinance requiring that trees removed from public rights of way must be replaced. A new tree-protecting ordinance that would require developments to maintain certain levels of tree canopy cover is currently being considered by the city’s metro council. “We’re in a situation right now where many tree advocates and environmentalists think it doesn’t go far enough, that the percentage of trees that need to be saved in new developments needs to be increased,” said Bill Hollander, the councilman who introduced the proposal. “We also have some members of the development community saying it goes too far.” Sullivan of TreesLouisville said the proposed ordinance is a step in the right direction, but that more needs to be done – and fast. “There’s an old eastern adage that says the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second-best time is now,” she said. “We’re way behind, I’d say decades behind other communities that have already figured some of this out.” Ebony Pryor, 42, hopes the planting being done now will make a difference. She works as a business manager at New Birth Church in Rubbertown, a largely industrial area of the city known for its chemical plants. In the summer, eggy, sulfury smells waft into the church on some days and the heat is relentless. “It’s just straight sun and it’s 10 degrees or more hotter down here than other parts of the city,” she said. “That’s where the trees come in. The trees will be able to take some of that smell out – and definitely shade the area.” TreesLouisville recently planted young trees at New Birth Church, the first of 10,000 trees the group plans to put in Rubbertown in the coming years. “While you don’t seen an immediate effect, over time it will improve and help the quality of life down here,” said Pryor. In 10 or 15 years, “I think it’s going to be beautiful – and smell good.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"

Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne site here.
At the online finanznachrichten.de there’s a short report about a recent Swiss vote on a Greens-Liberals energy tax initiative. The result:
92 percent voted against the initiative that would tax the consumption of non-renewable energies such as oil, gas, coal and uranium instead of having a value added tax. According to the Greens-Liberals it would be an effective instrument for reducing energy consumption and for promoting renewable energies.”
In summary on a few fringe activists in Switzerland are interested in taxing reliable and still affordable fossil and nuclear energy.

The Swiss Blick.ch called the result “an historic debacle” and “the most massive slap up beside the head ever” that a citizens’ initiative has ever suffered in Switzerland. Blick.ch writes:
The failure was historic – no initiative has ever gotten a result of less than 10 percent.”
Die kalte Sonne comments on the result, reminding us that it was…:
…the most clear rejection by the citizens since the founding of the modern Swiss federal state in 1848. It is also notable that the parties who supported the petition for a referendum, “The Green-Liberals” and “The Greens”, were not even able to convince many of their own voters. Both parties together represent 13.8% of all voters.”
Die kalte Sonne also comments on the lopsidedness of the result, claiming that it is the sort that one is accustomed to seeing in “hardcore communist states”. Only this time the vote was free and offered a choice.

"The Conservative party’s record on tackling the climate crisis has been condemned by leading scientists and former government advisers, as the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, warned that the forthcoming election was the last chance to halt the escalating emergency. Experts accused the Conservatives of copying rightwing politicians in the US by deliberately weakening environmental protections. Meanwhile, analysis by Labour reveals that environmental policies put forward since 2017 and opposed by the Tories would have led to emissions reductions of over 70m tonnes a year by 2030 – more than the annual emissions of Portugal. The climate emergency has become a key battleground in the election, with Labour promising a transformative green industrial revolution, the Liberal Democrats pledging to spend billions on the crisis, and the Conservatives announcing a pre-election moratorium on fracking and pledging to plant 30m trees a year by 2025. On Sunday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Conservatives could not be trusted on the environment. “This general election is our last chance to radically change course, or face the threat of a hostile and dying planet,” he said. “The science is clear – we don’t have time to waste.” He said Labour’s green industrial revolution would create hundreds of thousands of “good, clean jobs that will transform towns, cities and communities that have been held back and neglected for decades”. The Conservatives have come under increasing pressure on the climate crisis during the election campaign and recent analysis shows they are on course to miss several key environmental targets. Boris Johnson is the only party leader to have refused to take part in a TV climate debate, and he drew anger in Yorkshire last week when confronted by people whose livelihoods had been devastated by the floods. In Somerset, Johnson dodged environmental protesters, whom he later dismissed as “crusties”. Leading scientist David King, a key government adviser on the climate crisis until 2017, questioned whether Johnson could be trusted on the environment. He said he would give the Conservatives no more than three or four out of 10 for their record on tackling the climate crisis. “I wouldn’t give them a pass mark. The leadership has simply not been there,” said King, who was Britain’s climate ambassador at the Paris talks that led to the landmark 2015 agreement pledging to keep global heating below 2C, or 1.5C if possible. “The government has completely taken its eye off delivery and it has not been as consistent as it needed to be. If there isn’t support across the board from No 10, then it’s not going to happen.” He added: “The Conservatives are trying to be greener than the other parties, but I wonder just how much we can trust the Conservative party leadership at the moment.” Tom Burke, a former senior adviser to three Conservative environment secretaries, said the government’s record was a disgrace and accused it of aping the libertarian right in the US. “The current government has systematically weakened the capacity of this country to manage its environment. It’s been done by stealth. “They have taken a lesson, I suspect quite consciously, from the libertarian right in the US that you won’t win the argument about weakening environmental standards, so you don’t argue it. What you do is you weaken the capacity to make them effective. “They have completely cut the budgets of the Environment Agency and Natural England and they have systematically reduced their independence,” said Burke, who was a senior adviser to the Foreign Office special representative on climate change from 2006 to 2012 and now runs the environmental thinktank E3G. In a much vaunted announcement, the Conservatives this year committed to making the country carbon net zero by 2050. But their own climate change committee, in its latest analysis of their performance, said there was a growing gap between Britain’s carbon cutting ambition and the policies in place to achieve it. The committee said the government was likely to miss greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets from 2023 onwards, there was still no serious plan for decarbonising UK heating systems, and a tree planting target of 20,000 hectares a year in the UK was not being met. In other key areas, including tackling illegal levels of air pollution – which, the latest government data shows, covers 83% of the country – and water quality, the Conservative government is likely to fail to meet its legal obligations and targets. It is also set to miss targets for boosting renewable energy such as onshore wind and solar, according to a Greenpeace analysis. Carbon emissions from transport, which is responsible for a third of UK greenhouse gas emissions, remain static. Katie Nield, a lawyer for Client Earth, which has successfully taken the government to court on several occasions for its failure to clean up air pollution, said the Tories’ record on tackling toxic air was poor. “We have had these legal limits for nitrogen dioxide since 2010 in place – that’s almost 10 years. Yet they have still not met them. That is despite having a very clear idea of where the problems are, what the causes are and what potential solutions there are. And a failure to act in that context is quite shocking.” The analysis from the Labour party shows that policies opposed by the government on onshore and offshore wind power, home improvements and insulation, tidal power and transport would have led to nearly 70m tonnes of CO2 emissions savings per year by 2030. Luke Clark, from Renewable UK, the renewable energy industry trade association, said the government in the last five years had excluded onshore wind and solar from the competitive market for renewable projects, which had led to an 80% fall in onshore wind installed in 2018, compared with the previous 12 months. “If [we] are not using cheap sources like onshore wind and solar, we are slowing down the process of how quickly we can achieve decarbonisation,” said Clark. “To tackle the climate emergency, we need all these options.” Greg Archer, a director of the zero-emissions pressure group Transport & Environment, in a new analysis of the Conservatives’ nine-year freeze on fuel duty, said the policy had put the equivalent of 2.5m additional cars on the road. “Conservative action to tackle transport emissions has been a story of wrong priorities, little action and missed opportunities, and whilst it has talked green, transport emissions have flatlined for 10 years,” said Archer. “Grants for electric cars have been cut and are scheduled to end in March 2020, stalling progress.” In addition, UK aviation emissions were forecast to continue to rise, but the government was advocating additional runways, including the Heathrow third runway and new terminals, said Archer. Next year will be a critical in the fight to tackle the climate crisis, with the UK hosting the most important climate conference since the 2015 Paris agreement was signed. Experts say that will lead to unprecedented scrutiny of the environment policies of the new government, which will set the tone for the international response to the escalating global emergency. A Guardian investigation earlier this year found Conservative MPs were almost five times as likely to vote against climate action as legislators from other parties. Boris Johnson was among several dozen MPs, mostly Conservatives, who recorded the worst possible score of zero on the Guardian’s climate scorecard of MPs. Theresa Villiers, the environment secretary, said: “The Conservatives have taken world-leading action to tackle climate change – legislating to achieve net zero, reducing emissions by a quarter since coming to office in 2010, and boosting renewables to record levels. “We have set manageable targets that will bring society with us. Corbyn’s Labour would ban people from using their cars or taking flights, and their plans have been slammed by their own unions as ‘utterly unachievable’. “Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will get Brexit done so we can continue tackling climate change while successfully growing our economy.”"
"Hurricanes in the Caribbean and deadly floods across South Asia have once again raised the issue of climate justice.  The association between such events and climate change is now beyond serious question: we have had 30 years of well-founded scientific warnings about the relationship between increasing global temperatures and the incidence and severity of extreme weather. Much more problematic is the question of responsibility for climate change itself, and who should justly pay compensation for the resulting damage. This is complicated, and there are no clear categories of winners and losers, or responsible and blameless. Consider how the benefits from greenhouse gas emissions are usually divorced from the impacts of climate change, yet hurricane-hit Texas owes much of its wealth to oil. Or look at the extraordinary inequalities among those affected by the storms – most are relatively poor, but a few are among the world’s richest people. International debate on climate justice has usually occurred within the UN, via its Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in a process which led to the Paris Agreement. For much of the time since its inception in 1992 there was a heavy focus on cutting emissions rather than on adaptation to the damaging consequences of climate change.  Responsibility for global warming was usually framed as an obligation for developed states to make the initial moves to reduce their emissions, under the concept of “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities”. Climate justice was seen as something developed states owed less developed states, and were obliged to deliver so the latter had an incentive to cut their emissions, too. However, by the Bali conference in 2007 it was clear that climate-related sea level rise and extreme weather events were already happening. Adaptation was therefore moved up the agenda alongside emissions cuts. In crude terms, if the developed world wanted a new comprehensive agreement on tackling climate change it would have to provide sufficient guarantees of assistance for the less developed majority. These included a proposed US$100 billion per annum Green Climate Fund but also new form of compensation for “loss and damage for countries vulnerable” to hurricanes and other climate-related disasters. The “loss and damage” mechanism made it into the 2015 Paris Agreement but has not yet been fully implemented. It was a controversial topic, however, as it raised the question of liability or even reparation for climate damage. Direct responsibility was both difficult to establish and resolutely rejected by developed countries. The problem is these issues are discussed within the context of a system of self-interested nation states. Climate change requires a global, concerted effort, yet entrenched political structures within each country reinforce competitive and antagonistic outlooks. It is always difficult, for example, to make the case for foreign governmental assistance when this is ranged against domestic poverty. To be sure, some of the more progressive rich countries do reflect a “communitarian” approach which recognises some moral obligations to assist vulnerable states. This goes beyond the strict minimum in international law of the avoidance of harm, but it certainly does not admit any direct responsibility or liability. At most, this conception of international climate justice is based upon a recognition that the populations of other countries should not be allowed to deteriorate below minimal standards of human existence and is common to other areas of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Yet such state-based thinking remains unable to handle the complexity and all-encompassing nature of climate change. What’s needed is an alternative “cosmopolitan” approach to climate justice. Under cosmopolitanism the focus is on individual human beings and their needs and rights, all of whom would exist in one community where nationality is considered irrelevant to moral worth. This means a Bangladeshi farmer or Caribbean fisherman have as much right to be protected from the impact of global warming as someone in Texas or London and, in this sense, cosmopolitan climate justice mirrors the evolution of international human rights principles.  Nationality is often used to indicate development, or vulnerability to natural hazards, yet such categories are essentially misleading. As illustrated by flooded homes and destroyed roofs everywhere from Barbuda to Houston, it is more useful to think of rich and poor (or safe and vulnerable) people rather than countries.  True climate justice will have to reorientate the debate away from state sovereignty and international standing towards a focus on personal harm. A system of individual carbon accounting would also help so that people make a contribution to poverty reduction  and disaster relief appropriate to their wealth and lifestyle.    As hurricanes engulf numerous countries at once, and indirectly affect even more, climate change powerfully illustrates the need for creative thinking about a truly global cosmopolitanism in which the avoidance of human suffering comes before self-interest and it is recognised that there are many poor and vulnerable people in “rich countries” and fabulously rich people in “poor countries”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow often have we heard the older folks reminiscing about good old fashioned New England winters we used to get 50 years ago? Well, they’re back.
Ironically today’s winters are in fact so tough that journalist Jason Samenow of the online Washington Post here predicts that we may remember the current one “for generations“.
A “severe cold” is set to blast the eastern U.S. later in the week. And bitter cold is projected to persist well into March.
The WaPo writes that “parts of New England could witness its coldest air in years” and that frosty conditions will dip “into central and parts of south Florida“.
According to the WaPo, the cold “can be traced to the polar vortex” coming from the North Pole regions, and that the winter will likely leave a deep imprint in our minds:
For areas of New England buried under multiple feet of snow, the added element of uncompromising cold will present extreme mid-winter conditions that may be recalled for generations.“
Cold plunging from the North Pole deep into the middle latitudes normally means the polar air gets replaced, usually by warmer air from the south. Yet Arctic regions are also seeing polar vortex-like cold effects, with places in Alaska dipping close to -60°F, writes the WaPo.

The cold that is to grip the US east coast is set to come in two waves. The second wave will originate in Siberia, says the WaPo, and temperatures will be at levels that are 30°F below normal along the entire east coast of the US, with bitter cold literally effecting more than 100 million people.

Scientists are baffled by the recent severe cold winters that have struck North America. Ten years ago, when North America saw balmy winters, scientists were trumpeting cold and snowy winters as those of the 1960s and 70s, were “a thing of the past“. Now these old fashioned winters are back from the photo albums and the same red-faced scientists are now claiming these are global-warming frigid winters.
The truth and reality are that this has nothing to do with global warming, but has everything to do with natural cycles…the very ones that have sent global warming packing for 18 years.
Scientists have yet to explain how one distinguishes between a global-warming frigid winter and one that is an old fashioned cold one. Both are the same and arecaused by the same thing: predominant pattern of Arctic air dipping far south for the greater part of the winter season.

"The first ever election leaders’ debate focusing on the climate crisis will be broadcast by Channel 4 next week, with the prime minister the only major party leader set to be absent. Channel 4 News said it was awaiting confirmation from Boris Johnson as to whether he would take part and could place an empty chair in the place of the PM if he declines to attend.  The campaigners Possible – who have been pushing for a leaders’ head-to-head on the climate emergency – said it was a historic moment which put global heating front and centre of the election campaign. During the ITV live leaders debate on 19 November, the Conservative party re-branded their press office account on Twitter as 'factcheckUK', to tweet anti-Corbyn points during the programme to its 75,000 followers. On Twitter accounts there is a username - in this case @CCHQpress - and a screen name, which appears more prominently. The Conservatives changed the screen name to 'factcheckUK', and also changed the logo and biography of the account to read 'fact checking Labour from CCHQ'. No explicit mention of the Conservative party name in full was made, so users would have to know that CCHQ is an acronym for 'Conservative campaign headquarters' in order to understand who was providing the fake fact-checking service. Because the @CCHQPress account on Twitter is 'verified', it means when it appears it has a blue check mark next to the name, to show that Twitter has 'verified' that the account is who it says it is. This was retained while the account was tweeting under the false name 'factcheckUK'.  Martin Belam Max Wakefield, the director of Possible, said: “With poll after poll showing huge demand for emergency action from the political parties this has to be our first climate election. “It’s in the prime minister’s hands to make this happen, show leadership on the defining issue of our time – and prove he’s ready to take on the challenge if elected.” Earlier this week leaders from all the main opposition parties wrote to Johnson urging him to take part in any televised debate on the environmental emergency before the election. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, the Liberal Democrats leader, Jo Swinson, and the co-leaders of the Green party, Jonathan Bartley and Siân Berry, argued that the public had a right to know what political leaders intended to do to avoid “the irreversible impacts of environmental breakdown”. All have agreed to take part in next week’s debate. In the letter they stated: “The climate and nature emergencies threaten everything we hold dear; the jobs we do, the health service we rely on, the houses we live in and the food that we grow and eat. The public are right to look to us, their politicians, for leadership. The ambition of our response must match the scale of the challenge.” The Conservatives, whose environmental record was condemned by leading climate scientists and former government advisers this week, told Possible that Johnson would not participate because he did not want environmental issues to be “siloed”. The Tory party has been approached for comment. The idea of a televised climate debate has gained widespread support since it was launched by school strikers, students and pensioners’ groups earlier this month. More than 500 scientists – including Sir David King, a key government adviser on the climate crisis until 2017 – have backed the plan. Beccy Speight, the RSPB’s chief executive, said: “We must have the opportunity to scrutinise those vying to be our next prime minister on how they will deliver action at the unprecedented scale required.” In the past two weeks, the campaign has also received support from more than 70 organisations with a total membership of more than 10 million, including the Women’s Institute, the National Trust and the National Education Union. And more than 188,000 people have signed a petition supporting Possible’s campaign. The climate emergency has been forced up the political agenda in the past year as growing evidence of the crisis – from floods to wildfires, record temperatures to melting ice – has become impossible to ignore.

"Over the past century half of the world’s ponds and wetlands have been destroyed, with many being filled in and turned into agricultural land. However, all is not lost, and it is possible to “resurrect” these buried habitats from the seeds and eggs stored within their historic sediments. A new conservation approach pioneered by the UCL Pond Restoration Research Group can restore aquatic habitats lost to the landscape for centuries. Ponds can be extremely biodiverse. They support more aquatic species than any other freshwater habitat and provide important food sources for farmland birds and bats.  At the start of the 20th century there were an estimated 800,000 ponds in England and Wales – now, it is thought that fewer than a quarter of these remain. Similar levels of pond loss have occurred across farmland in Europe and North America, associated with increasing intensification of agriculture. Pond and hedgerow loss are often linked as hedges are uprooted and used to fill in ponds, before ploughing over the entire area.  Many lost ponds leave behind a “ghostly” mark in the landscape – visible as damp depressions, areas of poor crop cover, or changes in soil colour. Colleagues and I have recently discovered that these buried “ghost ponds” are not completely lost, but can be resurrected from historic seeds lying dormant underneath intensively cultivated agricultural fields.  These ghosts are an abundant yet overlooked conservation resource. Resurrecting them would of course mean more ponds, which in turn links up aquatic landscapes as plants and animals jump from pond to pond and species are able to thrive in larger populations. But the main advantage of a ghost pond, compared to a new pond, is the historic seed bank buried below the surface. This provides a source of local native species, speeding up the process of colonisation, and potentially restoring lost populations or even locally extinct species to the resurrected pond. We already knew that aquatic seeds were able to survive dormant for centuries within existing lakes and wetlands. Scientists recently tested 13 lakes in Russia, for instance, and found stoneworts (a keystone species in aquatic habitats), could grow from 300 year-old spores collected from lake sediments.  However, our recent paper, published in the journal Biological Conservation, is the first to demonstrate this astonishing survival ability within habitats which had been assumed lost to agriculture. In our study, we resurrected three ghost ponds in north Norfolk, eastern England. These ponds were similar in type, location and surrounding land use to the 8,000-plus ghost ponds buried across Norfolk and many more across the UK. While buried, ghost ponds are subject to the typical stresses of intensive agriculture (soil compaction, fertiliser and herbicide use), making the long-term survival of their aquatic seed banks particularly astonishing. Our three study ponds had been buried for around 45, 50 and 150 years. Each was re-excavated down to the pond’s historic level, which was easily distinguished from the overlying topsoil by its dark colour, silty texture, and even its distinctive “pond smell”. This layer of sediment was left mostly undisturbed to provide the source of historic seeds and eggs within each pond. All three ghost ponds were colonised within six months by native plant species. In total, 12 species of aquatic plant colonised the ghost ponds and eight of these species proved to have originated from the seeds that had lain dormant below the ground. To check these plants really had grown from the ghostly remains of the previous pond, and hadn’t been carried in by the wind or seed-eating birds, we kept some of the historic sediment in sealed aquariums. There, even under controlled conditions, the same species still grew out of this centuries-old sediment. Species recolonising from the historic seed bank included stoneworts, which are important for maintaining water quality but are increasingly threatened in farmland, and floating leaved pondweeds, which provide key habitat for dragonflies and damselflies. We also found crustaceans including Daphnia (water fleas), and copepods (tiny invertebrates which swim in a jumpy motion using their antennae), were able to hatch from eggs buried in the ghost pond sediment samples. Although only common species were resurrected from the sediments of our three ghost ponds, these included seeds of all different sizes and types – from a variety of aquatic plant species. This suggests that a wide range of plants, including potentially rare or even locally extinct species, could potentially survive within the buried sediments of ghost ponds. The boost to recolonisation speed and diversity from the historic seed and egg bank may also reduce the risk of invasive species becoming established. Ghost ponds represent abundant yet overlooked biological time capsules. Their restoration could facilitate the rapid return of wetland habitats and aquatic plants into the agricultural landscape. This process could play a significant role in reversing some of the habitat and biodiversity losses caused by the global disappearance of agricultural wetlands – and I urge conservationists to make use of this valuable yet hitherto little considered resource."
"Much of Britain’s infrastructure is long past its sell-by date. This is partly down to ineffective financing, a lack of investment, and a government preference for fancy megaprojects over boring-but-crucial things like the energy grid. History shows, however, that there is another, simpler reason. This is the neglect of project management, namely, the planning and construction of infrastructure projects. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the UK’s pitiful record with power stations. Just look at Hinkley Point C. In its desire to avoid British consumers subsidising construction, and its belief that the private sector could simply build a nuclear power plant, the government has effectively handed over project management responsibilities and oversight to French state energy firm EDF. This means it now has little say in or control over any construction problems, the cost of which EDF will recoup through a very generous fixed price for the electricity the plant generates. Under the present arrangement, the British government cannot do much about the fact its flagship nuclear project is already £1.5 billion over budget and a year behind schedule. Failure to ensure that power plants are built on time and on budget goes back much further. In fact, long lead times, engineering problems, cost overruns, and construction delays have been problems in the UK since the early 1960s. A 1963 select committee report on the electricity industry pointed out that it took five years for a station to be commissioned in the UK, compared to two-and-a-half years in the US and just 13 months in Japan. A few years later, the National Board for Prices and Income found that incomplete power stations were costing the taxpayer around £30m a year in annual interest payments alone, roughly £345m in today’s money. Nuclear power plants were by far the worse. In the mid-1960s, the UK decided to build a series of plants using a British-designed advanced gas cooled reactor (AGR) that had never been built on a commercial scale. Construction was hampered by engineering problems, however. For example, Dungeness B station in Kent, the first AGR station, started construction in 1965 and was meant to be completed within five years. But the station wasn’t connected to the grid until 1983, and didn’t start commercial operation until 1985, 15 years behind schedule. As early as 1969, the Wilson Committee, which was set up to examine the causes of these delays, pointed to inefficient management. Project managers responsible for overseeing construction were either incompetent or had little incentive to speed things up, and the committee recommended more authority should be exerted over them. Its suggestion was echoed that same year by the select committee on science and technology, which argued that inadequate attention on site had led to many breakdowns of power station generators. The problem was the government did not take much heed of these recommendations. Records held at The National Archives from this period show there was little urgency among civil servants or politicians to rectify the situation. Nuclear energy was considered  crucial to Britain’s energy security and industrial strategy, but much less importance was placed on ensuring that the nuclear plants were built on time. Roy Mason, minister of power in the late 60s, went so far as to obstruct the construction of a nuclear power plant to appease the National Union of Mineworkers. In fact, there seemed little realisation within government that a key to successful infrastructure project lay in efficient project management – and the the ability to construct on budget and on time. Hinkley shows that this same tendency to overlook the importance of project management still exists today. It’s just one aspect of infrastructure policy, of course. But until the government starts making project management more of a priority there is no guarantee the UK will get its infrastructure right. Funds and financing are important but what actually happens on construction sites is equally, if not even more, crucial."
"More than 50m people in Pakistan are at risk of arsenic poisoning from contaminated groundwater. That’s according to a study recently published in the journal Science Advances, based on samples from 1,200 wells across the country. Arsenic cannot be removed from groundwater through common processes such as boiling or filtration – instead it requires expensive procedures such as reverse osmosis which are beyond the reach of most poor people. Contamination is particularly worrying in this case as Pakistan is unusually dependant on a single, vast underground natural reservoir known as the Indus basin aquifer. The aquifer covers an area of 160,000km² – making it slightly larger than England – and spans Pakistan’s border with India.  Arsenic contamination may not even be the most alarming thing about the aquifer, however. At current rates of groundwater mining there is considerable risk the wells will eventually run dry. Both Pakistan and India have historically subsidised electricity and diesel for running agricultural wells that tap into the aquifer. Groundwater users only pay for the energy used to mine the resource; the water itself is not metered or priced. The aquifer is literally free for anyone to tap into by drilling a well – whether it is for agricultural, industrial or domestic purposes.  Both countries are taking out far more water than is being replenished by rain or rivers. In fact, India extracts more groundwater than any other country in the world (not just from the Indus), and Pakistan is fourth in the list. The Indus aquifer is already the second most “overstressed” groundwater basin in the world and, at current rates of use, reserves like this may be “severely depleted” over the next few decades.  More than 300m people live in the largely agricultural and extensively irrigated Indus basin. Of the total water used for irrigation about half comes from the aquifer below ground, rather than rainwater or the river itself and its various tributaries. There are irrigation canals, but their flow is concentrated in the summer monsoon period and isn’t as readily available as groundwater. Despite increased concerns over groundwater use, governments on both sides of the border have been encouraging farmers to produce and export water-intensive food crops and livestock products. Given lots of water from a fast-diminishing aquifer is needed to produce everything from a grain of rice to a slab of beef, this trade amounts to “virtual water” exports. “Virtual water” refers to water embedded in trade products. A country that exports rice is in effect also exporting the water that is used to grow rice. This is why water-starved countries such as Saudia Arabia have stopped growing products like wheat. Importing food instead essentially means they “import” water rather than using their own scarce reserves. Key exports from India and Pakistan including rice, sugar, cotton and textiles all require lots of water to produce. In addition, both governments are incentivising the growth of meat exports through the use of various subsidies, without considering the water footprint. Pakistan’s halal meat export trade has grown more than ten-fold in the past decade, for instance – mainly to water-scarce  countries such as Saudi Arabia.  Growing development pressures and increasing industrialisation in India and Pakistan also contribute to increased groundwater stress and pollution. Though official estimates say industry uses a mere 2% of the groundwater extracted in India, and even less in Pakistan, the reality is likely to be much more. In the Indus region, the aquifer is crucial for water-intensive sectors such as textiles or leather and, in practice, industrial mining of the region’s groundwater is not metered or priced. Most industrial units also discharge untreated effluents in unlined pits, which eventually seep into the ground and has resulted in severe contamination of the water table. In India, some states where groundwater levels are critical now require a license to drill new wells. In Pakistan, however, unlicensed drilling continues. The current legal framework for groundwater is spread across a variety of instruments both from colonial and post-colonial times, as well as local customs that often conflict with each other. Property rights are largely defined by an archaic piece of colonial legislation, the Easements Act of 1882, which allows landowners to effectively collect and dispose of underground water as long as it is not a part of a public irrigation network.  Most of the elaborate state irrigation bureaucracy serves to manage and distribute surface water – not the aquifer. India has recently established a Central Groundwater Board, but in Pakistan monitoring and management still happens in silos, with no particular institution taking responsibility for the conservation of the resource."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecently I published an opinion by Harvard astrophysicist Willie Soon concerning the dubious “2014 hottest year ever” claim.
That post is doing very well and continues to be widely shared in the social media – so much so that the piece stung a sensitive nerve over at Climate Nexus. But instead of rebutting Dr. Soon point-by-point, Climate Nexus produced an openly sophomoric rant with the usual name-calling we are all accustomed to from alarmists who run out of arguments.
Here’s what Climate Nexus wrote at their “DENIER ROUNDUP”:
“Denier-for-Hire Preaches About Prostituting Science
While we would normally ignore the low-grade blogs like NoTricksZone as well as bottom-tier, fossil fuel spokesmen-for-hire like Dr. Willie Soon, the two have come together for a post that is just too good to pass up.
NoTricksZone wanted a comment from Soon about how 2014 is shaping up to be the hottest year on record. His reply was a perfect example of a classic defense mechanism identified by Sigmund Freud called psychological projection—where one projects a problem of their own onto others. We see this regularly in deniers who claim “alarmists” ignore or cherry-pick evidence and engage in ideologically driven groupthink, as well as in deniers who name their deceptive and misleading blog “NoTricksZone.”
In this case, it’s Dr. Soon implying that the World Meteorological Organization and anyone else who notes this year’s record heat is “prostituting science.” Which is interesting, considering all of Dr. Soon’s grants since 2002 have come from the fossil fuel industry! Together with Sallie Baliunas, Soon has received over $1 million from dirty energy interests since 2001, according to a number of documents uncovered by Greenpeace.
So here we have someone who’s taken literally hundreds of thousands of dollars from the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil, Charles G. Koch Foundation and other fossil fuel interests with the express purpose of casting doubt on man’s influence on climate, saying independent scientists are “prostituting science.”
I think Freud may want a word with you, Dr. Soon. So have a seat on the couch, and tell us, how is your relationship with your mother?”
No surprise here that Climate Nexus kept the entire focus away from all scientific points made by Soon. Emotionally, it seems they never developed beyond puberty.
On the accusations of Dr. Soon being a “denier-for-hire”, we refer readers to the response Dr. Soon sent to the Guardian already years ago:

I do not write papers because ExxonMobil or Greenpeace pays me to, but because my academic researches demonstrate that the sun, not carbon dioxide, is the chief driver of Arctic temperatures, and that much of the ‘evidence’ for the bears’ imminent demise is speculative. Indeed the population has increased fivefold since the 1950s, mainly because of restricted hunting. Where the Arctic has cooled, bears dwindle: where it has warmed, they increase.
Polar bears evolved from brown bears 200,000 years ago and therefore must have survived the last interglacial period, when global temperatures were many degrees warmer than the present. More perspective and less prejudice, please.
Willie Soon”
Well, let’s not look at the BILLIONS in funding the IPCC alarmists get. Or Phil Jones taking money from Saudi Arabia…or Stanford taking from Exxon-Mobil. Although the list is long and lavish, funding is the popular instrument used to distract audiences from the shite-quality science underpinning alarmist claims. Under the bottom line, the real issue is the integrity of the science and observations, and not who funds it.
And even though skeptics are out-funded by several orders of magnitude, the alarmists are still losing the scientific debate. Running and hiding, dodging debates in public, and refusing to disclose data and code also hardly convince the objective audience.
On the subject of Freud, if he were alive today, I suspect he’d be really interested in psychoanalyzing the frustrated end-of-world-obsessed alarmist who only can derive satisfaction from crystal ball quality catastrophe scenarios.
“Low grade” sites?
Freud might also be interested as to why Climate Nexus characterizes NTZ as a “low-grade” site. According to Alexa (15 Dec), Climate Nexus global ranking is: 1,532,673. NoTricksZone global ranking is 148,886. Sort of like the Queens Park Rangers calling West Ham United a low-grade team in the Premier League. Who’s projecting here?
And who sponsors who?

"Leaders from all the main opposition parties have written to Boris Johnson urging him to take part in a televised debate on the climate crisis before the election. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats and the Green party’s Jonathan Bartley and Siân Berry argue that the public have a right to know what political leaders intend to do to avoid “the irreversible impacts of environmental breakdown”. “The climate and nature emergencies threaten everything we hold dear; the jobs we do, the health service we rely on, the houses we live in and the food that we grow and eat,” they wrote in the letter sent to Johnson on Tuesday. “The public are right to look to us, their politicians, for leadership. The ambition of our response must match the scale of the challenge.” The Conservatives, whose environmental record was condemned by leading climate scientists and former government advisers earlier this week, have failed to respond to questions from the Guardian regarding a climate debate. But a memo sent to the organisers of a public campaign for a climate debate said Johnson would not participate because he did not want environmental issues “siloed”. The idea of a televised climate debate has gained widespread support since it was launched by school strikers, students and pensioners’ groups earlier this month. More than 500 scientists – including Sir David King, a key government adviser on the climate crisis until 2017 – have backed the plan. In a statement, the experts said: “As scientists, we confirm that the youth movement’s concerns are well-founded and rest on highly robust scientific evidence. “Hence, we join their call for a political party leaders’ debate on climate and nature where candidates will outline and discuss their parties’ plans to tackle the climate and ecological crises.” In the past two weeks, the campaign has received support from more than 70 organisations with a total membership of more than 10 million, including the Women’s Institute, the National Trust and the National Education Union. And more than 188,000 people have signed a petition supporting the campaign being run by climate charity Possible. Max Wakefield, the director of Possible, said the poll in December must be the UK’s “first climate election”. “It’s time for all parties to recognise this is the fight of our lives, and debate how to go about the urgent changes we must make to win it.” The climate emergency has been forced up the political agenda in the past year as growing evidence of the crisis – from floods to wildfires, record temperatures to melting ice – has become impossible to ignore. In the UK, hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren have taken to the streets to demand action and Extinction Rebellion protests have brought large parts of London to a standstill. Anna Taylor, the co-founder of UK Student Climate Network, which helped organise the school strikes, said: “Young people now want to hear leaders’ plans to return our futures to us, because that is precisely what is at stake.”"
"Bumblebee queens are a common sight on a spring day, their large furry bodies flying industriously from flower to flower. At this point they will have just awoken from a long hibernation – the much smaller worker bees die off each year, leaving the new queens to survive winter alone. Eating nectar and pollen from these flowers is therefore essential for the queens to build up their energy and fat stores. Once they are fully restored, which can happen within a few days, the queens will look for a nest-site, perhaps an abandoned mouse nest, where they will build up a honey pot and pollen stores prior to laying eggs and founding a new colony of bumblebees.  While this all sounds fairly easy – how hard is it to find flowers in the spring, after all? – the colony-founding stage is actually the most stressful part of the bumblebee lifecycle. Bad weather, starvation, and predators like great tits mean the queens often fail to make it through the winter. The last thing they need is another challenge. But recently, a new potential threat to bumblebee queens has appeared. Neonicotinoids are a class of insecticides that are used on agricultural crops and in gardens to control insect pests. Unfortunately, as well as controlling insect pests, numerous studies have shown that they can also damage beneficial insects like bumblebees. This is because neonicotinoids get into the nectar and pollen of both the crops and the wildflowers that grow nearby, and so into the food of bees.  The European Union imposed a moratorium on their use in crops attractive to bees back in 2013, and similar restrictions are being considered by nations around the globe. During this moratorium, scientists are trying to find out how neonicotinoids affect bees, so we can make evidence-based decisions about their use.  Given the importance of queens and the colony-founding stage in bumblebees, colleagues and I decided to investigate whether exposing queens to neonicotinoids would lead to a reduction in egg-laying and subsequent colony founding. Our results have just been published in Nature Ecology & Evolution. Gemma Baron, the PhD student who led this work, first gathered evidence that bumblebee queens were collecting nectar and pollen from both oil-seed rape – a major neonicotinoid crop and one very attractive to bees – and from wildflowers growing nearby. This meant queens could be consuming these insecticides in the wild. However, to determine the impact of such exposure, we had to turn to the laboratory and the computer.  After mating hundreds of queens in the lab, she then put them through an artificial hibernation in a fridge, before placing them in a special bumblebee rearing room. Half of these queens were given a neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, in nectar at concentrations and quantities they could experience if foraging in and around crops treated with the chemical. The other half were given uncontaminated nectar. Both groups were given as much pollen as they wanted.  Egg-laying by these queens was then recorded over a ten-week period. It turns out that exposure to thiamethoxam made queens 26% less likely to lay eggs, and therefore to found a colony. This seems like a big impact, but what would it actually mean in the real world? Doing experiments with bumblebee queens in the wild is basically impossible. They can fly for kilometres, and frequently abandon artificial nests if allowed to forage freely. So to understand how our lab results might relate to bumblebee populations in the natural world, we turned to mathematical modelling.  Taking advantage of what is known about the dynamics of bumblebee populations in the wild, we factored in the impact of the neonicotinoids we had identified in the laboratory. We found that if bumblebee queens fed on nectar contaminated with thiamethoxam this could increase the probability of their population going extinct by at least 28%.  What does all this matter? Bees are essential pollinators of both crops and wildflowers, and bumblebees provide nearly half of all pollination in northern temperate regions like the UK. Given that their populations are already falling, we need to understand why they are declining in order to maintain and increase their numbers.  Our results suggest that exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides could have dramatic impacts on bumblebee queens, leading to fewer bumblebee colonies, less pollination, and ultimately population extinctions. Studies like this provide the evidence that policy-makers need if we are to develop sustainable agricultural systems that provide the food we need without harming the bees we rely on, not just for pollination but for that iconic buzzing on a summer’s day."
"Labour has softened its pledge to find a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 after unions pushed for a target of significant progress rather than a firm commitment. The party’s autumn conference had passed a motion setting 2030 as the target for net zero emissions, but trade unions raised concerns about the risk to jobs and industry.  Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, insisted on Monday that the party would remain on the “pathway” towards net zero emissions by 2030, in line with the conference motion. However, sources present at Saturday’s clause V meeting finalising the party’s manifesto said the GMB trade union and some other union representatives had pushed for softer wording, aiming for progress rather than completion. One source said the aim in the manifesto would be for a “significant majority” of carbon emissions to be eradicated by 2030. Labour for a Green New Deal, which brought the motion, said it was happy with Long-Bailey’s pledge of a pathway towards net zero by 2030 and confident that the leadership was supportive of strong action on the climate crisis. The GMB had pushed back firmly against a firm target of 2030, fearing it could lead to mass job losses. Tim Roache, GMB’s general secretary, had previously warned: “The proposal to do it by 2030 threatens whole communities, threatens jobs, and frankly GMB members in communities right up and down the UK have heard it all before. “This will mean within a decade people’s petrol cars being confiscated. This will mean families can only take one flight every five years. Net zero carbon emissions by 2030 is utterly unachievable.” Environmental campaigners had been alarmed on Monday by Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade, energy and climate change secretary, saying on the BBC that Labour’s target was still net zero “well before 2050”. But they were mollified by Long-Bailey’s tweets saying: “Ours will be the most radical manifesto ever written, especially on climate. “We are a constitutional democratic party with its roots in the labour movement. Energy workers are understandably fearful and distrusting about the transition because they have been abandoned through past industrial transitions. “We will only succeed by working with those workers and communities to develop a credible industrial strategy that ensures they will not be left behind by the transition. “Our manifesto will set out a pathway towards net zero by 2030. I look forward to setting out these plans in more detail over this campaign.” A spokesman for Labour for a Green New Deal said it was “great to see Rebecca Long-Bailey restate Labour’s commitment to forging a pathway to net zero 2030”. He added: “From housing to electricity to transport, Labour has laid out radical plans to decarbonise our economy by 2030 and transform it for the many.” Labour’s green industrial revolution agenda remains one of the most ambitious climate policy platforms of any mainstream party in Europe. To get close to net zero by 2030 will require a huge transformation of the economy and energy supply systems – although its advocates say it would also boost the economy by hundreds of billions of pounds a year. The 2030 pledge is just one of many areas where party conference motions are likely to be softened for the election manifesto. An ambition to “maintain and expand free movement” will translate into a compromise immigration policy, that acknowledges the rules could change if Brexit goes ahead. And the radical conference motion suggesting assets of private schools could be seized is more likely to take the form of saying tax loopholes should be closed for them. Teacher and campaigner Holly Rigby, who runs the Labour Against Private Schools group which led the motion, said they had met with McDonnell just two weeks ago and asked for their private school reforms to be included in the party’s manifesto. She said: “We had a really positive meeting in the lead up to clause V. We were really happy with how the meeting went and we felt we were listened to and I feel reassured personally that what happened at conference will be turned into action. “We have always said that the most important thing is that private schools and inequality is wrong and we want the Labour party to take some action on this, and that it goes further than in 2017.” The motion passed at conference was to include in the manifesto a commitment to integrate all private schools into the state sector by withdrawing charitable status and all other public subsidies and tax privileges, including business rate exemption. It also called for the endowments, investments and properties held by private schools to be redistributed democratically and fairly across the country’s educational institutions. Rigby said no matter what the final wording of the manifesto, the issue was now at the heart of the political consciousness of the party and had cut through to voters across the country. She said: “The most important thing is we raise the issue in wider society and that this inequality is unjust and we have started that conversation in a way that hasn’t existed before. “It’s in people’s minds now and it’s up to the Labour party to decide how to move forward and make sure that inequality is challenged.” "
"The world’s most destructive mud volcano was born near the town of Sidoarjo, on the island of Java, Indonesia, just over 11 years ago – and to this day it has not stopped erupting. The mud volcano known as Lusi started on May 29, 2006, and at its peak disgorged a staggering 180,000 cubic metres of mud every day, burying villages in mud up to 40 metres thick. The worst event of its kind in recorded history, the eruption took 13 lives and destroyed the homes of 60,000 people. But although the mud is still flowing more than a decade later, scientists are not yet agreed on its cause.  The debate is whether the eruption of Lusi was due to an earthquake several days previously, or down to a catastrophic failure of the Banjar Panji 1 gas exploration well that was being drilled nearby at the time. Given the huge impact of the volcano on the communities nearby and the fields that were their livelihoods, why are we still unsure of the cause? Mud volcanoes are extremely common on Earth, with thousands of examples known worldwide. They come in many shapes and sizes and behave a little like their molten-rock counterparts, going through long periods of inactivity with periodic violent eruptions. Mud volcanoes, however, spew out not molten hot lava from the Earth’s mantle, but usually a cold mixture of gas, water and solids.  Some of the most spectacular examples of mud volcanoes are in Azerbaijan where they can range from a few metres across to the size of a small mountain. They are commonly found at tectonic plate boundaries, and also underwater at river deltas where sediment is buried rapidly, causing unusually high pressures to build up underground. The muddy mix is also pushed to the surface by the buoyant gas it contains. Usually mud volcanoes grow slowly, through layer upon layer of mud. What happened in Sidoarjo in 2006 is unique, with Lusi by far the fastest growing mud volcano we know of, having drowned surrounding houses, factories, places of worship and schools in a foul-smelling, emulsion-like mud. The journal Marine and Petroleum Geology is publishing a special issue that examines the ways this amazing phenomena is developing. It includes one paper by geoscientists Stephen Miller and Adriano Mazzini (“[More than ten years of Lusi: A review of facts, coincidences, and past and future studies”) that exhumes the debate of what caused the eruption, offering strong support for the earthquake as the trigger and dismissing the idea the borehole was responsible. The explanation implicating the drilling is that water from surrounding bedrock entered the 2,834 metre-deep Banjar Panji 1 well, which for its lowest 1,743 metres was unprotected by steel and cement casing. The pressure the water exerted was enough to fracture surrounding rock or pre-existing faults. Mixing with underground mud from the Kalibeng Formation, which makes up part of Java’s geology, this pressurised water and mud rushed to the surface through a fault, forming the Lusi mud volcano just 200 metres from the drilling site. The alternative explanation is that despite its proximity the drilling well was coincidental, and that the 6.3 magnitude Yogyakarta earthquake on May 27, 260km away had sent vibrations into the Kalibeng Formation’s mud layer, causing it to liquefy and rise to the surface under pressure.  That earthquakes can trigger eruptions has been documented as far back as Pliny’s Encyclopedia in the first century. It’s also the case that the eruption started as a series of small eruptions, all aligned along a geological fault, so the role of the earthquake certainly deserves full consideration. But in comparison with other eruptions triggered by earthquakes such as in Azerbaijan, Pakistan and California, the Yogyakarta earthquake was very far away given its size. More compelling still is that there have been bigger and closer earthquakes that have not triggered eruptions, while other earthquakes have caused greater shaking and vibrations right at the site of Lusi, yet nothing happened on those occasions. If the earthquake caused liquefaction we would expect to see the widespread release of gas from the liquefied layer – but a study by Mark Tingay and colleagues in 2015 showed this did not happen.   The well was drilled by the Indonesian company PT Lapindo Brantas, which blamed the earthquake. Information on the borehole was passed to us at the time, which showed there was an influx of water that we estimated was sufficient to cause the rocks around the uncased borehole to crack. So the new paper by Miller and Mazzini doesn’t bring any new information or reasoning to the debate, which will now probably remained mired unless new data from the borehole or from the critical period at the end of May 2006 comes to light, and this is unlikely.  Distinguishing between two hypotheses for a unique event can be a challenge. We cannot go back in time and collect the ideal set of data and samples to test the hypotheses, nor can we make direct comparisons with other similar phenomena for which we know the cause. There are other major disasters that we still cannot be certain had a man-made cause, such as earthquakes potentially triggered by filling dams with water.  In the case of Lusi, we very strongly favour the argument that the drilling was responsible, but neither of us were at the site of the incident almost two kilometres underground at the time to witness it, and more than ten years on it’s clear the data and reasoning behind our argument have yet to convince everyone."

At its widest and calmest, the vast expanse of water is a flawless mirror of blue sky and green canopy. At its narrowest and roughest, the water churns around boulders eroded into the shapes of battlements and breaching whales. Parrots fly above the treetops. Fish feast on fallen blossoms. Kingfishers perch on riverside branches while herons await their prey on midstream rocks with their wings outstretched. White and yellow butterflies stumble across the river at remarkable speeds. It is in this idyllic setting, deep inside the Amazon rainforest, that a nascent alliance of traditional communities, climate activists and academics is re-imagining what the world’s greatest forest was, what it can be and who can best defend it. The gathering in Manolito, a riverine community of half a dozen wooden buildings in Terra do Meio (Middle Earth), contrasts sharply with what is happening elsewhere in the rainforest. Manmade fires continue to ravage swathes of Brazilian land. Scientists say the forest must be protected if the world is to avoid dangerous levels of global heating, yet the government of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has given the green light to farmers, miners and loggers to enter the region and cut down trees. The results will be apparent on Monday, when the government releases the latest annual deforestation figures. The forest’s traditional guardians – indigenous, riverine and quilombola (descendent of rebel slaves) communities – are expecting the worst and starting to fight back. Forging new alliances with young activists from Europe, they hope the connections will lead to more international support and greater overseas prominence for their long struggle to defend their land against invasion. The line-up in Manolito is eclectic. Extinction Rebellion organisers from the UK and school climate strikers from Belgium have worked alongside Nadya Tolokonnikova from the Russian feminist punk band Pussy Riot, learning about the forest’s history and role, and sharing ideas on how to defend it. Although it is 12 hours by bus and boat from the nearest city, this stronghold of nature is no longer far from the frontline of devastation. Most of Terra do Meio (a mosaic of conservation areas, indigenous territory and reserves) is inside Altamira – the huge municipality that has suffered the most fires, the worst deforestation and the highest murder rate in the Amazon. To get here, the participants travelled through the indigenous territory of Cachoeira Seca, which has been invaded by so many land-grabbers and illegal miners that the small population of Arara Indians are outnumbered 10 to one in their own land. This leaves them powerless to stop further intrusions. Anthropologists say they are now among the most endangered tribes in Brazil. There are other traditional forest dwellers looking for new allies, as they face the most hostile government since the military dictatorship that ended in 1985. The indigenous shaman and figurehead Davi Kopenawa Yanomami sees hope in the youth climate movement that has spread across the world in the past year. “It’s a new way of thinking and it’s very strong. The young from the cities are listening to the cry of the Amazon. They see the fire and the deforestation and they know that you can’t keep killing trees,” he said. All the world is talking about the Amazon. It’s very good. The new generation wants to save the life of the forest and the planet.” The event’s name – Amazon: Centro do Mundo – is a mission statement as much as a slogan on the participants’ T-shirts. The message is simple: if humanity is serious about dealing with the climate crisis and the collapse of natural life-support systems, the priority should be protection of the world’s biggest rainforest and its guardians in indigenous, riverine and quilombola communities. A key objective of the gathering – which is seen as a Forest COP – is to show that much of what the outside world believes about the Amazon is wrong. That it is more central to planetary life-support systems than most people realise. As well as being home to the richest biodiversity, and sequestering more carbon dioxide than any other land region, it is also a vital part of the planet’s cooling system. The meeting room doubled as a classroom. Conditions were basic – half a dozen wooden benches, four tables and a blackboard – but the lessons were cutting-edge: several of Brazil’s leading academics shared groundbreaking research on climate science, anthropology and archeology that upturned the popular history of the Amazon as an uninhabited, disease-ridden wilderness civilised by European colonialists and their descendants. The rainforest functions as the heart of the world, according to Earth scientist Antonio Nobre. Even more than sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere, the forest’s most crucial role is to pump water – the blood of the planet – through rivers and across the skies in the form of vapour, he says. This is done by the transpiration of billions of plants. Over time, satellite data of the world’s photosynthesis (essentially the green areas seen from space) shows the most regular pulse across the tropics, with by far the most vibrant beat in the Amazon. “When we are hot, we sweat. The forest does this – pushing 20bn tonnes of water vapour into the atmosphere each day. It’s part of the cooling system of the world,” said Nobre. “The relationship between the forest and water is extremely important.” This is nature at its most vibrant and super-diverse – but the forest is also far less wild than many realise. Brazil’s leading archeologist, Eduardo Neves of the University of São Paulo, came into the gathering with a ceramic fragment and a handful of black soil he had picked up outside. This, he said, was a sign the forest in this area was cultivated. The Amazon rainforest is made up of 360bn trees from at least 16,000 species (compared with just 72 species of trees in all of the United States, according to the scientists at the meeting). But just over 1% of the species account for almost half of the trees. Many of this super-dominant group were trees used by humans, such as acai (the most common tree in the forest), which is a primary source of nutrition in the Amazon. This is unlikely to be an accident, according to Neves. “This shows that the forest is not just the product of natural forces, it was nurtured by indigenous knowledge.” This was remarkably sustainable. For about 10,000 years, the indigenous residents of the forest cleared less than 0.5% of the Amazon while planting productive trees that enriched the soil and increased biodiversity, Neves said. The population thrived, reaching at least 8 million before European colonialists arrived, bringing diseases such as malaria, influenza and measles that – along with slavery and violence – wiped out 90% of the Amazon’s indigenous population. Over the past half-century, it is the forest that has suffered. A fifth of the Brazilian Amazon has been lost. Mega-projects are a major threat. Bebere Bemarai, of the Xikrin people, said his community at Trincheira Bakaja was affected by a series of new mega-projects as well as the centuries-old threats from land-grabbers and miners. The Amazon’s biggest dam, Belo Monte, which goes into full operation next year, has already devastated the Xingu river, killing fish and ruining livelihoods, he said. Next he fears a renewed push for a giant new Canadian gold mine, Belo Sun, in the same region. “Every day is a struggle. In every region it’s the same,” he told the group. “Our people will go to fight with you. Let’s help our families.” Tribes that were once enemies are now allying with each other and joining hands with two other former enemies – ribeirinhos (descendants of rubber tappers from the northeast) and quilombolas (descendants of rebel African slaves). These traditional forest dwellers share a common threat of encroachment by companies, government authorities and land-grabbers as the Amazon opens up and economic and political pressures increase. Maria do Socorro Silva, a quilombola leader from Barcarena, is opposing a mine – powered by the Belo Monte dam – and a Norwegian-owned alumina processing factory. “The company destroyed everything. They took my past and my future,” she told the meeting. “The river is poisoned. Future generations are born dead. The people of the forest aren’t protected. We decided to sacrifice our generation. We eat our poisoned food, but we don’t sell.” Without them, the forest is more vulnerable. More than cattle or soy, the biggest single driver of deforestation is land-grabbing for property speculation. Scarcely a tenth of the cleared land is put to use. Clearing forest increases the value of land 50- to 100-fold. With so much at stake, anyone standing in the way is dangerous, which is perhaps why only those with an attachment to the land are willing to risk their lives. Mauricio Torres, a social scientist at the University of Pará, said it was no coincidence that deforestation stopped at the borders of indigenous territory and the extractive reserves of indigenous people. It’s not because the state is protecting those areas but because the residents defend their land. That’s also why these areas have the highest murder rates,” he said in a talk after a dinner of locally produced food. “The only reason this area is still beautiful is because of the victories of the local riverine people who fought for it. I’ve been studying this most of my life, and what I have learned is the best way to protect the forest is to support the traditional families who live there.” To do this, some participants at the meeting proposed an international boycott of products that degrade the Amazon, such as soy and beef, and greater promotion of sustainable native fruits, such as acai and cupuaçu. Others said nature – particularly the rainforests – should be put at the heart of discussions at the United Nations climate talks that will be held in Madrid next month. Other plans will be discussed at greater length at a bigger civil society meeting in Altamira. Some of the European visitors said they were already revising how they see climate action. “The people of the forest and the forest itself completely depend on each other. This has changed the way I think. It’s not man and nature. They depend on each other. They can thrive together. That’s the big thing I will be taking back. The problem is not humans, it is the system,” said Alejandra Piazzolla, an XR Youth campaigner who recently graduated from university. Others said it made them appreciate that only focusing on emissions reductions can hurt some of the poorest communities, who are left with destructive dams and mines that provide the minerals for wind and solar farms. “We need to rebuild the forest because it is our heart. But we need to learn from the people here how to do that. It’s not just about new technology. It’s about the way we live. We can’t just focus on climate change. We have to focus on climate justice,” said Adelaide Charlier, an 18-year-old climate striker from Belgium, who spent six weeks on a sailboat to reach Brazil to keep her carbon emissions as close to zero as possible. Tiana Jacout, an Extinction Rebellion organiser from Somerset, said she would urge the organisation to include global justice among its demands. “The Amazon now feels really, really personal. It’s impossible to come here and not fall in love with the forest and the river and the people. And it is impossible to think that anyone would destroy that.” The biggest single driver of deforestation is property speculation. Wealthy individuals from faraway cities such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba hire grileiros (land-grabbers) to invade and clear the forest, then bribe officials to secure ownership rights. The value of the land increases 50- to 100-fold. Most of it goes unused. Tens of thousands of garimpeiros (illegal miners) clear forest and poison rivers while prospecting for gold. Even greater damage is done by corporate mega-mines, such as the one being planned at Belo Sun. The vast majority of timber in Brazil is cut illegally. The forest trails opened by loggers are often later used as access routes by land grabbers. Farming Cattle ranching has devastated the Amazon as trees are cut down to create pastures. Soy monocultures are an increasing threat, particularly in the south. Many of these products are sold in Europe, the US, China and Japan. Since the military dictatorship began building the Trans-Amazonian highway in the 1970s, deforestation has increased. As well as other roads, hydroelectric dams are submerging more forest and bringing more people to the region."

As the following diagram depicts, there was almost no wind output from Germany’s 40 or so gigawatts of installed wind capacity over the last 36 hours. The country’s wind turbines called it an early weekend.

Wind energy (blue) has virtually disappeared over the last 36 hours. Solar disappears every night, and often during the day in the wintertime. Often less than 1% of Germany’s electrical demand gets supplied by wind and sun. Source: agora.
German wind and solar power disappeared this morning and over the last 36 hours, leaving fossil and nuclear power to step in to the rescue. The following chart of Germany’s energy supply and demand shows how wind has gone AWOL already 11 times since January 1:

Since January 1, Wind power failed to show up some 11 times. On average about 85% of the installed capacity doesn’t show up to begin with. Charts cropped from agora.
The point here is that it doesn’t matter how much wind and solar capacity gets installed. Once the wind stops blowing and the sun does’t shine, which is often enough, you get no power – period. Imagine if a doctor sold you an artificial heart that could run for 100 years, yet the heart pumped only sporadically, sometimes at only a beat or two a minute over for hours or even days. So it is with wind and solar energy. Our society needs a steady and constant supply; it can’t afford to constatntly stall and sputter, otherwise it collapses and dies.
Today’s partial eclipse had little impact
Today’s partial eclipse of the sun did not strain Germany’s power grid as much as feared. Fog and cloudy weather over northern Germany helped to dampen the feared fluctuation. Sunny day projections of 12,000 megawatts of power going offline in just an hour followed by 19,000 megawatts surging online in an hour warned that the grid could be destabilized. Here’s what the sunny-day scenario solar feed-in looked like:

As the sun’s energy disappeared, conventional fuels saved the day.
What follows is a photo I took outside near peak time of the partial eclipse in northwest Germany, where it was overcast:

 10:45 this morning. Looks like a typical dreary day in north Germany.
In general, power companies and grid operators had months to prepare for the eclipse. Lapses and wild fluctuations in wind and sun energy are common (see above) and so today’s eclipse was manageable though with considerable effort. Power companies asked large consumers such as aluminum smelters, cement plants and glass manufacturers to ramp down their production before the event. That would not have been necessary with conventional power.

"To predict what type of Earth lies ahead of us, we scientists usually turn to complex computer simulations. But how can we test whether these models are remotely accurate? Perhaps the best solution is to turn to instances in the geological past when Earth’s climate experienced similarly rapid warming. One such event is the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) that occurred 56m years ago. In our latest research, we have identified the cause of this well-known warm period. Its links to present day climate change are clear. Just prior to the PETM, Earth looked very different than it does today. The polar regions were devoid of ice sheets, with temperate or even subtropical forests along the coastlines of Antarctica, and Arctic Canada resembling the swamplands of modern Florida. The deep oceans were about 10°C warmer than today, and warm climate zones were all shifted polewards. Against the background of this “greenhouse world”, the planet warmed by at least a further 5°C over a few thousand years at the onset of the PETM. Life in the deep sea suffered disproportionately; many species went extinct and parts of the deep ocean became anoxic (oxygen depleted). On land, the water cycle strengthened, leading to both floods and droughts. It took about 150,000 years for Earth’s climate to naturally recover from this “fever” and regain some sort of equilibrium. Here’s the really worrying part: 5°C over a few thousand years is breakneck speed in geological terms, but is still nothing compared to our current rate of warming. In fact, if we keep burning fossil fuels at our current rate, the worst-case scenarios suggest we could hit 5°C by the end of the century. So what can the PETM tells us about the future? It has long been suspected that the warm period was triggered by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. These gases absorb and trap solar heat, which is why any significant increase unavoidably leads to global warming.   We know there was a huge release of “new” carbon into the atmosphere and oceans at the time, thanks to analysis of 56m-year-old sediments. Yet where this carbon came from has always been disputed. Carbon can be emitted as carbon dioxide or methane (aka CH₄) and both are greenhouse gases. Some say the PETM carbon was methane from marine sediments, while others have advocated methane from thawing Antarctic permafrost or the impact of a large comet releasing carbon from rocks. In our study recently published in Nature, we identified the distinctive chemical fingerprint of this carbon – it pointed not to methane, but to emissions from intense and prolonged volcanic activity. We also show that atmospheric CO₂ levels more than doubled in less than 25,000 years.  This makes sense: at the same time, Greenland and North America were drifting away from Europe, creating the North Atlantic Ocean and a string of volcanic activity along what is now the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We found more than 10,000 Gigatonnes of carbon must have been released into the atmosphere by volcanic activity during the PETM, which is an order of magnitude higher than all currently-accessible fossil fuel reserves taken together.  But the rate of emissions would have been at least 20 times slower than today. Given how much CO₂ was released, the resulting global warming was about what we would predict based on calculations of current climate sensitivity.  So what would volcanoes large enough to affect the climate like this actually look like, in practice? We could imagine a series of sky-blackening eruptions along the lines of Laki in Iceland which caused temperatures to drop across the Northern Hemisphere when it erupted in the 18th century. But, given we know the PETM volcanism largely took place under water and at a slower pace, perhaps the best modern equivalent would be the “black smokers” still found today in the deep North Atlantic – but lots of them. The carbon released by these vents would bubble up to the surface and kick off a cycle that would eventually affect the oceans themselves. First, extreme PETM warmth led to faster weathering of rocks and soil, which meant more nutrients like phosphorus were being washed into the sea. This in turn stimulated plankton growth. When the plankton died they drifted down to the seafloor and gradually stored that same carbon in deep marine sediments.  While this chain of events aided the removal of carbon from the ancient atmosphere it also led to oxygen starvation in some parts of the deep sea – analogous to the “dead zones” that form today in areas like the Gulf of Mexico where an excess of nutrients is washed into warm water. We found the PETM was caused by massive carbon emissions from Earth’s interior. It thus has many parallels to today, where we are ratcheting up CO₂ levels in our atmosphere and oceans by burning fossil fuels that have been buried for millions of years. This extra carbon is, in effect, permanent on human timescales. The PETM is giving us an increasingly clearer picture of what Earth will be like if we carry on, and take our planet to places it has not been in at least 56m years."
"Modern biofuels have been touted as a greener alternative to petrol and diesel since the early 1900s. It seems like a good idea on paper, and they do work – but their use and production doesn’t come without problems.  The first generation of biofuels – mainly ethanol made from plant crops – and second generation, derived from plant and animal waste streams, both had environmentalists and others concerned about the competition for land and nutrients between biofuels production and food production. It was with a lot of hope, and hype, that production of the third generation of biofuels was started. Unlike their predecessors, these biofuels are derived from algae, and so in theory the food vs fuel dilemma of crop-based biofuels would be solved.  Fossil fuel oil and gas originated from ancient algae in large measure, so the concept here is to replicate the essence of the creation of fossil fuels, albeit accelerated and optimised with modern chemical engineering. It was claimed that using algae would be much more efficient than creating biofuels from terrestrial plants and that the technology would make use of poor quality land not able to grow other crops. Millions of dollars, euros and other currencies have been spent trying to get the algal marvel to work. Much of the money has been directed at refining the engineering process, electrically lighting the crop – which grows in a liquid suspension – harvesting and draining it. The solution to optimisation was seen as primarily technological non-biological, though species selection and growth conditions were also acknowledged as important factors. However, it turns out that the hype has been misplaced. Our research has found that the production of algal biofuels is neither commercially nor environmentally sustainable. The attainable production levels are a fraction of those that were claimed. The amount of biofuel produced from prolonged culture of algae in pilot-scale systems is actually not too dissimilar from those of terrestrial plants: around 5,000 to 10,000 litres per hectare per year.  In fact, the rate of production from algae growing in the vast ponds required for truly massive production is, for a given area of land, similar to that seen in the most productive areas of the ocean. It amounts to around 4g of carbon from CO₂ fixed into biomass per square metre every day. So what’s the problem? Why aren’t algal biofuels as good as had been hoped? Quite simply, it’s biology. The dream has been broken not by failings in engineering, but by the inefficiency of biochemistry. Simulations of microalgal biofuel production show that to approach the 10% of EU transport fuels expected to be supplied by biofuels, ponds three times the area of Belgium would be needed. And for the algae in these ponds to produce biofuel, it would require fertiliser equivalent to 50% of the current total annual EU crop plant needs. Ironically, such ponds would also need to be located near heavy industry which produces CO₂ to provide the level required by the microalgae for photosynthesis. The problem with third-generation biofuels has always been scaling up the production rates measured in small culture flasks to growth in thousands of cubic metres in size. In the larger cultures, the biomass density of the algae – needed to make the culture and harvesting processes economical – defeats desired growth rates because the organisms shade light from each other. This means that they do not get the sunlight needed to photosynthesise and produce the carbon-rich compounds needed for to make the biofuel fast enough. There have also been misunderstandings of how the algae react to their environment. Importantly, those vital carbon-rich compounds only really accumulate in cells that are nitrogen-limited and so are growing slowly. Early production estimates assumed high carbon-rich content in fast-growing cells but this has not proved to be the case.  Could we not genetically modify a solution to the inherent biological inefficiency? Perhaps, but should we really tamper with factors that are so fundamental to life on Earth and risk generating unstoppable harmful algal species that could destroy fisheries and damage drinking water supplies? Even if we did create the perfect algae for biofuels production, the need for all that fertiliser and CO₂ would remain. Ultimately the public have paid for this failed vision – but their money has not been wasted. If there’s one thing that humans need more than fuel it is food – and this work can help us understand how to better grow microalgae to support the farming of fish and shellfish, and produce dietary supplements, like Omega-3. Mass microalgal production could also create food containing omega fatty acids to farmed fish, for example, meaning that we would no longer need to fish in rivers and oceans to make fishmeal for them. The future for mass microalgal cultivation is still literally and metaphorically green, it just does not rest with biofuels production."
"Let’s start with the good bits in shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s speech on “rewriting the rules of our economy”. Forcing big accounting firms to split their auditing and consulting units is justified: current conflicts of interest are too great. One can applaud the push to get workers on to boards. And enhanced voting rights for long-term shareholders is an idea worth exploring. If McDonnell had stopped there, he would have had a worthwhile package of reforms. But he moved on to territory that ranged from radical to vague to plain odd. Try this: “All executive remuneration packages in large companies [will be] subject to an annual binding vote by stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and consumers.” Lloyds Banking Group has 30 million customers in the UK. There are 16 million holders of a Tesco Clubcard. Are these companies to hold an annual mini-referendum, as it were, before executives can know what they’re being paid for the year? A vote among all consumers would be unworkable. Companies that do not take adequate steps to decarbonise their businesses “will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange”. But surely incentives and penalties should apply equally to quoted and non-quoted companies. Then there’s McDonnell’s favourite “inclusive ownership funds”, meaning a transfer of 10% of a group’s shares, over a decade, to an employee fund. The model has been recast so that dividends for workers would relate only to UK profits, but basic flaws remain. The Treasury ends up a big winner as it collects all dividends over £500 a head; the 10% transfer represents heavy dilution for current owners, including pension funds; and it’s not obvious how foreign multinationals could be strong-armed to participate. One could go on. An “excessive pay” levy requires a definition of excessive. And, if you’re going to rearrange financial regulation, you must first define the role of the Bank of England, which wasn’t mentioned in the speech. The business world will hate most of it, which was perhaps the point. There is a need for big ideas to address obscene remuneration and restore trust in business. But they must be clear and workable, and some of the shadow chancellor’s plans fall well short of that requirement. What do you get for £21m, the cost of Slaughter & May’s independent report into last year’s IT fiasco at TSB? A document that generates a squabble – but that’s about all. Certainly, Richard Meddings, chairman of TSB then and now, has no intention of resigning, despite a finding that his board lacked “common sense” during the “replan” phase of the IT upgrade. Meddings’ view is that the report “doesn’t paint the full picture of [the data] migration”. TSB says there are “aspects … with which the board does not agree.” Meanwhile, Paul Pester, the former chief executive who was ousted shortly after the calamity, is gunning for Sabis, the tech contractor on the job and, like TSB, a subsidiary of Spanish bank Sabadell. “Sabis rolled the dice by running tests on only one of TSB’s two new data centres,” claims Pester. At this point, an outside observer will scream in frustration. After the great crash of 2008-09 the bankers pleaded, in as many words, that “nobody was responsible because everybody was responsible”. The refrain from TSB feels the same, albeit a botched IT job – even one that cost £350m and seriously annoyed nearly 2 million customers – is less serious than a full-on collapse. To get the full account, we’ll to have wait for the findings of the Financial Conduct Authority, which is semi-obliged to name a few names. Bring it on. The relationship between TSB and Sabadell looks to have been dysfunctional but somebody has to be judged to be responsible. Airlines have a choice when it comes to global heating, writes Larry Elliott. They can take steps themselves to limit their carbon footprint now or they can wait for tougher curbs to be imposed on them later. EasyJet’s announcement of an offsetting scheme shows they will plump for the former. The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to “do something” about the climate emergency. It can sense the way the wind is blowing, and the cost – £25m compared with annual profit of £427m – is surprisingly small. There will undoubtedly be more tree-planting and reforestation announcements over the coming months. Whether there are enough schemes currently available to provide all the offsetting required is unclear. But what is certain is that carbon-offsetting can at best be a stop-gap solution, until such time as the industry cracks the problem of how to go electric. That day is still some way off."
"One question that arises from the announcement by the UK government that new diesel and petrol cars will be banned by 2040 is what it means for biofuels. If cars running on fossil fuels will be substituted by electric cars, it could imply that all liquid transport fuels will be eliminated.  Around 5% of the volume of the average British tank of petrol or diesel comes from biofuels at present. It is produced from various sources, including corn, wheat, sugar beet and waste ranging from rotten vegetables to used cooking oil.  Biofuels in the UK by feedstock type The large-scale use of biofuels dates back to the 1970s, when they were first introduced in Brazil through government incentives to build vehicles that could run on 100% ethanol produced mainly from sugar cane. Brazil remains a leader in biofuels, despite ups and downs over the years. More than a quarter of petrol content must comprise ethanol – and most vehicles can run 100% ethanol if they choose to.  Elsewhere biofuels have enjoyed varying fortunes. They became a popular possible alternative in the 1990s as a consequence of the rise in the oil price. More recently, more than 60 countries across the world require some blend of biofuels at the fuel pumps as part of their commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and have also launched biofuel production programmes. Yet progress has become very slow in many countries. Among the reasons are the period of low oil prices and the fact that it uses much more farmland to increase biofuel proportions in fuel tanks.  So will anyone bother to keep striving towards sustainable liquid fuels now that the end of petrol/diesel vehicles appears in sight? The answer has to be yes, for a couple of important reasons.  The first is hybrid vehicles, which have been far more successful than purely electric ones to date. These engines that run on a combination of liquid fuels and recharged batteries will play a major part in the transition towards complete electrification. If the UK is to move towards a complete ban on fossil fuels in transport, new hybrids are likely to increasingly depend on biofuels.  The second point is that the transport system is about far more than roads. Aviation, shipping and haulage are all significant and they have a much more limited scope for electrification. They will continue to rely heavily on liquid fuels  – to which end the US navy recently launched its first biofuel-powered aircraft carrier, for example.  So if we’re still going to need biofuels, how do we make the most of them? I was a member of a working group of the Royal Academy of Engineering that recently produced a report about the sector commissioned by the UK’s departments for transport and energy.  The report, which involved a meta-study of a number of research papers about the sector, said biofuels would undoubtedly play an important role in meeting the UK`s commitments towards climate change. It called for a combination of incentives and careful regulation to avoid risks and unintended consequences, such as crops being diverted from food production.  It proposed incentives to encourage so-called second-generation biofuels – those which predominantly come from waste and have a far better emissions profile than biofuels from dedicated crops such as soya or corn. It proposed to incentivise growing biofuel crops on land that was unsuitable for food production, while generally capping crop-based biofuels to help prevent them from taking up space that could be for food crops. It also proposed that the minimum blend level in the UK be increased from its current 4.75% (more work is required to determine what might be realistic). If the government approached biofuels in this way, there could be indirect benefits  – giving farmers an extra incentive to plant more crops, for example, as well as improving crop yields and making farming processes more efficient. The amount of land dedicated to farming could also rise as a result.  My message is therefore that we will need biofuels for the foreseeable future despite the UK government’s 2040 ban. By prioritising the right kinds of biofuels through subsidies and caps, we can minimise their drawbacks and maximise their advantages over petroleum fuels. The 2040 ban, far from meaning the end of liquid biofuels, should be seen as an important opportunity for the sector."
"Sierra Leone is still reeling from the effects of a mudslide that killed nearly 1 000 people, left hundreds missing and rendered thousands homeless. After about five hours of heavy rainfall, the mudslide came down Mount Sugar-Loaf and almost wiped out Mortome. This is a relatively new settlement which emerged as a result of the rapid urbanisation of Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital city. The heavy downpour also caused huge flooding that inundated the city, including areas previously unaffected by heavy rains.  For the past five years floods have become almost an annual occurrence in Freetown. Whenever they occur, such as the floods in 2015, they overwhelm the capacity of government. They affect nearly the whole city, causing a huge humanitarian crisis.   Freetown is a coastal city built on wooded hills. Though mudslides are a rare event, this incident was not surprising. Over the past 10 years research papers and civil society organisations have repeatedly warned the government, and individuals who choose to build in unstable areas, that the city faces a serious threat from deforestation on the peninsula.    As the city pushes up into the mountains, the population pressures are taking a toll on the forest. Trees are being cut down by people who want land for housing and those who cut wood for their daily needs. About 14.7% of dense forest in 1986 was converted to built-up by 2015.   This increases the risk of mudslides as trees usually prevent run-off and forests hold water. When there is prolonged or intense rainfall in places with no trees, the soil becomes saturated and erodes.  There have been calls to stop the extension of settlements into the peninsula’s hills and for the government to better manage the city’s development. But the authorities have rarely taken steps to address this. Action ahead of rains is occasionally taken, but this is done at a household level. It consists of measures such as clearing drains, strengthening  house foundations, repairing roofs and pruning trees to prevent damage if branches were to fall. In response to the recent tragedy, the city’s director of surveys and land, Christian Pratt, pointed out that: The laws are there to control development but the attitude of citizens is a serious concern. We have done several sensitisations…we set up a cut off line and brought it to the attention of people but these were not heeded. Inaction caused a predictable tragedy. What nobody expected was the scale of damage it caused.  The simple truth is that people are living where they shouldn’t be, in areas that are now vulnerable to both flooding and mudslides.  Typically, the poor suffer the most whenever there is a disaster in Freetown. This is because they tend to live in high risk areas, such as slopes or coastal slums. In this case, though, well built homes were also affected as they were located in unstable areas. There are several reasons why people live in these areas and under these conditions.  Firstly, most places have developed chaotically. Houses have often been built by powerful or influential individuals without following basic, town and country planning, rules.  Secondly, there has been a lack of good spatial planning. With limited available land the city should have managed the use of land better. Settlements should have been clearly laid out and provided with services like water and sanitation before houses were built. Thirdly, there has been a surge in demand for home ownership combined with a widespread practice of public land grabs by both the poor and the rich.  Fourthly, as seen above, warnings about the environmental dangers were disregarded.  Freetown is already home to 40% of the country’s urban population. The city’s population was over one million in 2015 and is expected to increase by 3-5% in its various wards. Unless urban planning is taken seriously there’s a risk that more locations could experience similar events, potentially more devastating than this one.  Several steps are needed urgently. Legislation in settlement planning and land use must be reviewed and improved. Instead of focusing on evictions, relocation and resettlement, political action should respond to the reasons people live in risky areas.  Finally, the relevant government bodies need skills training in disaster risk reduction and land use planning."
"Climate change is not something that will just go away. It is already affecting global biodiversity, food security and human migration, and the situation is not expected to improve soon. Rising temperatures and regular extreme events will produce new selection pressures.  These will force many species to move to find more suitable conditions, or adapt. Their ability to respond to these pressures will depend on the rate and extent of change, their ability to adapt to new conditions or their ability to move away. Understanding how biodiversity responds to climate change requires an interdisciplinary perspective, combining ecological, molecular and environmental approaches.  As part of our work to establish a new way of studying biodiversity, we developed an integrated framework to help guide conservation efforts by identifying wildlife populations under threat from climate change. We assign levels of risk to populations based on their exposure to changing climate conditions, their sensitivity due to genetic variation and their ability to alter their range (range shift potential). We show how our approach can be applied in a bat species, the grey long-eared bat, Plecotus austriacus. This bat is one of the rarest mammals in the UK, with a population estimated at less than 1,000 individuals. This bat has also been in decline across Europe. Our previous work showed that its geographic distribution is limited by climate, and current patterns of genetic variation were shaped by changes to the climate. We collected wing biopsy samples for genetic analysis from eight populations in the Iberian Peninsula and two populations in England – the southern and northern edges of their range. We used ecological modelling and climate data to look at where changes are likely to be most extreme. And to identify climate-driven genetic adaptations we looked at genomic data. This allowed us to assess which populations are likely to be most sensitive to the effects of climate change. Finally, we use a combination of genetic and geographic data to predict the ability of populations to track suitable conditions in the future. We show that while conditions in the UK could actually improve for the bat, populations in southern Europe that hold the key to the survival of the species as a whole could be devastated. We identified those likely to be most sensitive to future changes because they do not contain enough climate-adaptive variation.  We also looked at landscape connectivity to show populations that will become isolated in the future. As the suitability of the environmental changes, the movement of individuals will be affected. This will limit the ability of populations to move to more suitable areas, and limit the chances of spreading adaptive genetic variation into populations that are at risk. We identified one population, along the eastern coast of Spain, as being high risk. It will be exposed to high changes in the suitability of the climate, has a low levels of climate-adaptive genetic variation and will experience limited landscape connectivity.  We identified two other populations in the central regions of Spain that are medium-high risk. Despite high exposure to changes and limited connectivity, they have a higher frequency of adaptive genetic variation. In contrast, populations along the Atlantic coast of the peninsula and in the UK are at lower risk from climate change, because they will experience less change in the suitability of the climate, and keep higher landscape connectivity. Assigning levels of threat to populations can help us to set conservation priorities. Conservation management can focus on rescuing high risk populations. This could be by moving of the population to more suitable areas, or moving individuals with the right adaptive variation into the population.  But such intense management is likely to be costly and irrelevant when considering the number of species likely to be in need of these measures. Alternatively, we could focus on reducing threats to medium and medium-high risk populations by increasing landscape connectivity, this would allow range shifts and the spread of adaptive genetic variation.  Long-lived, slow-reproducing species with smaller population sizes are unlikely to adapt to climate change fast enough by spreading new mutations. They will depend on the spread of adaptive genetic variation caused by the movement of individuals between groups. Therefore a better understanding of movement processes and landscape connectivity is needed for predicting population persistence under climate change.  The framework we developed can be widely applied to other population groups and ecological systems to help decide how to focus conservation efforts to help species survive."
"EasyJet is set to become the world’s first major airline to operate net-zero carbon flights across its entire network, after announcing it would offset all jet fuel emissions. The British budget airline said it would start offsetting all flights from Tuesday, which it said would cost about £25m in the next financial year through schemes to plant trees or avoid the release of additional carbon dioxide.  Johan Lundgren, the airline’s chief executive, said longer-term solutions were also needed. “We recognise that offsetting is only an interim measure, but we want to take action on our carbon emissions now,” he said. “Aviation will have to reinvent itself as quickly as it can.” EasyJet’s move surpasses the recent pledges of rival airlines, including British Airways, whose parent company, IAG, promised last month to be carbon-neutral by 2050 and to start offsetting all domestic flights next year. The German airline group Lufthansa has launched a business fare where European flights are automatically offset for corporate customers from 2020. There is mounting pressure on the aviation industry to address its environmental impact. The UN agency ICAO has launched a limited global offsetting programme, Corsia, whereby governments have agreed to offset any growth in emissions, but campaigners argue this does not go far enough. Lundgren argued that EasyJet was “together, all in all, doing more than any other major airline within this area. Customers increasingly expect companies to do something about it and it is fundamentally the right thing to do.” The airline said it had secured a relatively low price as it had signed a three-year contract for wholesale offsetting, equating to less than £3 per tonne of CO2 or £25m a year. Lundgren said that the 17 different projects were “verified to the highest standards … audited and monitored to deliver actual offsets”. The airline plans to develop its own schemes to continue offsetting after the three-year period. EasyJet’s move, however, is unlikely to assuage environmental criticism, in a year during which it has launched domestic flights between Birmingham and Edinburgh, which are linked by fast rail routes, and expanded its airline capacity by more than 10%. EasyJet also announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the manufacturer Airbus to work in partnership to develop electric and hybrid electric planes for short-haul European flights. Lundgren said he hoped it would be “an important step towards making electric planes a reality”. The airline said it would continue working with Wright Electric, a US firm that has developed a nine-seater electric plane expected to start flying in the coming weeks. Lundgren said easyJet would take further measures including reducing the number of empty seats flown – although the proportion left empty on the average flight increased to 8.5 in every 100 seats last year. EasyJet reported pre-tax profits of £427m for the year ending 30 September, in line with previous guidance but down 26% on 2018, a drop it ascribed to rising fuel prices and a tough operating environment – although it was boosted by strikes at rivals BA and Ryanair. A record 96.1 million passengers flew with easyJet last year. EasyJet has also relaunched its package holiday business as a stand-alone division, looking to increase customer numbers following the collapse of its major competitor Thomas Cook. A new easyJet Holidays booking site will launch in the UK before Christmas, with the division aiming to at least break even in its first financial year. Lundgren said that, despite Thomas Cook, the package holiday was “not in any way shape or form in decline” and that easyJet was well placed to capitalise on a market worth £60bn a year in Europe. EasyJet expects to start flying routes as early as next February using airport slots at Gatwick and Bristol acquired from Thomas Cook’s administrators."
"The global climate crisis could lead to more renewable electricity being generated by spurring faster wind speeds for the world’s growing number of windfarms, according to research. Scientists have discovered that the world’s shifting ocean circulation patterns may have triggered a rapid increase in wind speeds over the last 10 years. The international research team analysed data from 9,000 international weather stations since the late 1970s and found that wind speeds had unexpectedly increased after a three-decade slowdown. Dr Zhenzhong Zeng, a professor at Princeton University and the lead author of the report, said the research team was surprised by the findings after setting out to study the slowdown in global wind speeds. The faster than expected wind speeds could help increase the amount of renewable electricity generated by each turbine by more than a third to 3.3m kilowatt hours (kWh) by 2024. Zeng said the unexpected acceleration is likely to have played a bigger role in improving the efficiency of windfarms in the US than technological innovations. The research paper, published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change, suggests that faster global speeds may continue for at least another decade in what would be a major boost for windfarm owners. Dr Adrian Chappell, a professor at Cardiff University and a co-author of the report, said the rapid increase in global wind speed bodes well for the expansion of renewable energy which will be central to keeping global heating to below 2C. The findings mark a major reversal in a trend of decreasing wind speeds over the last three decades – known as global terrestrial stilling – which threatened to halve the world’s wind power potential by the end of the century. We believe that the escalating climate crisis is the defining issue of our lifetimes and that the planet is in the grip of an emergency. We know that our readers and supporters around the world care passionately about this too, as so many of you have told us. We want the Guardian to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe. So at the Guardian we commit to the following: Read our full environmental pledge  Previous studies have found that increased “roughness” on the Earth’s surface, from new buildings and urbanisation, has acted as a buffer by slowing wind speeds by up to 2.3% every decade since the late 1970s. But the latest research has demonstrated that large-scale ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns could be making wind speeds faster again. The study found that the main drivers of the world’s quickening wind speeds were the Pacific decadal oscillation, the North Atlantic oscillation and the Tropical North Atlantic index. Zeng said that the effect of global heating on the world’s wind speeds remained largely uncertain because rising temperatures would have a diverse range of impacts that are not fully understood. “We believe our study advances [the] understanding on how climate change affects wind, and we appeal for more scientists to focus on this important climate variable,” he said. “The study of wind can also shed light on the dynamic mechanisms of climate change.” • The article was updated on 19 November 2019 to reflect a correction notice from Cardiff University. The original press statement said higher wind speeds could help increase wind power output by more than a third to 3.3m kilowatt hours (kWh) by 2024. After publication, the university said the figures refer to the output of one wind turbine. This has been corrected."
"“Spreading out into space will completely change the future of humanity,” says Stephen Hawking. It “may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves. I am convinced that humans need to leave Earth”. The world-famous physicist was talking at a recent science festival in Trondheim, Norway. And his keynote speech to the Starmus Festival about giving humanity a sense of purpose raises some very important questions about our views of positive futures. For Hawking “a new and ambitious space programme would excite (young people), and stimulate interest in other areas, such as astrophysics and cosmology”. Humans have to leave Earth, he explained, due to an array of threats including asteroid strikes, resource depletion, overpopulation, deforestation, decimation of animal species, and the effects of human made climate change (particularly rising temperatures and melting ice caps). Yet hearing such a viewpoint in response to the challenges we face leaves me cold. We cannot flee the apocalypse forever, leaving a chosen few to flourish on other planets; we need positive visions for humanity here on Earth. I am not a physicist, I research and teach in a business school about how people and organisations go about taking action to address sustainability challenges, such as the global ecological threats mentioned by Hawking.  The concept of sustainability has been traced back to ideas that emerged in forestry about 300 years ago to sustain yields. The general implication of this expansive and slippery concept is that we need to work out ways to sustain both the social (including economic) and ecological processes that enable us to live in ways that we value.  Key questions are raised by Hawking’s speech and we can use these questions to briefly explore Hawking’s ideas about a future for humanity: What is being sustained? Hawking’s suggestion is that by establishing colonies on the moon or Mars we are helping to guarantee that some form of human life will continue beyond Earth being humanly habitable. What is being sustained is a protected bubble of a small selection of humans in artificially created Earth-styled environments somewhere in space. How long is it being sustained? Given his background in research into how the universe began – and will end – it is perhaps no surprise that in Hawking’s vision for humanity the time horizons are very long. His intention is for another million years of human life, with our space colonies enabling us to live even beyond the life of Earth itself. In whose interest is what being sustained? We can identify a range of core interests who would benefit from Hawking’s idea of humanity spreading out into space, including astrophysicists, astronauts, space agencies (science-related areas of work) which tend to be much more appealing to men and the members of the future space colonies. The problem is that such a purpose or vision for humanity involves, and is relevant for, very limited groups of people. They will generally do certain types of jobs, and will be citizens of, or live in, those few countries that are putting serious money into space exploration. It’s easy enough to imagine a colony on Mars with the same sort of demographic makeup as a Silicon Valley tech giant. It’s much harder to imagine a colony populated by people with little financial wealth from less wealthy countries – the very people most affected by the environmental threats Hawking refers to. I don’t have any particular objections to space travel itself. Interplanetary tourism doesn’t come cheap of course, and isn’t great for the carbon footprint, but if people want to leave planet Earth they are welcome to do so. My concern is that such visions are being presented as a benefit for all of human society. After Hawking’s speech to the Starmus Festival, audience members put it to him that it would be better to spend our money on solving the problems of this planet. Hawking’s view is also one that is likely very enticing for a few, but alienating for many. This is partly because of the hopelessness of the apocalyptic vision for planet Earth, which is his starting point. This gloomy scenario can foster ambivalence by belittling what we can each do in the face of such enormous problems. Hawking also puts too much emphasis on technology. The problem with sustainability visions that rely on tech advancements is they rarely factor in the complex task of sustaining conducive social-ecological relations. Yes, humans may eventually invent nuclear fusion, or a great way to suck carbon out of the atmosphere. But we’ll invent harmful things too, providing even more ways to trash the planet. Which sets of technologies are more significant will be a question of politics, not science. It can be very difficult to face up to the social and ecological challenges that scientists have outlined and still develop some enthusiasm for positive “approach goals” instead of negative “avoidance goals”. New technologies are part of the positive picture, but too much tech talk is a distraction.  As we each develop our own view about what a positive future would look like, it’s clear that the real innovation must be in the ways we organise ourselves and live together on Earth – as there’s not much hope in only aiming for a life on Mars."
"Venezuela is sinking ever deeper into a political and economic calamity. Inflation is above 700% and GDP is more than a third below 2013 levels. The country with the world’s largest proven oil reserves is now the world’s most indebted country – no other nation has a larger public external debt as a share of GDP or of exports. Living standards have truly collapsed. Many factors have contributed to Venezuela’s current crisis including mismanagement of oil wealth by former president Hugo Chavez and the current leader, Nicolás Maduro, and criminality, lawlessness and the black market. While all of these have undoubtedly had a part to play, the falling price of oil is the most significant factor. However the connection between this and an economic crisis in South America is not as obvious. What’s going on in Venezuela is the unintended consequence of Saudi Arabia’s policy of keeping oil prices deliberately low for political reasons. The price of oil, as with any other commodity, is regulated through supply and demand. When there is an oil surplus, or a reduction in demand, the price will fall.  At the start of 2014 the global supply and demand for oil was fairly balanced, at around 92m barrels a day. But production started to escalate thereafter, and by late 2015 the average daily supply reached 97m barrels, more than a million barrels per day ahead of demand. This surplus caused a sharp drop in the price of oil. Part of this increase in supply was from American shale oil, extracted through fracking, but mostly it was the result of the Saudis deliberately pumping large amounts of oil for political reasons. As the only oil-producing country with sufficient reserves to regulate the market in this way, Saudi Arabia is considered the “swing producer”. Even though US shale production has reduced some of the Saudis’s swing power, the oil kingdom has still the capacity to produce more than it does currently and is therefore still very much capable of crashing the market.   It seems the Saudis are trying to achieve two aims. The first is to drive US shale producers out of business and consolidate the Gulf state’s leading role in global oil. Producing oil from shale via fracking is expensive, around US$60 a barrel, while the cost of natural oil is no higher than US$7 a barrel. Saudi Arabia hopes the drastic decrease in oil prices, to well below US$60 a barrel, will make it unprofitable for American shale producers to drill at their current rates. The second aim is to destroy the economy of Iran, the Saudi kingdom’s main competitor in the Middle East. This would thus limit Tehran’s ability to continue funnelling hundreds of millions each year to the Syrian regime, and Shia militias in Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere.  Oil markets have always been at the heart of the Saudi-Iranian struggle for regional hegemony. Back in 1977, when Iran was planning extensive nuclear power plants and envisaging the spread of its influence throughout the Middle East, the Saudi regime swamped the markets, expanding oil production from 8m to almost 12m barrels a day, sharply cutting the oil prices.  Iran watched billions of dollars in anticipated oil revenues vanish, and the Shah was forced to abandon his plans for nuclear investment. Manufacturing collapsed, inflation skyrocketed, unemployment rose steeply – and before long economic troubles had destroyed all support for the Iranian monarchy. The rest is history: the regime collapsed in two years and was replaced by Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic republic. It seems, after some hesitation and discussions in the early part of 2014, Saudi Arabia launched this oil price war in tandem with the US. America supported the policy as it wanted to undermine the influence of oil-dependent Russia, something it apparently considered more important than supporting its own fracking sector, while access to cheap imported oil is good news for US consumers and industry in general. Whether or not there was a clearly planned and agreed strategy, there seems to be an unmistakable convergence of interests between the Saudi and US positions. This strategy of keeping the price of oil down has not necessarily destroyed either the Russian or Iranian economies however. Instead, the hardest hit oil-producing nations are in South America and Africa, where petro-states such as Libya, Angola, and Nigeria are suffering.   But the worst affected country of all is Venezuela, the most disastrously oil-dependent state in the world. Oil accounts for 96% of exports and more than 40% of government revenues. It is still unclear whether the Saudi-US oil price strategy will ever achieve its main goal of crushing Russian and Iranian power and influence. But one thing is clear: the world oil market will continue to be extremely volatile, and smaller, less powerful nations will continue to be caught up in the wider battle. This article was amended on August 10 to more accurately reflect the status of global oil supplies before 2014. Supply was not “constant at around 80m barrels a day” but instead grew steadily throughout the previous five years."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat About Climate Change?
By Ed Caryl
In last week’s on-line issue of the Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine (Volume 90, Number 4), Judith Curry and Kim Cobb contributed their thoughts on the issue of climate change in two short essays.
Photo: Kim Cobb; source: Georgia Tech.
These essays were obviously intended to oppose each other. As one would expect, Ms. Curry wrote a low-key, well reasoned opinion piece urging caution and a measured approach to a more efficient use of our energy resources. She emphasized the considerable uncertainty in climate science:
The climate has always changed and will continue to change. […]
There is growing evidence that the climate is less sensitive to adding greenhouse gases than has been predicted by climate models.  Solar variability, volcanic eruptions and long-term ocean oscillations will continue to be sources of unpredictable climate surprises.”
On the other hand, Ms. Cobb has NO doubt that disaster is at hand, and dismisses those who disagree with a wave of the hand. For example:
Nobody with any knowledge on the subject denies that carbon dioxide (CO2) derived from the burning of fossil fuels is measurably warming the planet.”
“Measurably”? Ms. Cobb, could you share that measure with us? Even the IPCC can’t decide this measure plus or minus 100%. That isn’t a measure! That is a wildly adventurous guess.

As Judith Curry implies, the measure of climate sensitivity is declining almost with each new paper on the subject. Even the IPCC acknowledges that. Studies based on data place climate sensitivity somewhere between zero and one degree. Only papers based on models put the number higher, all with huge uncertainty ranges. KC says:
Nobody denies that the risks of climate change will accelerate as greenhouse gas emissions accelerate.”
To that breath-taking statement I have a question. What are the “risks” of climate change? So far, those risks seem to be fewer hurricanes, fewer tornados, warmer winters, longer growing seasons, enhanced crop growth due to higher CO2 levels, and warmer nights due to urban heat islands. Those “risks” will also accelerate IF emissions accelerate. Emissions from the US and the EU are falling along with their economies. Emissions are rising and will rise in the developing countries as they pull their citizens out of energy poverty. Both the drivers of increased emissions and the chief “risks” all seem good things. Reduced emissions often result in bad things.
The down-side seems restricted to sea-level rise. For most of the world, subsidence and uplift govern local sea level and these factors have nothing to do with climate change. For the rest, if we judge from the past, 17 cm of sea level rise in the next 100 years should not be a big problem. For island nations, coral growth easily keeps pace. Cobb claims:
And nobody denies that, given the long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere, the climatic response of our current emissions will play out over the lifetimes of our children and our grandchildren. They will inherit our generation’s climate debt, and its accrued interest, potentially in the form of irreversible impacts.”
“Long lifetime”? I wonder if she is as worried about the national debt? Each year only about half of the human carbon emissions remain in the atmosphere. This is called the CO2 “airborne fraction”. In the long term this fraction is falling (See Figure 3 in this link) as emissions increase, because the biosphere is greening and pulling out increasing amounts of CO2. With CO2 “half-life” at one year, if global emissions decrease, within a few years CO2 content in the atmosphere would begin falling. Then those “irreversible” positive impacts that I describe in my previous paragraph would begin to disappear. According to Cobb:
It is equally likely that future impacts will be less than or greater than those projected by climate models.”
Ms. Cobb has evidently not seen a comparison of the climate models and data. So far, 95% of the models are running too hot compared to real measurements. This is obviously not “equally likely”. The models have failed to predict reality, and will continue to fail because they are written with an over-estimation of warming due to CO2. Future impacts will be far less than the climate models indicate.
Ms. Cobb is an alarmist. All her opinions are biased by that alarm. Her lack of skepticism makes her resemble more an end-of-world preacher rather than a thoughtful scientist.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNASA has an interview with James Hansen (still) up at its site here.
Here we see that “surface air temperature” (0 to 50 feet) is not even yet defined, let alone can it be determined. This does not only present lots of uncertainty in its determination, but also plenty of opportunity for measurement and interpretation mischief. Hat/tip: Reader Dennis.
Here The NASA interview (my emphases added):
==================================

GISS Surface Temperature Analysis
The Elusive Absolute Surface Air Temperature (SAT)
The GISTEMP analysis concerns only temperature anomalies, not absolute temperature. Temperature anomalies are computed relative to the base period 1951-1980. The reason to work with anomalies, rather than absolute temperature is that absolute temperature varies markedly in short distances, while monthly or annual temperature anomalies are representative of a much larger region. Indeed, we have shown (Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987) that temperature anomalies are strongly correlated out to distances of the order of 1000 km.
Q. What exactly do we mean by SAT ?
A. I doubt that there is a general agreement how to answer this question. Even at the same location, the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 ft above the ground and different again from 10 ft or 50 ft above the ground. Particularly in the presence of vegetation (say in a rain forest), the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation. A reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 ft of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation. To measure SAT we have to agree on what it is and, as far as I know, no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted. Even if the 50 ft standard were adopted, I cannot imagine that a weather station would build a 50 ft stack of thermometers to be able to find the true SAT at its location.

Q. What do we mean by daily mean SAT ?
A. Again, there is no universally accepted correct answer. Should we note the temperature every 6 hours and report the mean, should we do it every 2 hours, hourly, have a machine record it every second, or simply take the average of the highest and lowest temperature of the day ? On some days the various methods may lead to drastically different results.
Q. What SAT do the local media report?
A. The media report the reading of 1 particular thermometer of a nearby weather station. This temperature may be very different from the true SAT even at that location and has certainly nothing to do with the true regional SAT. To measure the true regional SAT, we would have to use many 50 ft stacks of thermometers distributed evenly over the whole region, an obvious practical impossibility.
Q. If the reported SATs are not the true SATs, why are they still useful ?
A. The reported temperature is truly meaningful only to a person who happens to visit the weather station at the precise moment when the reported temperature is measured, in other words, to nobody. However, in addition to the SAT the reports usually also mention whether the current temperature is unusually high or unusually low, how much it differs from the normal temperature, and that information (the anomaly) is meaningful for the whole region. Also, if we hear a temperature (say 70°F), we instinctively translate it into hot or cold, but our translation key depends on the season and region, the same temperature may be ‘hot’ in winter and ‘cold’ in July, since by ‘hot’ we always mean ‘hotter than normal’, i.e. we all translate absolute temperatures automatically into anomalies whether we are aware of it or not.
Q. If SATs cannot be measured, how are SAT maps created?
A. This can only be done with the help of computer models, the same models that are used to create the daily weather forecasts. We may start out the model with the few observed data that are available and fill in the rest with guesses (also called extrapolations) and then let the model run long enough so that the initial guesses no longer matter, but not too long in order to avoid that the inaccuracies of the model become relevant. This may be done starting from conditions from many years, so that the average (called a ‘climatology’) hopefully represents a typical map for the particular month or day of the year.
Q. What do I do if I need absolute SATs, not anomalies ?
A. In 99.9% of the cases you’ll find that anomalies are exactly what you need, not absolute temperatures. In the remaining cases, you have to pick one of the available climatologies and add the anomalies (with respect to the proper base period) to it. For the global mean, the most trusted models produce a value of roughly 14°C, i.e. 57.2°F, but it may easily be anywhere between 56 and 58°F and regionally, let alone locally, the situation is even worse.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s clear: none of the intended aims were reached during the two-week UN mega climate conference in Lima.
Some baby steps were made. And of course they are being sold to the public as important progress on the road to a binding treaty in Paris next year. No one believes it.
What was achieved, unfortunately, were some real tangible and permanently visible negative results: 1) another huge junket bill for the taxpayers, 2) one large carbon footprint from the hundreds of international flights, and 3) worst of all, one forever-ruined historical treasure, the Peruvian Nazca lines – all thanks to the IPCC emboldened environmental activist group, Greenpeace.

Lima’s permanent result: a trampled, ruined Peruvian historical treasure during a Greenpeace publicity stunt. Image: Greenpeace. 
That’s the sorrowful result of this year’s climate conference. And no other has gone down as having been more destructive as this one. The ruin of the more than 2000 year old Nazca lines site was the icing on the IPCC cake.
Politically Lima finished with the same familiar result as usual – for the 20th time. The tens of billions of dollars that the UN and the IPCC have wasted on the climate issue, which is now unraveling as a grand hoax, could have done a heck of a lot more good for the environment had the money been invested directly in environmental protection technologies for smokestacks, clean water supplies, sanitation, medicine, and education in the third world. Instead, all the money is gone and the useless climate circus continues on its global tour.
The UN has failed miserably, abjectly. It’s time to disband the IPCC. The UN’s leadership performance and its trail of destruction, all punctuated by the Nazca lines, are an international civic disgrace that needs to be ended for good.
Regarding results on a climate treaty, they were almost non-existent. As I predicted here yesterday, the only result was an illusionary agreement with lots of intentions and back doors. Twenty conferences should be enough to tell any sane person that this is all a cynical charade by parasitic bureaucrats.
German Federal Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks, obviously fed up with the conference, left already on Friday.

WWF official Regine Gunther said: “The Lima Conference was a waste of time and energy.”
On the climate treaty results of the Lima Conference, what follows are some reactions from the German language media.
Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel:
Thus the Lima Conference failed to reach its decisive target: Actually a precise outline of a world climate treaty was supposed to be drawn up. It was supposed to become clear which measures could lead to a peak in CO2 emissions by the year 2030.”
The Austrian Der Standard writes:
The 195 countries agreed on a final text in Lima during the night into Sunday. It defined only vague criteria for national climate commitments, which are to be introduced in the Spring of 2015. Environmental groups spoke of a ‘dangerously weak text’.”
The Swiss Tagesanzeiger:
Climate conference with only a minimal target
The treaty countries have produced a document of about 40 pages that contain all the important elements that an effective climate treaty needs. However the document contains a long series of options that will lead to days of debate. At the forefront of the conflict points fairness, new order and trust, everything is indeed open as to whether or not an acceptable treaty will be reached in Paris.

"The climate crisis is poised to deliver a severe blow to America’s most threatened animals, with a new study finding that almost every species considered endangered is vulnerable in some way to global heating. Of the 459 animal species listed as endangered by the US government, researchers found that all but one, or 99.8%, have characteristics that will make it difficult for them to adapt to rising temperatures. An array of threats faces these species. The California condor, once close to being completely wiped out, faces increased risk of contamination in hotter conditions. Key deer, found only in the Florida Keys, face losing habitat to the rising seas. Whole classes of animals including amphibians, mollusks and arthropods are sensitive to the greatest number of climate-related threats, such as changes in water quality, shifting seasons and harmful invasive species that move in as temperatures climb. Mammals, such as the north Atlantic right whale and Florida panther, also face increased hardships, albeit on fewer fronts than amphibians, mollusks and arthropods. Despite the overwhelming peril faced by America’s endangered species due to the climate crisis, the report, published in Nature Climate Change, found a patchy response from the US government. Federal agencies consider just 64% of endangered species to be threatened by the climate crisis, while just 18% of listed species have protection plans in place. “This study confirms that the climate crisis could make it even harder for nearly all of our country’s endangered species to avoid extinction,” said Astrid Caldas, a study co-author and a climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “While agencies have increasingly listed climate change as a growing threat to species whose survival is already precarious, many have not translated this concern into tangible actions, meaning a significant protection gap still exists.” Aimee Delach, senior policy analyst for climate adaptation at Defenders of Wildlife and Caldas’s co-author, said the Trump administration’s decision to weaken its interpretation of the Endangered Species Act was “disastrous” and likely to further slow down the response to climate threats. In May, a landmark UN report warned that 1 million species around the world were at risk of extinction, with global heating one of the main pressure points on biodiversity. This year a small brown rat called the Bramble Cay melomys, which lived on a small island off northern Australia, became the first mammal known to have become extinct due to human-driven climate change. Nearly half of Australian species are threatened by the climate crisis, researchers have found. A spokesman for the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which oversees the endangered species list, said that while a species may be sensitive to changes in the climate, this sensitivity may not be so severe as to warrant being put on the list. “Our process for determining this looks at five factors: threats to a species’ habitat, overutilization, disease or predation, existing regulatory mechanisms, and other factors that may affect its continued existence,” he said. “Through this scientifically rigorous process we examine and account for the effects of climate change.”"
"By 2050, two thirds of the world’s population will live in an urban area. Until recently, we knew little about how wild animals were coping with the growth of all those towns and cities. The field of urban wildlife ecology has since emerged to fill this gap. Urban ecologists have found some species, like Britain’s hedgehogs, have struggled to cope. But other species, often called “synurbic”, have proven themselves very adaptable and, in some cases, they can actually live at higher densities in cities.  One species capable of modern urban living is the red squirrel. Understanding how they behave in towns and cities, a topic that is relatively unexplored, could help their long-term conservation. Red squirrels are found in cities right across mainland Europe, for example in Finland, France, and Poland. It is likely they were once also found in many UK towns too. However, Britain’s native squirrel is now a very rare sight, thanks to decades of habitat loss and the introduction of the larger and more competitive grey squirrel from North America. But one town where the reds haven’t disappeared is Formby, in Merseyside, the study site for my PhD researching the urban ecology of red squirrels. Formby is one of few red squirrel strongholds in England and one of the only remaining urban areas where they can be found at all.  Red squirrels can easily be spotted in gardens throughout the town. Local residents are passionate about protecting their unusual wildlife, with many of them providing supplemental food and volunteering locally with conservation organisations. These organisations manage the extensive woodland to the west of the town, where they supply additional food themselves, and employ dedicated “squirrel officers” who help maintain “grey squirrel-free” habitats. In addition to the woodland, the town itself contains ideal habitat, with hedgerows and trees lining the roads and gardens, which provide corridors for the squirrels to move through. Urban areas also typically have fewer natural predators, such as buzzards. Unfortunately, invasive grey squirrels like all these things too and, given the chance, they would colonise the town and displace the reds. However, a combination of grey squirrel control (including protection from their advances on one side by the sea), supplemental feeding, suitable urban green spaces, and careful monitoring by volunteers and rangers have meant that the reds have clung on in Formby, despite greys replacing them elsewhere in the UK.  The longer-term strategy is to manage the area in favour of the reds. This could involve, for example, planting trees which the reds can easily exploit but the greys are less able to, like native conifers and small-seeded broadleaved trees such as birch or ash. Greys instead prefer large-seeded broadleaves, such as oak and beech. However, there are downsides to living alongside people. For instance, several studies have flagged road traffic as the biggest cause of squirrel mortality. Despite fewer natural predators, there are higher numbers of pets, such as cats and dogs, that can injure and even kill squirrels. In addition, some of the trees in the town may be gradually lost as residents landscape their gardens, further fragmenting the remaining habitat. Even the widespread supplemental feeding could have hidden negative consequences. In Formby, well-meaning residents provide lots of peanuts: one of the squirrels’ favourite foods. Unfortunately, peanuts are low in calcium and alone do not give the required nutrition that a squirrel needs.  If feeders are not cleaned thoroughly and regularly, this could also contribute to another outbreak of squirrelpox virus or other diseases. This suggests that residents, who are enthusiastic about feeding the squirrels (and should continue to do so), perhaps need to be provided with more information, such as on what to supply for a varied diet. Much of the research and conservation of red squirrels in the UK is carried out in more rural areas, such as Kielder Forest in Cumbria, often along the interface with the invasive grey squirrel. However, managing urban sites for the benefit of the native reds could be a useful alternative conservation tool, through making the most of the benefits of living alongside people.  For example, local volunteers could act as a free and dedicated workforce for conserving and monitoring the red squirrels, as is the case in Formby. This could be employed in the nearby towns, or even elsewhere in Britain near squirrel strongholds, to hopefully encourage the reds to disperse and reoccupy areas as they become free from greys. This is currently occurring in Wales, with reds crossing over from the island of Anglesey onto the mainland as rangers remove greys from the area around nearby Bangor. An urban management plan could also create the opportunity to develop more green spaces and wildlife-friendly gardens. This would benefit all of the local biodiversity, not only squirrels, as well as the people. This is what my research aims to explore over the next few years: how have red squirrels adapted to urban life, and how do the associated resources and risks affect their ecology. By understanding this, we can hopefully develop a strategy to better protect this charming native species."
"As a millennial, a university student and a human, I thank you, Guardian, for your 2019 environmental pledge (It’s time to act, 17 October).

"After fears the Loch Ness Monster had “disappeared” last winter, a new sighting in May 2017 was celebrated by its enthusiasts. The search for monsters and mythical creatures (or “cryptids”) such as Nessie, the Yeti or Bigfoot is known as “cryptozoology”.  On the face of it, cryptozoology has little in common with mainstream conservation. First, it is widely held to be a “pseudoscience”, because it does not follow the scientific methods so central to conservation biology. Many conservation scientists would find the idea of being identified with monsters and monster-hunters embarrassing.  Moreover, in the context of the global collapse in biodiversity, conservationists focus their attentions on protecting the countless endangered species that we know about. Why waste time thinking about unknown or hypothesised creatures? Most people are rightly sceptical of sightings of anomalous primates or plesiosaurs in densely populated regions that have been surveyed for hundreds of years. However, while there are strong ecological and evidence-based reasons to doubt the existence of charismatic cryptids such as Nessie and Bigfoot, conservationists should not automatically dismiss enthusiastic searches for “hidden” species. In fact, cryptozoology can contribute to conservation in several ways.  Firstly, the process of mapping out the world’s species is far from finished. Conservationists aim to protect and preserve known plants and animals – but it is not always appreciated how many remain “undescribed” by scientists. Since 1993, more than 400 new mammals have been identified, many in areas undergoing rapid habitat destruction. The number of undescribed beetles, for example, or flies, let alone microscopic organisms, will be huge. We are entering a new age of discovery in biology with descriptions of new species reaching rates comparable to the golden era of global exploration and collection in the 18th and 19th centuries. The advent of methods such as DNA barcoding offer the possibility of automated species identification.  A recent mathematical model predicted that at least 160 land mammal species and 3,050 amphibian species remain to be discovered and described. Other predictions suggest that a large proportion of undescribed species will go extinct without ever being recorded or conserved at all – a phenomenon we might term “crypto-extinction”.  The father of cryptozoology, Bernard Heuvelmans, argued that “the great days of zoology are not done”. In the sense that so many species remain undiscovered, he was correct. The main principle behind cryptozoology is soundly zoological: species exist that humans have not discovered or described. The quest to locate and protect the world’s biodiversity is one that conservation and cryptozoology share, even if cryptozoologists tend to focus their attentions on the large, mythical and monstrous, over the small, plausible, and non-mammalian species in our midst. Cryptozoology involves rampant speculation and unconventional surveying methods. But controversial new “findings” can inspire a renewed quest to better map out the natural world. This was the case with the cryptid spiral-horned ox, never seen by a scientist in the flesh and known only from a few horns found in a market in Vietnam. The debate between rival camps of zoologists about whether the ox existed pulled together historic accounts, local folklore, and samples of museum specimens – all classic cryptozoological methodologies. The second reason why conservationists should not automatically discount cryptozoology is its shared history, co-evolving with conservation in the 20th century and interesting many conservationists along the way.  One notable connecting thread comes through Peter Scott, the founder of the World Wildlife Fund and creator of the Red Data Book method of classifying endangered species. Scott first grew interested in Loch Ness Monster reports in 1960 and in the same year wrote to Queen Elizabeth offering to name the – undiscovered – cryptid Elizabethia nessiae in her honour. Although the Queen was said to be “very interested”, her advisers wrote back saying it would be inappropriate to attach her name to something viewed as a monster or likely to be a hoax.  In an infamous article in Nature in 1975 Scott published underwater photographs appearing to show a creature with a diamond-shaped flipper. Scott and his co-author, the American Nessie enthusiast Robert Rines, named the creature Nessiteras rhombopteryx with the intention that it could then be preemptively protected under the Conservation of Wild Creatures and Wild Plants Act (1975). Although he knew that grainy photographs were insufficient taxonomic evidence in the long term, Scott argued “the procedure seems justified by the urgency of comprehensive conservation”. For Scott, conservation was at the heart of the hunt for Nessie. Scott was not the only curious conservationist. In his book Searching for Sasquatch, Brian Segal examines several other mainstream conservationists who grew interested in cryptozoological ideas and endeavours. More recently, when specimens of a species named Homo floresiensis were found on the island of Flores in Indonesia in 2003, Henry Gee, an editor at Nature, wrote:   If animals as large as oxen can remain hidden into an era when we would expect that scientists had rustled every tree and bush in search of new forms of life, there is no reason why the same should not apply to new species of large primate, including members of the human family. Given conservation’s haunting relationship with the problem of absence, is it time to bring cryptozoology, in some form at least, in from the cold? A rapprochement would demand changes on both sides. Cryptozoology’s appeal currently comes from its celebration of the anomalous and monstrous. A “post-monstrous” outlook might aid in forging new coalitions, and a stronger focus on plausible undiscovered species (such as the thousands of smaller amphibians and mammals predicted to exist) than on charismatic, but highly unlikely, cryptids.   The third way that cryptozoology can contribute to conservation is through the sense of wonder. From the conservation perspective, something might be learned from the Nessie and Bigfoot hunters about telling new stories of weird and wonderful discoveries alongside the more familiar tales of flagship species decline.  Instead of rebuffing them, conservationists might consider enlisting cryptozoologists as part of a wonder zoology that accelerates conventional taxonomic efforts. Indeed, the EDGE of Existence conservation initiative is doing exactly this by focusing its attention on “weird” endangered species.  Other examples of wonder zoology include the descriptions of new (although known to local people) primates by Marc van Roosmalen in the Amazon, and the “lost world” of new species found in or near Vietnam’s Vu Quang Nature Reserve in the 1990s. One promising model of how conservationists and cryptozoologists might engage is sketched out by the paleozoologist Darren Naish. Naish’s “sceptical cryptozoology” does not dwell on the question of whether cryptozoology is pseudoscientific or not but focuses instead on the ground it shares with conventional zoology. Stories of the discovery and rediscovery of species routinely punctuate the depressing catalogue of extinction after extinction. Wonder and speculation – however untethered – must play a role in energising conservation actions.  Although no one expects conservation NGOs to start searching for Bigfoot, it would be remiss of them to ignore the powerful ecological imagination that can be inspired by cryptozoology."

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Kurt in Switzerland points out that Germany’s Climate Pope John Schellnhuber, Director of the end-of-times Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), has just postponed the timepoint when man’s CO2 emissions must reach a peak and start their (rapid) downward trend.
Two days ago I quoted Professor Schellnhuber, who said:
At the latest by 2030 Co2 emissions must reach their peak and start downward.”
That deadline appeared to be new, so Kurt in Switzerland checked if that was the deadline Schellnhuber had given in the past. Kurt writes:
In 2011, Schellnhuber insisted that the emissions curve needed to peak no later than 2020 in order to meet the 2 degree warming target. http://www.wbgu.de/wbgu_jg2011_ZfE.pdf (See p. 7 of 34).”
Indeed in 2011 here Prof. Schellnhuber wrote:
The global emissions trend reversal must occur no later than 2020 [in order to assure compliance to the 2-degree C limit].”
Three years ago Schellnhuber was warning we had to turn things around by 2020 at the latest, or else we would be doomed. Now suddenly we’ve just been given 10 more years?

Now what could have possibly compelled Prof. Schellnhuber to recalculate a new peak time? Perhaps it was the sudden the realization that his expectation of a possible trend change by 2020 was one of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds? Global CO2 emissions have not even yet started to slow down, and a trend reversal point is nowhere near in sight. Major emerging industrial countries like China and India are still seeing rapid, accelerating CO2 emissions growth.
Even Schellnhuber’s home country of Germany, supposedly a model for cutting CO2 emissions, has not managed to reduce CO2 emissions since 2000 – despite more than tripling its renewable energy capacity at a cost of hundreds of billions of euros, as EIKE shows here today:

 CO2 emissions from electricity are depicted by the red line. Renewable energy capacity by the blue line. It’s not working! Source: BDEW
 The story is the same in neighboring Austria. Die Presse here quotes Austrian Green Party spokeswoman Christiane Brunner:
According to an evaluation by participants of the UN Climate Conference in Lima Peru, Austria has not ‘saved a single gram of CO2.’ […]
In 1990 Austria saw CO2 emissions of 78 million tonnes; in 2005 it was 82 million tonnes. ‘When one calculates the EU2020 taregts, Austria will end up once again at only 78 million tonnes in the year 2020 – and that only if additional measures get implemented,’ Brunner criticizes.”
We can certainly expect Professor Schellnhuber to make yet another recalculation in the year 2018 or so, pushing back yet again the deadline for a trend change to 2040 or even 2050. This of course is as remote from science as one could possibly get. Professor Schellnhuber and his scientists in Potsdam are rapidly making themselves to a laughing stock.

Harvard Astrophycist Willie Soon asks if hottest year ever claim is “a joke”.
NoTricksZone sought out astrophysicist Dr. Willie Soon’s opinion on the claim that 2014 is the “hottest on record”. What follows is his reply:
2014 hottest year a manipulation
Is this a joke or simply my BAD dream? Prostituting science like this is now consider a virtue. It is no wonder that science writer Lord Ridley said that he has lost his faith on science as an institution.
http://www.rationaloptimist.com.aspx
Why would anyone even bother with claims and insistence of the globe in 2014 being the hottest to a relative colder years all within a few hundredths of a degree Celsius? Poor Anders Celsius should be dancing in his grave.
The claim is based on just one (from a half dozen or so) thermometer-based products whose measurement quality is fraught with uncertainty and with actual error bars at least ten times larger than those claimed “effects”. WMO and others simply pick and choose the “data” that produces the press news they want in time for the Lima, Peru political pow-wow.
In truth the datasets taken as a whole clearly show that the global temperature has been flat-trending for nearly two decades now and that the theory of rising CO2 leading to global warming is sorrowfully exaggerated.

This kind of manipulative science, exemplified by IPCC, WMO, NOAA and what have you, is serving its master in the realm of politics and policy, and is indeed very sickening.
All of them are essentially behaving in ways we would never want any of our school children to behave: cheating and manipulating that are accompanied by careful wording and clever rhetoric.
Of course as a philosophy we all hold science dear. But if we continue to keep silent and do not express outrage like the one I now feel, the notion of science as a philosophy and way of life will soon be reduced to computer games and animation for the mind-controllers and beauty-contest institutions.
If folks reading NTZ still need a bit of fact on how stinky this CO2-global warming ideology has become, you only need to consider reading the blog by Willis Eschenbach on how the UN’s own survey of over 6 million votes show climate change a non-issue.

"Antarctica is a vast icy wasteland covered by the world’s largest ice sheet. This ice sheet contains about 90% of fresh water on the planet. It acts as a massive heat sink and its meltwater drives the world’s oceanic circulation. Its existence is therefore a fundamental part of Earth’s climate.  Less well known is that Antarctica is also host to several active volcanoes, part of a huge “volcanic province” which extends for thousands of kilometres along the western edge of the continent. Although the volcanic province has been known and studied for decades, about 100 “new” volcanoes were recently discovered beneath the ice by scientists who used satellite data and ice-penetrating radar to search for hidden peaks.  These sub-ice volcanoes may be dormant. But what would happen if Antarctica’s volcanoes awoke? We can get some idea by looking to the past. One of Antarctica’s volcanoes, Mount Takahe, is found close to the remote centre of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. In a new study, scientists implicate Takahe in a series of eruptions rich in ozone-consuming halogens that occurred about 18,000 years ago. These eruptions, they claim, triggered an ancient ozone hole, warmed the southern hemisphere which caused glaciers to melt, and helped bring the last ice age to a close. This sort of environmental impact is unusual. For it to happen again would require a series of eruptions, similarly enriched in halogens, from one or more volcanoes that are currently exposed above the ice. Such a scenario is unlikely although, as the Takahe study shows, not impossible. More likely is that one or more of the many subglacial volcanoes, some of which are known to be active, will erupt at some unknown time in the future. Because of the enormous thickness of overlying ice, it is unlikely that volcanic gases would make it into the atmosphere. So an eruption wouldn’t have an impact like that postulated for Takahe. However, the volcanoes would melt huge caverns in the base of the ice and create enormous quantities of meltwater. Because the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is wet rather than frozen to its bed – imagine an ice cube on a kitchen work top – the meltwater would act as a lubricant and could cause the overlying ice to slip and move more rapidly. These volcanoes can also stabilise the ice, however, as they give it something to grip onto – imagine that same ice cube snagging onto a lump-shaped object. In any case, the volume of water that would be generated by even a large volcano is a pinprick compared with the volume of overlying ice. So a single eruption won’t have much effect on the ice flow. What would make a big difference, is if several volcanoes erupt close to or beneath any of West Antarctica’s prominent “ice streams”. Ice streams are rivers of ice that flow much faster than their surroundings. They are the zones along which most of the ice in Antarctica is delivered to the ocean, and therefore fluctuations in their speed can affect the sea level. If the additional “lubricant” provided by multiple volcanic eruptions was channelled beneath ice streams, the subsequent rapid flow may dump unusual amounts of West Antarctica’s thick interior ice into the ocean, causing sea levels to rise. Under-ice volcanoes are probably what triggered rapid flow of ancient ice streams into the vast Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica’s largest ice shelf. Something similar might have occurred about 2,000 years ago  with a small volcano in the Hudson Mountains that lie underneath the West Antarctica Ice Sheet – if it erupted again today it could cause the nearby Pine Island Glacier to speed up. Most dramatically of all, a large series of eruptions could destabilise many more subglacial volcanoes. As volcanoes cool and crystallise, their magma chambers become pressurised and all that prevents the volcanic gases from escaping violently in an eruption is the weight of overlying rock or, in this case, several kilometres of ice. As that ice becomes much thinner, the pressure reduction may trigger eruptions. More eruptions and ice melting would mean even more meltwater being channelled under the ice streams.  Potentially a runaway effect may take place, with the thinning ice triggering more and more eruptions. Something similar occurred in Iceland, which saw an increase in volcanic eruptions when glaciers began to recede at the end of the last ice age. So it seems the greatest threat from Antarctica’s many volcanoes will be if several erupt within a few decades of each other. If those volcanoes have already grown above the ice and their gases were rich in halogens then enhanced warming and rapid deglaciation may result. But eruptions probably need to take place repeatedly over many tens to hundreds of years to have a climatic impact.  More likely is the generation of large quantities of meltwater during subglacial eruptions that might lubricate West Antarctica’s ice streams. The eruption of even a single volcano situated strategically close to any of Antarctica’s ice streams can cause significant amounts of ice to be swept into the sea. However, the resulting thinning of the inland ice is also likely to trigger further subglacial eruptions generating meltwater over a wider area and potentially causing a runaway effect on ice flow."
"Tackling the climate emergency forms the centrepiece of the Green party’s appeal to voters, with an eye-catching proposal to spend £100bn a year – more than any other party – on a transformation of the economy to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030. Policies on housing, transport, industry and the economy all flow from this central premise: that failing to see off the climate crisis would spell disaster, while tackling the challenge correctly can revitalise both the economy and the social fabric of the country.  The proposed Green New Deal would require close to £1tn in government borrowing over the next decade, during which time the UK would be transformed to a net zero carbon economy. Renewable energy would be expanded to produce most of the country’s power, with wind alone producing 70% of electricity by 2030. New support for solar, geothermal, tidal, hydro and other renewable sources would provide most of the rest, while subsidies to fossil fuels would be abolished. Large-scale batteries, an overhaul of the grid and new interconnectors to mainland European neighbours would help counter any intermittency of supply. A carbon tax on all fossil fuel imports and domestic extraction would be progressively raised to phase out fossil fuels, while home insulation – every home to be adequately insulated by 2030 – and energy efficiency improvements in industry would reduce demand. The party’s estimates the Green New Deal would create millions of jobs, assisted by £2bn a year investment in training and skills. Transport is now the UK’s biggest source of emissions, and the Green party plans rely heavily on improving public transport. HS2 would be scrapped, and the money spent instead on electrifying all intercity railways, building new routes and creating a government-owned rolling stock company for electric trains. No new petrol or diesel cars could be sold after 2030, and a frequent flyer levy would apply to people taking more than one return flight a year. Airport expansion would cease. Agriculture is another major source of emissions. The Greens would plant 700m new trees, more than 10 times the number of other parties, restore hedgerows and designate some areas for rewilding to restore wildlife and natural habitats. Farmers would be encouraged to diversify into forestry and new urban farms created. Revenue raised by a new 5% tax on meat and dairy products would be returned to farmers to help them move to low-carbon methods. Increase NHS funding by £6bn a year, and a further £1bn a year on nursing education. Provide an additional £4.5bn a year to fund councils to provide free social care to people over 65 who need support in their own homes. Roll back the privatisation of the NHS and give the health secretary the duty to ensure the NHS is properly staffed. Mental health services to be on a par with physical health, and anyone needing mental health therapy to receive it within 28 days. End the “hostile environment”. Replace the Home Office with a Ministry of Sanctuary, responsible for a new immigration system with no minimum income rules for visas, full workplace rights for migrants, the right to work for asylum seekers and recourse to public support for migrants and asylum seekers who need it. Recompense those affected by the Windrush scandal and a national Windrush Day bank holiday to recognise the contribution migration has made to UK society. Abolish undergraduate tuition fees and write off the student debts of recent graduates who paid £9,000 tuition. Schools to receive an additional £4bn a year, with a long-term aim of bringing class sizes down to 20 pupils. Formal education to start at six years old, with early years education available and free childcare of 35 hours a week. Remove charitable status from private schools and charge VAT at full rates on fees. Corporation tax to be raised from 19% to 24%. Flatten tax for individuals, by merging income tax, national insurance, capital gains, inheritance and dividend tax into a single consolidated income tax. Everyone to receive a universal basic income of £89 a week for adults, £178 for pensioners. Council tax and business rates to be replaced with a land value tax. Women to occupy 40% of board positions in major companies. Reduce short prison sentences and create specialist women’s centres. Restore youth services to combat knife crime, and make policing more community-based. Decriminalise drug use in favour of a regulated system of licensed sales at fixed prices, with government responsible for sourcing sustainable supplies of opium and coca from developing countries. Ban advertising of alcohol and other drugs, and place a minimum unit price on alcohol. Cancel the Trident nuclear programme. Replace the Ministry of Defence with a Ministry for Security and Peace, with the promotion of peace as a key foreign policy objective, along with helping other countries combat climate chaos and dealing with the impacts of climate-related disasters. Spending on overseas aid to be increased from 0.7% of GDP to 1%. The government’s activities in selling and encouraging the sale of arms to be closed down, along with all subsidies and support for the UK arms industry’s export of weapons. People living in privately rented accommodation to be given new rights through an end to no-fault evictions and controls placed on rent. End right-to-buy sales of council homes, and scrap the help-to-buy scheme. Councils to be granted funding to build 100,000 new homes a year, all constructed to high environmental standards. Exemptions to the land-value tax for pensioners or people on low-incomes, so they are not forced to move. A second referendum, in which the Greens would campaign to stay in the EU and push for reforms to make its institutions more transparent, as well as replacing the UK’s own parliamentary voting system with proportional representation, votes for 16-year-olds and an elected second chamber."
"You have probably never seen a great crested newt. If you’re in the UK, you’ll usually only hear about them when construction work is halted because they are found at a building site. In the past month alone, relocating these protected animals has caused delays to new roads, a huge rail freight hub, a 1,400-home development and a football club’s state-of-the-art £14m training complex. Even an illegal rave in Norfolk only made the news because it was too close to a protected breeding site. As a European protected species, great crested newts and their habitats are fully protected by law, so a development which risks disturbing them can only go ahead if approved plans are made to relocate them to another suitable habitat. It might seem reasonable to hope that, after Brexit, there will be less “red tape”, and that we can get on with building without worrying about a few newts. But these creatures are worth worrying about. Even if you’ve never seen one, their fate and yours could be linked. Great crested newts are large, up to 15cm long, and can be found in ponds across northern Europe. When not breeding, they are are nocturnal, and tend to spend the daytime hiding away – one reason humans rarely spot them.  As they go about their day-to-day lives, these newts perform important functions which inadvertently benefit humankind. We may say that they contribute to “ecosystem services”. One service is the cycling of nutrients from water to land and back again, thanks to their complex lifecycles. This contributes to soil fertility, a service our overworked soils desperately need if we are to provide enough food for a growing population.  They also eat small biting insects like midges. Aside from being irritating to humans, midges are also responsible for transmitting diseases such as bluetongue to livestock. These diseases have animal welfare implications, as well as knock-on effects on the cost of food production. Predicted rises in temperatures in the UK, associated with global climate change, mean that we are likely to see more of these insects in future, and more insect-borne diseases. Some functions within an ecosystem will be carried out by more than one species, and it’s true that the UK’s six other native amphibian species (the common frog, pool frog, common toad, natterjack toad, smooth newt and palmate newt), all contribute ecosystem services in similar ways. Yet it is the great crested newt that makes the news, thanks to its special protection status and its tendency to be found in sites which are earmarked for development. It may be that newts are utilising the new ponds that frequently develop in post-industrial land and brownfield sites because agricultural intensification and development has reduced the availability of field ponds and other habitats.   The UK could of course give up on protecting these newts, and rely instead on other native amphibians to fulfil their functions. But this would be a very risky move.  In ecology, a species may be termed “redundant”, if other species within an ecosystem carry out the same functions. But the existence of a redundant species is not pointless. It may become extremely important after a major event, such as a fire or an earthquake, as part of the adaptive process which allows an ecosystem to keep functioning. How do we know which species will be important in the future? We don’t really. We can make predictions about what will happen in the environment, of course, but there is a lot of uncertainty in any complex system: events could unfold along a variety of different paths. We are currently in the middle of the sixth mass extinction event of the past half billion years. Amphibian species across the world are declining faster than any other class of animal. Every time we lose a species of amphibian, or indeed of any animal or plant, we suffer the loss of genetic material. This material, the earth’s biodiversity, is vital for our planet’s resilience. To cope with changes (and there are certainly plenty of those around), the living planet needs variety, providing the capacity to adapt. Without this, we are vulnerable to potentially catastrophic consequences resulting from even small environmental disturbances. It’s not possible to save every single species, and we can’t always tell which will become the most important to us. This means we have to concentrate our conservation efforts where they have the greatest chance of success. But with great crested newts we have a good chance, especially as new techniques allowing us to detect traces of newt DNA in water mean that surveying for their presence is cheaper and quicker than ever.  It’s in our best interest to make use of these techniques, and keep working to conserve this species. We humans are part of the same network as all other life on earth, dependent on the same finite resources. Great crested newts might just turn out to have a key role in our own survival."
"Each summer, a large part of the Gulf of Mexico “dies”. This year, the Gulf’s “dead zone” is the largest on record, stretching from the mouth of the Mississippi, along the coast of Louisiana to waters off Texas, hundreds of miles away. Around 8,776 square miles of ocean, an area the size of New Jersey or Wales, is almost lifeless. John Muir, the famed naturalist and early conservation campaigner, once said that: “When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.” His point was that everything in nature is connected, and that no part of our ecosystem exists entirely independently from any other. It is perhaps no surprise then that ultimate cause of the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone can be found many miles inland. Fertilisers used by farmers then wash into the Mississippi River and eventually into the sea, where nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus stimulate an explosion in microscopic algae, creating huge “algal blooms”. The algae then die and sink to the bottom, where they decompose. But the same bacteria which decompose the algae also use the sea’s oxygen during the process, leaving an “anoxic” ocean. Fish and other mobile sea creatures are able to escape the suffocating dead zone. Less lucky however are the sponges, corals, sea squirts and other animals who live their lives fixed in one place on the sea bed. Low oxygen levels place them under great stress and we have seen huge mortalities. Such losses will of course ripple up the food web, creating a negative chain reaction of increasing mortality rates in larger and larger animals. The “dead zone” has grown this year due to increased rainfall in America’s Midwest washing ever greater amounts of nutrients into the Mississippi, which ultimately end up in the Gulf. Not only is this a huge conservation issue – the Gulf contains key nursery habitats such as mangrove forests, sea grass beds and coral reefs that benefit adjacent fisheries – but it also has huge consequences for the local fishing economy, particularly the shrimp industry. Steps are under way to slow down the ecological disaster. Some farmers in the Mississippi basin are using large grassy zones along waterways in order to soak up the agricultural fertilisers and filter out many of the nutrients before they make their way down the Mississippi to pollute the Gulf. However, it remains to be seen whether such measures are effective – and US farmers certainly need to greatly reduce the nitrogen and phosphates they use. In the century since Muir’s death, things have sped up. A larger population demands more food which means more deforestation, more farmland and more fertiliser. The increase demand placed on our land is ultimately affecting the marine environment. These losses are unsustainable. The marine environment is integral for all life on earth, from an ecological and economic point of view. If we keep losing ecosystem services such as coastal nursery habitats and spawning grounds at this current rate, it will not just be an area the size of a state that is a dead zone, but the whole Gulf, or even whole oceans."

========================================
Failed spectacularly: Arctic data hole theory for the warming pause collapses
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
For quite some time climate scientists have been desperately seeking an explanation for the unexpected warming pause. On November 15, 2013 in the Süddeutsche Zeitung Christopher Schrader declared that the solution had been found: There was no pause; the data had only been missing from the Arctic.
Climate change without pause
According to the data, the earth had not warmed over the past years. However, this impression is likely related to missing data from the Arctic. And there the temperature appears to have risen much more strongly than the global average.[…] These [temperature] measurements have large holes: Approximately one sixth of the earth is not covered. Foremost in the Arctic there are not enough thermometers. But according to all signs it is warming considerably more quickly than the rest of the planet. An English and a Canadian scientist now show how this hole can be closed up with estimated values and how the supposed warming pause practically disappears. Kevin Cowtan of the University of York and Robert Way of the University of Ottawa refer to satellite data. […] Thus ultimately Cowtan and Way arrived at the result that the Arctic warmed eight times faster than the rest of the planet. Before that it had been thought that it was warming three times faster.”
Unfortunately Schrader did not mention that the two scientists were climate activists who were close to the IPCC-friendly Internet platform Skeptical Science. Yet, he still was unable to let slip out a couple of critical words about the two authors:
However the process is too complicated in order to find widespread recognition. Doubt will be stirred up among many because both authors have no name in climate science. Kevin Cowtan is a theoretical physicist and computer specialist at the Department of Chemistry at his University. Robert Way is still busy writing his doctorate dissertation.
It’s been a full year since the appearance of the dubious paper by Cowtan and Way, one that was highly praised by Stefan Rahmstorf. So just how was this pioneering paper received by the science community? On January 29, 2015 the answer from their colleagues appeared in the Geophysical Research Letters. The dodgy Arctic data fill-in model has failed spectacularly and has been soundly rejected. The answer to the pause is not to be found in the Arctic as Cowtan and Way suspected, rather it is to be found at the lower geographical geographical latitudes, as a team of scientists of the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen led by Hans Gleisner reports in a new publication. What follows is the paper’s abstract:
Recent global warming hiatus dominated by low-latitude temperature trends in surface and troposphere data
Over the last 15 years, global mean surface temperatures exhibit only weak trends. Recent studies have attempted to attribute this so called temperature hiatus to several causes, amongst them incomplete sampling of the rapidly warming Arctic region. We here examine zonal mean temperature trends in satellite-based tropospheric data sets (based on data from (Advanced) Microwave Sounding Unit and Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation instruments) and in global surface temperatures (HadCRUT4). Omission of successively larger polar regions from the global mean temperature calculations, in both tropospheric and surface data sets, shows that data gaps at high latitudes cannot explain the observed differences between the hiatus and the prehiatus period. Instead, the dominating causes of the global temperature hiatus are found at low latitudes. The combined use of several independent data sets, representing completely different measurement techniques and sampling characteristics, strengthens the conclusions.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s so-called Climate Consortium here has published a telling statement on this year’s “record warm year” in Germany and the reasons behind it. The Climate Consortium represents the collective position of all Germany’s scientific climate institutes.
Although the statement claims the record year “fits very well in the picture of a long-term global temperature increase” it now concedes major natural fluctuations in the climate system. Less than 3 years ago, on February 6, 2012, the same site posted the following in a hasty response to skeptic book Die kalte Sonne:
Pure natural fluctuations ­- such as changes in solar activity – on the other hand cannot be mainly responsible for the global warming of the past decades.”
What a difference a couple of years can make. Now they are blaming precisely these “natural fluctuations” for the “warming pause”.
Yesterday’s statement was authored by Germany’s top appointed climate experts (some are well-known IPCC scientists): Jochen Marotzke, Paul Becker, Gernot Klepper, Mojib Latif and Monika Rhein.
Does anyone think they will do the honorable thing and admit that Die kalte Sonne authors Prof. Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning claims had merit after all? Professional and honorable scientists would certainly do so.
On the surface the latest German Climate Consortium statement does its best to give the façade of a warming planet, but in the text the truth comes gushing out. They write that at 10.3°C, Germany this year is set to break the previous 2000 and 2007 record (9.9°C) for the highest mean annual temperature since recording began in 1881. But the statement then cautions:
However, only the global mean temperature is a reliable indicator of global warming. If one takes the preliminary data for the months of January to November 2014 as a reference, then, since systematic data recording began, fourteen of the last fifteen warmest years occurred in the 21st century.
Moreover it is too early to talk about an end to the now 15-year long ‘warming pause’ and to assume an accelerating warming over the coming years. The global earth’s surface temperature is subject to year-to-year and decadal fluctuations. Only with the following years will it be possible to judge to what extent global warming of the earth’s surface will resume.”
This is an interesting statement. The scientists now concede that natural factors now dominate, and 2) that the upcoming years will answer the hotly debated question concerning the extent of man-made warming.
And we all thought it was all settled.
More concessions, admissions soon likely

Given this year has been an El Nino year, and that such years are normally followed by the cooler La Ninas, and that current solar activity cycle is well into its second half, temperatures over the next several years may lead to even more difficult concessions and admissions from warmist scientists. Expect the 2015 – 2022 period to make or break the AGW science.
90% of the missing heat absorbed by oceans
The German Climate Consortium statement continues:
In addition to solar radiation and volcanic activity, the oceans are a major climate factor. Recent scientific results show that the world’s oceans have stored 90 percent of the energy resulting in the climate system from greenhouse gases over the past 40 years. Phases of increased heat absorption alternate with phases of less absorption. Thus connected with this are fluctuations of the sea surface temperatures.”
As an example the Climate Consortium paper then describes the effects of El Nino on global surface temperatures.
Here we see again that they concede the oceans are a major driver of the surface temperatures – a real natural fluctuation. And although they chose not bring it up, it only logically follows that they would also have to concede that both the Pacific and the Atlantic Decadal Oscillations (PDO and AMO) are major drivers of the global surface temperatures. But they did not bring it up. Maybe it’s because admitting this would necessarily mean that the strong 1980 – 1998 warming would have to be in large part attributed to the oceans, and NOT Co2. That medicine seems to be still too bitter to swallow.
The statement adds:
The interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere is an important reason for the decelerated rise in global surface temperatures since the start of the millennium.”
The German Climate Consortium statement ends by pointing out 2015 could also break a new global surface record (depending on the dataset one uses) because the impacts of an El Nino on global temperature lag by up to one year.
Warming now facing huge obstacles
Record or not, we can all safely assume that 2015 will be a warm one globally. But after that the warmists will really have to start sweating. Chances are good that a La Nina will follow, and its cooling effects will be further compounded by the death of SC24 and an AMO heading down towards its cold phase.
Right now it’s best to ignore all the day-to-day hollering and to just be patient. The next 8 years or so will decide the issue once and for all. After that there will be no excuses for not acting – in one direction or the other.

"Legal & General has defended its decision to retain Shell as one of the top stocks in its climate-conscious fund despite a pension client raising concerns about the oil corporation’s inclusion. PensionBee, an online pension provider that handles £650m worth of client assets, said it was being inundated with questions from its customers about the composition of one of Legal & General Investment Management’s Future World Funds, which counts Shell among its top 10 holdings. “While Shell has made some progress in the right direction, our customers are asking us on a daily basis whether Shell’s business model is sufficiently transitioning to a low-carbon economy to warrant continued inclusion in this responsible investment plan,” PensionBee’s chief executive, Romi Savova, said in a letter sent to LGIM this week. PensionBee, which has more than 60,000 customers, is believed to be one of the fund’s top five owners, with about £50m invested. LGIM’s Future World Funds are governed by its “climate impact pledge”, which means it can exclude companies over poor governance and weak climate disclosures, as well as lobbying politicians on policies that risk accelerating the climate crisis. Big oil companies need to cut their carbon emissions by 35% by 2040 to achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement, according to a recent report by the financial thinktank Carbon Tracker. But Shell is forecast to increase its combined oil and gas output by 38% by 2030. “This is a puzzling situation and one that is compounded by Shell’s refusal to disclose its future production schedule and whether it is indeed on track to meet its global obligations,” Savova said. LGIM, which is one of the UK’s biggest fund managers with £1tn in assets, has acknowledged that the oil and gas industry cannot continue to expand if the world is to meet climate targets. “However, there is no widespread agreement on what individual companies need to do,” it told PensionBee. The fund manager stressed the need to “balance” environmental and financial concerns when putting together the investment portfolio. “The fund has already significantly reduced exposure to hundreds of carbon-intensive stocks. Further exclusions might have unintended financial impacts. For example, Shell is one of the largest payers of dividends in the UK.” LGIM said it was seeing “positive signs” from the oil company, which this year announced plans to quit the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers lobby group over differing views on climate policy. Shell has also gone further than most of its peers by setting carbon reduction targets that include customer emissions and investing in low-carbon technologies, the asset manager said. LGIM, which has become one of the most outspoken fund managers over the climate crisis, said the oil company could do more and it was pushing for greater transparency on how Shell’s production plans aligned with the Paris agreement. LGIM also plans to monitor how Shell meets its emissions targets. The investment firm said if it had significant concerns about Shell’s climate strategy it would vote against the chair of the business or dump its shares from its Future World Fund. Shell said the company fully supported the Paris agreement and had already invested billions of dollars in a range of low-carbon technologies including biofuel and wind power. “We’re committed to playing our part, by addressing our own emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany outlets are reporting on Greenpeace’s desecration and exploitation of ancient Incan and Nazca historical sites for political and fund-raising purposes. See here.
Photo: Craig Rucker questions Greenpeace spokesman. Photo cropped from C-Fact video.
Today the online Spiegel covers (instead of buries) the story: “Nazca Lines in Peru: Greenpeace apologizes for cultural contamination“. 
That apology of course comes only after a huge wave of negative publicity. When asked by C-Fact’s Craig Rucker at a press conference about what the activists had done, a Greenpeace spokesman seemed completely indifferent about having used the site for their stunt, and even thought that everyone just loved Greenpeace.
Well, I’ve been with them. I’ve been in the village and we were basically in the village for a day and everybody loved them, there was no problem.”
Indeed here it appears that the Greenpeace higher-ups were actually there at the site and aware of what the activists were doing. It seems as if the stunt even may have been orchestrated by the higher-ups. Will Greenpeace officials take responsibility for the actions of their activists members? Spiegel writes:
“On their homepage Greenpeace showed themselves as demonstratively proud about the stunt even still on Thursday morning. […]
However in the meantime Greenpeace no longer considers the spectacular action as a good idea.”

Note how Greenpeace officials quickly backpedalled once the massive backlash became undeniable. Greenpeace higher officials are (suddenly) acting as if they had nothing to do with it, and that it had been carried out solely by the activists on their own.
It’s a pity that Greenpeace officials always distance themselves from the actions of their activists whenever they go awry, but are always quick to collect the cash donations that flow in afterwards when the actions succeed. Spiegel adds:
Also the head of the Greenpeace delegation at the climate conference, Martin Kaiser, said he expects that the activists to always take the responsibility for their actions.”
Unbelievable. What about Greenpeace officials taking responsibility for once?
Greenpeace chief Kumi Naidoo will personally fly into Lima by jet and apologize. But that may be too little, too late. Spiegel writes:
Peru’s Deputy Cultural Minister Luis Jaime Castillo is requesting the state attorney to file charges for ‘the attack on archeological monuments’, a crime that is punishable by as much as six years in prison.”
Of course European governments and other organizations will express disgust at the Greenpeace activists’ action for awhile, but behind the scenes they’ll be working out a deal with the Peruvian government to get them off…probably in exchange for cash and support.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn former times, the job of official climate witch-hunting had been one of the German Ministry of Environment, which even went so far as to identify, target and attack skeptic US and German scientists and journalists – all because they held non-alarmist views on climate change. Fortunately that activity turned out to be somewhat embarrassing, and thus the activist Ministry thought that it was best to end it.
But not to worry, the witch-hunting business has found a new home: at the site of the end-of-world climate conspiracy theorists: Klimaretter.info – a leading alarmist site run by a group of highly influential climate doom-infatuated persons.
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne
Klimaretter.info (in English: climate rescuers.info) is now offering a new, very special service to readers: They now have the chance to deliver “explosive disclosure material” on climate skeptics and their clandestine activities at an anonymous letter box: The klimaretter.info site explains:
Here you can discretely and anonymously deposit internal documents, information, data sets, bank accounts, and similar material when you think that the public needs to know about it.”
The klimaretter site even promises that materials will be handled in “strict confidentiality”, and that tracing back to the discloser will not be possible.
Many of us of course will naturally view this as a step back into the old authoritarian, go-after-the-enemy days in darker German times. Is this all they have left? Are they totally bankrupt of argument in the arena of debate that they now have to resort to gutter skimming and dumpster diving? Perhaps they ought to get in touch with Peter Gleick to find out how to acquire explosive documents.

So who are these people at klimaretter.info? A look at their website tells us a lot already. It’s mainly made up of a group of powerful lobbyists working on behalf of the renewable energies industry, or the reinsurance industry. Among the publishers at Klimaretter are Hartmut Grassl, former director of the WMO and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg. According to other sources, it turns out he is also a foundation board member of reinsurer Munich Re!
Other klimaretter.info publishers like Claudia Kemfert, Gero Lücking, Jens Mühlhaus, Matthias Willenbacher or Klaus Franz are directly connected to the multi-billion dollar green energy industry. Kemfert is also a member of the Club of Rome.
Pots ought to be careful about going around and calling others black.
Send in your explosive documents
Already skeptic site Die kalte Sonne tells here that the klimaretter.info secret letter box has gotten some success. Die kalte Sonne writes that they have delivered a comprehensive package of “explosive material” consisting of (1) important scientific papers on the sun’s impact on climate, (2) a bank statement of an explosive visit to a pizza eatery concerning the last international climate conference and (3) discrete sea level data showing an average rise of 1.5 mm/yr. But don’t get your hopes up that we’ll be reading about that at Spiegel, or Die Zeit.
Die kalte Sonne also would like to know who are the generous donators to Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project.
If readers here should happen to have in your possession explosive information like photos, documents, bank transactions, e-mails, datasets, etc. that you feel the public needs to know about, then do send them to the confidential letterbox of the climate rescuers at klimaretter.info here.

"Llamas recently have become a relatively common sight around the world. Whether you live in England or New South Wales, Canada or New Zealand, you don’t have to go too far to find a llama now. Indeed thousands of llamas are registered in the UK, where the species has emerged as a popular (if seemingly unlikely) choice for many aspiring livestock owners and is winning new admirers by the day.  While the llama is currently on the up, its history has not always been so rosy. Reared intensively by the Incas, llamas suffered severely at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors and still lack the genetic diversity they enjoyed in Pre-Columbian times. But over the past few decades, llamas have flourished as a global commodity, fulfilling novel roles and gaining an international profile.  So how has the llama gone from near extinction to global sensation? The ancestors of the llama originated in the Great Plains of North America around 40-50m years ago and migrated to South America 3m years ago, when a land bridge formed between the two continents. Llamas themselves are believed to be descended from guanacos – their wild cousins – and were first domesticated around 4,500BC.  As the only livestock to be domesticated by humans anywhere in the New World, South American camelids fulfilled a role in the Andes equivalent to horses, cattle and sheep in Europe, furnishing ancient Peruvian civilisations with transportation, clothing and sustenance. They occupied a crucial place in the cultures of the Nazca (c. 200BC-600AD), Moche (c. 0-700AD), Wari (c. 600-1000AD) and Chimu (c. 1300-1470AD). Llamas are most closely associated with the Incas, who used them as beasts of burden and sacrificed thousands of the animals every year to their gods. In the month of Capac Raymi (January), for instance, they sacrificed 100 camelids with “long wool and stiff straight tails”; in the following month, Camay (February), they sacrificed 100 “light brown” camelids, “white from the knees down, with white heads”.  While such large numbers of sacrifices might have been expected to seriously reduce llama numbers, careful management ensured that the flocks survived and prospered. The Incas refrained from killing female llamas, to ensure that stocks remained for breeding. They also developed a novel method of treating a disease called “carache” (probably scabies), burying afflicted beasts “at once, deep in the ground” to prevent them infecting the entire flock. They also conducted a census of camelids every November to calculate their number, recording the results in quipus – knotted threads employed as a form of account keeping.  Unfortunately, such careful practices were not maintained after the Spanish conquest, and the llama faced annihilation. While some wild species (such as jaguars) likely benefited from the arrival of the Spanish – and the consequent reduction of the human population of the Americas – llamas suffered the same fate as their human owners. Over-exploited for their meat, attacked by newly imported diseases and out-competed for grazing by sheep, llamas perished in huge numbers, experiencing a demographic decline of 80-90% in the first 100 years after the conquest. Llamas were initially very much victims of globalisation, their numbers plummeting dramatically during the “Columbian Exchange” of the 16th century. But since then, llama populations have gradually rebounded and extended their range beyond South America. Between 1773 and 1778, the veterinary school at Alfort in France possessed a llama, which was examined by the famous naturalist George Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. In 1805, the first llama to be exhibited in Britain was put on display at Brookes’s Menagerie in London, and by 1829 London Zoo owned two llamas. One of these – of the white variety – was described as “gently, mild and familiar”; the other – a brown animal – as “morose” with a penchant for spitting at visitors. Today, llamas are big business and their uses have expanded to include livestock guarding, therapy and agility training. In Peru and Bolivia, the animals continue to be used as beasts of burden in rural areas and retain some of their sacred connotations. They also appear increasingly as tourist attractions, gambolling around the Inca ruins at Machu Picchu and posing for photographs in Cuzco and other tourist hot spots. In 2014, the Bolivian government lobbied the United Nations to make 2016 the International Year of Camelids, emphasising the “economic and cultural importance of camelids in the lives of people living in areas where they are domesticated”.  Beyond South America, llamas have been employed to protect sheep, comfort the sick and stock many a hobby farm. In the US, a llama named Rojo conducts regular visits to hospitals, schools and old people’s homes in Oregon, while a golf course in North Carolina employs several llamas as caddies. Llamas have also been used in various parts of the globe to protect livestock from predators, shielding sheep, calves and poultry from attacks by foxes, wolves and coyotes.  The llama is one victim of globalisation to survive demographic catastrophe and come out the other side an international animal, loved, farmed and traded around the world."
"Labour’s “green new deal” – or “green industrial revolution” – puts a radical environmental plan at the heart of the party’s election offer. It proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, which it says would create hundreds of thousands of green jobs.  The party says the programme would also transform the way people live – from upgrading the UK’s entire housing stock and revitalising public transport to boosting renewable wind and solar industries and decarbonising the country’s energy supply. Although the initial investment would be large, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging economic benefits, which experts say would total at least £800bn by 2030. The green new deal aims to tie far-reaching environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by – and benefits – ordinary people. The party, which at its conference backed plans to hit zero emissions by 2030, has also said it would ban fracking and boost electric car infrastructure. The Tories say they want to double science and research spending to £18bn in the next parliament, with an unspecified amount going to new green technology. The party says it also wants to increase the number of public electric vehicle charging points so that everyone in England and Wales is within 30 miles of a charging point, with an investment of £500m. The party, which has been criticised over its record on onshore wind and solar power, says it will build more offshore windfarms, increasing the UK’s target capacity from 30GW to 40GW by 2030. It has also announced plans to plant 30m trees a year by 2025. It would create “clusters” of carbon capture and storage expertise around the country for £800m in the next decade, and a cabinet-level committee will oversee the commitment to reach its target of net zero carbon by 2050. It has also announced a review of the HS2 high-speed rail project and a moratorium on fracking. The party says it will establish citizens’ assemblies to thrash out new policy measures to tackle the climate emergency. It wants to revive the green investment bank, sold off by George Osborne, and end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030. It would support onshore and offshore wind and solar power, with a target of 80% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and says all new homes would be fitted with solar panels. It says it would declare a nature crisis and work towards an international Paris-style agreement on preserving the natural world and biodiversity. It has pledged to plant 60m trees a year and impose a moratorium on airport expansion, including Heathrow. The party would ban fracking and new coalmines and has set a net zero target of 2045. The Greens say they would raise £100bn by borrowing every year for the next 10 years to pay for tackling the climate crisis through upgrading infrastructure, including shifting electricity generation to a low-carbon footing, insulating the UK’s draughty housing stock and expanding public transport. They aim to bring forward the UK’s target for net zero carbon from 2050 to 2030 and would scrap nuclear power and expand renewable energy. They are in favour of ending airport expansion, including Heathrow, scrapping HS2 and halting the current road-building plan, spending the money instead on local transport improvements. They would ban fracking and all fossil fuel expansion. The SNP is aiming for a 75% reduction of all emissions by 2030, net-zero carbon by 2040 and net zero for all emissions by 2045. It is proposing to “phase out the need” for petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032, investing in active and sustainable travel by doubling cash for walking and cycling to £80m a year. It is introducing a deposit return scheme for drink containers to increase recycling and reduce littering. And an expert panel is looking at what else can be done to reduce demand for single-use items. It has banned fracking and underground coal gasification and says it is “championing the principle” of climate justice."

Yet its operators, among them energy giant E.on, are aiming to mothball the recently installed modern gas-fired facility for good. The reason? It’s losing money because Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act, which allows conventional plants to operate only when the wind and sun aren’t putting out.
Hat-tip: EIKE here.
The Irsching gas-fired power generators are unable to operate at a profit because the facility has to yield to wind and solar energy, which are mandated to be fed first into the grid by law. The result: the modern gas turbines are forced to operate intermittently when the sun and wind are AWOL, which means they are unable to cover their high operating costs. The dirtier coal power plants have lower operating costs, and so they are making a comeback. Result: the green energy revolution is leading to more CO2 emissions, and not less.

According to FOCUS magazine, the Irsching gas-fired plant located near Ingolstadt in southern Germany has become “the symbol of the faulty development of the Energiewende” – Germany’s ongoing transition to green energies.
Industry association leader Hans-Joachim Reck, complains: “It’s the paradox of the Energiewende that now the cleanest and most efficient power plants in Germany, the gas-fired power plants, cannot earn money.”
The gas-fired Irsching facility isn’t the only one that risks being shut down because they are prevented from operating at their capacities and efficiencies. FOCUS writes: “approximately 50 applications to shut down similar plants have been submitted across Germany“. As more and more erratic solar and wind power come online, the less efficiently gas-fired plants operate. As a result, Germany’s stable component of its power grid is eroding rapidly.
So how bad has Germany’s energy policy become, outsiders may ask? At EIKE economist Dr. Klaus Peter Krause tells us:
What the political leadership has inflicted with its ‘Energiewende’ and continues to inflict is a ‘farce to the tenth power’. When it comes to the financial burden for Germans and the entire [German] economy, it will surpass the also ruinous euro bailout policy.”
That’s awfully ruinous.
The shutting down of gas-fired plants has already put the south German power supply stability at risk. Already the federal government has intervened and forbidden the mothballing of several gas power plants. This of course will only serve to further burden the power utilities with even more costs. Eventually those too will get passed on to German consumers, who are already paying the second highest electricity rates in the world. Little wonder 600,000 households can no longer afford it.
So far only about a quarter of Germany’s power is supplied by renewables. The target is 90% by 2050. Little wonder many experts think the whole system is going to collapse well before that.

Geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning responds to and mocks the Potsdam Institute’s report released together with the World Bank.
===================================
Learning from the PIK means learning how to win: Clever Climate Marketing 2.0
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning
(Translated by P Gosselin)
When it comes to the business of climate change, we are dealing with lots of money. Thus it is only natural that the World Bank is getting into the act and playing the climate doomsday music. But to do this, it needs an ally. Fortunately there’s the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), which is sort of a mill that regularly churns out and markets new, entertaining horror scenarios.
The World bank has contracted the PIK to conjure up an entire series of climate alarms. Part 3 of the cooperation came to light in November 2014. Of course here one finds nothing new. Yet again the attempt was made to shock a climate-weary public with the usual old Biblical extreme-weather cocktail: hellish heat, huge floods and giant cyclones descending from the heavens.
Their efforts seem to have been accompanied by a professional marketing department that took on the task of coming up with hard-hitting marketing slogans and catchy messages. And so this is how they got the title ‘Turn down the heat 3‘, which also could be the name of a rock album. Hats off. The same can be said for the slogan: “Confronting the new normal”. Sounds great.
So why can’t us climate skeptics do the same? In our reports we all too often use ineffective terms, calling the other side names like “stupid alarmists”, “swindlers”, or “senseless”. What if instead we used terms like “Let’s get back to reason 5.0″ or “Accepting and understanding the Medieval Warm Period”?
Overall the structure of the PIK press release and the psychological fundamental elements used are carefully considered and crafted. The claim “Climate change impacts foremost the world’s poor” really does play on the heart strings:
‘Global warming impacts in the next decades are likely to hit those hardest that contributed least to global greenhouse gas emissions: the global poor.’ Developing countries are expected to experience the most severe climate impacts, notably in the tropics, while lacking the means to build resilience. And within these countries, again those parts of the population with the least means are most vulnerable to additional stress.”
A great marketing gag: the evil westerners are destroying the climate, particularly in developing countries. From a scientific point of view, it is totally baseless, yet it sounds really good and almost no one will dare to challenge the claim. That simply does not befit the rich westerner. Here for example the coral horror would be of much worth. Here’s how it’s written by the PIK:
In the Caribbean, coral reefs are threatened of significantly higher probabilities of annual bleaching already at 1.5-2 degrees warming… .”

Apparently knowledge of the latest literature on that subject is quite lacking at the PIK. Otherwise the Potsdam scientists would have known that the coral reefs have turned out to be far more warmth-resistant than previously feared. Yet the cooperation between the World Bank and the PIK has far less to do with facts, and much more with moral declarations formulated in catchy language that makes for good prose. The PIK director puts on his best act to mislead:
‘Tackling climate change is a matter of reason, but also of justice,’ says the report’s lead-author Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of PIK.”
This method would also work effectively for the climate realists side. For example we could write:
‘Recognizing the climate’s natural variability is a matter of reason, but also of justice,’ says Sebastian Lüning, DkS website director and number 2 lead author of the sustainable climate report ‘Die Kalte Sonne’.”
As is known since the discovery of the motion picture in Hollywood, a good story has a happy ending and allows for a bright outlook. Thus it is no surprise that this technique also gets used by the PIK and the World Bank:
‘The good news is that we can do something about it’
[…] The good news is that we can take action that reduces the rate of climate change and promotes economic growth, ultimately stopping our journey down this dangerous path. World leaders and policy makers should embrace affordable solutions like carbon pricing and policy choices that shift investment to clean public transport, cleaner energy and more energy efficient factories, buildings and appliances.”
A positive call to action is simply far more effective than making threats. The phrase “Good News” has been successfully employed in religions for a very long time, and also by cults. “The good news: You can transfer one third of your income to the account of our religion founder, and so cleanse yourselves of all your sins.”
Us skeptics should do as the PIK does and band together with a top performing team of marketing experts and psychologists so that we too can promote our scientific messages in the suitable format.
This step is not only a matter of reason, but also of justice. Learning from the PIK means learning how to win.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt has been clear for a long time to those who simply observe climate that temperatures are driven by, in the long term, orbital and Earth tilt cycles, the Milanković cycles, in the medium term by solar cycles with ocean cycles. like the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO), and in the short term, by ocean and atmosphere cycles like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
A few researchers have used this information to project the future. An example can be found on the sidebar of this blog. A problem with these projections is that factors such as volcanoes cannot be predicted. Due to the chaotic nature of most ocean cycles, these also cannot be used to predict the future. Only the AMO is regular enough to extend into the future, and then only for one or two cycles.
The sun is our source of energy, and it also has cycles. The 11-year sunspot number cycles (SSN) are regular but seem not to affect climate in any cyclic way. Only the integrated energy over whole cycles seems to push temperatures, and this affect seems to be delayed by about one whole sunspot cycle. Here is a history of the last 150 years and a simple projection to 2050.

 
Figure 1 is a chart of the main influences on global temperature over the last 150 years. The red trace is based on the SSN processed with an 11-year trailing average. The purple AMO trace has been smoothed with a 9-year centered average. These were then combined with the annual average central Pacific El Niño 3.4 to produce the orange trace. The orange trace is a model of global temperature before volcanic cooling. The vertical green lines are named volcanic eruptions, the height of the lines is the volcanic eruption index (VE) using the right side scale. The blue trace is the global annual temperature average as published by GHCN.
For over a hundred years, the orange model follows the GHCN temperature closely except where perturbed by volcanic activity. Volcanoes can warm the atmosphere if they are primarily ash eruptions, or cool the atmosphere if they loft large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. The Askja eruption and caldera collapse in Iceland in 1875 produced primarily ash. That eruption plus a Grand El Niño the following year produced a warm year in 1876. The VE6 eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 and Tarawara three years later, produced five years of cool climate.
Santa Maria and Novarupta were two more VE6 eruptions, that along with a cool sun and a negative AMO sent temperatures plunging in the early 20th century. From 1918 until 1975, temperatures followed the ocean cycles and the sun very closely. Smoke and soot from WWII, along with a strong El Niño in 1942, may have caused the warming from 1939 to 1945. In contrast, a strong La Niña in 1975 that lasted for two years produced a pronounced cooling. This was the “ice age scare” of the late 1970’s.

After 1978 a serious divergence began between this model based on sun and ocean cycles and the GHCN measurements, leading to the current 0.6°C difference. For UAH satellite measurements this difference is less, from 0.3°C to 0.45°C, depending on the level set for the 1979 record beginning relative to GHCN.
To account for this difference, the reader is urged to note the changes over the years to the global temperature records as found by the following reporters:
– Steven Goddard: Data Tampering At USHCN/GISS and about a thousand other posts on the same subject.
– Paul Homewood: Posts Tagged Temperature Adjustments, and Another GISS miss: warming in the Arctic – the adjustments are key
– Ira Glickstein: The PAST is Not What it Used to Be (GW Tiger Tale)
– Willis Eschenbach: The Smoking Gun At Darwin Zero.
– MS at The Hockey Stick: Paper finds more smoking guns of temperature data tampering in Northern Australia.
– Ed Caryl: A Light In Siberia. This was also posted here. And Is GISS Also Cheating In The Arctic?
– Jennifer Marohasy: Corrupting Australia’s Temperature Record, along with here, here, and others.
– Michael and Ronan Connolly: Global Warming Solved
These adjustments can account for the whole difference between the model and the GHCN temperature record. It is not necessary to invoke any CO2 warming. If it is there, it is very slight, on the order of 0.1°C.
The model indicates that it has been cooling since 2010, and that the cooling will continue as solar output declines and the AMO goes negative. Yes, the years from 1998 to 2010 were warmer than the 20th Century average because the globe was at the peak of all the natural cycles. But it is all downhill from here.
Cooling next 30 years
Solar activity is going into a decline as well. We don’t yet know if this decline will be to a Dalton Minimum-like level or a Maunder Minimum level. The model projection into the future does not contain ENSO or volcanic data as that data cannot be predicted. But it will get cooler for the next thirty years. The AMO will turn positive some time in mid-century, and solar output may not decline as much as indicated, so another full-blown ice age is not beginning, but a Little Ice Age may be starting. See here for further projections into the future based on the deVries 230-year cycle and the 1000-year Suess cycle.

German power producer EnBW has sent a letter (see below) to its customers informing them that the situation was under control as tomorrow’s solar eclipse is poised to put Germany in partial darkness shortly before noon and to test the country’s power grid stability.
Because of the eclipse, up to 12,000 megewatts of PV power could disappear from the grid (if it’s sunny) in a mere hour at around 10:00 a.m. Then, shortly before noon, 19,000 megawatts could surge into the power grid in just an hour as the moon allows the sun’s radiation to shine back in unhindered.
EnBW warns of possible grid instability and the disruption of frequency sensitive industrial machinery as a result. In Germany power generators themselves are not allowed to operate power grids. Independent grid operating companies perform that task.
EIKE writes that the letter seems to pre-emptively point the finger at the grid operators should blackouts or disruptions occur.
What follows is that letter, translated in English (German version thanks to J. Kowatsch):
========================
Re: Partial solar eclipse on March 20, 2015:
 Your power supply is in good hands
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen
On March 20, 2015, a partial solar eclipse will occur over parts of Europe. This natural phenomenon will also have impacts on the power supply. As your partner for all matters concerning energy, we have put together a few important facts.
The solar eclipse will begin in Spain and end in Scandinavia. In Germany between ca. 9:10 and 12:00 noon up to 82% of the sun will be covered by the moon. If the sky is overcast, then the possible impacts will be very limited. However on a sunny day it will lead to a drop in power generation from PV systems of up to 12,000 megawatts in Germany, which is equivalent to 12 large power plants. Beginning at about 10:50 the power will then increase by up to 19,000 megawatts within about an hour.

The four power transmission grid operators in Germany are responsible for ensuring the usual system stability. The challenge is to completely balance the drop and the later subsequent rapid increase in power fed in from the PV systems by using many flexible power generations units. The power transmission grid operators have prepared well for this event. The employees at the grid control and switching centers have been trained for this special situation, and control centers will be manned with extra personnel on March 20, 2015.
Yet the chances of disruptions cannot be fully excluded. For example frequency fluctuations can effect sensitive systems (CNC machines, robots and other computer-controlled systems, etc.). Should you have any concerns, we recommend that you drive your systems down to a stable condition.
You will find more information at a mutual press release by the four power transmission grid operators dated 23 February, 2015, which we have enclosed. Moreover you will find at “Zeit online“ a fuctuial article as well as a video animation [scroll down] which illustrates very nicely the possible impacts on power feed-in by PV systems in Germany on a sunny day: http://blog.zeit.de/gruenegeschaefte/2015/03/03/sonnenfinsternis-energiewende/.
Have you got questions? Then give me a call. I’m gladly at your service.

"We’re really only just learning about the impact Hurricane Irma has had on the Caribbean, especially for residents of disaster affected areas.  How can we tell their stories, and ensure their voices and experiences are not ignored? Here are four things the media could focus on: Local Caribbean residents are the real “losers”, not the tourists. They haven’t had a flight delayed, cancelled or temporarily inconvenienced by a hurricane. Instead, they have had their lives, livelihoods and homes devastated, and recovery will be a protracted process that will take many years.  The poorest and most marginalised populations across the region will be the most affected. Irma’s unequal impacts are starkly illustrated by looking at Richard Branson’s Necker island, which is part of the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Most of the buildings on Necker and other BVI islands were destroyed or badly damaged in the hurricane. Branson himself, however, was able to safely hunker down in his private cellar while Irma wreaked havoc.  Location, or the severity of hazards, cannot sufficiently explain why Irma had such a severe impact. There needs to be an acknowledgement of why Caribbean nations are far more vulnerable to natural hazards than the US.  This requires a long hard look at the political and economic situation of these islands. For example, several reports have raised worries over the heavy reliance on a handful of sectors, such as agriculture and tourism, which will be severely impacted by Irma in the long-term. Countries with diverse economies are better able to recover following a disaster; but Caribbean countries will find recovery far more challenging, given their low economic diversity. However, reports of destroyed hotels or ruined crops also conveniently ignore local history. As Leon Sealey-Huggins, an expert in Caribbean development based at the University of Warwick, points out, these economies were effectively forced to restructure economically towards these sectors, in light of a debt crisis that was largely due to their insertion into an unequal global system following independence. News reports should expose this side of the Caribbean’s colonial history, and add to the argument that Britain, France and the Netherlands, in particular, should be doing more to help. If coverage of previous large disasters is anything to go by, we are about to see an influx of images of distressed Caribbeans being saved, rescued and cared for by international relief organisations. However, it is important to stress that local civil society is often heavily involved. These may be formal, already established organisations, or they may be grassroots groups that form spontaneously in the wake of disaster.  Following Typhoon Haiyan, for instance, a huge cyclone that devastated the Philippines in 2015, two local NGOs, Coastal Core International and the Centre for Empowerment and Resource Development, were able to exploit their local knowledge and work effectively alongside the government. This sort of collaboration is crucial: local and international organisations mustn’t work in silos. Too often, there is a media frenzy of physical destruction and human agony, and a focus on short-term relief operations. This will draw attention to the disaster, and likely galvanise many charity donations from overseas. However, it will also serve to turn the disaster into a spectacle – and the slow process of rebuilding roofs or clearing trees from roads isn’t much of a spectacle. More attention must be given to long-term recovery. This is often forgotten about, and public engagement dries up. Granted, disaster recovery is not as “sexy” as response and relief. However, this phase is absolutely critical, and is an opportunity to recover society in a way that meets the needs of local people."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Lima Climate Conference has been extended another day as countries are still unable to reach an agreement on how much to cut emissions and who has to pay how much. But there are mounting signs that the talks may have fallen apart.
This morning NTV German public television writes that German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks already left Lima Friday evening, even leaving an hour before the official end. The title of the NTV article: “Sobriety in Lima – Hangover mood at the climate conference.”
The NTV first reports on all the hope and optimism that had led up to the Conference, but that the realities of clashing national interests and responsibilities quickly dampened the mood as the conference wore on during the second week.
NTV writes:
In Lima it was already clear on Friday that important questions still could not be resolved. ‘The road to success in Paris remains remains long,’ German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks observed. The Treaty’s bindingness will first be decided in Paris in any case.”
Already it appears that negotiators in Lima may be headed only to a watered down document full of intents, declaring that the parties agree to try to agree in Paris next year.

Hendricks’s early departure
There are no details as to why the German Environment Minister left already on Friday with the business unfinished. NTV writes:
The German negotiation leadership is now in the hands of State Secretary Jochen Flasbarth. The environmental protection organization Greenpeace criticized the Minister’s departure. ‘I find it already remarkable that the German Environment Minister has departed early, after Germany had played a spirited and progressive role,’ said Stefan Krug, head of the political representative in Berlin. ‘At such moments, when the negotiations are so precarious, it is extremely important that ministers remain engaged with their colleagues behind the scenes in order to strive for a solution.'”
NTV also writes of disappointment by German socialist EU Parliamentarian Jo Leinen: “Unfortunately it looks like we will be going home with a document that will contain many vague and soft formulations.”
That may very well be the case. But don’t expect the coming UN press releases to say so. Expect them to declare a breakthrough and success.

"British Gas has raised electricity prices by 12.5% and its rivals are likely to follow suit. Another round of inflation-busting increases has put calls for an energy price cap back on the agenda.  When then Labour leader Ed Miliband first proposed a cap in 2013 it was dismissed by the Tories as coming from a “Marxist universe”. Four years later, Theresa May flirted with the idea ahead of the 2017 election, while Labour included the policy in its manifesto. But whatever it is, it’s not a Marxist idea. For a start, the price cap won’t work because the market is not only broken, it never worked in the first place. Incredibly high start-up costs mean energy is a natural monopoly, in which a small number of companies have been protecting significant investments in fossil fuels and nuclear power since the sector was first privatised.     Yes, you can regulate markets, but that requires a regulator with both sufficient teeth and the nerve to use them, and one which does not believe that switching suppliers is the answer to all its problems. British Gas’s move will add £76 to an average family’s bills each year. In theory, people could simply choose a different supplier, most likely from another of the “Big Six” energy firms who dominate the UK market. But there are lots of reasons why people won’t switch.  First of all, humans are generally poor at envisioning their future circumstances. Offer someone an amount of money in six months’ time, and then see how quickly they’ll take a fraction of that now instead.  Second, energy supply is something householders fundamentally rely on, and the difference between one supplier and another really isn’t that much extra if you’re happy with the service you have. So for those who can afford it, paying less than a tenner extra a month to avoid the hassle and for a bit of reassurance they won’t be left hanging in the case of a power cut is going to be worth it. And there are many more reasons people won’t switch, simply because humans are highly complex and rarely completely rational creatures. The belief behind the cap is that up to 10m “disengaged” Big Six customers could’ve been protected from price hikes if they’d switched.  This may be true, especially in the short term or if they’d switched away from the Big Six, but it conveniently ignores the fact that a common cause of price hikes is governments signalling their intent to intervene in the market. And unlike governments, energy suppliers think in decades, so any threat of a cap will merely be seen as a signal to drive up prices while they can, and then start lobbying like hell to get the cap raised by justifying the need for more of their costs to be passed to the consumer. An effective regulator might withstand this onslaught, but if we had an effective regulator there wouldn’t be a need for the cap in the first place. The problem with competition in the energy market is it encourages the sort of collusion and price fixing that even classical liberal economist Adam Smith warned about centuries ago. You can’t completely design out the potential for collusion because suppliers and network operators have to work together, otherwise the lights go off. And those who control the greatest assets in the market will exert the greatest influence on it – it doesn’t have to be active collusion, it’s a natural feature of imperfect markets.   Competition also means companies waste vast amounts of money paying staff to develop competing applications for different locations and technologies, when what is really required is a national strategy that sets out what is needed, and where, over the sorts of multi-decade periods energy suppliers need to justify investment. And then why bother wasting money putting those contracts out to tender? It clearly hasn’t worked for the railways. A price cap is hardly a “Marxist” solution to all this. A traditional Marxist energy policy would of course start with renationalising the industry, as energy supply is an issue that requires strategic planning at a national level. A Marxist solution would also push highly-skilled workers towards the socially-productive renewables sector, which even government estimates say could support more than 35,000 jobs across the UK.  Where eco-socialists, including myself, sometimes differ from traditional Marxism is on quite how much state ownership we see is necessary. I see a lot of value in community ownership because it doesn’t just help solve the energy problem, it also helps make people and communities more resilient. Towns and villages can’t become energy cooperatives overnight, however. They need investment, technical expertise, and an awful lot of support to get up and running. Does that sound Marxist? We already do it with private companies. The Labour manifesto included support for a publicly owned energy company in each region, and the SNP has proposed something similar. It’s not a complete solution, but it’s a big step in the right direction. Maybe it’s another idea Theresa May could consider borrowing?"
"Australia needs to develop policies and structures to prepare for the health impacts of climate change because we have not moved quickly enough – domestically or internationally – to reduce emissions and mitigate the risk, Labor’s health spokesman, Chris Bowen, believes. Bowen will use a lecture at Sydney University on Wednesday night to argue a health response to climate change would not be necessary if there was a robust international policy response to emissions. “But the world, and Australia, has failed to act with appropriate seriousness and haste, and so we will need specific policies to deal with the health impacts of climate change,” he will say.  A copy of the lecture shows Bowen will point to estimates that by 2030, 250,000 people around the world will die each year as a direct result of a warming planet. But what was often missing from the public debate in Australia “is an understanding that severe climate change, of the type the globe is currently on track to experience, isn’t just about the frequency and severity of weather events”. “It is about changing climate zones, desertification, ocean acidification, ecosystem collapse; these impacts threaten our food supply, our economy, our security and of course our health,” it says. “As some have put it, climate change is so dangerous to health that it threatens to unwind 50 years of progress in improving public health outcomes, as well as adaptation to already unavoidable impacts from climate change.” Bowen will argue that climate change means more prevalent natural disasters and heatwaves in a country already prone to both, and the arrival of disease: “Countries not so far to our north are prone to vector-borne diseases. It would not take too much more of an increase in temperature for us to be prone to those diseases.” He will challenge the Morrison government to add climate change to the list of national health priorities. There are nine priority areas agreed between the commonwealth and the states – cancer control, cardiovascular health, injury prevention, mental health, diabetes mellitus, arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions, obesity and dementia – and the health minister, Greg Hunt, has proposed a 10th: medicines safety. Bowen will say adding climate change “would raise awareness of the importance of the challenge of climate change health and set out a road map for dealing with it”. The United States, a climate laggard under the Trump administration, has a significant program of climate change, disease control and prevention research, and Britain also has a sustainable development strategy: “But in Australia we have no such equivalent. “This is despite the fact we are more exposed than most, and our medical community is increasingly vocal on the issue, from Doctors for the Environment, to the Australian Medical Association, which recently declared climate change to be a health emergency.” Guardian Australia revealed in September that the AMA had formally declared climate change a health emergency, pointing to “clear scientific evidence indicating severe impacts for our patients and communities now and into the future”. The landmark shift, delivered by a motion of its federal council, brought the organisation into line with forward-leaning positions taken by the American Medical Association, the British Medical Association and Doctors for the Environment Australia. The American Medical Association and the American College of Physicians recognised climate change as a health emergency in June 2019, and the following month the British Medical Association declared a climate emergency and committed to campaign for carbon neutrality by 2030. The World Health Organisation has recognised since 2015 that climate change was the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century, and argued the scientific evidence for that assessment was “overwhelming”. The AMA president, Tony Bartone, said climate change meant higher mortality and morbidity from heat stress, injuries and mortalities from severe weather, increases in the transmission of vector-borne diseases, food insecurity resulting from declines in agricultural outputs, and higher incidences of mental ill health. Bowen will say he has been struck in his first six months in the health portfolio by the number of clinicians and medicos who have engaged him on climate change.  “As one senior doctor put it me powerfully recently: ‘Doctors listen to the science of the climate change and its health impacts like we listen to the science of vaccination and the impacts of not vaccinating. They are as clear as each other, and ignoring the science of climate change would be akin to supporting anti-vaxxers.’ ”"
"The media is at the forefront of generating awareness over environmental issues. It is easy to name influential films like An Inconvenient Truth or note advances made by The Guardian’s environmental reporting. But what is often missing from this discussion is the environmental costs of producing media in the first place. Whether these be the energy that powers Al Gore’s visually stunning presentations or the materials – wood pulp, ink, detergents, cleansing solvents – required for printing a newspaper, there are considerable environmental costs involved. The media industry has slowly come to realise these costs, often as a result of prodding from NGOs like Greenpeace or in the form of policy (such as the BBC requiring carbon reporting for all its productions). The print sector has elaborate mechanisms in place to use recycled paper and minimise the use of harmful toxins. Similarly, the film and television sectors have started to develop carbon calculators to allow productions to assess – and curtail – their emissions. To date, emissions reductions have focused on materials and practices that adhere to the traditional production pipelines for different sectors. The newspaper industry focuses on paper; broadcasting on the travel of journalists and crew; the film industry on production management. But of course, most of the operations of contemporary media companies are now thoroughly digital. Films are shot on digital cameras, online workflows allow for centralised management of editing, newspapers are increasingly accessed online. Contemporary digital media is pervasive and proliferating, and raises fundamental questions over the capabilities of the industry to account for its environmental impact by focusing largely on traditional production methods.  Indeed, when these companies observe their environmental performance, digital operations often present a daunting challenge. Academic work on the production and delivery of digital content as well as on the devices on which they are accessed has been conducted. Yet this discussion has not penetrated the public consciousness or even parts of the industry. Many assume that digital media is more environmentally friendly than traditional forms. Take publishing – there’s far less paper used, right? The publisher Schibsted, for example, argues that the move to digital has reduced its emissions by more than 50% from 2009 to 2015. Yet it is not always clear what to include within these measurements. Schibsted has, for example, focused on the type and volume of energy needed to power devices in terms of reading time. But other considerations, such as the use of files and access to cloud services, provide more complex challenges. Cloud services provide endless backups which are seen and marketed as a way to ensure one’s data is preserved indefinitely against disruption. But increasing information flow from servers to terminal devices and using remote hosting can lead to a considerable increase in the amount of energy used. Certainly, they provide for efficient corporate conduct and management of information, but they are also a quintessential example of anthropocentric logic. The image of the immaterial cloud ignores the grounded realities of the data centres, still often at least partially powered by coal. The Guardian picked up on these debates in 2015 and commissioned extensive research on the publishing sector. It draws on studies that suggest that the internet accounts for 8% of the total energy consumption in the UK. Greenpeace estimates that the ICT sector comprises 2% of global emissions – on par with the airline industry.  A study by the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland estimates that digital content production comprises, at the high end of estimates, 50% of the total climate emissions of newspaper publications. The majority of emissions are generated by consumer choices in accessing said content (going as high as 87% of total emissions from online publications). These depend on the particularities of the devices used, the electricity mix powering data servers, the grid which consumers use to access data, their means of downloading/streaming content (wifi vs ethernet), and how much time they spend reading the material.  Any attempt to understand the digital emissions of a publisher would therefore rely on an overwhelming number of factors and variables including reader habits, data farms, internet service providers, device manufacturers, and the operations of the media companies themselves. And most difficult of all, 50% or more of these emissions take place outside of the control of the media company. These concerns are not only prominent in the publishing sector. Calculating the total emissions of a company like the BBC or 20th Century Fox is even more complex. The problems for the industry are to do with not only agreeing on similar notions of transparency and common standards of accounting, but also of collecting data from sources far outside their remit. There are no definitive ways to calculate and assess the footprint of digital media – as there arguably has been with more traditional production methods. The problem is that tracing material emissions extends all the way down the supply chain for media production and beyond to consumption practices, including how often a file is accessed and on what kind of devices. When compared to heavy industry, the footprint of media production is small. But as the use of digital proliferates, our digital footprint can and will have consequences – and we should work out how to measure this sooner rather than later. Sectors such as publishing may have alleviated environmental concerns by turning attention to recycled paper and suchlike. But the seeming immateriality of digital calls for much more extensive attention to the sector’s footprint. The proliferation of digital media necessitates urgent self reflection and regulation as well as the establishment of much firmer and more comprehensive policies to address these emissions.  The question of responsibility is clearly a tortuous one when 50% of these emissions take place outside of the control of the media company. Cross-sectional collaboration is required here, but the impetus for this goes back to the media company as well as the wider policy environment. Environmental sustainability may soon no longer be a marginal inconvenience (or a tool to generate positive PR), but emerge as a strategic, financial priority."
"Bristol is the latest city to propose a clean air or low emissions zone. These improve air quality by excluding the most polluting vehicles. Good news for the health of 100,000 people who live in the centre of Bristol – but not everyone is happy. One common objection is that zones only accelerate changes that would happen anyway as old vehicles wear out and are replaced. However, poor air is estimated to cause a health burden of more than 200 early deaths each year in Bristol, 9,600 in London and 32,000 UK-wide.  Air pollution has been described as the ‘new tobacco’ by the head of the World Health Organization. Over 90% of the world’s population suffers toxic air and research is increasingly revealing the profound impacts on the health of people, especially children. Children and babies’ developing bodies are most at risk from toxic air, with 300 million living in places where toxic fumes are six times above the international guidelines.  A comprehensive global review found that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. It causes issues from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. The systemic damage is the result of pollutants causing inflammation that then floods through the body, and from ultrafine particles being carried around the body by the bloodstream. A Canadian study recently linked air pollution nanoparticles to brain cancer for first time In the UK, while deaths attributed to air pollution have halved in the last four decades, most urban areas have illegal levels of air pollution. One in 20 deaths in the UK is still attributable to small particle pollution alone. Damian Carrington, Environment editor A study in London suggests that children in the most polluted areas are growing smaller lungs, a change that is not fully recoverable. Balanced against these impacts, we cannot justify delay. Early analysis of London’s ultra-low emission zone showed a decrease of 29% in nitrogen dioxide from traffic alongside major roads. Changes in outer London, well away from the zone, were used to estimate what would have happened without the scheme – just 7% decrease. Others worry that polluting vehicles will divert, moving the problem. However, studies from Germany and London show the opposite. The cleaner vehicles required in these zones also drive in the surrounding area, spreading the benefit."
"As Victoria issued a code red bushfire alert and Melbourne sweltered through a record-equalling November temperature, the residents of Mildura walked out of their homes at midday on Thursday to see a dust storm rolling in. On a day of catastrophic fire danger and 40C heat, high winds swept the dry topsoil into the air and across the state. In Mildura, in far north-western Victoria, dramatic footage and pictures showed the sky turn an angry red.  Residents told Guardian Australia it was like a “wall of dust”, a danger to asthmatics, and “unliveable”. And, for many, it is not even the worst dust storm this year. In May residents reported a storm as the town’s worst in 40 years. Josh Maloney, a 17-year old student at Mildura Senior College, said he had seen Thursday’s dust storm come in during class. “I’m standing in the middle of dust storm right now,” he told Guardian Australia. “We noticed through the windows that the sky had turned this dark, thick orange. We could feel this thick dust on the tables. “This is bad but recently there have been probably been three or four a week.” Sophie Appleby, 35, was working from home with her one-year-old child, with the windows closed and the doors shut. “What is really eerie is that everything goes quiet,” she said. “There’s no birdsong, there’s nothing. It’s really bizarre and you know you are in the worst of it when the birds stop singing. “I have been here for 10 years and have never experienced anything like this. We used to have a dust storm a year, this is now a weekly basis. At its worst I couldn’t see across the road. This time the heat, because it is 40C, coupled with the dust just made it unliveable. You couldn’t go outside. Wild footage from #Mildura pic.twitter.com/MrYvOJJEd2 “It is really concerning to have young children and to feel like you can’t leave your house. You’re kind of trapped.” Appleby said the extended drought had devastated farming communities and made the dust storms more frequent. “We haven’t seen rain in months. It is absolutely climate-induced. The drought in this region is crippling farmers. And the dust in the sky is that farmers’ topsoil. When you put it into perspective like that it is terrifying.” Maloney, who took part in the school climate strike, agreed. “Within the last 12 months dust storms have been a lot more regular,” he said.  “We’ve had two or three really bad ones. This is probably the second worst one this year … it’s a lot to do with mismanagement, this partially man-made drought. “If anyone wants to call this completely natural circumstances, I think they would be kidding themselves, and a lot of this is due to mismanagement of our own resources.” A fellow resident, Narelle Hahn-Smith, said greed and the diversion of irrigation water had made conditions worse. This is my reality today, another dust storm in Mildura, and a fire on our outskirts pic.twitter.com/yP5jUxI2K6 “I’ve lived in Mildura for 52 years,” she said. “We do get dust storms if we’ve had a dry winter but because we’ve had two seasons of failed crops our farming district is struggling. “If you’ve got zero allocation of water there is less water going on to crops, which causes less evaporation, which causes less rain. It is an ongoing cycle. My feeling is that part of our drought is man-made through greed. The Darling River has been seriously interfered with higher up. “I’m an asthmatic so I’ve had to stay inside today. We’ve had a couple of dust storms a week for several weeks now and we haven’t even hit summer. I can’t imagine how bad it will over summer.” Sara White captured the moment the dust rolled in. “You could almost see to the end of the street, then within a matter of 20 seconds you could only see 50 metres down the road,” she said. 10:30am vs 12:14pm in Mildura! #duststorm pic.twitter.com/G5SXvfwZIi “It was like an orange hue, not dissimilar to when you have bushfire smoke everywhere. The sun was trying to come through but it can’t, and you just get an orange glow. You get grit in your eyes, in your mouth. “It’s something that we are getting quite used to over here and it’s not something I would prefer we get used to.” “The dust storms are becoming incredibly frequent. I actually asked my next -oor neighbour, he is 84 years old and has lived in Mildura most of his life. I asked if he had seen it like this before. He said he hasn’t seen anything like this since 1944-45.” Appleby, who also has a six-year-old in school, said it was scary to think that this would be the future for her children. “We are seeing the effects of climate change firsthand in this region and these increasing dust storms are just one part of that,” she said. “It’s terrifying to think of the future. Is this the new normal for my children that I can’t take them outside to play, that we can’t leave the house? That’s scary.”"
"Nigel Farage is hoping to enlist the climate science denier Donald Trump to help lead a global campaign to plant billions of trees to capture CO2. The Brexit party leader, a friend of the US president, is due to make the announcement in Westminster on Friday as his party launches its version of an election manifesto. Described as a “contract with the British people”, the party’s focus on the environment with the support of the US may be part of an attempt to broaden its appeal to voters beyond those looking to vote for a hard form of Brexit. Speaking to the Guardian, Farage said the UK should become the face of a worldwide UN initiative. “The UK should spearhead a global initiative at the United Nations to plant billions of trees around the world and I have every confidence Britain would get support from the American administration on this,” he said. “If it’s true that an area the size of Devon and Cornwall is removed from the Amazon every year, then we have a lot of work to do – and quickly.” Farage is also pledging to ensure Britain recycles all of its own waste and to make it illegal for it to be exported overseas to be burned, buried or dumped at sea. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate change agreement, aimed at keeping the planet’s temperature rise below two degrees this century. He said the agreement placed an unfair burden on the US to meet targets while big polluters in Asia were not signatories. In 2018 he also caused controversy when he said he did not believe a finding in the US government’s fourth national climate assessment that the country’s economy would be hit by the climate crisis. Tree-planting initiatives are said to be gaining ground among rightwing parties globally as a way of reclaiming the climate debate from the left. Farage, who recently secured a rare interview with the US president on his LBC radio show, is said to be keen to work with Trump on pushing environmental policies. Farage’s Brexit party has had a difficult start to the campaign after its formal offer to the Tories of an electoral alliance was rebuffed by Boris Johnson. After coming under pressure not to split the vote among those on the right and in favour of Brexit, Farage pulled out candidates in 317 Tory-won seats. He had hoped the government would give him a free shot at Labour-won seats in return, but this was also rejected by Johnson. While it won the most seats in the European parliament elections, polls show support for the party has dropped to 3%. Another tranche of its offer to voters is political reform through referendums. Farage is expected to say at the launch in Westminster that the party would introduce “citizens’ initiatives” to allow people to call referendums, subject to a 5 million threshold of registered voter signatures. There would also be time limitations on repetitive votes of at least 10 yrs. Farage, who is not standing at the election, said: “We need wholesale change in Westminster and our plans will ensure that millions across this country feel like they can be heard in a politics that isn’t listening to them any more.”"
"Oxford Dictionaries has declared “climate emergency” the word of the year for 2019, following a hundred-fold increase in usage that it says demonstrated a “greater immediacy” in the way we talk about the climate. Defined as “a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it”, Oxford said the words soared from “relative obscurity” to “one of the most prominent – and prominently debated – terms of 2019.”  According to the dictionary’s data, usage of “climate emergency” soared 10,796%. Oxford said the choice was reflective, not just of the rise in climate awareness, but the focus specifically on the language we use to discuss it. The rise of “climate emergency” reflected a conscious push towards language of immediacy and urgency, the dictionary said. In 2019, “climate” became the most common word associated with “emergency”, three times more than “health emergency” in second. In May, the Guardian updated its style guide to clarify that “climate emergency” or “global heating” would be favoured over “climate change” or “global warming” (although the original terms are not banned) – to better reflect the scientific consensus that this was “a catastrophe for humanity”. The Guardian has updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world.
Instead of “climate change”, the preferred terms are “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” and “global heating” is favoured over “global warming”. The scale of the climate and wildlife crises has been laid bare by two landmark reports from the world’s scientists. In October 2018, they said carbon emissions must halve by 2030 to avoid even greater risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In May 2019, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and destruction of the ecosystems that support all life on Earth. The editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, says: “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.” Other terms that have been updated include the use of “wildlife” rather than “biodiversity”, “fish populations” instead of “fish stocks” and “climate science denier” rather than “climate sceptic”. Damian Carrington Environment editor Hundreds of cities, towns and even countries have also declared “climate emergencies” during 2019 – from Scotland in April, the UK parliament in May, Canada, France and the city of Sydney in Australia. “In 2018, climate did not feature in the top words typically used to modify emergency, instead the top types of emergencies people wrote about were health, hospital, and family emergencies,” the selection panel said. “But with climate emergency, we see something new, an extension of emergency to the global level.” And for those protesting that “climate emergency” is two words, as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s resident linguist explained in 2017, single words can consist of two parts. Such multipart constructions, like “heart attack”, “man-of-war” or the 2017 American Dialect Society word of the year “fake news”, are commonly accepted by linguists as words. “Climate emergency” beat the words “climate crisis”, “climate action”, “climate denial”, “extinction”, “flight shame”, “global heating” and “plant-based”, which were on the shortlist. The dictionary’s word of the year is chosen to “reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the passing year” and should have “lasting potential as a term of cultural significance”. “In 2019, climate emergency surpassed all of those other types of emergency to become the most written about emergency by a huge margin, with over three times the usage frequency of health, the second-ranking word,” Oxford said. Previous choices for word of the year include “toxic” in 2018 and “youthquake” in 2017."
"Most of the world could switch to 100% renewable energy by 2050, creating millions of jobs, saving millions of lives that would otherwise be lost to air pollution, and avoiding 1.5℃ of warming. That’s the bold claim of a major new study by Stanford professor Mark Jacobson and his colleagues, published in the journal Joule. Such work can be controversial. Jacobson and his team had previously produced a similar “energy roadmap” for the US alone, which sparked a fierce debate about whether it was feasible or even possible to power the country only with wind, water and solar by mid-century. One rebuttal earlier this summer, by a team of scientists led by Christopher Clack, claimed Jacobson’s plan didn’t have enough energy storage, was unrealistic about hydropower and completely disregarded nuclear power and carbon-capture – it was, they said, a “poorly executed exploration of an interesting hypothesis”.  The original authors responded by saying “there is not a single error in our paper” and highlighting the critics’ links to the fossil and nuclear industries. The debate had quickly turned into a personal feud on the pages of prominent academic journal PNAS and even Twitter.  Jacobson’s work has been politically influential, despite all the bickering. Many cities have joined his 100% renewables movement and public figures such as Bernie Sanders and the actor Mark Ruffalo have pledged their support.  Now Jacobson has upped the ante by publishing this new analysis of 139 countries across the world. However, it is likely that it will also be criticised along similar lines as it uses simplifying assumptions and still evades a detailed modelling of the three largest problems we face in the transition to sustainable energy: storage (especially large scale and long term), intermittency (both generation and demand) and trade (influenced by national security agendas just as much as by economics). Nevertheless, it can still be regarded as an agenda-setting, hypothetical description of the future, rather than a scientific pathway. But this is just what we need. Debates over energy modelling rarely make front page news, but this one did. We believe the world needs more discussion and awareness of the sheer complexity of the problem, as well as a positive vision of the future to aim for. And that requires work that is ambitious – and long-term. The energy transition is one of those “wicked problems” – by the time you realise you took the wrong action, it may be already too late.  It’s true that 2050 is a whole generation away, but this is exactly the sort of timescale over which we need to think about switching to clean energy. Change doesn’t happen overnight. Even if a holy grail technology was invented today, history teaches us that it would still take decades to make it viable on an industrial scale and many more years to deploy worldwide.  And let us not forget that radical energy inventions happen perhaps once or twice a century, with no guarantee they will keep occurring. Therefore we must look to the alternatives that are already being deployed on a large scale: wind and solar. The possibility of continuing to rely on fossil fuels along with carbon capture and storage is fading away, given both the practically nonexistent commercial deployment so far and the associated risks. On the other side, renewables are already the cheapest option for providing (variable) power in many countries, significantly below fossil fuels and nuclear power, while both hydropower and bioenergy are limited to certain regions and cannot easily scale up.  With the cost of wind and solar set to fall even further, the real question is what additional infrastructure we deploy to support it. This certainly includes batteries, which are predicted to become dramatically cheaper.  But there is also something else: inertia. This is partly technical: cheaper renewables and climate policies will leave a legacy of “stranded assets” such as the unnecessary Chinese coal-fired power plants that will probably never be turned on, or the UK’s nuclear plant at Hinkley Point C, already twice as expensive as offshore wind. But renewables must also battle against political and social inertia. Our societies are becoming ever more complex, and energy (especially electricity) plays an increasingly central part in supporting this complexity. An “energy transition” isn’t enough; what’s required is a total societal transformation. This societal transition can only be discussed in conjunction with other critical systems like transport or manufacturing and trends such as the rise of big data analytics, artificial intelligence or the internet of things. These are the fields which have the potential to actually revolutionise and enable the large-scale transition to renewables. And the large energy companies already know this. Take transport. Recently, many countries have come up with plans to ditch petrol cars and go electric. These policies will need to join up with plans to store more energy and build more turbines and solar panels (if they don’t, emissions may increase). But they’ll also rely on developments in artificial intelligence, governance, the concept of car ownership and even insurance. The  ideal of replacing all fossil-fuel vehicles with electric, comfortably charging every night, may be impeded by an antiquated grid or by insurers that choose not to cover damage or fires. An optimizing centrally controlled algorithm or a consumer-based dynamic pricing system could resolve this, but there are limited laws and precedents for this – another example of technology already being far ahead of what is politically or socially feasible.  People need to be clear that renewables are the way forward. We may differ with Jacobson and his team over the best type of energy storage, but there is a lot of value in this sort of ambitious roadmap. It emphasises the scale of the challenge, and, if done right, it should bolster general opinion and inspire action. The Paris Agreement was a good example of target-setting but details matter. We know that the future will not be anything like we imagine – “all models are wrong” after all. But physical limitations suggest there won’t be a magical new source of energy; the technologies we need are already here. Like Polynesian navigators, we need to look beyond the horizon to “see” the unknown destination we are heading to."
"Just 2% of the election debate was spent discussing the climate crisis. That includes the second Jeremy Corbyn gave it in his opening statement. When it was finally discussed – for a scant 45 seconds in the last 10 minutes – Corbyn was heckled after highlighting the effects our changing climate would have on the world’s poorest, with a jeer of “Oh, here we go!”. For those of us who work on raising awareness and finding solutions to the climate crisis, it was chilling. Corbyn himself looked shocked and seemed to gesture to the audience as if to say, “See what I’m working with?”  Implied in the audience intervention was the idea that caring about the plight of the world’s poorest is the preserve of tiresome, do-gooding snowflakes. Who cares about the people at the whims of climate change-related extreme weather events? They’re on the other side of the world anyway, right?  Thankfully, it is increasingly a minority of Brits who laugh off the climate crisis. Just this week Ipsos Mori noted that, when asked to list the most important issues facing Britain today, the environment and pollution had leapt up the chart, with 21% of respondents saying it was important to them. This is its highest recorded score since July 1990, a six-percentage-point rise from September, pushing this topic into fourth place (after Brexit, health and crime but above education, inequality, housing, the economy and immigration). Similarly, polling from YouGov at the end of last month shows a majority of voters say climate change will influence the way they vote. For under-25s, it’s near three-quarters. But we clearly can’t rely on demographic changes to push the dial towards climate action. We need action now. Climate activists always say this, but what we do in the next few years really is vital. The urgency required to deal with our environmental crisis means this has to be the climate election, whether we’d rather be talking about Brexit or not. The heckle seemed to derive from the view that the Labour leader is a bleeding-heart liberal who puts Brits last. Without wanting to suggest he should cave in to nationalist rhetoric at the first sign of resistance, Corbyn might well have avoided this by pulling the conversation back to a more domestic frame, skewering the prime minister on the recent floods, the Tories’ near-ban on onshore wind or their lack of action on cold, uninsulated homes. The Labour leader did move on to refer to “unusual weather patterns” and extreme air pollution in the UK, as well give a plug to Labour’s “green industrial revolution”, but it seemed almost like an afterthought. I’m sure in his post-debate debrief he was told this was a missed opportunity, and many of my fellow activists in the climate movement might be taking this as a sign that we need to be careful to always speak to domestic concerns first. And yet, at the same time, we can’t keep sugar-coating the impact of our emissions on the rest of the world. We should be able to have a grown-up national debate on the climate crisis as an issue of global inequality, including the often exploitative and damaging role the UK has played. And why not have it at a point when voters are at their most engaged and politicised? The sort of ambitious climate action we need in order to limit the damage globally is going to be difficult. It will require radical action against the big oil corporations – but it also means a change in our individual behaviour and routines too. We need drastically heightened levels of tree planting – it can’t just be a few more saplings here and there – and that’s going to mean more of us eating less meat. We need to cut flying, and driving too, and change our heaters and cookers. It’s vital we get these conversations right or they could go sour, fast. And although comments like those made in the leaders’ debate are beyond the pale, changing hearts and minds will have to involve challenging parochial approaches to climate action too. We need to do this well. Protests for climate action have been extremely powerful in the last year, and will no doubt continue to be so throughout the election and into next year. Looking ahead, we may be better served by a community-organising approach, one that focuses more on personal relationships and, above all, listening to people across the UK, rather than simply shouting our campaign messages ever louder. Older people who may not identify with environmental protest groups need to be listened to, engaged with and have clearly explained to them the ramifications of inaction on climate change. Otherwise, jeers such as “Oh, here we go!” could be just the beginning of a climate crisis culture war, where eco-fascism rises to the surface. This doesn’t mean simply agreeing to views we find abhorrent, but neither does it mean dismissing them in the way Corbyn’s “See what I’m working with?” gesture seemed to imply either. We need conversations, genuine ones where we listen to each other, and we need to be bold enough to go out and have them with people we disagree with. We can speak to a variety of values and approaches when it comes to climate change without pandering to banal nationalism. But we need to listen to them and – above all – involve them in the changes our society needs to avert climate catastrophe. • Alice Bell is co-director at climate change charity Possible and is writing a book on the history of the climate crisis."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman meteorologist Dominik Jung writes at wetter.net that the first preliminary forecast for Central Europe for the upcoming summer issued by the NOAA does not look very favorable. Expect a “grisly summer”, he writes.
He writes that over the last 10 years spring has generally been on the warm and sunny side, but that Central Europeans have had to pay a price for that by having to put up with wet and variable summer weather.
Models wrong 11 out of 12 years!
Jung then reminds us that the climate models have been very wrong with their 2003 predictions that Central Europeans in the future would have to expect hot, barbecued summers like the one seen in 2003. Back then climatologists warned the public to get used to such summers, as it was all consistent with global warming. Turns out that prediction has been a complete flop. Jung writes:
Do you recall the climate prophets after the hottest and driest summer of all time in the 2003 prophesizing more drought summers? None of that has occurred. Of the 11 summers that followed, 7 were wetter than the long-term mean, i.e. too much rain. Moreover predictions of sustained heat waves failed to come true. Four summers turned out to be almost normal and only one single summer was about 15% too dry. The majority of the past summers saw no large heat waves. It was hot only for a few days, with really cooler days with thundershowers in between.
That could be again the case this year. According to the long-term trend of the US weather service, March and April could turn out to be warmer, sunnier and drier than normal. A few days ago the first trend for the months of June, July, August was calculated by the US colleagues and things don’t look better than the past – in fact it looks a little worse!
This year could be a grisly summer. The US long-term model sees no summer month that will be warmer than the long-term average. All three summer months should be at near normal temperatures and accompanied by more precipitation than normal. August is forecast to be especially wet.”
But Jung warns that these are only long-term projections and that one should not put too much stock in them. Many readers here are aware that the seasonal forecasts made by the US weather services (and those of the UK Met Office) often leave much to be desired.
In fact assuming the opposite would likely be a better prediction.

"Kelsey Juliana, a youth climate activist from Oregon, is joining forces with Gabriela Hearst, a fashion designer whose clothes are worn by Lady Gaga and the Duchess of Sussex, to ignite a trend they hope will become a global sensation. Juliana, 23, is the lead plaintiff in a group lawsuit suing the US government for breaching the human rights of her generation by failing to take action to protect the environment. The case, Juliana v United States – which goes by the unofficial name of Youth v Gov – aims to have the US supreme court order the government to dramatically change energy policy. Hearst – who, with her husband, John Augustine Hearst, the scion of the magazine empire, has a net worth estimated at £1.5bn – is providing financial backing for the case.  As they prepare to speak in front of an audience of designers, supermodels, editors and luxury industry CEOs at the Business of Fashion Voices conference, Juliana and Hearst hope that their constitutional action to protect the rights of young people to a clean environment can snowball into the next decade’s most era-defining trend. “Fashion sets the tone for society. Right now, we need to imagine a new way of living and fashion can help us do that,” says Juliana. “And fashion has young people driving it, just like climate action does.” Juliana, who filed her case aged 15, has taken part in many protest events, including marching 1,600 miles from Nebraska to Washington DC in 2016, but believes that lawsuits give those too young to vote a way to stand up for their right to a habitable planet. “All movements – the women’s movement, the gay rights movement – have cemented themselves in law and in the culture with a constitutional change,” says Hearst of their choice of a legislative rather than protest-based challenge. “It’s important to solidify this by going through the traditional route.” There are currently 1,390 lawsuits against governments and fossil fuel corporations in more than 25 countries, according to the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. Last month, a group of 15 young Canadians filed La Rose v Her Majesty the Queen, alleging that the Canadian government’s energy policies have violated their rights to a stable climate. Juliana notes that “there are more cases coming up all over the world”. Many climate activists would decline an invitation to speak at a fashion event, given that it represents one of the world’s most polluting industries and sits uncomfortably at the crossroads of still-growing consumerism and increasing awareness of the need for change, but Juliana is “excited to be here. All facets of our society currently operate in a way that is problematic – the way we eat, the way we travel, what we buy. I am totally guilty of buying fast fashion, because I don’t have the resources to buy luxury fashion. But I was in Amsterdam recently and it was inspiring to see how much secondhand clothes and taking care of clothes are part of the culture there. What if we saw fashion come to represent a new way of living?” Fashion has always symbolised intergenerational strife and is, in that sense, a fitting stage for a crisis in which the Greta Thunberg generation are voicing increasing anger towards older people. “I want to be on stage to showcase how young people are stepping up to the bat, and ask the professionals and heads of industries in the audience to stand with us,” says Juliana. “My future is at risk in a way that isn’t the case for old people. I won’t sugarcoat it – I feel disappointment, disgust and rage. But my primary emotion is love – a deep, deep love for life and for the planet.” Hearst staged New York fashion week’s first carbon-neutral catwalk show in September, working with the consultancy EcoAct to calibrate and offset each element of the carbon footprint. However, shesays: “Sometimes, I think I should just stop producing products. Definitely, people should buy less.” Britain, she says, is better placed to lead a change of lifestyle than the US, “because here you experienced world war two and so you understand frugality and resilience, which is the mentality we are going to need to access. In America, those challenges haven’t been seen since the civil war.”Other speakers at the Voices conference, which begins on Thursday, include the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, Clare Farrell of Extinction Rebellion and the photographer Juergen Teller."
"Colombia is the second most biodiverse country in the world, as measured by species richness. But over the past half century it has also been home to a brutal civil war, inflicting death and displacement on its citizens, with negative repercussions on its natural environment. However grim, conflict itself is not necessarily bad for biodiversity. While the lack of governance in war zones can encourage illegal mining and deforestation, a resulting reduction in development can also mean the natural environment is not exposed to pressures it might otherwise face. So, peace brings a fresh environmental challenge. In November 2016 the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) signed a peace agreement to put an end to more than five decades of conflict. The optimism has since been tainted by delays in the process and an increase in the number of human rights activists murdered this year.  All this makes it a delicate time for Colombia and its natural riches. Brigitte Baptiste, director of the Humboldt Institute in Bogotá, described the period as a “great ecological experiment”. Throughout the text of the peace agreement, the goal of maintaining social and environmental sustainability was stressed. It called for the establishment of agricultural workers’ associations, for example, with the aim of protecting the environment, while substituting illegal drug crops for food production. The agreement also set out plans for environmental zoning to mark out the agricultural frontier. It’s not going to be easy. Since the signing of the peace agreement there have been some worrying trends. Deforestation increased by 44% in 2016, primarily in areas previously controlled by the FARC. These figures are aligned with some recent research showing a correlation between the presence of the FARC and lower levels of deforestation, due to the guerrilla group maintaining a level of control over the forests in its territory. Production of coca (which goes into making cocaine) is also on the increase, due in part to a perverse incentive for coca farmers to increase the size of their crops in order to receive greater subsidies for switching to alternative crops as part of the peace strategy. Aside from illegal activity, there are major national plans for development, including mining concessions and a massive infrastructure programme of 8,000km of roadways, all of which put Colombia’s biodiversity under threat. However, peace also creates opportunities. Colombia could now improve its governance and conservation policies, and properly monitor the biodiversity of zones previously off limits during the conflict. For instance, 88 new species have been discovered in Colombia since the peace agreement in areas previously considered too dangerous for research.  At the International Congress for Conservation Biology (ICCB) held in Cartagena, Colombia in July 2017, conservationists from Colombia and across the world discussed some of these key opportunities. Protected areas are being expanded, and there is a major drive for more eco-tourism – especially for bird lovers.  Colombia’s national development plan promotes a strategy of green growth and “as much market as possible, and as much state as necessary”. Consequently, new market-based conservation initiatives are emerging that attempt to find a compromise between economic development and nature conservation.  One example is the emergence of “biodiversity offsetting”. This aims to compensate for the environmental impacts of large mines, dams or roads by conserving or restoring an ecosystem of greater or equal biodiversity value as to that that is being damaged. But these mega projects still tend to become sites of conflict. In fact, the Environmental Justice Atlas lists 125 environmental conflicts in Colombia (only India has more), most of which arise from mining or drilling for oil and gas.  Popular consultations are now cropping up around Colombia, where communities have been voting against mining in their territories. Many feel that their livelihoods and the extractive industries are strongly incompatible: “agua, vida o minería” (“water, life or mining”). Meanwhile, Baptiste, in her plenary speech at the ICCB, spoke of “minería sí, pero no así” (“mining yes, but not in that way”), outlining a wish for responsible mining and a belief in the existence of solutions that can make development compatible with nature conservation. Baptiste presented a breakdown of where biodiversity is located in Colombia and who is in charge of it, with protected areas representing 14-18% of the national territory, and mining and energy concessions representing 25%, around 1% of which has thus far been transformed by mining activity. It is critical that conflict between armed groups is not simply replaced by conflict between communities and mega projects over the protection of their livelihoods and environment. It is unclear as yet how life, both human and non-human, will evolve in Colombia after the conflict. Certainly, there is a long road ahead to transition this country into a truly post-conflict nation. The challenge, and the opportunity, is to build a peaceful society while maintaining its biological and cultural diversity, and develop a model for other biodiversity-rich countries affected by war."
"A potentially deadly disease affecting marine mammals, including seals and sea otters, has been passed from the North Atlantic Ocean to the northern Pacific thanks to the melting of the Arctic sea ice. Experts have long been concerned that sea ice melting in the northern oceans, caused by global climate heating, could allow previously geographically limited diseases to be transmitted between the two oceans.  Now scientists believe they have identified how an outbreak of distemper, similar to that suffered by dogs, was passed from northern seal populations to Alaskan seals and sea otters . “There’s long been concern that melting Arctic sea ice could allow disease to pass between the Atlantic and the Pacific,” Tracey Goldstein, an expert in marine animal diseases at the University of California, Davis, and one of the lead authors of a report, said. “Now here we are.” Phocine distemper virus, or PDV, has long been a threat to seal populations in the northern Atlantic, along with several strains of influenza, but had not previously been identified in the Pacific. It was first recognised in 1988 following a massive epidemic in harbour and grey seals in north-western Europe with a second event of similar magnitude and extent in 2002. The 1988 outbreak killed thousands of Britain’s seals. The virus attacks the immune system, leaving animals susceptible to pneumonia and in the most severe cases can kill a seal within 10 days of infection. The two outbreaks, which both started on the Danish island of Anholt in the Kattegat strait, killed about 23,000 harbour seals in 1988 and 30,000 seals in 2002. The virus is believed to spread through contact between infected individuals and has killed animals in the waters of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the UK and Germany. The new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, based its conclusions on samples taken from seals, sea lions and sea otters in Alaska between 2001 and 2016, finding that PDV had become entrenched in Alaskan waters. “Concern was first raised that PDV could be infecting Alaska’s sea otters so we decided to look at whether it had been transmitted via overlapping populations of seals and sea lions,” said Goldstein. “When we started testing the different species the sequence of the virus was always the same strain, with incidence peaking when the sea was open.” The research was prompted by mounting concern in recent years that the virus could reach the Pacific via a warming Arctic and infect the large Pacific harbour seal and northern elephant seal populations or the endangered Hawaiian monk seals. Genetic sampling of the disease also established that the same strain identified in the Atlantic had emerged in Alaska, with peaks of the disease correlating to periods of low sea ice. The study tested more than 2,000 animals from a variety of species in Alaska’s waters from the northern Beaufort Sea in the Arctic to more temperate southern areas. The report warns of the potential for other diseases to be spread as sea ice recedes. “Climate change-driven reductions in sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean are projected to increase and open-water routes along the northern Russian coast have occurred every August and/or September since 2008. “The health impacts of this new normal in the Arctic are unknown, but association of open-water routes through Arctic sea ice with increased PDV exposure or infection suggests that opportunities for PDV and other pathogens to cross between North Atlantic and North Pacific marine mammal populations may become more common,” it said. One of the concerns about the disease’s path from the North Atlantic to the Pacific is that it is unclear what impact it will have on infected species. While some may have a natural resistance to the disease, others may be more vulnerable, with the deadly 1988 outbreak in Europe believed to have been caused initially by an infected harbour seal from Greenland where the disease has long been endemic and the population has built up resistance."

When they tell us global warming is real while sea ice at the poles is at normal levels and snow is falling in Jacksonville, Florida and in the Arabian desert, should we believe them?
Probably not – especially when one looks closely at the climate data. And certainly not at all when one looks at how they report the news on how world leaders “bravely” demonstrated in Paris “alongside” more than a million people in response to the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack.
Most readers by now are aware of the STAGED photos and images of the 50 or so world leaders standing and “marching united with” the more than one million demonstrators in Paris last Sunday. In reality it was all staged to deceive television viewers all over the world.

World leaders stage their Paris, Charlie Hebdo, demonstration. Image cropped from here.
German Television’s mass deception
Now someone has just put up a montage of various news clips from some German public television news networks, showing how they used the stagecraft to deceive viewers into thinking our leaders were bravely demonstrating at the front row against terrorism in the Paris march of last Sunday.

At the 0:40 mark the video informs the viewers up ahead of the deception the media used:
Observe the targeted deception of the viewers through the use of camera angles, sound clips (the side streets were dead quiet) and the audacious lies of the news anchors and correspondents”.
What follows are some examples I’ve translated in English.
At the 0:55 mark Germany’s ZDF describes how more than a million people demonstrated in Paris to “send a clear signal of unity and to march for freedom of expression, tolerance and against terror”.
At the 1:12 mark, the ZDF anchor tells its millions of viewers:
And among them, arm-in-arm, the leaders and countries from all over the world.”
The reality is that these world leaders were in fact too afraid to appear “arm-in-arm, should-to-shoulder” with the masses. In effect they actually demonstrated their capitulation to terrorism, admitting the terror worked and that they are now too afraid to appear with the public. Congratulations terrorists, your aim has been achieved – at least among our leaders. Obviously real courage is something only for the masses.
At the 1:32 mark the ZDF switches to a correspondent “on location”, and shows how the world leaders seem to be marching along with the one million-plus demonstrators.
At the 1:34 mark the correspondent reports on the leaders:
These here are also demonstrators. More than 50 government leaders and high officials from all over the world march together.”
Looking at the video image, one sees Angela Merkel and others even seemingly waving at people. The sad truth is that it was all an act.

At the 2:00 mark, the same ZDF correspondent describes:
The world’s political elite on the street, side-by-side, with the people.”
Sorry, but they weren’t “with the people”. It’s just the media willfully disseminating organized deception to millions of viewers all over Europe and the world.
Later in the video a ZDF Special Report shows more of the same: brave world leaders marching hand-in-hand with the people, “to send a signal against terrorism“.
At the 2:52 mark there are more images deceiving the viewers into thinking the world leaders were marching with the people. Even Bibbi Netanyahu is getting in on the act. The deception continues at the 3:38 mark…courageous leaders seemingly risking their lives to demonstrate in unity in public with their people.
Truth: leaders were cowering behind the demonstrators
The aspect that annoys me in particular is that these leaders found the situation to be too dangerous, yet had no qualms about letting the more than a million and half demonstrators put their lives at risk on the street. Bravery for you, but not for me.
The truth is that the world leaders, by staging in an empty highly secured street, were in effect cowering in the last rows behind the demonstrators, and not bravely leading them in the front row as we were misled to believe.
At the 4:30 mark the video shows how Germany’s flagship ARD Television also uses the same mass deception, the news anchor announces:
More than 40 world leaders participated in the march.”
At the 6:40 mark the ARD in a special report again showed “world leaders marching with the people“.
At the 7:51 mark viewers see world leaders in the “front row”, seemingly bravely leading the million-plus person march. Here we notice audio of people cheering and demonstrating in the background, when in reality the footage was recorded on a secluded street where the side streets were completely empty and silent!
At the 8-minute mark the correspondent reports the names of the important figures present in the front row: Merkel, Hollande, Netanyahu and Abbas.
At the 8:06 mark the correspondent declares that it’s:
“A front row who are declaring: ‘We will not be intimidated!'”
These are the very people who send our sons and daughters to the battlefield.
At the 9:08 mark yet another ZDF report shows world leaders marching with the people, labeling them at the 9:20 mark: “Politicians as demonstrators.”
The topping on the cake comes at the 10:00 mark, where the ZDF correspondent even asks:
When was there ever a time where government leaders, or leaders of 50 nations, have come onto the streets as demonstrators, over a kilometer-long stretch that was not even completely safe? That was something particularly special.”
The mainstream media cannot be trusted. Little wonder that demonstrators in Germany refer to them as the “Liar Press”. I guess we should sarcastically start calling them “the Truth Press”.

"Australian officials have told major business groups there will have to be a diplomatic solution to a standoff between the Morrison government and other nations about whether the government can use carryover credits from the Kyoto period to meet its Paris target. Guardian Australia understands diplomats from the British high commission signalled their objection to Australia using carryover credits during a recent meeting of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network, which includes major emitters such as BHP and Woodside, and industry associations.  Australian officials responded by saying the government intended to use carryover credits despite the opposition, and there would need to be a diplomatic solution at the looming United Nations climate talks in Madrid. British officials, according to sources with knowledge of the meeting, said everything was negotiable in the context of the UN talks, but using carryover credits should not become a substitute for climate action. The British high commission in Canberra declined to comment on a presentation delivered during a private meeting. Carryover credits are an accounting system that allows countries to count credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030. Australia will need to cut emissions by 695m tonnes cumulatively across the next decade to meet its 2030 target. The Morrison government said more than half of that cut, 367m tonnes, would come from accounting and not from practical emissions reduction. Australia’s stance is controversial, and a number of countries have objected, including the European Union, Pacific nations and Canada. Environment department officials recently told Senate estimates they were unaware of any countries other than Australia planning to use the controversial credits to meet their international climate commitments. The Australian Industry Greenhouse Network meets regularly. The most recent conversation, including diplomats and Australian officials, is scheduled as a precursor to the UN climate talks in Madrid starting on 2 December. Officials from the foreign affairs department have been briefing stakeholders ahead of the meeting. Foreign affairs officials told stakeholders that Australia would not discuss an increase in its headline commitment – a 26-28% emissions cut by 2030 compared with 2005 – in Madrid and did not expect carryover credits to be a major focus at the meeting. They said the environment department was working on a long-term climate strategy that would be released for feedback early next year. This is consistent with a commitment Morrison made at the Pacific Islands forum in Tuvalu in August, when – after rejecting heavy criticism by island nations of Australia’s support for coal – he signed Australia up to pursuing efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C and produce a 2050 strategy by 2020. His statement said the strategy “may include commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050”. The context for the conversation at the network meeting was rising concern in the business community about the continuing lack of resolution to article 6 of the Paris rulebook, which is the section of the agreement promoting international cooperation, including allowing countries to trade their emissions allowances, or credits. Despite Scott Morrison’s frequent, strident criticisms during the May election of a plan by Labor to allow high emitting businesses to use international permits to reduce their pollution at least cost, Australia’s official position in the UN negotiations is it supports the use of permits. But it remains unclear whether a consensus on the rules will be reached in Madrid. The issue of whether Australia can use carryover credits from the Kyoto period is a separate but related issue to the disputes about article 6. Carryover credits are not mentioned in the Paris agreement, under which countries nominate their own targets (known as nationally determined commitments) and explain how they plan to reach them. It means there is nothing in the text that prevents Australia from using them, despite the objections. They could be banned only through consensus, which would require Australia to agree. The government said Australia was entitled to use the carryover credits as they reflected its efforts in “beating” the targets set under the Kyoto protocol. Critics say Australia has access to the credits only because it has made unexacting commitments, including allowing its emissions to continue to increase under the protocol’s first stage, and the point of the Paris deal is to significantly ramp up action over time, not just loopholes."
"In the wake of the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma, it was reported that up to 80% of home damages were not insured. Insurance schemes are widely advocated as a means of facilitating recovery from – or resilience to – natural and human-made disasters. For those without insurance, or who are under-insured, recovery prospects are bleak. Many such people – who are often already living in precarious situations – will leave their homes, never to return, or will live in properties that are unfit for habitation.  But our research suggests that even for those fortunate enough to have insurance cover, the path to recovery is tortuous. Flood-afflicted communities have likened dealing with loss adjustors, insurers, and subsequently contractors to being as “traumatic as the flood itself”. More fundamentally, the industry’s promotion of a rapid return to normality undermines efforts to create a more resilient society by reducing opportunities to adapt to future flooding. It is little wonder that there are fears that many places will increasingly suffer from repeated flood events. To take just one example of this challenge, it is reported that Houston has now experienced its third one-in-a-500-year flood in just three years.  The aftermath of any disaster provides opportunities to rebuild in a way that  reduces the impacts of future such incidents. With respect to flooding, this includes opportunities to install flood-resilient building materials, to move services such as electricity cables and power sockets above flood levels, or to use property-level protection measures such as door barriers that might keep water out of a building.  In practice, however, insurers often take complete control of rebuilding efforts, arranging for authorised contractors to conduct reinstatement work. Of course, insured homeowners are initially relieved that some of the financial burden of  rebuilding efforts will fall elsewhere. But the insurer also becomes the de-facto property owner. Homeowners – often temporarily relocated at some distance from their properties – lose control of key decisions regarding the reconstruction of their homes.  Understandably, the emphasis of all concerned is to “bounce back” and to be rehoused with things as they were as quickly as possible. As a rule, insurers do not pay for anything that could be referred to as “property betterment”. Instead, they promise to reinstate a property to its original condition (the condition it was in the day before a flood or a storm struck). This precludes adaptation and protection – measures that might limit the impact of a future flood, even if these interventions are at little or no cost to the overall rebuilding project. This is particularly problematic in the face of climate change. To understand the systemic limits to adaptation, we must examine the fundamentals of insurance. In return for a modest annual payment, insurers provide assistance in the form of financial compensation or services after a disaster. Insurance therefore transfers risk from those immediately exposed to a hazard to another entity. However, this transfer of risk brings concerns. When the costs of hazards such as floods fall elsewhere, there can be an erosion of willingness to reduce exposure or to encourage less risky behaviour. 
Insurers have long recognised this contradiction and refer to it as a “moral hazard”. In practice, the integration of adaptation measures that might mitigate flooding or that can help reduce the impacts of a flood can be disincentivised by the moral hazard. An associated concern is referred to as “risk-pooling”. Insurance premiums are pooled into a fund that is used in the event of a peril occurring. This dissipates financial exposure throughout all policyholders. While this may be good for reducing the costs to citizens at high risk, it has wider effects that we need to acknowledge. Beyond this there are broader concerns that insurance, with its focus on annual premiums, encourages people to inhabit areas that should be avoided altogether over the long term – areas where flooding is inevitable.   Insurers are crucial to disaster recovery initiatives, promising security in the face of uncertainty and the restoration of business as usual for civil and commercial life. Yet in the face of increasingly severe floods, the promotion of this approach rather than adaptation means that insurance has “maladaptive” tendencies. These are actions (or inaction) that may provide short-term benefits – but ultimately increase the vulnerability to future changes in flood risk prompted by climate change and other land-use factors. Put differently, as insurers promise a rapid return to a pre-shock “normality” this creates the conditions for repeat events and misses opportunities to adapt. Insurance facilitates recovery – but at what cost? We believe it insulates from the costs of living with risk, fosters moral hazard and stops property owners from adapting to risk. Perhaps our misplaced faith in insurance means that we are destined to treat the symptoms but never the actual causes of climatic hazards."
"The one thing never to forget about global warming is that it’s a timed test. It’s ignoble and dangerous to delay progress on any important issue, of course – if, in 2020, America continues to ignore the healthcare needs of many of its citizens, those people will sicken, die, go bankrupt. The damage will be very real. But that damage won’t make it harder, come 2021 or 2025 or 2030, to do the right thing about healthcare. But the climate crisis doesn’t work like that. If we don’t solve it soon, we will never solve it, because we will pass a series of irrevocable tipping points – and we’re clearly now approaching those deadlines. You can tell because there’s half as much ice in the Arctic, and because forests catch fire with heartbreaking regularity and because we see record deluge. But the deadlines are not just impressionistic – they’re rooted in the latest science. In the aftermath of the Paris climate accords in 2015, for instance, many researchers set 2020 as the date by which carbon emissions would need to peak if we were to have any chance of meeting the accord’s goals. Here’s an example of the math, from Stefan Rahmstorf and Anders Levermann. Under the most plausible scenario, they wrote, “even if we peak in 2020 reducing emissions to zero within 20 years will be required,” and that is an ungodly steep slope. But if we wait past 2020 it’s not a slope at all – it’s just a cliff, and we fall off it. As the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres put it when she launched Mission 2020, “Everyone has a right to prosper, and if emissions do not begin their rapid decline by 2020, the world’s most vulnerable people will suffer even more from the devastating impacts of climate change.” Here’s another way of saying it: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported last autumn that if we hadn’t managed a fundamental transformation of the planet’s energy systems by 2030, our chance of meeting the Paris temperature targets is slim to none. And anyone who has ever had anything to do with governments knows: if you want something big done by 2030, you better give yourself a lot of lead time. In fact, it’s possible we’ve waited too long: the world’s greenhouse gas emissions spiked last year, and – given Trump, Bolsonaro and Putin - it’s hard to imagine we won’t see the same depressing thing this year. Which is why, I guess, it’s a good thing that 2020 is an election year in the US, and that the Democratic party finally seems willing to talk seriously about climate change. If it nominates Sanders or Warren, maybe the kind of aggressive approach that shakes things up is possible. But America is just one country; we also need to pressure our real global government, which has its headquarters not in Washington but in Wall Street. Last year banks increased their already staggering lending to the fossil fuel industry; if that continues there’s no chance of turning this round in time. If you’re looking for optimism, at least we come into 2020 on a roll. The great climate strikes of this September were the largest demonstration of climate activism in history, with 7 million people in the street. And April 2020 marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day – it could be a day for an even more massive outpouring. The planet is running a hideous fever, and the antibodies – all those protesters – are finally kicking in. It’s a race, and we’re behind, and we better start catching up right now."
